The simple-stomached animals (pigs, chickens, dogs, human beings, etc.) can utilize only natural protein, whereas ruminant animals can use nonprotein-nitrogen {{as a source of}} ammonia to produce microbial protein in the rumen.

40|$|Protein {{available}} to ruminants is supplied by both microbial and dietary sources. Metabolizable protein (MP) {{is the true}} protein which is absorbed by the intestine and supplied by both microbial protein and protein which escapes degradation in the rumen; the protein which is {{available to}} the animal for maintenance, growth, fetal growth during gestation, and milk production. Thus, the concept of balancing <b>ruminant</b> <b>rations</b> basing on only dietary crude protein (CP) content seems erroneous. In India, <b>ruminant</b> <b>rations</b> are still balanced for digestible CP and total digestible nutrients for protein and energy requirements, respectively. Traditional feed analysis methods such as proximate analysis and detergent analysis consider feed protein as a single unit and do {{not take into account}} of the degradation processes that occur in rumen and passage rates of feed fractions from rumen to intestine. Therefore, the protein requirement of ruminants should include not only the dietary protein source, but also the microbial CP from rumen. The MP systems consider both the factors, thus predict the protein availability more accurately and precisely. This system is aptly designed to represent the extent of protein degradation in the rumen and the synthesis of microbial protein as variable functions. Feed protein fractions, i. e., rumen degradable protein and rumen undegradable protein play vital roles in meeting protein requirements of rumen microbes and host animal, respectively. With the advent of sophisticated nutrition models such as Cornell net carbohydrate and protein system, National Research Council, Agricultural Research Council, Cornell Penn Miner Dairy and Amino Cow; ration formulation has moved from balancing diets from CP to MP, a concept that describes the protein requirements of ruminantsat intestinal level, and which is available to animals for useful purposes...|$|E

40|$|Aims: Information about {{degradability}} of nutrients, effective degradability (ED) {{values and}} digestion kinetics of agricultural wastes {{is important for}} feed manufacturing industry and farmers performing feed mixing practices who currently rely on nutritive values published by research institutions. Almond hull (AH) and cucumber plant (CW) were evaluated for ruminal dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradation kinetics. Methodology: Duplicate bags containing 3 g ground raw material each were incubated in the rumen of two ruminally cannulated Assaf rams for 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h. Rate and extent of ruminal degradation were estimated. Results: Significant effects of byproduct type were observed in rapidly soluble and potentially degradable fractions, and degradation rates of DM, CP, ADF and NDF. The rapidly soluble DM, CP, ADF and NDF fractions were 16. 10, 15. 2, 10. 64 and 14. 06 % for CW, and 7. 21, 6. 64, 6. 00 and 5. 62 % for AH. The potentially degradable DM, CP, ADF and NDF fractions, respectively, were 55. 82, 62. 30, 49. 40 and 55. 09 % for CW, and 47. 61, 44. 26, 46. 34 and 48. 53 % for AH. The DM, CP, ADF and NDF disappearance in CW were higher (P < 0. 05) compared to those in AH. Similarly, the effective degradability (ED) of DM, CP, ADF and NDF in AH were higher compared to AH (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The new data presented in this study could be useful {{for the purposes of}} ration formulation and ruminants’ performance. Considering these findings, one can propose using both byproducts, together or separately as part of <b>ruminant</b> <b>rations.</b> It can be introduced in these rations as part of roughage (wheat and barley straw).

40|$|The {{livestock}} {{sector accounts}} for 30 % of global land area {{and is a}} major driver of land use change. The price reductions generated by crop yield increases should, ceteris paribus, encourage farmers to replace some of the grass in <b>ruminant</b> <b>rations</b> with crops. This would lead to land sparing and related carbon dioxide emission reductions in regions where the feed productivity per unit of area is higher for cropland than for grassland. Six land cover types are distinguished in GLOBIOM: cropland, grassland, short rotation tree plantations, managed forest, unmanaged forest and other natural vegetation.

40|$|Feather meal protein {{contains}} {{high level}} of keratin, which consists of 14 % disulphide cystine, therefore feather meal protein is difficult to be digested by proteolytic enzymes. Feather meal must be processed before {{being used in the}} ration, because the digestibility of unprocessed feather meal is very low (5. 8 %). There are four processing methods of feather meal, i. e. physical, chemical, enzymatic and microbiological. The aim of these processings is to alleviate or break down the bonds in the keratin such as disulphide, ionic, ester and hydrogen bonds. Processed feather meal is known as hydrolyzed feather meal (HFM). Although the processing methods of feather meal produce different quality of HFM, the utilization of HFM in <b>ruminant</b> <b>ration</b> results in a better response than conventional protein resources. HFM has higher level of crude protein content (74 – 92 %), rumen undegradable protein (70 %) and post rumiral digestibility (57 – 78 %) than soybean meal has. The utilization of HFM in ration up to 8 % of dry matter can substitute soybean meal and the use of 2 – 3 % HFM improved milk production in dairy cow and daily gain in sheep and cattle...|$|R
40|$|Glycerol or {{glycerin}} {{is generally}} {{recognized as a}} safe compound {{to be used in}} animal feed, especially for ruminants. A number of in vitro studies related to glycerol supplementation in <b>ruminant</b> <b>ration</b> have been published but to date the results have not been summarized. The objective of this study was, therefore, to evaluate in vitro digestibility, ruminal fermentation characteristics, total gas and methane production through the meta-analysis approach. Meta-analysis was applied to 13 experiments and 42 treatments dealing with glycerol supplementation in ruminants. Data were analyzed by general linear model procedure in which the glycerol levels and the different studies were treated as fixed effects. Results revealed that glycerol supplementation did not affect the in vitro digestibility and total VFA production, but significantly decreased molar proportion of acetate and iso-valerate (P< 0. 05). In contrast, molar proportion of propionate, butyrate, and valerate significantly increased, and thus the ratio of acetate to propionate declined linearly (P< 0. 05). Methane production decreased linearly and accompanied with an increase of total gas production with increasing levels of glycerol supplementation (P< 0. 05). It is concluded that the use of glycerol as an energy substitution in animal feed has no detrimental effects in the rumen and environmentally friendly...|$|R
40|$|Sodium bentonite, an {{expanding}} clay, {{is being used}} {{in many different ways}} in industry today. The livestock and feed industry, for example, use it in many different ways. It is used as a pellet binder to maintain a fat test in dairy animals, as a digestive aid in the poultry industry and as a “buffering agent” in feedlot rations. A two-pronged investigation was undertaken to determine the effect sodium bentonite could have on the ruminant feeding industry. One part of the investigation sought to determine if bentonite could partially or entirely alleviate subclinical lactic acidosis with problem rations. The other part of the investigation involved the effect of bentonite on NPN and natural protein utilization. The literature cited in this piece has shown inconclusive results in several in vitro and in vivo trials which used sodium bentonite in some manner. The role that sodium bentonite will play in the future of the livestock industry is uncertain.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} the digestibility of feedstuffs were studied with {{special attention to}} cell wall components such as crude fibre, lignin, silicic acid, pentosans and tannic acid. Lignin in feeds was estimated by a new method. Lignin in grass increased with age and with higher rates of N. In the second cut lignin was {{higher than in the}} first. Lignin had more effect than crude fibre and silicic acid on digestibility. Chemical and microscopic studies showed that the lower digestibility of protein if fibre content was high was not caused by lower penetration of the cell walls by digestive enzymes. True digestibility for protein hardly depended on protein and crude fibre in the feed. Perhaps higher crude fibre content may increase the number of intestinal bacteria. More of the intestinally secreted protein would then be incorporated in bacteria which would stimulate the protein secretion, and increase the amount of metabolic faecal protein. There might be a limit to the increase in metabolic faecal protein, reached in ruminants and in pigs on rations with crude fibre contents similar to those in <b>ruminant</b> <b>rations.</b> <p/...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{development}} of crop rotations with regard to the current state of fodder crops, when it began to wane sown forage and reduce the number of cattle as well. The thesis also deals with the principle of crop rotation, the appropriateness of including different types of forages and the influence of the inclusion of forage in crop rotation and nutrient parametres of cattle. Properly assembled crop rotation contributes to the smooth growing of plants and enrichment of the soil by a large number of underground and aboveground phytomass. Classification of forages contributes in many cases to increase soil fertility. Very suitable in this context is inclusion legumes, particularly clover plants, but also pea, which leave large quantities of crop residues and also due to symbiotic root with nodule bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen. In <b>ruminant</b> <b>rations</b> represent an important source of protein components. The greatest use of legumes in feed industry is sown alfalfa and clover.

40|$|Fatty acids such as n- 3 and n- 6 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFA) are critical nutrients, {{used to improve}} male reproductive performance through modification of fatty acid profile and maintenance of sperm membrane integrity, especially under cold shock or cryopreservation condition. Also, PUFA provide the precursors for prostaglandin synthesis and can modulate the expression patterns of many key enzymes involved in both prostaglandin and steroid metabolism. Many studies carried out on diets supplemented with PUFA have demonstrated their capability to sustain sperm motility, viability and fertility during chilling and freezing as well as improving testis development and spermatogenesis {{in a variety of}} livestock species. In addition to the type and quantity of dietary fatty acids, ways of addition of PUFA to diet or semen extender is very crucial as it has different effects on semen quality in male ruminants. Limitation of PUFA added to <b>ruminant</b> <b>ration</b> is due to biohydrogenation by rumen microorganisms, which causes conversion of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids, leading to loss of PUFA quantity. Thus, many strategies for protecting PUFA from biohydrogenation in rumen have been developed over the years.

40|$|Effective {{utilization}} of available feed resources {{is the key}} for economical livestock rearing. Complete feed system {{is one of the}} latest developments to exploit the potential of animal feed resources in the best possible way. The complete feed is a quantitative mixture of all dietary ingredients, blended thoroughly to prevent separation and selection, fed as a sole source of nutrients except water and is formulated in a desired proportion to meet the specific nutrient requirements. The concentrate and roughage levels may vary according to the nutrient requirement of ruminants for different production purposes. The complete feed with the use of fibrous crop residue is a noble way to increase the voluntary feed intake and thus animal's production performance. In this system of feeding, the ruminant animals have continuous free choice availability of uniform feed mixture, resulting in more uniform load on the rumen and less fluctuation in release of ammonia which supports more efficient {{utilization of}} ruminal non-protein nitrogen. Feeding complete diet stabilizes ruminal fermentation, thereby improves nutrient utilization. This feeding system allows expanded use of agro-industrial byproducts, crop residues and nonconventional feeds in <b>ruminant</b> <b>ration</b> for maximizing production and minimizing feeding cost, thus being increasingly appreciated. However, to extend the concept extensively to the field and make this technology successful and viable for farmers, more efforts are needed to be taken...|$|R

The three mixtures were wheat with pea and vetch (WPV), bearded triticale with pea and vetch (+TPV) and beardless triticale with pea and vetch (-TPV). The DMI was on average 65. 4 g kg- 1 BW 0. 75 for silages harvested at early stage without significant difference between mixtures; the DMI was lower for silages harvested at late stage (28. 0, 37. 5 and 46. 2 g kg- 1 BW 0. 75 for +TPV, –TPV and WPV respectively). The OMD for WPV and +TPV was higher than for –TPV at both growth stages.

The experiment {{was carried out}} to increase the use of palm oil fronds as a substitute material for napier grass through biodegradation process with P. chysosporium. A completely randomized design with four treatments and four replications was used. The treatments were ration containing 60 % napier grass (R 1), ration containing 40 % napier grass and 20 % fermented palm oil frond (R 2), ration containing 20 % napier grass and 40 % fermented palm oil frond (R 3), ration containing 60 % fermented palm oil frond (R 4). Fourty percent concentrate was included in all treatment rations. Parameters measured were in vitro digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, crude fiber, NDF, ADF, NH 3, TVFA, and ruminal cellulolitic bacteria. Results showed that increasing level of fermented palm oil frond in the ration reduced (P< 0. 05) digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, crude fiber, NDF, ADF, N-NH 3, TVFA concentration and number of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria. It is concluded that fermentation of palm oil frondwith P. chysosporium decrease lignin content by 47. 79 %, but increasing the fermented palm oil frond in the ration reduces nutrient digestibilities, N-NH 3 and TVFA concentrations and rumen cellulolytic bacteria counts.

The use {{of poultry}} waste as a dietary {{supplement}} in <b>ruminant</b> <b>ration</b> {{could have a}} considerable effect on reducing costs, insufficiency of protein in diet, and on solving disposal problems. The chemical composition of poultry waste and its safe use in ruminant nutrition were investigated prior to its use as a dietary supplement. No appreciable differences in chemical composition were noted in poultry wastes between oven and sun dried forms. The high content of protein, energy, and minerals in poultry waste indicated its importance as a partial substitute for concentrates in the diet. The numbers of total bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms such as Salmonella and E. coli detected in poultry waste were within the acceptable limits. Farm testing of rations containing poultry wastes were carried out on sheep (ewes and lambs), Friesian cattle and buffalo heifers. In ewes fed during late pregnancy and lactation, milk yield and performance did not show any significant changes. Lambs suckled from ewes fed on poultry waste did not show any significant difference in weaning weight, average daily weight gain or feed efficiency (kg feed used/kg weaned weight). However, the poultry waste group had shorter age at weaning than the control group. In another feeding trial on growing lambs after weaning, mean daily body weight gain was higher in lambs fed on a ration containing poultry waste than the control ration.

40|$|AbstractImproving {{digestibility}} of forage maize (Zea mays L.) through breeding {{is important}} to optimize the efficiency of <b>ruminant's</b> <b>rations.</b> It can partly be achieved by improving the digestibility of stem tissue, a genetically complex and diverse trait changing drastically {{during the growing season}}. We tried to gain insight into this trait by analysing the changes during the growing season in the anatomy, chemical composition and fermentation characteristics of a lower internode (internode 7) of two forage maize cultivars differing in whole plant digestibility. These two cultivars, known to differ in digestibility, were grown in the Netherlands for two growing seasons. Cell wall thickness of the sclerenchyma tissue in the rind of internode 7 increased linearly with the temperature sum until reaching final cell wall thickness several days before anthesis. Volens, the less digestible cultivar, had a higher final cell wall thickness than Vitaro, the cultivar with a better digestibility. Chemical analyses included determination of NDF, ADF, ADL, crude protein, sugar content, and ash. Lignin content increased until shortly after anthesis in both cultivars, in both years. Lignin content was higher for Volens than for Vitaro and higher in 2000 than in 1999. Crude protein content decreased from 15 – 21 % in early July to 2 – 5 % in late September with no clear differences between cultivars or years. Fermentation characteristics showed that maximum gas production of cell wall components was highest immediately before anthesis and subsequently decreased. At all stages of development, Vitaro had a higher maximum gas production than Volens. The cultivar differences in digestibility could not be confirmed by differences in rate of cell wall disappearance. Seasonal changes showed an increase in fermentable cell wall material until anthesis; thereafter fermentability decreased. Differences in cell wall thickness and in lignin content reflected the changes in digestibility during the growing season best; {{the differences between the two}} contrasting cultivars were best reflected by the differences in cell wall thickness, lignin content and the decline of the potential digestibility in the period before anthesis...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{agricultural}} byproducts {{produced during}} different agricultural practices are nutrients-rich feed ingredients {{with a large}} potential {{to be used for}} ruminants nutrition (Ahmed et al., 2015; Elghandour et al., 2016 a); however, in many developing countries, agriculture byproducts always cause environmental problems resulting from their burning in the field. Such feeds {{can be used as a}} cleaner product of animal feed and environment (Elghandour et al., 2016 b). Moreover, as the global population is increasing, the conventional feed for animal production, such as grains, legumes, etc. is in shortage and highly priced in many parts of the world. Ruminal fermentation is accompanied by production of methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) which are greenhouses making the Earth warmer. Therefore, the sustainable production of CH 4 and CO 2 as well as fermentation kinetics when corn grain (CG) was replaced with prickly pear cactus flour (PC) was investigated. Besides, the effect of different levels of organic acid salts (OAS) was studied. Three total mixed rations used as substrates were prepared where CG was replaced with PC at three levels (/kg) : 0 g (Control), 75 g (PC 75) or 150 g (PC 150). The OAS was used at three levels: 0, 5 and 10 mg/g dry matter (DM) of substrates. Asymptotic gas (GP), CH 4, and CO 2 productions as well as lag time had linear responses (P < 0. 05) as PC level increased in the ration. Fractional rate of GP (P ¼ 0. 007), GP, organic matter degradability, short chain fatty acid, and microbial biomass production (P < 0. 001) were increased with increasing level of PC. Fermentation pH (P < 0. 001), and DM degradability (P ¼ 0. 0448) were linearly decreased as the PC level increased in the rations. Ration OAS interaction did not affect fermentation kinetics, GP, CH 4 production and fermentation parameters.

Acid detergents insoluble nitrogen concentration of both GM and GMhp was significantly lower than that of GM hx (10. 3, 11. 29 and 18. 53 g kg - 1 nitrogen, respectively). In situ fractional degradation rate constant (c) of DM and CP was significantly decreased as a result of heat-xylose processing. Effective crude protein degradability of GM hp and GM hx was higher than that of GM. Post-ruminal disappearance of ruminal-undegradable CP of GM hx (0. 965) was significantly higher compared with GM and GM hp (0. 918 and 0. 906, respectively). Conclusion: Results of the present study demonstrated that heat and heat-xylose processing might effectively protect the DM and CP of guar meal from ruminal degradation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were firstly to determine the nutritive values for beef cattle and sheep of refuse screenings that had undergone various chemical or physical treatments; secondly to quantify the effects of chemical or physical treatments on viability of weed seeds after passage through the digestive tract of the ruminant; and thirdly to assess the potential for use of screenings in a hay based ration. The nutritional value of refuse screenings was determined in feeding trials with ewes and steers, {{as well as by}} analytical laboratory procedures. The grain screenings were either steam pelleted, untreated, or chemically treated with three percent ammonia or one percent urea, both in whole or pelleted form. Eight diets were fed, six containing screenings, and two control diets of pelleted or unpelleted hay. The screenings were fed at 60, 40, or 20 % of the diet in combination with brome-alfalfa hay. Both in vivo and in vitro digestibilities showed pelleting, chemical treatment with ammonia and, to a lesser degree, the addition of urea improved the nutritive value of refuse screenings for the ruminant animal. Ammoniated and pelleted diets showed higher digestibilities of organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), energy, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and cellulose than whole unprocessed screenings. Digestibility increased as the level of screenings in the diet decreased. Ammoniation and pelleting were both effective in reducing weed seed viability, according to germination tests. Unpelleted diets containing urea or nonchemically treated diets contained large numbers of seeds which survived passage through the digestive tract and germinated, representing a potential weed contamination problem in manure from animals fed these diets. This study showed that refuse screenings can be used effectively as a component of the <b>ruminant</b> <b>ration.</b> With growing ewes and steers it appeared that a screenings level of approximatly 40 % of the diet was optimal. This is economically significant as a large amount of relatively inexpensive screenings are available annually. Since ammoniation appeared effective in decreasing weed seed viability, it potentially could replace pelleting of screenings for livestock rations if proven to be more cost effective than the traditionally used steam pelleting...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} was objected {{to study the}} in vitro rumen fermentability on the processed vegetable waste. The study was accomplished by two experiments. The first {{experiment was}} aimed to select the best processing for vegetable waste. The vegetable wastes from a traditional market in Semarang City were fermented using Lactobacillus bulgaricus and rumen bolus with cassava waste, rice bran, and maize grain as additives. In each combined treatment of innoculant and additive was fermented in anaerob conditon for 0, 1, 2, and 3 weeks, respectively. In each combined treatment of innoculant, additive, and fermentation time was analyzed for its moisture, crude protein, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber content. Among the combined treatments were then selected the best processing for vegetable waste ac-cording {{to the use of}} L. bulgaricus and rumen bolus, respectively. The selection was determined {{on the basis of a}} numerical score for each parameter observed. The results showed that the combination of rice bran of additive and one week of fermentation was the best for fermentation using L. bulgaricus (SSLB). Likewise, the the combination of rice bran of additive and two weeks of fermentation was the best for fermentation using rumen bolus (SSBR). In the second experiment, the processed vegetable wastes from the result of first experiment (SSLB and SSBR) were compared to Pennisetum purpureum (RG), unprocessed vegetable waste from the garbage collecting terminal in Semarang City (SSTPA), and unprocessed vegetable waste from traditional market (SSPT) on the basis of their in vitro rumen fermentability. Parameters of the in vitro rumen fermentability were dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility, rumen production of VFA and N-NH 3. The test of in vitro rumen fermentability was conducted using cattle rumen liquid and artificial saliva. The results showed that the DM and OM digestibility of RG was lower (P< 0, 05) than that of SSPT, but there was no siginificant different among SSTPA, SSLB, and RG in their DM and OM digestibility. The in vitro rumen VFA production among RG, SSTPA, SSLB, and SSBR were not different significantly. The in vitro rumen VFA production of SSPT was higher (P< 0, 05) than that of RG, SSTPA, SSLB, and SSBR. The in vitro rumen NH 3 production among SSPT, SSLB, and SSBR were not different significantly. The in vitro rumen NH 3 production of RG and SSTPA were lower (P< 0, 05) than that of SSPT, SSLB, and SSBR. The fermen-tation using L. bulgaricus with rice bran for one week was appropriate in processing the vegetable waste. The results could be utilized for further study focusing on the substitution of Pennisetum purpureum with the processed vegetable waste in a <b>ruminant</b> <b>ration.</b> Keywords : processing, vegetable waste, rumen, in vitr...|$|R
40|$|Canola fibre-protein and can-sugar {{are the two}} {{by-products}} {{arising from}} a process for separating high quality protein fractions from canola meal. In the first trial chemical characteristics of fibre-protein and can-sugar were examined in comparison with commercial canola and soy meal. In the second trial in situ rumen degradability and kinetics of test feed was studied. Based {{on the findings of}} those two trials, available energy values were estimated based on NRC (2001) while protein contents potentially absorbable at small intestine were predicted using both NRC (2001) and DVE/OEB models. Subsequently a mixture of fibre-protein and can-sugar was used as an additive to dehydrated alfalfa pellet and two dairy cow trials were conducted to determine the palatability and examine effect on lactation performances of blended alfalfa pellet feeding in comparison with standard alfalfa pellet. Palatability difference was evaluated by “Paterson -two choice alternating access method” through a 7 day experimental period using 6 lactating Holstein cows. In the lactating performance trial, 6 cows were randomly assigned into two groups and two treatments were allocated over three experimental periods in a switchback design. Can-sugar consisted of water soluble components (CP 15. 6 %DM; SCP 96. 2 %CP; NFC 99. 9 %CHO) with non-protein nitrogen as the main CP fraction (NPN 96. 2 %CP). Fibre-protein was a highly fibrous material (NDF: 55. 6 %; ADF: 46. 3 %; ADL: 24. 1 %) comparing to canola meal (NDF: 25. 4 %, ADF: 21. 2 %, ADL: 9. 0 %) due to presence of higher level of seed hulls in fibre-protein. Comparing to canola meal, fibre-protein contained 9 % less CP and 1 / 4 of that consisted of undegradable ADIP. Rumen degradability of can-sugar was assumed as immediate and total as it was water soluble. Most of the ruminally undegradable nutrient components present in canola meal appeared to be concentrated into fibre protein during the manufacturing process and as a result fibre-protein has shown a consistently lower effective degradability of DM, OM, CP NDF and ADF comparing to both canola and soy meal. Available energy content in can-sugar was marginally higher than that of canola meal while fibre-protein contained only 2 / 3 that of canola meal. The predicted absorbable protein content at small intestine was about 1 / 2 that of canola meal. These results indicate that fibre-protein can be considered as a secondary source of protein in ruminant feed and a mixture of fibre-protein and can-sugar would nutritionally complement each other to formulate into a cheaper ingredient in <b>ruminant</b> <b>ration.</b> In the palatability study, {{there was no significant difference}} (P> 0. 05) in intake preference or finish time between the blended and standard alfalfa pellets. The results from the lactation study showed that there was no significant difference (P> 0. 05) in milk yield, dairy efficiency or milk composition between the blended and standard alfalfa pellets. The results from the two studies indicated that fibre-protein and can-sugar fractions could be used as an additive to alfalfa dehydrated pellet at 15 % inclusion rate without compromising its palatability or the performance of dairy cows. For future studies it is proposed to conduct feeding trials with varying levels of inclusions to alfalfa pellet to know the nutritional effect of fibre-protein and can-sugar while ascertain optimum inclusion rate...|$|R

It {{is important to}} ensure the consistent quality of these DDGS. Traditional chemical methods do not consider the inherent structural changes of feed ingredients. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the nutritional value of triticale and triticale DDGS in terms of chemical profile, protein and carbohydrate subfractions partitioned using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System and energy values calculated according to NRC (2001), to evaluate the digestive characteristics of the proteins in triticale and triticale DDGS using the in situ and in vitro methods and the DVE/OEB and NRC- 2001 models, to identify differences in protein molecular structures between grains (wheat, triticale and corn) and DDGS (wheat DDGS, triticale DDGS, corn DDGS and wheat and corn blend DDGS) using Synchrotron Based Fourier Transform Infrared Microspectroscopy and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy and to reveal the relationship between protein molecular structure and protein digestive characteristics in DDGS in dairy cattle. Triticale DDGS was significantly higher (P 0. 05). However, triticale DDGS had higher predicted total metabolizable protein (P< 0. 01) and protein degraded balance (P< 0. 01) than triticale. The protein molecular structure study showed significant decreases (P< 0. 01) in the amide I to amide II ratio and the α helix to β sheet ratio from grains to DDGS. Protein digestive characteristics were correlated with protein molecular structures in grains and DDGS and prediction equations were established to estimate protein digestive characteristics of DDGS using protein molecular structure parameters. In conclusion, protein molecular structure varies among different DDGS and their original grains, and this variation is associated with the digestive characteristics of the proteins in the DDGS and their original grains...|$|E
40|$|Lupin seed has the {{potential}} to be used as a protein supplement in <b>ruminant</b> <b>rations,</b> but its usage is restricted by the presence of alkaloids. Experiments were conducted with the aim of determining whether the removal of specific toxic alkaloids, lupanine and 13 -hydroxylupanine, from crushed lupin seed (CLS) would improve the organic matter intake (OMI) and average daily gains (ADG) in lambs, and also improve the lactation performance in dairy cows. Effects on liver function in lambs were also investigated. An additional study on the effects of the detoxification of CLS on the degradation of protein was conducted. In Experiment 1, 30 growing Corriedale lambs were fed five diets for 105 d according to a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with six blocks. Two diets contained intact CLS at 15 % (LUI- 15) or 30 % (LUI- 30) of DM; two other diets contained detoxified CLS at 15 % (LUD- 15) or 30 % (LUD- 30) and the control (CON) diet was supplemented with crushed sunflower seed, which was locally prepared, on-farm. All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous (16 % CP). The alkaloid content (lupanine and 13 -OH lupanine) of the diets was. 31,. 70,. 21 and. 52 % for LUI- 15, LUI- 30, LUD- 15 and LUD- 30, respectively. Thus, diets containing detoxified CLS contained approximately 30 % less alkaloids than those with intact CLS. Estimates of ADG of lambs fed diets containing detoxified CLS was higher (P $<$. 01) (120 g. d$ sp{- 1 }$) than that of lambs fed intact CLS (76 g. d$ sp{- 1 }$). The OMI (73 g/Wkg$ sp{ 0. 75 }$) was also higher, although not significantly, for lambs fed diets containing detoxified CLS. Feed conversion efficiency was increased (P $<$. 05) by the detoxification of CLS. Lambs fed diets containing intact CLS consumed more OMI as time progressed, suggesting that adaptation to CLS might have occurred. Lambs fed diets containing intact CLS demonstrated increased trends in the activity in plasma of the enzymes glutamic oxaloacetic transferase (GOT) and $ gamma$-glutamyl transfe...|$|E
40|$|Determining the urea {{concentration}} in milk {{is a useful}} indicator of the nutritional protein status of the organism {{as well as of}} the ratio between the energy and the protein in <b>ruminant</b> <b>rations,</b> with increasing practical usage. In addition to nutrition, milk urea concentration is influenced by a whole range of factors, for example: breed, stage and number of lactations, body weight, daily production and chemical composition of milk, somatic cell count, season and milking. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of the cow breed (Holstein and Simmental), the number of lactation (1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th), milking time (morning-evening) and season (spring-summer and autumn-winter) on milk urea concentration. The following was determined for each breed: daily milk yield, milk fat, protein and lactose content, urea concentration and somatic cell count in milk. Statistical data processing was carried out by applying General Linear Model procedure, SAS system (1999). The cow breed had a significant influence on daily milk yield and log somatic cell count (P< 0. 001), lactose content in milk (P< 0. 01), milk fat content and milk urea concentration (P< 0. 05). The number of lactations significantly influenced daily milk yield (P< 0. 001), protein content (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 01) and milk urea concentration, but only for Holstein breed (P< 0. 05). Milking time significantly influenced the fat and protein content (P< 0. 001) in the milk of Holstein cows, that is, lactose content (P< 0. 05) and urea concentration (P< 0. 05) in the milk of Simmental cows. The season significantly influenced the fat and protein content of milk (P< 0. 001), that is, urea concentration and log somatic cell count (P< 0. 01). Determining of urea {{concentration in}} cow milk should also be systematically conducted in the Republic of Croatia, in order to determine standard physiological values characteristical for a particular cow breed, aiming to determine the balance of energy and protein in rations...|$|E
40|$|This {{study using}} the rumen {{simulation}} technique (RUSITEC) investigated {{the changes in}} the ruminal microbiota and anaerobic fermentation in response to the addition of different lipid supplements to a ruminant diet. A basal diet with no oil added was the control, and the treatment diets were supplemented with sunflower oil (2 %) only, or sunflower oil (2 %) in combination with fish oil (1 %) or algae oil (1 %). Four fermentation units were used per treatment. RUSITEC fermenters were inoculated with rumen digesta. Substrate degradation, fermentation end-products (volatile fatty acids, lactate, gas, methane, and ammonia), and microbial protein synthesis were determined. Fatty acid profiles and microbial community composition were evaluated in digesta samples. Numbers of representative bacterial species and microbial groups were determined using qPCR. Microbial composition and diversity were based on T-RFLP spectra. The addition of oils had no effect on substrate degradation or microbial protein synthesis. Differences among diets in neutral detergent fiber degradation were not significant (P = 0. 132), but the contrast comparing oil–supplemented diets with the control was significant (P = 0. 039). Methane production was reduced (P < 0. 05) with all oil supplements. Propionate production was increased when diets containing oil were fermented. Compared with the control, the addition of algae oil decreased the percentage C 18 : 3 c 9 c 12 c 15 in rumen digesta, and that of C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11 was increased when the control diet was supplemented with any oil. Marine oils decreased the hydrogenation of C 18 unsaturated fatty acids. Microbial diversity was not affected by oil supplementation. Cluster analysis showed that diets with additional fish or algae oils formed a group separated from the sunflower oil diet. Supplementation with marine oils decreased the numbers of Butyrivibrio producers of stearic acid, and affected the numbers of protozoa, methanogens, Selenomonas ruminantium and Streptococcus bovis, but not total bacteria. In conclusion, there is a potential to manipulate the rumen fermentation and microbiota with the addition of sunflower, fish or algae oils to ruminant diets at appropriate concentrations. Specifically, supplementation of <b>ruminant</b> mixed <b>rations</b> with marine oils will reduce methane production, the acetate to propionate ratio and the fatty acid hydrogenation in the rumen...|$|R

40|$|This study {{comprised}} of field survey, agronomic trial, laboratory and animal evaluation of desho grass. A total of 240 households (hh) {{were involved in}} the field survey conducted to assess the status of desho grass production and utilization in Burie Zuria and Doyogena districts, with the use of pre-tested and semi- structured questionnaire. The grass was planted at mid and highland altitudes using vegetative root splits in randomized complete block design {{to determine the effects of}} altitude and harvesting dates (90, 120 and 150 days after planting) on morphology, dry matter (DM) yield and chemical composition of desho grass. Feeding & digestibility trials were conducted using 25 Washera yearling rams with mean body weight of 19. 4 + 1. 89 kg in randomized complete block design to evaluate the feed potential of desho grass as a basal diet. The dietary treatments studied were; 100 % Natural Pasture Hay (NPH) (T 1), 75 % NPH+ 25 % Desho Grass Hay (DGH) (T 2), 50 % NPH + 50 % DGH (T 3), 25 % NPH+ 75 % DGH (T 4), and 100 % DGH (T 5). All the treatment groups were supplemented with 300 g/h DM of concentrate & data on feed intake, daily body weight gain, feed conversion efficiency & fecal samples were collected during the 90 and 7 days of feeding and digestibility trial respectively. The field survey data were analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics and probit model using SAS 9. 2. The agronomic characteristics and laboratory analytical data were subjected to two-way ANOVA and correlation analysis of SAS 9. 2. Animal evaluation data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA of SAS. Tukey’s Honest Significant Test was used to separate means that showed significant difference. The results of the field survey revealed that the mean landholding, livestock holding and family size of the respondents was 0. 95 hectare, 3. 56 tropical livestock units and 6. 5 persons/hh, respectively. The proportion of farmers who use desho grass as a feed were 60 % and 35 % use it for more than one purpose including feed. About 42, 3 and 53 % of the respondents reported that they feed desho grass to lactating cattle, small ruminants and to all livestock species respectively. There was significant positive correlation (P< 0. 01) between experience of desho grass production practice and utilization for different purposes in the study areas. About 43 % of desho grass producers have received training on desho grass production and utilization. The utilization of the grass for many purposes is not well practiced by many farmers, due to in adequate extension services and lack of training. The results of the agronomic trials indicated that leaf length per plant (LLPP) of the grass planted in mid altitude (28. 98 cm) was greater than that (21. 81 cm) planted in the high altitude. Highest harvesting date significantly increased (P< 0. 05) plant height (PH), number of tillers per plant (NTPP), number of leaves per plant (NLPP), leaf length per plant (LLPP) and re-growth dates (RGD). The DM yield of desho grass significantly increased, while crude protein (CP) content significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) as the harvesting date increased from 90 to 150 days. Agronomic results xviii revealed that desho grass performs well both in mid and high altitude areas and represent potential livestock feed resource at early stage (90 to 120 days after planting) of feeding. The daily DM intake and mean daily body gain of the experimental sheep showed significant improvement (P< 0. 05) with increased level of inclusion of desho grass into the basal ration. The digestibility coefficient of DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF were significantly different (P< 0. 05) among the treatments (in the order of T 1 <T 2 <T 3 <T 4 <T 5).
