50|$|ISO 2014 is an {{international}} standard that was issued in April 1976, and superseded by ISO 8601 in June 1988. ISO 2014 was the standard that originally introduced the all-numeric <b>date</b> notation <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b> with the digits in order starting with the most significant digit first (similar to big-endian). It was technically identical to ISO Recommendation R 2014 from 1971.|$|R

50|$|Another {{example of}} a non-dictionary use of {{lexicographical}} ordering appears in the ISO 8601 standard for dates, which expresses a <b>date</b> as <b>YYYY-MM-DD.</b> This formatting scheme has the advantage that the lexicographical order on sequences of characters that represent dates coincides with the chronological order: an earlier date is smaller in the lexicographical order than a later date. This date ordering makes computerized sorting of dates easier by avoiding {{the need for a}} separate sorting algorithm.|$|R
