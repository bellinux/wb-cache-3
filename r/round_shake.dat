6000|$|Having drunk a {{glass of}} wine, Nat went out with the admiral on to the quarter-deck. The {{officers}} pressed <b>round,</b> <b>shook</b> hands, and congratulated him. It did not last long, for the admiral said kindly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By gum, Jack! but you're a good un!" [...] Bill Haden said, {{bringing}} down his hand upon Jack's shoulder {{with a force}} that almost knocked him down; while the men, with revived hope, leaped to their feet, and crowding <b>round,</b> <b>shook</b> Jack's hands with exclamations of approval and delight.|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of an awed silence he went <b>round</b> and <b>shook</b> hands.|$|R

60|$|The other {{officers}} then crowded <b>round</b> him, <b>shaking</b> {{his hand and}} congratulating him on his escape.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho, ho!" [...] said Larry {{to himself}} that night, as he smoked his pipe after {{retiring}} to rest; [...] "it's neck or nothin' is it--never ventur' never win, is the word? Well, well, 'tis the way o' the world. My blessin' go wid ye, doctor." [...] With this benediction on his lips he turned <b>round,</b> <b>shook</b> the ashes out of his pipe and went to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Bounce {{watched his}} opportunity. As he swept near to a rocky point, he sprang towards {{it with all}} his might. He fell short, but happily the water did not reach above his knees.

60|$|Very unwillingly they went, and if Lady Archfield had {{not kept}} a strict watch from her coach window, they would {{certainly}} have turned back to revenge the pranks played on them. The last view of them showed Sedley turning <b>round</b> <b>shaking</b> his whip and clenching his teeth in defiance. Mrs. Woodford was greatly concerned, especially as Peregrine {{could not be found}} and did not appear at supper.|$|R
60|$|Six ladies were {{gathered}} at the bungalow, as Lisle entered with the colonel. All rose as they entered, and pressed <b>round</b> him, <b>shaking</b> his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know, after all," [...] Strether mused. [...] "I've {{had to come}} as far <b>round.</b> However"--he <b>shook</b> it off--"it's doubtless MY {{performance}} that's absurd." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] was {{the general}} reply; and the {{officers}} all pressed <b>round,</b> to <b>shake</b> hands with the boys, as they accompanied the governor back into the house.|$|R
60|$|This {{time there}} was no {{laughter}} mixed with the cheers. Many of the officers left their seats and came <b>round</b> to <b>shake</b> his hand warmly, O'Grady foremost among them.|$|R
60|$|He glanced <b>round</b> and <b>shook</b> his head, {{for he was}} {{wondering}} whether {{he would be able}} to lift the buck on to the horse without asking Suzanne to help him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ugh!' said Ralph, scowling <b>round,</b> and <b>shaking</b> his clenched hand as {{the faces}} of the two profligates rose up before his mind; 'you shall pay for this. Oh! you shall pay for this!' ...|$|R
60|$|He kissed 'is dirty paw--which is {{more than}} I should 'ave liked to 'ave done it if it 'ad been mine--and waved it, and the gal turned <b>round</b> and <b>shook</b> her 'ead at 'im.|$|R

60|$|To Nat's delight he saw, as {{he entered}} Port Royal, the Orpheus lying there, and without landing he hailed a boat and went on board. As {{soon as he was}} made out there was quite a commotion on board the frigate among the sailors on deck and at the side, while those below looked out of the port-holes, and a burst of cheering rose from all as the boat came alongside. As he came up on to the deck the midshipmen crowded <b>round,</b> <b>shaking</b> him by the hand; and {{when he went to the}} quarter-deck to report his return, the lieutenants greeted him as heartily. The captain was on shore. Nat was {{confused}} and abashed at the warmth of their greeting.|$|R
60|$|Felix nodded. And with 'Good night, old man' all <b>round,</b> and no <b>shaking</b> of the hands, {{the three}} {{brothers}} dispersed.|$|R

6000|$|... 'E-eh? Of all mortal impudence!'said Puck, as Dan, also in one boot, {{grabbed his}} sister's hand to steady himself. He walked <b>round</b> them, <b>shaking</b> with delight. 'You think I can only {{work with a}} handful of dead leaves? This comes of taking away your Doubt and Fear! I'll show you!' ...|$|R
60|$|Until now {{none of the}} {{defenders}} of the breach had known how what seemed to them an almost miraculous change in the fortune of the fight had come about, and they thronged <b>round</b> Gervaise, <b>shaking</b> his hand, {{and many of them}} warmly embracing him, according to the custom of the time.|$|R
60|$|At Euston Square {{the porter}} called {{him several times}} ere he could rouse him. He could hear nothing for awhile but that same imps' melody, {{even though it had}} stopped. At last he got out, staring <b>round</b> him, <b>shook</b> himself awake by one strong effort, and hurried away, not knowing whither he went.|$|R
60|$|Gala doings, to {{a certain}} extent, there were there. It was in July, and tables were spread under the oaks for the tenants. Tables were spread, and meat, and beer, and wine were there, and Frank, as he walked <b>round</b> and <b>shook</b> his guests by the hand, {{expressed}} a hope that their relations with each other might be long, close, and mutually advantageous.|$|R
6000|$|Du Lhut glanced <b>round</b> him and <b>shook</b> his head. [...] "We {{are only}} six now," [...] said he. [...] "I fear they {{are up to}} some devilry {{because they are so}} very still." ...|$|R
5000|$|There are 280 plane {{trees with}} ten nodes.As a {{consequence}} of this, 18 people around a <b>round</b> table can <b>shake</b> hands {{with each other in}} non-crossing ways, in 280 different ways (this includes rotations).|$|R
6000|$|Harcourt turned <b>round</b> and <b>shook</b> hands warmly {{with his}} other friend. [...] "Upon my word, I did not see you, Master Wilkinson. You have such a habit of hiding {{yourself}} under a bushel that one always misses you. Well; so the great day is over, and the great deed done. It's a bore out of the way, trampled under foot and got rid of; that's my idea of a degree." ...|$|R
60|$|Fiorsen spun <b>round,</b> <b>shook</b> his fist, {{and went}} out muttering. They heard the front door slam. Gyp turned {{abruptly}} to the window, and there, in her agitation, she noticed little outside things as one does in moments of bewildered anger. Even into that back yard, summer had crept. The leaves of the sumach-tree were glistening; in a three-cornered little patch of sunlight, a black cat with a blue ribbon round its neck was basking. The voice of one hawking strawberries drifted melancholy from a side street. She was conscious that Monsieur Harmost was standing very still, with a hand pressed to his mouth, and she felt a perfect passion of compunction and anger. That kind and harmless old man--to be so insulted! This was indeed the culmination of all Gustav's outrages! She would never forgive him this! For he had insulted her as well, beyond what pride or meekness could put up with. She turned, and, running up to the old man, put both her hands into his.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here you all are, eh?" [...] said Mr. Brooke, {{shuffling}} <b>round</b> and <b>shaking</b> hands. [...] "I {{was going}} up to the Hall by-and-by, Chettam. But it's pleasant to find everybody, you know. Well, {{what do you think of}} things?--going on a little fast! It was true enough, what Lafitte said--'Since yesterday, a century has passed away:'--they're in the next century, you know, on the other side of the water. Going on faster than we are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll get shelter behind it, Ben, my boy," [...] {{said the}} Captain, [...] "hold the oar well up, and don't let the rag clap <b>round</b> the blade. <b>Shake</b> it out so. God grant {{that they may}} see it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1. The fiery {{mountains}} answer each other; Their thunderings are echoed from zone to zone; The tempestuous oceans awake one another, And the ice-rocks are <b>shaken</b> <b>round</b> Winter's throne, When the clarion of the Typhoon is blown. [...] 5 ...|$|R
60|$|The captainâ€™s {{reply was}} inaudible {{as he turned}} and bore off Miss Hartley. The young man stood for some time {{watching}} them, and, as Joan and her burly companion disappeared <b>round</b> the corner, <b>shook</b> his head and set off home.|$|R
6000|$|Beaumanoir ran his eye <b>round</b> and <b>shook</b> his head. [...] "Alas!" [...] said he, [...] "there are but {{twenty of}} you here, and I have thirty at Josselin {{who are so}} eager to advance {{themselves}} that if I return without hope {{for all of them}} there will be sore hearts amongst them.

60|$|It was {{at eleven}} o'clock {{the next morning}} that the aunts and uncles came to hold their consultation. The fire was lighted in the large parlor, and poor Mrs. Tulliver, with a {{confused}} impression {{that it was a}} great occasion, like a funeral, unbagged the bell-rope tassels, and unpinned the curtains, adjusting them in proper folds, looking <b>round</b> and <b>shaking</b> her head sadly at the polished tops and legs of the tables, which sister Pullet herself could not accuse of insufficient brightness.|$|R
