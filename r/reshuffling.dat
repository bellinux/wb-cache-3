5|$|On September 28, 2013, the Heat {{announced}} a <b>reshuffling</b> of their organization. The <b>reshuffling</b> included {{the announcement that}} Howard would remain with the Heat, moving officially into an assistant coaching role. The assistant coaching position was available after both Chad Kammerer and Keith Askins were moved from coaching to scouting positions. This effectively indicated Howard's retirement as a basketball player, as league regulations prohibit one from holding a coaching position while being an active player.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>reshuffling</b> {{process of}} the Politburo ended in the mid-to-late 1970, the Soviet {{leadership}} evolved into a gerontocracy, a form of rule in which the rulers are significantly older {{than most of the}} adult population.|$|E
5|$|Research in {{the early}} 2000s {{combining}} the use of phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences and more traditional morphology-based characters {{has resulted in a}} <b>reshuffling</b> of the species concept in Gomphus; as a result, G.clavatus is considered the only Gomphus species in North America. Comparison of the DNA sequences of species Gomphus brevipes and Gomphus truncatus has shown them to be genetically identical to G.clavatus, and they may be treated as synonyms.|$|E

5|$|Variation {{comes from}} {{mutations}} in the genome, <b>reshuffling</b> of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations (gene flow). Despite the constant {{introduction of new}} variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species. However, even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differ in only about 5% of their genomes.|$|E
5|$|In 1709, George {{resigned}} as field marshal, never {{to go on}} active service again. In 1710, he was granted the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Empire, an office formerly held by the Elector Palatine—the absence of the Elector of Bavaria allowed a <b>reshuffling</b> of offices. The death of the Emperor in 1711 threatened to destroy {{the balance of power}} in the opposite direction, so the war ended in 1713 with the ratification of the Treaty of Utrecht. Philip was allowed to succeed to the Spanish throne but was removed from the French line of succession, and the Elector of Bavaria was restored.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius torminosus, {{commonly}} known as the woolly milkcap or the bearded milkcap, is a large agaric fungus. A common and widely distributed species, it is found in North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and North America. It was first described scientifically by Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774 as an Agaricus, and later transferred to the genus Lactarius in 1821 by Samuel Frederick Gray. A variety, L.torminosus var. nordmanensis, is known from the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. L.torminosus officially became the type species of Lactarius in 2011 after molecular studies prompted the taxonomic <b>reshuffling</b> of species between several Russulaceae genera.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{approved}} the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (see also Soviet–Afghan relations) {{just as he}} had previously {{approved the}} Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In both cases, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest for a possible armed intervention. Several leading members of the Soviet leadership decided to retain Brezhnev as General Secretary so that their careers would not suffer by a possible leadership <b>reshuffling</b> by his successor. Other members, who disliked Brezhnev, among them Dmitriy Ustinov (Minister of Defence), Andrei Gromyko (Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Mikhail Suslov (Central Committee Secretary), feared that Brezhnev's removal would spark a succession crisis, and so they helped to maintain the status quo.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. This plant extinction caused a major <b>reshuffling</b> of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for these new requirements, Fort Lewis began to receive new corps support units which {{were coming out}} of Europe. One of these was the 7th Engineer Brigade which was inactivated on 16 January 1992 and immediately reactivated as the 555th Engineer Group. On 16 February 1992 the 210th Field Artillery Brigade, also from Europe, was activated. In 1997, the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade moved to Fort Bliss, Texas, to join other air defense brigades. The corps and Fort Lewis would see a <b>reshuffling</b> of units {{in and out of the}} area through 2000. Plans were drawn up for emergency operations for I Corps should a major conflict emerge in the Pacific region. Plans exist for I Corps to rapidly deploy in defense of Japan or South Korea.|$|E

5|$|The Centre Party {{has been}} the {{traditional}} party of rural voters, but according to polls, it had been losing support to the True Finns in its traditional stronghold regions. The party has traditionally had both a liberal and a conservative wing, however, with the leadership <b>reshuffling</b> in 2010, the central posts are now held by the liberal wing. The Centre Party has held the portfolio {{of the prime minister}} since 2003. According to opinion polls, Kiviniemi's personal support was higher than that of the party. She had also been campaigning as a staunch defender of Finland's participation in guarantees to the crisis-ridden EU countries.|$|E

50|$|On 3 September 2010, Emil Boc {{announced}} a Cabinet <b>reshuffle,</b> replacing six Ministers.

25|$|Many issues {{plagued the}} {{government}} {{in the beginning of the}} administration: controversies regarding the appointment of high-ranking government officials, rampant political conflicts, accusations of oppression of media and strained diplomatic relationships with North Korea and Japan. The economy was affected by the global recession as the worst economic crisis since 1997 hit the country. The Lee administration tackled these issues by actively issuing statements, <b>reshuffling</b> the cabinet, and implementing administrative and industrial reforms.|$|E
25|$|Card {{counting}} is {{most rewarding}} {{near the end}} of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly susceptible to card counting. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and <b>reshuffling</b> when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.|$|E
25|$|All parties {{within the}} Swedish {{opposition}} {{have opened up}} for a vote of confidence against cabinet ministers Anna Johansson, Anders Ygeman and Peter Hultqvist in order to remove them from office, with some parties calling for vote of confidence against Löfven as Prime Minister. Such a vote would, if supported by several parties, result in a removal of the Löfven cabinet. In a press conference on 27 July Löfven announced a government <b>reshuffling</b> with Ygeman and Johansson resigning. He also stated that he would not resign himself over the incident.|$|E

50|$|British prime {{minister}} David Cameron <b>reshuffled</b> the Conservative {{members of his}} coalition government on 15 July 2014. The <b>reshuffle,</b> intended to strengthen his party's position {{in advance of the}} 2015 general election, had been long anticipated, as Cameron had maintained an unusually high level of stability amongst the senior ranks of his government, with only one prior <b>reshuffle</b> of significance, and many ministers having remained in place since their election in 2010. The <b>reshuffle</b> also featured the appointment of a new European Commissioner representing the United Kingdom, as the term of Lady Ashton was set to expire later in 2014.|$|R

As Rakim continued to struggle with legal problems, he secured a deal with Universal Records and began recording his solo debut album The 18th Letter in 1996. In November 1997, the album The 18th Letter was released. Expectations were high for Rakim, as the album debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200 and went certified Gold by the RIAA.|$|E

25|$|According to some, Fleva's {{fight against}} {{government}} abuse was what caused his fall during a cabinet <b>reshuffling,</b> {{only three months}} after electoral victory. C. Bacalbașa notes that Fleva first attracted his colleagues' hostility when he inspected first-hand, and punished, {{the damage done by}} government representatives in the village of Spineni. Sturdza interpreted this work as a sign of disloyalty, and the National Liberal paper Voința Națională made a show of Fleva, publishing allegations about his conduct in both public and private. In what was virtually an unprecedented gesture, Titu Maiorescu, who had become leader of the opposition, denounced such mudslinging from the Assembly's rostrum.|$|E
