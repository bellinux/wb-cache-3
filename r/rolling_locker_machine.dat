These three wings are linked by a large, roughly {{rectangular}} social area, known as The Street, which houses the cafeteria, stage and main meeting area for pupils during breaks (Interval & Lunchtime).

50|$|In 2007, {{the school}} removed the popular common area {{from inside the}} school. The common area was located {{on the first floor}} {{directly}} {{in the middle of the}} school surrounded by <b>lockers,</b> vending <b>machines,</b> one ladies room, one mens room, four stairwells and classrooms. The popular space drew big crowds of students before, after and in between the switching of periods-often causing students to be late to their next class. The massive amounts of students in one space easliy caused fights to start, insubordiataion and a disturbance of peace. The choice to remove the schools common area was brought into play after the uniform policy did not seem to change the behavior and structure of students. The common area has been replaced by four additional classrooms.|$|R
5000|$|Euskirchen {{station is}} a major railway junction, and its lines have {{had to cope with}} a high volume of {{commuter}} traffic with heavy overcrowding of trains. In order to handle traffic a new central railway station signal box was built for the equivalent of about € 2.9 million. This was put into operation on 12 December 1973, after three years of planning and construction. Since the 90s, large central bus station, which was built by the city, has been located directly on the station forecourt. This has two fully covered walkways, which are served on both sides and a less protected platform for school buses. There is also an information point for travellers, electronic information displays, and an integrated taxi parking area. The station building houses <b>lockers,</b> vending <b>machines,</b> a ticket office, a bookstore, a bakery and a McDonald's restaurant.|$|R

There are two exits from the station; the east exit is the busier of the two and features a staffed [...] "Midori no Madoguchi" [...] ticket office, ticket vending <b>machines,</b> <b>lockers,</b> and toilets. The west exit also has these amenities except for the ticket office.|$|R

Many employees have access to the corporate recreation center. Recreational amenities are scattered throughout the campus and include a workout room with weights and rowing <b>machines,</b> <b>locker</b> rooms, washers and dryers, a massage room, assorted video games, table football, a baby grand piano, a billiard table, and ping pong.

50|$|Caistor Sports Hall was {{purpose built}} for the school in the 1990s. The {{building}} houses a fully equipped, multi-purpose sports hall, a weights room, changing rooms, showers, offices, <b>lockers</b> and vending <b>machines.</b> When it was built, it was intended that the sports hall would double as a community sports venue, to ensure financial sustainability for the school. A Sports Development Officer was appointed to schedule an ongoing programme of out of hours community events and bookings, however financial losses estimated at £10,000 per year forced the school to consider closing the facility to the public, {{as it would have}} been illegal for the school to subsidise these losses using its own funds. Following a campaign to retain community use of the facility, West Lindsey District Council agreed to manage the building on the school's behalf, commencing 1 April 2006. The council now work in partnership with the school to ensure that the building operates profitable outside of school hours and it is run as a satellite from the De Aston Sports Hall, which is also a shared school/community facility based at the De Aston School in Market Rasen.|$|R
60|$|There the encampment lay; from a {{distance}} the cabins, covered over with the silk of the balloon part, looked like a gipsy's tent on a rather exceptional scale, and all the available hands were busy in building out of the steel of the framework a mast from which the Vaterland's electricians might hang the long conductors of the apparatus for wireless telegraphy that was to link the Prince to the world again. There were times when it seemed they would never rig that mast. From the outset the party suffered hardship. They were not too abundantly provisioned, and they were put on short rations, {{and for all the}} thick garments they had, they were but ill-equipped against the piercing wind and inhospitable violence of this wilderness. The first night was spent in darkness and without fires. The engines that had supplied power were smashed and dropped far away to the south, and there was never a match among the company. It had been death to carry matches. All the explosives had been thrown out of the magazine, and it was only towards morning that the bird-faced man whose cabin Bert had taken in the beginning confessed to a brace of duelling pistols and cartridges, with which a fire could be started. Afterwards the <b>lockers</b> of the <b>machine</b> gun were found to contain a supply of unused ammunition.|$|R
