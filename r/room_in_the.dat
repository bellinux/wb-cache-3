5|$|The Northern Quarter of Delos {{contains}} the Jewelry Quarter, where older {{structures such as}} workshops and other archaeological remains dating to the 3rd century BC and early 2nd century BC have been discovered. By {{the second half of}} the 2nd century BC these were replaced by private homes built in the most characteristic fashion for Delos: a narrow, rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard, a vestibule service <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front, and a larger, main <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear. The quarter of the House of the Masks is the only area of Delos without this archetypal house plan. Some houses of the Northern Quarter feature mosaic decorations with mythological scenes, including Lycurgus of Thrace and Ambrosia in an upper-story mosaic, as well as Athena and Hermes together with a seated woman in a main-room mosaic.|$|E

5|$|The {{floors of}} the rooms on this level are made from lime-ash plaster pressed into a bedding of straw and oak laths, which would have offered some {{protection}} against the ever-present risk of fire. All the first-floor rooms in the east range and all except the Prayer <b>Room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west range are closed to the public, some having been converted into accommodation for the National Trust staff who live on site.

5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E

Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return. He observed Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.|$|E

5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, there was <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market for another edition in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur was {{considered}} {{as the source}} of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 King Chulalongkorn of Siam visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from the stairs and gateways, and a guardian statue (dvarapala). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> National Museum in Bangkok.|$|E
5|$|Bounty {{had left}} England in 1787 {{on a mission}} to collect and {{transport}} breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. A five-month layover in Tahiti, during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was no <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> launch.|$|E

5|$|Fares {{were stored}} in a money room at 370 Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn {{starting}} in 1951, when the building opened as a headquarters for the New York City Board of Transportation. The building {{is close to the}} lines of all three subway divisions (the IRT, BMT, and IND) and thus was a convenient location to collect fares, including tokens and cash, via money train. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement of the building. Fare collection and transport was originally performed using armored trucks, and the money trains were replaced by armored trucks in 2006.|$|E

His tenacity came to fruition when, on April 21, 2007, Hamels pitched his first major league complete game, allowing one run on five hits and two walks while setting a career high with 15 strikeouts. Just three days before, the Phillies moved their opening day starter Brett Myers to the bullpen to be the closer, making Hamels the team's number one starter. On May 16, he carried a perfect game into the seventh inning, but then walked leadoff hitter Rickie Weeks and surrendered a home run to the next batter, J. J. Hardy.|$|E
