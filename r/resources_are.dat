5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} frivolous or vexatious claims. This minimizes disruption in the administrative process. When an administrative decision by a public authority is challenged, implementation of {{the decision by the}} authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the decision. Furthermore, since the courts' <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> limited, restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> appropriately allocated.|$|E
50|$|However, {{in certain}} cases both the dispose pattern and finalizers are used for {{releasing}} <b>resources.</b> This <b>is</b> primarily found in CLR languages such as C#, where finalization {{is used as a}} backup for disposal: when a <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> acquired, the acquiring object is queued for finalization so that the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> released on object destruction, even if the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> not released by manual disposal.|$|R

5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> being used, whether or not those <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E

5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending.

5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity.

The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome.

50|$|<b>Resource</b> {{acquisition}} <b>is</b> initialization (RAII) is a programming idiom used {{in several}} object-oriented languages.
