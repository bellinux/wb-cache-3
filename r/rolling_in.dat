As the second verse begins, Rihanna is seen with slicked-back hair wearing a metal bikini top, <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> mud and surrounded by troops on a stone structure before a mountainous backdrop. She is shown gambling with (and winning against) soldiers in another bunker.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{the mundane}} sight of pebbles <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> the Baltic Sea surf {{in the summer}} of 1921, Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall, {{conducting}} extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process. Although he had originally conceived of it as a hymn to the city and technology, over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature. He finished the manuscript {{in the summer of}} 1923, and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year.|$|E
5|$|Monkey Fight: One to {{four players}} {{simultaneously}} engage in combat by <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> any {{direction with the}} analog stick and using the A button to punch opponents with a boxing glove attached to their monkey's ball. Points are awarded for knocking opponents {{off one of the}} three available arenas, with more points being awarded when the player currently in the lead is knocked off. The player with the most points is declared the winner of a round when the in-game timer reaches zero. Items can be used to extend the reach, size, and strength of one's boxing glove.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the other}} senior {{officers}} in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and they were caught by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings of the military complex remained under junta control. Khánh managed to escape to Vũng Tàu. His plane was just emerging from the hangar and lifted off just as rebel tanks were <b>rolling</b> <b>in,</b> attempting to block the runway and shut down the airport. Phát's ground troops also missed capturing Kỳ, who fled through the streets in a sports car {{with his wife and}} mother-in-law. Kỳ ended up at Tân Sơn Nhất, where he ran into Khánh; the pair flew off together to regroup.|$|E
5|$|For the Meteora shoots, a Greek bishop {{was paid}} to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly {{critical}} of production <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> their installations. After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court, {{it was decided that}} the monks' only property were the interiors – the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government. In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting, and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their washing out of their windows and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters. The production team solved the problem with back lighting, matte paintings, and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock, and a monastery set in Pinewood.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 6 allows {{players to}} select between four {{scenarios}} with interwoven storylines. Each scenario follows {{one of four}} main protagonists: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong. The player-characters from each scenario will have their own partners whom are controlled by either artificial intelligence (AI) or another player via local or online multiplayer. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters are more vulnerable to attacks whereas others are more resilient. Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from increased reload times and carrying more ammunition. Resident Evil 6 presents new innovations and gameplay mechanics such as <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> any direction and running whilst shooting and sliding. The game also features a four-player co-operative mode. When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time. While performing certain actions, quick time events may occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating joysticks within {{a limited amount of}} time.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before noon}} on 19 February, he used around fifty tanks, their crew and {{a mixture of}} {{infantry}} battalions to seize {{control of the military}} headquarters, the post office and the radio station of Saigon. He surrounded the home of General Khánh and Gia Long Palace, the residence of head of state Phan Khắc Sửu. The tanks were led by Colonel Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, a Catholic member of the Đại Việt. The country was still trying to find stability, with Phan Huy Quát being appointed prime minister just three days earlier. Khánh managed to escape and flee to Vũng Tàu. His plane lifted off from Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the country's military headquarters, just as rebel tanks were <b>rolling</b> <b>in,</b> attempting to block the runway. Thảo's men tried to capture the Saigon base of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, and its commander, Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, but were foiled, but they did capture a number of junta members at Tan Son Nhut.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{originated with}} a tech demo by Naka, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix. Naka's prototype was a platform {{game with a}} fast-moving character <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was fleshed out with Ohshima's character designs and levels by Yasuhara. Yasuhara originally intended {{to work on the}} game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War, but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year. His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design. The game's color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Kay and Michael Brody are {{informed}} of Overman's disappearance. They {{go down in}} a submarine to look for his body, and during the search, they encounter a smaller shark. The dolphins rescue Kay and Mike, but the shark escapes back into the park. The news of the shark is disbelieved by Calvin Bouchard, the park manager, though it excites his hunter friend, Phillip FitzRoyce, who states his intention to kill the shark on network television. Kay protests and suggests capturing and keeping the shark alive in captivity, to guarantee more publicity for the park. The shark is successfully captured and Kay and her staff nurse it to health. Calvin, desperate to start the money <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> immediately, orders it moved to an exhibit, but the shark dies.|$|E

25|$|Drawing {{differs from}} <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> that the {{pressure}} of drawing is not transmitted through the turning action of the mill but instead depends on force applied locally near the area of compression.
