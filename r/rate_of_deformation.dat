25|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> is a {{function}} of the material properties, exposure time, exposure temperature and the applied structural load. Depending on the magnitude of the applied stress and its duration, the deformation may become so large that a component can no longer perform its function — for example creep of a turbine blade will cause the blade to contact the casing, resulting in the failure of the blade. Creep is usually of concern to engineers and metallurgists when evaluating components that operate under high stresses or high temperatures. Creep is a deformation mechanism that may or may not constitute a failure mode. For example, moderate creep in concrete is sometimes welcomed because it relieves tensile stresses that might otherwise lead to cracking.|$|E

25|$|The Zagros fold {{and thrust}} belt {{was formed by}} {{collision}} of two tectonic plates, the Eurasian Plate and the Arabian Plate. This collision primarily happened during the Miocene and folded the entire rocks that had been deposited from the Carboniferous to the Miocene in the geosyncline {{in front of the}} Iranian Plate. The process of collision continues to the present and as the Arabian Plate is being pushed against the Eurasian Plate, the Zagros Mountains and the Iranian Plateau are getting higher and higher. Recent GPS measurements in Iran have shown that this collision is still active and the resulting deformation is distributed non-uniformly in the country, mainly taken up in the major mountain belts like Alborz and Zagros. A relatively dense GPS network which covered the Iranian Zagros also proves a high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> within the Zagros. The GPS results show that the current rate of shortening in the southeast Zagros is ~10mm/yr, dropping to ~5mm/yr in the northwest Zagros. The north-south Kazerun strike-slip fault divides the Zagros into two distinct zones of deformation. The GPS results also show different shortening directions along the belt, normal shortening in the southeast and oblique shortening in the northwest Zagros.|$|E

The interstitial fluid effects are assumed negligible and the particles approximately incompressible. Dimensional arguments and experimental observations suggest that two different regimes of flow may occur. At low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation,</b> the Coulomb friction gives rise to stresses that are <b>rate</b> independent (<b>of</b> the plastic type). At large <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation,</b> momentum transfer arises from particles collisions and the resulting stresses become <b>rate</b> dependent (<b>of</b> the viscous type). A continuum model that includes both types of behaviour is proposed. The equilibrium part of the stress tensor satisfies the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion and a non-coaxial flow rule. The viscous part is assumed to have a form corresponding to an isotropic Reiner-Rivlin fluid. Experiments of simple shear flow flow in an annular shear cell were performed on several types of dry granular materials. The purpose of the tests was to obtain the information needed for the continuum description of the material behaviour. At lower solids concentrations and high shear rates where the inter-particle collisions are dominant, both shear and normal stresses were proportional to the square <b>of</b> the shear <b>rate.</b> At higher concentrations and lower shear rates, Coulomb friction between particles became increasingly important and the stresses were proportional to the shear rate raised to a power less than two.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Objective {{finite element}} {{modelling}} of any localized deforming body {{can only be}} achieved by the accurate calculation of the shear band thickness and the shear band orientation independent of alignment of the elements. Out of these two key issues, the authors have already considered the calculation of the shear band thickness in sensitive clays. Hence, this paper is pivoting around finite element modelling of inclination of a propagating shear band in sensitive soft clays under partly drained situation. In this paper the orientation (and direction) of a developing shear band in a sensitive soft clay is studied by finite element modelling accounting {{for the effects of}} local pore water flow out from the shear band (local drainage). Whether the shear band orientation is controlled by the degree of drainage (volume change) or by the mechanisms for shear band orientation under fully drained condition is studied. Numerical results show that orientation of shear band is governed by both dilatancy and frictional angle for slow <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation,</b> whereas for faster <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> it seemed to be unchanged and equal to 45 degrees from minor principle stress direction. ...|$|R

High resolution fluorescence microscopy is used to image the fibrin networks in the microchannels. Aggregation (i. e.
