40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of seedling preparation technology (seedling flats with cell size of 20 ml, 40 ml and seedlings pulled from patches) and of seedling age {{at the time of}} planting (development stages of 3 – 4 true leaves and 5 – 6 true leaves) to the qualitative characteristics of seedling of selected cabbage species: white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. capitata (L.) Alef. var. alba DC.) – Aros, Avak, Midor; cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar. botrytis (L.) Alef. var. botrytis L.) – Beta, Delta, Rober and savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. capitata (L.) Alef. var. sabauda L.) – Vega, Versus. The diameter and weight of <b>rosaces,</b> resp. heads, was evaluated in the harvested production. After splitting the harvested crop into several groups, the percentage of non-standard portion of the yield was determined. The use of older seedlings (5 – 6 true leaves) for the white and savoy cabbage planting had a positive influence to both average yield and the harvest earliness. On the other hand, for the cauliflower conclusively better average crop of <b>rosaces</b> and earlier harvests were achieved with younger seedling transplanting (3 – 4 true leaves). Seedling flats proved to be the most suitable way of seedling preplantation; no {{differences were found between the}} characteristics of products cultivated from the seedling flats with 20 ml and 40 ml cell volumes. In average, smaller amount of non-standard harvest plant parts was, gained with the transplanting from larger seedling flats (40 ml cell volume) ...|$|R

This paper aims to expose a communication component architecture allowing to manage a cooperative adaptation which is aware of the activity and resource context into pervasive environment. This allows to provide the appropriate adaptation of the activity in response to evolutions of the activity requirements and the changes in relation with the communication resource constraints.

40|$|Steven J Dell Dell Laser Consultants, Austin, TX, USA Abstract: There {{is a clear}} {{association}} between dry eye disease (DED) and skin inflammatory diseases occurring {{in close proximity to}} the eyelids, such as facial skin rosacea. Intense pulsed light (IPL) is widely accepted as a treatment for skin rosacea. A number of recent studies demonstrated that, in patients suffering from meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), IPL therapy also reduces signs and symptoms of DED. Despite these encouraging results, in the context of DED and MGD, the mechanisms of action of IPL are not well understood. The purpose of this review was to raise the potential mechanisms of action and to discuss their plausibility.

40|$|Rosacea is {{a common}} chronic {{cutaneous}} disorder that primarily occurs on the convex surfaces of the central face and is often characterized by exacerbations and remissions. A case of a 52 -yr-old woman visited our clinic in February 2008 complaining typical features of rosacea including multiple pinhead to rice-sized erythematous papules. We applied various conventional treatments including topical benzoyl peroxide and metronidazole as well as oral metronidazole, isotretinoin, and doxycycline. The lesions were not controlled but were rather aggravated by complications from these treatments. Therefore, we prescribed oral azithromycin, which has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces reactive oxygen species. Ten weeks after the administration of oral azithromycin, 500 mg per day for 2 weeks, the lesions had mostly disappeared and no specific side effects related to the azithromycin were noted. Oral azithromycin dosing 500 mg/day for 2 weeks is effective for treatment of intractable rosacea. Key Words: Azithromycin; <b>Rosace...</b>|$|E

Despite {{the fact that}} many hypotheses have been proposed, its etiology remains unknown. In the present review, the possible link and clinical significance of Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of rosacea are being sought. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was performed using the terms “rosacea”, “H. pylori”, “gastrointestinal disorders and H. pylori”, “microorganisms and rosacea”, “pathogenesis and treatment of rosacea”, and “risk factors of rosacea”, and selected publications were studied and referenced in text. Although a possible pathogenetic link between H. pylori and rosacea is advocated by many authors, evidence is still interpreted differently by others. We conclude that further studies are needed in order to fully elucidate the pathogenesis of rosacea. Keywords: eradication, Helicobacter pylori, pathogenesis, <b>rosace...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Rosacea is {{a common}} skin condition, but the {{currently}} available treatments are not satisfactory. Objective: We wanted to assess the efficacy and safety of photo-pneumatic therapy (PPx), which delivers pneumatic energy and broadband light (400 ∼ 1, 200 nm), {{for the treatment of}} erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. Methods: Twenty two patients with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea were treated 3 ∼ 5 times with PPx. Three independent dermatologists evaluated the efficacy of PPx by comparing the photographs taken before and after treatment. Patient self-assessment was also done by interviews. Results: The photographic assess-ment by the dermatologists of the improvement showed that ＞ 50 % improvement occurred in 64 % (14 / 22) of the pa-tients. The specific categories of improvement were as follows: poor (＜ 25 % improvement), 1 patient; fair (25 ∼ 50 % improvement), 7 patients; good (50 ∼ 75 % improve-ment), 11 patients; and excellent (＞ 75 % improvement), 3 patients. Based on the patients ’ self-assessment, 20 patients (91 %) acknowledged an improvement. Conclusion: PPx is an effective and safe treatment option for erythematotelan-giectatic rosacea.

KG, Limburg (Lahn), Germany Abstract: Infection {{is common}} in many chronic, {{inflammatory}} skin conditions but {{is often difficult to}} treat, in part due to growing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Liposomal polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) -iodine hydrogel has a unique mode of action, combining the antiseptic and anti-inflammatory actions of PVP-iodine with the drug delivery and moisturizing properties of liposomes. We investigated the utility of liposomal PVP-iodine to treat infective dermatoses. In this prospective, single-arm (uncontrolled), open-label Phase II pilot study, patients with acne vulgaris (n= 30), atopic dermatitis (n= 20), impetigo contagiosa (n= 10), and rosacea (n= 10) received PVP-iodine (3 %) hydrogel for ≤ 4 weeks. Global Clinical Severity score improved for all dermatoses (range: 0. 5 for acne vulgaris [p< 0. 001] to 1. 0 for impetigo contagiosa [p= 0. 011]). Improvements in pain, quality of life, (Freiburg Life Quality Assessment), and Eczema Area and Severity Index scores were also seen. Treatment was well tolerated; most frequent adverse events were burning (14 %) or itching (9 %) sensations. Thus, liposomal PVP-iodine hydrogel has potential utility as an effective treatment for inflammatory skin conditions associated with bacterial colonization.

The decoration painted under the vaults is more systematic and can be outlined under two main topics : Emblematic motifs, usually circular, sometimes square, painted under {{the apex of the}} vaults : the lotus <b>rosace,</b> at the centre of the cloister vault of shrines; the Buddha's footprints, under the vault of vestibules and entrance halls in a large number of temples; the map of universe, with its concentric circles of mountains and rivers around the Mount Meru and the four continents in the peripheral ocean; the horoscopes of Buddha's life, depicting the zodiacal chart for the major events in the Buddha's life (conception, birth, enlightenment and parinirvana); the map of Anotatta Lake, considered by the Buddhist cosmogony to be the source of the five sacred rivers of India. Decorative patterns, generally covering the whole of the vault and composed of simple geometric elements, occasionally with a figure on the centre : the circle pattern, most frequently used, with numerous variations in their detail and in their arrangement; the polylobe pattern, primarily with quatrefoils or cruciform elements; the polygon pattern, combining octagons, squares, diamonds or hexagons; the figure pattern, with rows of Buddha figures generally of very small size; the floral pattern, which can include figures or animals on a vegetal patterned background.
