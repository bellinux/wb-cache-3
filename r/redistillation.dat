5000|$|Shaw's avowed {{literary}} strategy, {{as we have}} seen, was {{to appeal}} to the most highly developed taste of the intelligentsia he was attacking. Shaw knew that Captain Shotover, his spokesman in the play, must first of all, like Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, hold his audience spellbound if he was to strike home with his message. As Shaw himself put it, [...] "The funny old captain, having lured them into his ship by his sallies, ties them up to the gangway and gives them a moral dozen." [...] The result is Chekhov reorchestrated, so to speak, with tubas and drums added, to allow for the playing of a Dies Irae at the end. Heartbreak House is thus a <b>redistillation</b> of Chekhov {{and at the same time}} a passing beyond him, for Chekhov's world is static and directionless. Though his characters often talk grandly and eloquently about the future of humanity, it is obvious that they are not going to act on their convictions, and Chekhov records their orations with a sympathy that is undercut with humorous skepticism. His aim is to present men and women to us dramatically, not to point the way. As a result some critics have exalted his detachment into an end in itself and attacked Shaw as the perverter of the master. But this is to ignore the fact that Chekhov himself found the lack of commitment in contemporary writing its greatest failure and contemporary nihilism the age's bane.|$|E

The purification was done using several methods included sedimentation, filtration, adsorbtion, and <b>redistillation</b> at up to 100 C, 125 C, 150 C, and 200 C. The results of the research showed that during sedimentation, filtration, adsorbtion, <b>redistillation</b> at up to 100, 125, 150 and 200 C the concentration of tar was 1. 24 %, 1. 19 %, 0. 45 %, 0. 44 %, 0. 59 %, 0. 72 % and 1. 20 % respectivelly and the concentration of benzopyrene was 305 ppm, 110 ppm 0. 196 ppm, 0. 196 ppm, 0. 196 ppm and 0. 196 respectively.

40|$|Methanol is an {{unwanted}} {{component in the}} production of spirit beverages. Its presence in grape pomace stored until distillation greatly affects the composition of the final product, which requires <b>redistillation,</b> modifying the aromatic characteristics of the distillate. Consequently, reduction of methanol, by controlling its formation during pomace storage, can increase the quality of grappa. The aim of this work was to monitor pectinmethylesterase activity during grape pomace storage, in order to identify its presence related to methanol release. The enzyme activity was detected during various storage times by spectrophotometric and electrophoretic methods. Results show that yeasts do not contribute to PME production. Moreover, by using paranitrophenyl acetate, a specific substrate for esterase, also as PME substrate, we demonstrate the presence of several enzymes hydrolysing ester bond...|$|E

Bacteriol. 89 : 1015 – 1019. 1965. —The trace element {{requirements}} for growth of facultative chemolithotrophic Hydrogenomonas strains H 1 and H 16 were investigated under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. The organisms were grown in a mineral medium, rendered deficient in trace elements by extraction with 8 -hydroxyquinoline and chloroform, and, in some cases, by coprecipitation with copper. The organic substrates, succinate and fumarate, used for heterotrophic growth were {{treated in a}} similar fashion. Acetate and butyrate were purified by <b>redistillation.</b> It was found that iron alone was required for heterotrophic growth (optimal concentration, 1. 5 × 10 − 6 m Fe+++), but cells grown chemolithotrophically on molecular hydrogen required the addition of nickel. The yield of protein was proportional to the nickel added, reaching a maximum at 3 × 10 − 7 m Ni++. Manganese, cobalt, copper, and zinc, alone or in combination, failed to substitute for nickel in the experiments with Hydrogenomonas. Although nickel is required specifically for the chemolithotrophic growth of Hydrogenomonas, nickel deficiency did not affect: (i) the synthesis or activation of hydrogenase, (ii) the Knallgas reaction, (iii) the assimilation of CO 2 by resting cells, or the synthesis of the storage material poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid.

40|$|Liquid smoke {{has been}} used to extend the shelf life of food. However, its {{composition}} varies considerably {{depending on the type of}} raw materials used and preparation precedure. Liquid smoke derived from palm oil shell is potential due to the abundance of its byproduct sources in the palm oil industry. This study thus aims to prepare the best fraction of liquid smoke that can extend the shelf life of beef meatballs at room temperature. The raw liquid smoke was redistilled at 80, 90, and 100 °C and was used as an ingredient in the beef meatballs production. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identification showed that there were no harmful compounds such as derivatives of tar and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Liquid smoke produced from <b>redistillation</b> at 80 °C had the best result for providing higher acid value and lower pH, i. e. 5. 14 % and 2. 26, respectively. The LC 50 value of the redistilled liquid smoke in brine shrimp lethality assay was 0. 16 %. Inhibition zones of 0. 1 and 0. 8 % redistilled liquid smoke on the antibacterial test against Staphylococcus aureus were both 6. 10 mm, while the zones of inhibition for Escherichia coli were 0 and 7. 0 mm, respectively. These resulting inhibition zones were less effective than that of 100 ppm chloramphenicol, i. e. 14. 2 mm on S. aureus and 12. 6 mm on E. coli. The usage of redistilled liquid smoke at concentration of 0. 8 % in meatballs was found to inhibit total microbial growth greater than that of the addition at 0. 1 %.

40|$|The goal of {{producing}} and processing limestone ore (mostly CaCO 3) is to obtain high-quality refractory materials based on lime (CaO). Lime is {{the raw material}} for obtaining calcium metal as a strategic and fundamental component in lead metallurgy (production of refined lead, Pb-Ca alloys in the battery and cable industry, ferroalloys production {{with the addition of}} silicon and calcium, production of alloy steel and high-quality steel). This paper explores the preparation of lime by roasting the limestone deposits of Strezovci (Republic of Kosovo) and its use for obtaining calcium through the aluminothermic process. Through research and analysis of the chemical composition of certain types of lime, its suitabi- lity for obtaining calcium metal was determined, and by analyzing the samples of the slag, determined was the possibility of its use in the production of fire-resistant cement for which the evaluation is needed. Based on previous research, the following was chosen: optimal composition of the cast, volume of added reducing agents, and conditions of the reduction process performance: temperature-time and initial vacuum. According to the authors’ knowledge, not one Southeast European country has applied this method, and it includes the use of by-products (slag), which can cause environmental pollution. The goal of this research was to prepare lime by roasting limestone of domestic origin in order to obtain calcium metal through the aluminothermic process. The procedure of calcium metal production includes the following operations: decarbonatization of limestone ore (CaCO 3), grinding of the obtained lime (CaO), homogenization of CaO and alumina, agglomeration, and aluminothermic reduction in vacuum furnaces. For the efficiency of the process, the most important technological operations are decarbonatization and reduction, provided the other operations are performed correctly. The estimated total world capacity for production of calcium metal is 25 000 – 27 000 tons/year. The mass fraction of calcium in manufactured calcium metal is minimum 97 %. In recent years, some western countries are producing calcium metal with 99. 99 % of Ca, through <b>redistillation</b> and zonal refining. In the countries of Southeastern Europe and former Yugoslavia, the largest consumers were lead metallurgy, battery and cable industries, the steel industry and the producers of friction alloys. Based on the given results, the manufactured calcium metal can also be placed on other world markets. These {{studies have shown that the}} preparation of lime by roasting the limestone depo- sits of Strezovce (Republic of Kosovo) and its use for the aluminothermic obtaining of calcium metal is possible. This would stop imports and initiate exports, as well as create conditions for serious research into the application of calcium metal for industrial purposes, and thus keep pace with global technological development trends. &KUI– 5 / 2013 Received October 12, 2012 Accepted November 21, 201...|$|E
