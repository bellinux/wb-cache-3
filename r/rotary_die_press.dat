50|$|In the {{broadest}} sense, a <b>rotary</b> <b>die</b> is a cylindrical shaped die {{that may be}} used in any manufacturing field. However, it most commonly refers to cylindrical shaped dies used to process soft webs, such as paper or cardboard. Two rules are used, cutting and creasing rules. This is for corrugated boards whose thickness is more than 2 mm. <b>Rotary</b> <b>dies</b> are faster than flat dies.|$|R

The shapes of the bars predicted by the proposed fuzzy model are compared with those obtained in the extrusion tests in order to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction.

The wire drawing process was conducted in industrial conditions by means of a modern multi-die Koch drawing machine.

It has been proved that the application of phosphate lubricant carrier and also the <b>rotary</b> <b>die</b> in the first draft in an essential way improve the lubrication condition in high speed multipass drawing process and makes it possible to refine the mechanical properties of wires...|$|R
50|$|In 1834, Mothes and Dublanc {{were granted}} a patent for {{a method to}} produce a single-piece gelatin capsule that was sealed with a drop of gelatin solution. They used {{individual}} iron moulds for their process, filling the capsules individually with a medicine dropper. Later on, methods were developed that used sets of plates with pockets to form the capsules. Although some companies still use this method, the equipment is not produced commercially any more. All modern soft-gel encapsulation uses variations of a process developed by R. P. Scherer in 1933. His innovation was to use a <b>rotary</b> <b>die</b> to produce the capsules, with the filling taking place by blow molding. This method reduced wastage, {{and was the first}} process to yield capsules with highly repeatable dosage.|$|R

50|$|Scherer House is a rambling, {{split-level}} {{design of}} white brick construction.

In {{the center of the}} house is a sweeping staircase and soaring two-story window. The extensive gardens and grounds are elevated and tiered down to the lake. The estate was designed by Keyes for Robert Pauli Scherer. (Scherer—at the age of 24 in 1930—invented the <b>rotary</b> <b>die</b> encapsulation process, which revolutionized the pharmaceutical world and helped raise worldwide health and nutritional standards. He created a multibillion-dollar company around his invention, and his experimental machine ended up in the Smithsonian Institution in 1955.)

50|$|Softgels are {{produced}} {{in a process}} known as encapsulation using the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Die</b> Encapsulation process invented by Robert Pauli Scherer. The encapsulation process {{has been described as a}} form/fill/seal process. Two flat ribbons of shell material are manufactured on the machine and brought together on a twin set of rotating dies. The dies contain recesses in the desired size and shape, which cut out the ribbons into a two-dimensional shape, and form a seal around the outside. At the same time a pump delivers a precise dose of fill material through a nozzle incorporated into a filling wedge whose tip sits between the two ribbons in between two die pockets at the point of cut out. The wedge is heated to facilitate the sealing process. The wedge injection causes the two flat ribbons to expand into the die pockets, giving rise to the three-dimensional finished product. After encapsulation, the softgels are dried for two days to two weeks depending on the product.|$|R
