5|$|Chris's loss on the Vortex was {{reversed}} after {{a review of}} a smaller camera underneath the Vortex that showed the ball dropping and landing milliseconds before the change in colour to red, thus the money was awarded to him— also note that the <b>rollover</b> still stood.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 2008, after a delay {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled {{from the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, {{where it was}} mated to the external fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a delay in the rollout of Atlantis to the launch pad, which is normally done seven days after <b>rollover.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{few hours}} {{prior to its}} development, outer rainbands from the {{depression}} began moving over portions of the Texas coast. Heavy rainfall from intense thunderstorms caused minor flooding as they crossed the coastline during the subsequent days; precipitation in the state peaked at 14.13inches (358.9mm) at East Bay Bayou, the highest recorded rainfall total {{in association with the}} hurricane. Sustained winds peaked at 69mph (112km/h) with gusts to 85mph (137km/h) at Sea Rim State Park; the National Weather Service estimates gusts exceeded 90mph (145km/h) in southwestern Jefferson County and extreme southeastern Chambers County. In the Golden Pass Ship Channel, an unofficial report of a 115mph (185km/h) wind gust was relayed to the National Hurricane Center. Upon moving ashore, Humberto produced a minor storm surge in the state, peaking at 2.86feet (0.87m) at <b>Rollover</b> Pass; the combination of surge and waves resulted in light beach erosion.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rollovers</b> {{overwhelm}} contributions - {{the overwhelming}} majority of IRA contributions, in dollar terms, were from <b>rollovers,</b> rather than new contributions - over 10 times as much is added to IRAs from <b>rollovers</b> than new contributions.|$|R
5000|$|While many <b>rollovers</b> {{were small}} (28.5% {{were less than}} $5,000, and 53.1% were less than $25,000), a {{significant}} number of <b>rollovers</b> were quite large, with 20.2% being more than $100,000.|$|R
50|$|The {{additional}} {{height and}} weight of plus sized wheels may reduce vulnerability to <b>rollovers,</b> particularly by changing the center of gravity. During rapid tire deflation at speed, reduced sidewall height may decrease <b>rollovers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2010, Lexus {{underwent}} a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives. Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models. The ES 350 and certain IS models {{were affected by}} a recall for potentially jamming floor mats, while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem rates per-vehicle. The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy the SUV, citing a possible <b>rollover</b> risk following the slow stability control response to a high-speed emergency turn. Although the publication knew of no reported incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.|$|E
5|$|The case {{began when}} the {{investigation}} of an automobile <b>rollover</b> accident during Mateen Cleaves' 1996 Michigan Wolverines recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the team. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated {{over the next few}} years and by 1999 several were called before a federal grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball players (Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock) were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin. Eventually he confessed to having accepted some of the money he was charged with having borrowed. For his perjury during a federal grand jury investigation, he was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by National Basketball Association after performing public service.|$|E
25|$|Space Shuttle Discovery {{was moved}} from its hangar in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) 3 {{to the nearby}} Vehicle Assembly Building on 22 February 2010. The <b>rollover</b> was {{completed}} around 10:30 EST. According to NASA, the <b>rollover</b> occurred a day earlier than announced {{to take advantage of}} favorable weather in advance of poor conditions forecasted on the next day.|$|E
50|$|Vehicle <b>rollovers</b> {{are divided}} into two categories: tripped and untripped. Tripped <b>rollovers</b> are caused by forces from an {{external}} object, such as a curb or a collision with another vehicle. Untripped crashes {{are the result of}} steering input, speed, and friction with the ground.|$|R

25|$|Discovery {{was moved}} from its hangar in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF)-3 {{to the nearby}} 52-story Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) on 9 September 2010. The shuttle emerged from OPF-3 at 06:54 EDT and the <b>rollover</b> was done at 10:46 EDT when Discovery came to a rest in the VAB's {{transfer}} aisle. The quarter-mile trip between the OPF-3 and VAB was the 41st <b>rollover</b> for Discovery. The <b>rollover</b> was originally planned at 06:30 EDT on 8 September 2010. The move did not commence due to the unavailability of fire suppression systems because of a broken water main near the VAB and turn basin that runs out to the shuttle launch pads.|$|E

25|$|Now, most {{pension plans}} {{have the same}} {{protection}} as an ERISA anti-alienation clause giving these pensions the same protection as a spendthrift trust. The only remaining unprotected areas are the SIMPLE IRA and the SEP IRA. The SEP IRA is functionally similar to a self-settle trust, and a sound policy reason would exist to not shield SEP IRAs, but many financial planners argue that a <b>rollover</b> (or direct transfer) from a SEP IRA to a <b>rollover</b> IRA would give those funds protected status, too.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that, considering <b>rollover</b> risk for heavy vehicles (semitrailers & buses), which have a relatively high centre-of-gravity, the above equation yields cross slope values which are too low.|$|E

25|$|U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{crash test}} results in 2003 rated the ES 300 the maximum five {{stars in the}} Frontal Driver, Frontal Passenger, and Side Driver categories, and four stars in the Side Rear Passenger and <b>Rollover</b> categories.|$|E
25|$|In the United States and Canada, all 2005 MY {{and later}} CR-Vs have {{anti-lock}} brakes, electronic brake force distribution, traction control and Vehicle Stability Assist, front seat-mounted side airbags, and side-curtain airbags with <b>rollover</b> sensors for all occupants.|$|E
25|$|Sports utility {{vehicles}} (SUVs) are criticized {{for a variety}} of environmental and safety-related reasons as they became more popular.

25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{low profile}} of the U. S. military Humvee was designed in part to allow it tilt farther than taller vehicles, without a <b>rollover,</b> because its low center of mass would stay over the space bounded the four wheels even at angles far from the horizontal.|$|E
25|$|The SRTV has a {{range of}} up to 350 miles, and can operate in {{difficult}} environmental conditions, and including at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above mean sea level. The vehicle can travel at a speed over 100mph and climb vertical grades over 70 degrees, move on side slopes angles of over 60 degrees and climb vertical steps over three feet. It can turn on a 20' (6.1 m) diameter curb to curb. Maneuverability is enhanced with cutting brakes allowing U-turns on steep hills within the length and width of the vehicle, also allowing high speed J-turns. The vehicle provides <b>rollover</b> safety for all occupants without limiting mission operational performance. Storm can carry up to three liters inside the <b>rollover</b> protection frame, without modifications, while still maintaining 360° of weapon field of fire.|$|E
25|$|CR-Z {{models have}} {{received}} an average rating for side crash safety, an excellent (5 out of 5 stars) rating for <b>rollover,</b> and a 4 out of 5 star rating for frontal crash safety for 2012 and newer model. The 2011 model has an average frontal crash safety rating (3 out of 5 stars).|$|E
