25|$|Several {{scientific}} {{studies have suggested}} that caged farmed salmon harbour lice to a degree that can destroy surrounding wild salmon populations. Other studies have shown that lice from farmed fish have relatively no effect on wild fish if good husbandry and adequate control measures are carried out (also, see section: Control on salmon farms). Further studies to establish wild–farmed fish interactions are on-going, particularly in Canada, Scotland, Ireland, and Norway. A <b>reference</b> <b>manual</b> with protocol and guidelines for studying wild/cultured fish interactions with sea lice has been published.|$|E

500|$|Modern style guides provide {{standards}} and guidance for the written language. [...] These works {{are important to}} writers since [...] "virtually all professional editors work closely {{with one of them}} in editing a manuscript for publication". Late editions of comprehensive style guides, such as the Oxford Style Manual (2003) in the United Kingdom and the Chicago Manual of Style (2010) in the United States, provide standards {{for a wide variety of}} writing and design topics, including sentence spacing. The majority of style guides now prescribe the use of a single space after terminal punctuation in final written works and publications. A few style guides allow double sentence spacing for draft work, and the Gregg <b>Reference</b> <b>Manual</b> makes room for double and single sentence spacing based on author preferences. Web design guides do not usually provide guidance on this topic, as [...] "HTML refuses to recognize double spaces altogether". These works themselves follow the current publication standard of single sentence spacing.|$|E
