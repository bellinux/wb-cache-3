5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball {{are provided in}} diverse sources. As noted, in kelly pool each player is <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack, which must be made in numerical order. The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when {{a large number of}} players are participating, players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in orderhave little chance of winning. This {{is a result of the}} likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a number of players at least one will come to the table with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E

Early plans were for players to be <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to characters {{but in the}} final release, players can choose any character—provided that the character has not already been selected—or be <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> an unselected character. Aside from appearances, all of the characters play exactly the same in-game.|$|E

Penn researchers found that the abstinence-only offering reduced subsequent sexual activity by one-third more than other programs.|$|E

The <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> group received 3 treatment sessions, {{between the ages}} of 6 and 9 months, based on maternal responsiveness to negative and positive infant cues. Intervention was based on Ainsworth's sensitive responsiveness components, namely perceiving a signal, interpreting it correctly, selecting an appropriate response and implementing the response effectively.|$|E

The last study visit was in May 1997, and the blind was broken in October.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{educational}} research (and {{the social sciences}} in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies. Quantitative research includes studies that use inferential statistics to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> different methods {{in order to test}} their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.|$|E

25|$|Double-blinding is {{relatively}} easy to achieve in drug studies, by formulating the investigational drug and the control (either a placebo or an established drug) to have identical appearance (color, taste, etc.). Patients are <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to the control or experimental group and given random numbers by a study coordinator, who also encodes the drugs with matching random numbers. Neither the patients nor the researchers monitoring the outcome know which patient is receiving which treatment, until the study is over and the random code is revealed.|$|E
25|$|One study, {{sponsored}} by NIDA, <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> cocaine abusers into four groups, individual drug counseling plus group drug counseling (GDC), cognitive therapy plus GDC, supportive expressive therapy plus GDC, or GDC alone. Individual drug counseling {{was based on}} the 12-step philosophy. Group drug counseling was designed to educate patients about the stages of recovery from addiction, to strongly encourage participation in 12-step programs, and to provide a supportive group atmosphere for initiating abstinence and an alternative lifestyle. Nearly 500 patients participated in the study.|$|E
25|$|A {{very small}} {{preliminary}} {{study published in}} 2016 shows that prayer helps people who have achieved sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous reduce cravings for alcohol. The study used a MRI machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking. The study <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> the subjects, so that some subjects saw the images after saying prayers in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous; others after reading newspaper articles. The people who had just seen the prayers reported feeling fewer cravings for alcohol; the MRI scans of their brains confirmed {{that there was a}} different reaction.|$|E

50|$|A true {{experiment}} would, for example, <b>randomly</b> <b>assign</b> {{children to a}} scholarship, {{in order to control}} for all other variables.

25|$|Versus: up to {{four other}} human players take control of various Special Infected to try and prevent the Survivors from {{completing}} a stage. Special Infected are <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to Infected players; they cannot control the Witch or any Common Infected. Occasionally, {{as determined by the}} AI Director, certain players will become the Tank. The two teams swap sides once per stage, and are scored based on their stage progress as Survivors. If both teams make it to the saferoom with all four Survivors, a 25-point tiebreaker is awarded to the team that dealt the most combined damage as Special Infected.|$|E
25|$|A 1967 study where a judge <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> (ordered) {{offenders}} {{to either}} clinical treatment, AA treatment, or to a no treatment (control) group.

No {{statistically significant differences between}} the three groups were discovered in recidivism rate, in the number of subsequent rearrests or in time elapsed prior to rearrest. Like the Brandsma study, the results are inaccurate since the studies did not stop people not assigned to AA treatment from going to AA meetings.|$|E
