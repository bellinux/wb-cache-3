5|$|Degraded by revolt and fifth-column activity, the 27th Infantry Division Savska {{numbered}} about 2,000 effectives {{when the}} German attack began. The 14th Panzer Division vanguard reached their {{positions in the}} Bilogora range around 08:00, and the <b>remnants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division began withdrawing towards Križevci under heavy air attack.

The divisional headquarters staff escaped, but were captured a little {{further down the road}} at Bojnikovec. The <b>remnants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Cavalry Regiment had to fight its way towards Bjelovar, but was attacked by German tanks on the outskirts, captured and detained.

The division's commander, chief of staff, {{and a few other}} officers chose instead to withdraw to the area of Chalkidiki. Apart from sending detachments, 191st Regiment did not participate en masse in battle. As soon as news came of the fall of Thessaloniki, the regiment moved to Stavros, where it disintegrated, with its men dispersing across Chalkidiki. This signalled the end of the division and its major sub-units as coherent fighting forces.|$|E

Another, in our vision, more plausible explanation for our case is that this recurrent ectopic pregnancy was conceived following passage <b>of</b> spermatozoa through <b>the</b> intact right fallopian tube and <b>the</b> pouch <b>of</b> Douglas to <b>the</b> distal <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left fallopian tube where the oocyt was present. The final option is transperitoneal embryo migration [6].|$|R
