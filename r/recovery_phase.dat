5|$|Roughly a {{month after}} the storm, a benefit concert was held in St. John's. The concert raised about $400,000 (2010CAD) toward storm relief in one night. In late October, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador {{allocated}} $275,000 in funds for 200workers who lost their jobs after two fish processing plants were damaged in Marystown and Port Union. However, union leaders claimed that the assistance was insufficient and accounted for just 420 of 600work hours. Following {{more than a year of}} discussions, the plant's parent company, Ocean Choice International, decided to permanently shut down operations on December2, 2011. Numerous insurance claims, reaching $65million by early November, were made following Hurricane Igor's landfall Over the course of the <b>recovery</b> <b>phase,</b> several complaints, including concerns lodged by church ministers, that relief funds for victims of the storm were not being distributed fast enough and the overall process was taking too long. Roughly ten months after the hurricane, work on permanent reconstruction of roadways began in several areas across the Burin Peninsula. By January 24, 2011, The Salvation Army received about $1.6million worth of donations for residents affected by Hurricane Igor, roughly half of which had been distributed at that point.

40|$|The {{presence}} of very few statistical studies on auroral omega bands motivated us to test-use a semi-automatic method for identifying large-scale undulations of the diffuse aurora boundary and to investigate their occurrence. Five identical all-sky cameras with overlapping fields of view provided data for 438 auroral omega-like structures over Fennoscandian Lapland from 1996 to 2007. The {{results from this}} set of omega band events agree remarkably well with previous observations of omega band occurrence in magnetic local time (MLT), lifetime, location between the region 1 and 2 field-aligned currents, as well as current density estimates. The average peak emission height of omega forms corresponds to the estimated precipitation energies of a few keV, which experienced no significant change during the events. Analysis of both local and global magnetic indices demonstrates that omega bands are observed during substorm expansion and <b>recovery</b> <b>phases</b> that are more intense than average substorm expansion and <b>recovery</b> <b>phases</b> in the same region. The omega occurrence {{with respect to the}} substorm expansion and <b>recovery</b> <b>phases</b> is in a very good agreement with an earlier observed distribution of fast earthward flows in the plasma sheet during expansion and <b>recovery</b> <b>phases.</b> These findings support the theory that omegas are produced by fast earthward flows and auroral streamers, despite the rarity of good conjugate observations...|$|R

Three types of feeding events are differentiated during feeding: (1) food ingestion primarily by ram feeding; (2) food manipulation; and (3) hydraulic transport of the food by suction. All feeding events are composed of the expansive, compressive and <b>recovery</b> <b>phases</b> common to aquatically feeding teleost fishes, salamanders and turtles.

25|$|A fit adult {{creates a}} wake. Drag {{due to a}} wake is Newtonian drag, {{increasing}} with {{the square of the}} velocity. For example, if the relative speed between the water and the leg is twice as high on the thrust phase than on the <b>recovery</b> <b>phase,</b> the thrust is four times as high as the drag. Assuming the legs are recovered with a relative speed between leg and body which amounts to the same as the relative speed between water and body, the legs must be kicked back with five times the mean velocity of the swimmer. This limits the top speed. Both effects together, velocity and frontal area, yield a thrust-to-drag ratio of 8 for the legs.|$|E

25|$|The turn is {{initiated}} by touching the wall during the gliding {{or during the}} <b>recovery</b> <b>phase</b> of the arms, {{depending on how the}} wall can be touched faster. After touching the wall, the legs are pulled underneath of the body. The body turns sideways while one hand is moved forward (i.e. towards the head) {{along the side of the}} body. When the body is almost completely turned, the other hand will be swung straight up through the air such that both hands meet at the front at the same time. At that time the body should also be almost in the horizontal and partially or totally submerged. After the body is completely submerged, the body is pushed off the wall with both legs. Doing this under water will reduce the drag. After a gliding phase, an underwater pull-out is done, followed by another gliding phase and then regular swimming. The head must break the surface during the second stroke.|$|E

2500|$|The leg movement, colloquially {{known as}} the [...] "frog kick" [...] or [...] "whip kick", {{consists}} of two phases: bringing the feet into position for the thrust phase and the insweep phase. From the initial position with the legs stretched out backward, the feet are moved together towards the posterior, while the knees stay together. The knees should not sink too low, as this increases the drag. Then the feet point outward {{in preparation for the}} thrust phase. In the thrust phase, the legs are moved elliptically back to the initial position. During this movement, the knees are kept together. The legs move slower while bringing the legs into position for the thrust phase, and move very fast during the thrust phase. Again, the goal is to produce maximum thrust during the insweep phase, and minimise drag during the <b>recovery</b> <b>phase.</b> In the <b>recovery</b> <b>phase</b> the lower leg and the feet are {{in the wake of the}} upper leg, and the feet are pointed to the rear. In the thrust phase all three parts create their own wake, and the flat end of the feet acts like a hydrofoil aligned to give maximum forward thrust.

The lower arm and the hand are completely relaxed and hang down from the elbow close to the water surface and close to the swimmer's body. The beginning of the recovery looks similar to pulling the hand out of the back pocket of a pair of pants, with the small finger upwards. Further into the <b>recovery</b> <b>phase,</b> the hand movement has been compared to pulling up a center zip on a wetsuit. [...] The recovering hand moves forward, with the fingers trailing downward, just above the surface of the water. In the middle of the recovery one shoulder is rotated forward into the air while the other is pointing backwards to avoid drag due to the large frontal area which at this specific time is not covered by the arm. To rotate the shoulder, some twist their torso while others also rotate everything down to their feet.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} {{steps to the}} arm {{movement}}: outsweep, insweep, and recovery. The movement starts with the outsweep. From the streamline position, the palms turn out and the hands separate to slightly past shoulder width. The outsweep {{is followed by the}} insweep, where the hands point down and push the water backwards. The elbows stay in the horizontal plane through the shoulders. The hands push back until approximately the vertical plane through the shoulders. At the end of the insweep the hands come together with facing palms in front of the chest and the elbows are at the side at the body. In the <b>recovery</b> <b>phase,</b> the hands are moved forward again into the initial position under water. The entire arm stroke starts slowly, increases speed to the peak arm movement speed in the insweep phase, and slows down again during recovery. The goal is to produce maximum thrust during the insweep phase, and minimum drag during the recovery phase.Another variant is the underwater pull-down, similar to the push phase of a butterfly stroke. This stroke continues the insweep phase and pushes the hands {{all the way to the}} back to the sides of the hip.

2500|$|The skiff is {{designed}} for optimum performance and so the technique applied is important. The two fundamental reference points in the stroke are the catch where the blade {{is placed in the}} water, and the 'finish' where the blade is removed from the water. The skiffer leans forward, and bends the legs slightly. After placing the blade vertically in the water at the catch, he or she applies pressure to stretcher, levering the blade in the water on the thole and leans back. This is called the drive phase of the stroke. Once the skiffer has pushed the blade as far forward in the water as possible, he or she extracts the oar from the water, and the <b>recovery</b> <b>phase</b> begins, setting up the skiffer's body for the next stroke. On the recovery, it is normal to tip the blade flat (known as [...] "feathering"). There are some differences from the rowing stroke.
