We model this setting in a dynamic framework in which both <b>rating</b> <b>agencies</b> and bond issuers are of heterogeneous quality. <b>Rating</b> <b>agencies</b> can apply costly research technology to reveal the fundamental nature of bond issuers and engage in rating smoothing. We show that rating smoothing can compensate for low research quality, {{even though it is}} accompanied by a quality deterioration in the rating market and market clustering. Moreover, low-quality bond issuers have a general tendency to match with low-quality <b>rating</b> <b>agencies.</b> If investors place a strong emphasis on the reputation of <b>rating</b> <b>agencies,</b> <b>rating</b> markets also tend to be strongly clustered...|$|R
