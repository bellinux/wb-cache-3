50|$|<b>Roue</b> de Moulin is {{the first}} one to stay at the castle, and he is {{preparing}} soup for dinner. All of a sudden, he hears a noise coming from the chimney. Then, a hand, an arm, an ear, and a head fall down the chimney like hail, and they form together to become a man. This man is the devil, and he asks <b>Roue</b> de Moulin to light his pipe. However, <b>Roue</b> de Moulin doesn't light his pipe, so the devil beats him up and prevents <b>Roue</b> de Moulin from finishing the dinner or ringing the bell. The others come back to the castle without hearing the bell, but <b>Roue</b> de Moulin fabricates an excuse and doesn't reveal what really happened.

Too many <b>roués</b> of the same name will never do. And now spurs to our steeds! for we are going at least three miles out of our way, and I must collect my senses and arrange my curls before dinner, for I have to flirt with at least three fair ones." ...|$|E
6000|$|The female sex {{participated in}} this sordid frenzy. Princesses of the blood, and ladies of the highest nobility, {{were among the most}} rapacious of stock-jobbers. The regent seemed to have the riches of Croesus at his command, and lavished money by {{hundreds}} of thousands upon his female relatives and favorites, as well as upon his <b>roués,</b> the dissolute companions of his debauches. [...] "My son," [...] writes the regent's mother, in her correspondence, [...] "gave me shares to the amount of two millions, which I distributed among my household. The king also took several millions for his own household. All the royal family have had them; all the children and grandchildren of France, and the princes of the blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Joan <b>Roué,</b> the {{great-granddaughter}} of Bluenose designer William <b>Roué,</b> started {{raising funds}} {{to build a}} new Bluenose. She cited the need for a new ambassador for Nova Scotia and Canada, listing the particulars at a Bluenose IV website. The name Bluenose III is owned by the province of Nova Scotia, and <b>Roué</b> could not reach an agreement for its use on the new schooner; <b>Roué</b> and North Atlantic Enterprises proceeded anyway, under the name Bluenose IV. [...] An agreement was reached with Snyder's Shipyard to build the new replica when fundraising was completed. However, as of 2009, <b>Roué</b> had not succeeded in raising the required funds.

She could hear the town yelping with it, every soul of them, gleeful at new details, panting to win importance by having details of their own to add. How well they would make up for what they had been afraid to do by imagining it in another! They who had not been entirely afraid (but merely careful and sneaky), all the barber-shop <b>roues</b> and millinery-parlor mondaines, how archly they were giggling (this second--she could hear them at it); with what self-commendation they were cackling their suavest wit: [...] "You can't tell ME she ain't a gay bird; I'm wise!" ...|$|E
60|$|I hate fountains and statues in dark {{confined}} places: that cheerless, endless plashing {{of water}} is the most inhospitable sound ever heard. The stiff grin of those French statues, or ogling Canova Graces, {{is by no means}} more happy, I think, than the smile of a skeleton, and not so natural. Those little pavilions in which the old <b>roues</b> sported were never meant to be seen by daylight, depend on't. They were lighted up with a hundred wax-candles, and the little fountain yonder was meant only to cool their claret. And so, my first impression of Berry's place of abode was rather a dismal one. However, I heard him in the salle-a-manger drawing the corks, which went off with a CLOOP, and that consoled me.|$|E

60|$|But that unfortunate Vivian {{attachment}} {{stood in}} the way; Sir Harry and his elder daughter ignored it entirely, but did not forbid Frank the house; though Lady Tyrrell took care, as only she could do, that Eleonora should never have ten minutes private conversation with him, either at home or abroad. Even in a crowd, a ball, or garden- party, the vigilant sister had her means of breaking into any kind of confidence; and Frank was continually tantalized by the pursuit. It could not but unsettle him, and draw him into much more gaiety than was compatible with the higher pursuits his mother had expected of him; and what was worse, it threw him into Sir Harry Vivian's set, veteran <b>roues,</b> and younger men who looked up to their knowingness and listened to their good stories.|$|E
6000|$|At Brussels Becky arrived, {{recommended}} by Madame de Saint Amour to her friend, Madame la Comtesse de Borodino, widow of Napoleon's General, the famous Count de Borodino, who {{was left with}} no resource by the deceased hero but that of a table d'hote and an ecarte table. Second-rate dandies and <b>roues,</b> widow-ladies who always have a lawsuit, and very simple English folks, who fancy they see [...] "Continental society" [...] at these houses, put down their money, or ate their meals, at Madame de Borodino's tables. The gallant young fellows treated the company round to champagne at the table d'hote, rode out with the women, or hired horses on country excursions, clubbed money to take boxes at the play or the opera, betted over the fair shoulders of the ladies at the ecarte tables, and wrote home to their parents in Devonshire about their felicitous introduction to foreign society.|$|E

It is to oblige the former that the good-natured young fellow is here to-night; though it must not be imagined that he gives himself any airs of superiority.

60|$|He {{surrounded}} {{himself with}} a set of dissolute men like himself; who, let loose from the restraint under which they had been held, during the latter hypocritical days of Louis XIV., now gave way to every kind of debauchery. With these men the regent used to shut himself up, after the hours of business, and excluding all graver persons and graver concerns, celebrate the most drunken and disgusting orgies; where obscenity and blasphemy formed the seasoning of conversation. For the profligate companions of these revels, he invented the appellation of his <b>roués,</b> the literal meaning of which is men broken on the wheel; intended, no doubt, to express their broken-down characters and dislocated fortunes; although a contemporary asserts that it designated the punishment that most of them merited. Madame de Labran, who was present at one of the regent's suppers, was disgusted by the conduct and conversation of the host and his guests, and observed, at table, that God, after he had created man, took the refuse clay that was left, and made of it the souls of lackeys and princes.|$|E
