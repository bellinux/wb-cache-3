40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} that enables software recovery in legacy applications by retrofitting exception-handling capabilities, error virtualization using <b>rescue</b> <b>points.</b> We introduce the idea of "rescue points" as program locations to which an application can recover its execution {{in the presence of}} failures. The use of <b>rescue</b> <b>points</b> reduces the chance of unanticipated execution paths thereby making recovery more robust by mimicking system behavior under controlled error conditions. These controlled error conditions {{can be thought of as}} a set erroneous inputs, like the ones used by most quality-assurance teams during software development, designed to stress-test an application. To discover <b>rescue</b> <b>points</b> applications are profiled and monitored during tests that bombard the program with bad/random inputs. The intuition is that by monitoring application behavior during these runs, we gain insight into how programmer-tested program points are used to propagate faults gracefully...|$|R
30|$|The supernetwork {{modelling}} of a cross-regional emergency scheduling {{system is}} conducted from two aspects: the optimization of petroleum emergency scheduling and the optimal behaviour of decision-making in the <b>rescue</b> <b>points.</b> In addition, the constructed supernetwork model is flexible and dynamic, which is embodied {{by adding a}} transfer layer to coordinate the cross-regional association in emergency process.|$|R

50|$|Dinosaur Island was {{announced}} via Sea World's Facebook page on 3 May 2012. This followed several visual {{clues as to}} what the new attraction might be. Construction began almost immediately with the closure of the area surrounding the <b>Rescue</b> <b>Point</b> Lighthouse. In late May, the dinosaurs began to arrive. On 16 June 2012, the attraction officially opened to the public. The exhibit was expected to close following the June/July holidays in 2013; however it remained open until June 2014.|$|E
50|$|The Dinosaur Island exhibit {{was split}} into two sections. The main part of Dinosaur Island was where {{a number of the}} larger {{animatronics}} were located. There were 14 animatronics in this area including an 18 m long Tyrannosaurus. Some of the animatronics featured control panels which allowed guests to control their movement. This section was located {{along the edge of the}} Sea World Lake in the area surrounding the <b>Rescue</b> <b>Point</b> Lighthouse. The second part of the exhibit, the Dinosaur Island Discovery Centre, was an indoor exhibit located near the Sea World Monorail System's main station and Penguin Encounter. This section was also home to a merchandise shop, the Dinosaur Store.|$|E
50|$|President Chávez {{proposed}} a humanitarian mission to rescue Clara Rojas, her son Emmanuel and Consuelo González in Colombia {{with the permission}} of the Colombian government. Chávez' plan was supported by the governments of Argentina, Brazil, France, Ecuador and Bolivia, as well as the Red Cross which will also participate of the operation. The mission consisted on flying Venezuelan aircraft labeled with the Red Cross insignia and into Colombia to an airport in the town of Villacicencio. Then resupply and from there reach the secret <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> set up by the FARC. On December 26, 2007 the Colombian government through the Minister of Foreign Affairs approved the mission.|$|E

40|$|Software {{bugs and}} {{vulnerabilities}} cause serious problems to both home users and the Internet infrastructure, limiting {{the availability of}} Internet services, causing loss of data, and reducing system integrity. Software self-healing using <b>rescue</b> <b>points</b> (RPs) is a known mechanism for recovering from unforeseen errors. However, applying it on multitier architectures can be problematic because certain actions, like transmitting data over the network, cannot be undone. We propose cascading <b>rescue</b> <b>points</b> (CRPs) to address the state inconsistency issues that can arise when using traditional RPs to recover from errors in interconnected applications. With CRPs, when an application executing within a RP transmits data, the remote peer is notified to also perform a checkpoint, so the communicating entities checkpoint in a coordinated, but loosely coupled way. Notifications are also sent when RPs successfully complete execution, and when recovery is initiated, so that the appropriate action is performed by remote parties. We developed a tool that implements CRPs by dynamically instrumenting binaries and transparently injecting notifications in the already established TCP channels between applications. We tested our tool with various applications, including the MySQL and Apache servers, and show that {{it allows them to}} successfully recover from errors, while incurring moderate overhead betwee...|$|R

30|$|In the cross-regional {{emergency}} scenario, {{with the}} decrease in links between <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> B and transfer point 2, the emergency scheduling quantity of petroleum in this region decreases, and this quantity is less than that in the single mode. The minimum relief costs and generalized emergency costs both increase under identical conditions. However, the generalized emergency costs sharply decline when the link between <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> B and transfer point 2 increases, which {{is less than the}} single one. Compared with the single region emergency dispatching mode, the cross-regional mode has lower costs and more capacity. Although the minimum relief costs increased slightly the cross-regional emergency coordination mode is better than the single region emergency dispatching.|$|E
30|$|In {{view of the}} {{complexity}} of emergency cooperation in the different regions, we make the following assumptions to facilitate the construction of the supernetwork model: (1) The petroleum for supply and relief in each region is homogeneous. (2) The emergency command centre provides instructions for a <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> to allocate the petroleum resources to the crisis point. (3) The total petroleum in the <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> is greater than the total demand for petroleum in the crisis point. (4) All the emergency agents are rational; they are on the basis of satisfying the petroleum shortage, utilizing the reduction in the emergency cost and the emergency time as the main purpose. (5) The functions of emergency costs and emergency time are all continuously differentiable convex functions (Wang and Wang 2008).|$|E

30|$|In {{the single}} region {{emergency}} scenario, {{with an increase}} in the emergency path’s vulnerability, the total emergency scheduling quantity has a slight increase to 5.1, the minimum emergency costs remain virtually unchanged, and the generalized emergency costs of the entire network greatly increase from 39.5 to 58.6. To relieve the shortage condition, the <b>rescue</b> <b>points</b> should be appropriately increased to allocate more emergency funds if the path vulnerability increases. In short, different vulnerabilities for the emergency path will result in an emergency scheduling quantity change, which further affects the minimum relief costs and the generalized emergency costs at each crisis. Increasing the robustness of the emergency path can effectively improve the emergency response efficiency.|$|R
30|$|The {{necessary}} {{conditions for}} which the crisis point can obtain relief are shown in Formula (4). If the <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> decides to allocate the petroleum, the total supply must meet the total demand. The emergency action will terminate if supplies are less than demand, and the minimum relief costs are λ_w = 0.|$|E
40|$|Give me a fulcrum, and I shall {{move the}} world. —Archimedes How can one {{possibly}} analyze computation in general? The task seems daunting if not impossible. There {{are too many}} different kinds of computation, and the notion of general computation seems too amorphous. As in quicksand, one needs a <b>rescue</b> <b>point,</b> a fulcrum. In computation analysis, a fulcrum is a particular viewpoint on computation that clarifies and simplifies things to the point that analysis become possible. We review from that point of view the few foundational analyses of general computation in the literature: Turing’s analysis of human computations, Gandy’s analysis of mechanical computations, Kolmogorov’s analysis of bit-level computation, and our own analysis of computation on the arbitrary abstraction level. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} handle Natural disasters, {{emergency}} areas are often individuated over the territory, close to populated centres. In these areas, rescue services are located which respond with resources and materials for population relief. A method of automatic positioning of these centres {{in case of}} a flood or an earthquake is presented. The positioning procedure consists of two distinct parts developed by the research group of Prof Michael G. H. Bell of Imperial College, London, refined and applied to real cases at the University of Bologna under the coordination of Prof Ezio Todini. There are certain requirements that need to be observed such as the maximum number of rescue points as well as the number of people involved. Initially, the candidate points are decided according to the ones proposed by the local civil protection services. We then calculate all possible routes from each candidate <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> to all other points, generally using the concept of the "hyperpath", namely a set of paths each one of which may be optimal. The attributes of the road network are of fundamental importance, both for the calculation of the ideal distance and eventual delays due to the event measured in travel time units. In a second phase, the distances are used to decide the optimum <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> positions using heuristics. This second part functions by "elimination". In the beginning, all points are considered rescue centres. During every interaction we wish to delete one point and calculate the impact it creates. In each case, we delete the point that creates less impact until we reach the number of rescue centres we wish to keep. ...|$|E

30|$|In {{the single}} region {{emergency}} scenario, {{the results show}} that when the maximum emergency capability on line 2 is increased, two effects happen. First, the scheduling quantity in region B is increased. Furthermore, when the maximum emergency capability is decreased, the scheduling quantity also decreases. Specifically, the quantity of petroleum on line 2 significantly decreases from 5.0 to 3.0. Second, the minimum relief costs after reaching the network equilibrium will incrementally increase from 595.0 to 597.0. Therefore, the increase in the maximum emergency capacity will result in a larger emergency scheduling quantity for the entire network and smaller minimum costs for the <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> for the corresponding crisis point. Otherwise, the results will be the opposite. For petroleum supply, we should increase the maximum emergency capacity to effectively promote a more flexible emergency response mode.|$|E
30|$|In {{the single}} region {{emergency}} scenario, {{the results show}} that as the links between <b>rescue</b> <b>point</b> B and transfer point 2 decrease, the emergency scheduling quantity of petroleum in this region decreases. However, the minimum relief costs and the general emergency costs both increase. In addition, by setting r_ 2 = 10, the petroleum on that line increases to 5.0, while the minimum relief costs and the general emergency costs are reduced to 595.0 and 37.0, respectively. That finding means that the increase in links tends to result in more allocated petroleum and lower costs. Therefore, with an increase in cross-regional links, there should be more petroleum for an emergency, lower generalized emergency costs, and better emergency effects. Otherwise, the emergency effects will be weakened. There are two ways to reduce the emergency costs. One is increasing the coordination of the cross-regional emergency, and the other is technical innovations in the petroleum emergency.|$|E
