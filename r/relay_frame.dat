5000|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} technologies were previously deployed with essentially identical goals, such as Frame Relay and ATM. Frame Relay and ATM use [...] "labels" [...] to move frames or cells throughout a network. The header of the Frame <b>Relay</b> <b>frame</b> and the ATM cell refers to the virtual circuit that the frame or cell resides on. The similarity between Frame Relay, ATM, and MPLS is that at each hop throughout the network, the “label” value in the header is changed. This {{is different from the}} forwarding of IP packets. MPLS technologies have evolved with {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} ATM in mind. Many network engineers agree that ATM should be replaced with a protocol that requires less overhead, while providing connection-oriented services for variable-length frames. MPLS is currently replacing some of these technologies in the marketplace. It is highly possible that MPLS will completely replace these technologies in the future, thus aligning these technologies with current and future technology needs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{cooperative}} ARQ protocols, {{data frame}} retransmissions may {{be performed by}} a neighboring node (the relay) that has successfully overheard the source’s frame transmission. One advantage is the diversity provided by the relay. The three-way (source, destination, <b>relay)</b> <b>frame</b> exchange sequence required in the cooperative ARQ protocols may however introduce extra latency when compared to non-cooperative ARQ protocols. To take advantage of cooperative ARQ protocols, it is then necessary to resort to selective repeat solutions. The focus of the paper is to derive a delay model for cooperative selective repeat ARQ protocols in slotted radio networks. The derived analytical model quantifies, with closed formulas, the queueing and transmission delay experienced by Poisson arriving data frames, whose retransmissions are performed by a single relay.

50|$|When {{multiplexing}} packet {{data from}} different virtual circuits or flows, {{quality of service}} concerns often arise. This is because a frame from one virtual circuit may occupy the line for a long enough {{period of time to}} disrupt a service guarantee given to another virtual circuit. IP fragmentation is a method for addressing this. An incoming long packet is broken up into a sequence of shorter packets and enough information is added to reassemble that long frame at the far end.

Designed for transmission lines with a low error rate, <b>frame</b> <b>relay</b> networks provide minimal internal checking, and consequently, error detection and recovery is implemented in the attached user systems. The <b>Frame</b> <b>Relay</b> Bearer Service was developed specifically as a data service to handle highvolume, bursty traffic by means of high-speed packet transmission, minimal network delay, and efficient use of network bandwidth. The frame protocol supports the data transfer phase of the Service; the <b>frame</b> <b>relay</b> header and the local management interface are sources of congestion avoidance mechanisms. Current implementations include the StrataCom IPX FastPacket digital networking system, which provides the <b>frame</b> <b>relay</b> network, and Digital's DECNIS 500 / 600 and DEC WANrouter 100 / 500 software for attaching user equipment. Today's communications networks are built using high-speed digital trunks that inherently provide high throughput, minimal delay, and a very low error rate. Such transmission networks supply highly reliable service without the overhead of error control functions. <b>Frame</b> <b>relay</b> is a packet-mode transmission network service that exploits these network characteristics by minimizing the amount of error detection and recovery performed inside the network.
