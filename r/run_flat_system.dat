50|$|Besides the cost, {{which can}} be more than double other tires of {{comparable}} size, run-flat tires can not be <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> if the flat is due to sidewall damage, a common cause of flats. Also, under the best circumstances, the speed and range that the run-flat tires can be <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> is very limited. Run-flat tires cannot be driven over 50 miles per hour and usually offer only up to 50 miles of extended mobility. These limitations lower {{the value of the}} extra expense for many buyers. In certain applications, depending on the vehicle, specific tire design, and driving surface, a run-flat tire can provide from 25 miles to 200 miles driving while flat with limited speed.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{paradigm}} of two degree of freedom design for nonlinear control systems. In two degree of freedom design one generates an explicit trajectory for state and input around which the system is linearized. Linear techniques are then used to stabilize the system around the nominal trajectory {{and to deal with}} uncertainty. This approach allows the use of the wealth of tools in linear control theory to stabilize a system in the face of uncertainty, while exploiting the nonlinearities to increase performance. Indeed, this thesis shows through simulations and experiments that the generation of a nominal trajectory allows more aggressive tracking in mechanical systems. The generation of trajectories for general systems involves the solution of two point boundary value problems which are hard to solve numerically. For the special class of differentially <b>flat</b> <b>systems</b> there exists a unique correspondence between trajectories in the output space and the full state and input space. This allows us to generate trajectories in the lower dimensional output space where we don't have differential constraints, and subsequently map these to the full state and input space through an algebraic procedure. No differential equations have to be solved in this process. This thesis gives a definition of differential flatness in terms of differential geometry, and proves some properties of <b>flat</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, it is shown that differential flatness is equivalent to dynamic feedback linearizability in an open and dense set. This dissertation focuses on differentially <b>flat</b> <b>systems.</b> We describe some interesting trajectory generation problems for these systems, and present software to solve them. We also present algorithms and software for real time trajectory generation, that allow a computational tradeoff between stability and performance. We prove convergence for a rather general class of desired trajectories. If a system is not differentially flat we can approximate it with a differentially <b>flat</b> <b>system,</b> and extend the techniques for <b>flat</b> <b>systems.</b> The various extensions for approximately <b>flat</b> <b>systems</b> are validated in simulation and experiments on a thrust vectored aircraft. A system may exhibit a two layer structure where the outer layer is a <b>flat</b> <b>system,</b> and the inner system is not. We call this structure outer flatness. We investigate trajectory generation for these systems and present theorems on the type of tracking we can achieve. We validate the outer flatness approach on a model helicopter in simulations and experiment...|$|R

Motion of a four-axial vehicle has been analysed in order to evaluate the influence of tire damage (cracking, tearing) on its behaviour during sudden braking and based on that to evaluate the possibilities of driver’s reactions to motion disorders resulting from that emergency condition. Using the PC-Crash software, a vehicle model was designed allowing for simulation of special-purpose vehicle motion. The vehicle model includes a possibility of occurring of sudden tire damage when in motion. In such situation a model of cooperation of a tire and a surface is of crucial significance. A semi-empirical, non-linear TMeasy tire model was used. Its parameters were obtained {{on the basis of}} the results of the tests performed on 14. 00 R 20 tires with <b>run</b> <b>flat</b> inserts.

In both cases, we show that simulation checking is Exptime-hard, and for {{the case of a}} non-flat implementation, the result holds even if there is no synchronization between the parallel components and their alphabets of actions are pairwise disjoint. Moreover, we show that the considered problems become Pspace-complete when the specification is assumed to be deterministic. Additionally, we establish that comparing a synchronous non-flat system with no hiding and a <b>flat</b> <b>system</b> is Pspace-hard for any relation between trace containment and bisimulation equivalence, even if the <b>flat</b> <b>system</b> is assumed to be fixed...|$|R

Under such conditions we develop algorithms for finding a controller. Our methods do not focus only on finding control inputs trajectories but one can also find a representation of the controller under suitable conditions. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for determining whether a system is dissipative using data. Finally, we study the notion of difference flatness for linear systems. We define a <b>flat</b> <b>system,</b> using trajectories, as a system whose variables admits a partition such that a subset of the variables are unconstrained, and the other remaining variables are observable from the unconstrained variables.
