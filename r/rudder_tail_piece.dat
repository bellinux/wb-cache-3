50|$|The <b>tail</b> {{vertical}} <b>rudder</b> meter set {{a vertical}} gyrocompass {{to control the}} vertical <b>tail</b> <b>rudders.</b> The gyrocompass guided the torpedo to the target, allowing even rear-launched torpedoes {{to turn around and}} hit a target in front.

50|$|The starter starts controllers, one for {{vertical}} <b>tail</b> <b>rudders,</b> {{and another}} for roll rudders for anti-rolling in both side wing <b>rudders,</b> with horizontal <b>tail</b> <b>rudders</b> being locked at uppermost position, while the torpedo falls {{down to the water}} surface. It starts the main engine to propel when the torpedo hits the water. A thick safety bolt is inserted into the starter when the weapon is loaded on an aircraft. The bolt is pulled out from the torpedo when it is released. The bolt remains underneath the fuselage of aircraft.|$|R

50|$|Pan Am {{initiated}} trans-Pacific airmail {{service on}} 22 November 1935; and began carrying passengers in October 1936. Pan Am requested Boeing {{to design a}} longer range flying boat to improve service offered by the original Martin M-130s; and Boeing completed NX18601 with the canceled Boeing XB-15 wing design and a single vertical tail fin on 1 June 1938. A twin <b>rudder</b> <b>tail</b> was substituted after the initial test pilot reported adjusting engine power {{was the only way}} to turn the aircraft; and that was subsequently replaced with the triple tail used on production aircraft. Boeing also modified the hull-step and sponsons to provide satisfactory performance during takeoff and landings.|$|R
40|$|The ultrastucture of {{the snake}} Eryx jayakari (E. jayakari) mature sperm has not been published. Therefore, {{the present study was}} {{conducted}} to elucidate the sperm ultrastructure of this species in comparison with that of other reptilian species. The present investigation has shown that mature spermatozoa of Eryx jayakari are filiform in shape averaging 45 m (mean of 10) in length with a curved head measuring 9 m. The acrosomal complex, which involves the acrosomal cap and subacrosomal material, measures 2. 5 m. The nucleus is 6. 5 m in length, the neck approximates 1 m and the <b>tail</b> (midpiece, principal <b>piece</b> and endpiece) is maximally 35 m in length. The different <b>tail</b> <b>pieces</b> vary in diameter, being the largest at the midpiece (0. 66 m), diminished at the principal piece (0. 36 m) and the least at the endpiece (0. 25 m). The midpiece, the longest <b>tail</b> <b>piece,</b> is composed of mitochondrial and fibrous sheaths encircling the microtubular axoneme. The mitochondria are rod-shaped having linear cristae but no dense bodies interrupt their arrangement. The principal <b>tail</b> <b>piece</b> consists of the microtubular axoneme surrounded by the fibrous sheath. The endpiece involves only an axoneme enveloped within the plasmalemma of the spermatozoon. The present findings were discussed in relation to other relevant studies. It was concluded that the general ultrastucture of the E. jayakari spermatozoon conforms to that reported to be typical of squamates...|$|R

40|$|The ultrastructural {{features}} of the sperm tail differentiation in the lizard, Stenodactylus dorie have been described. The initial event was the caudal migration of the centrioles followed by implantation of the proximal centriole in the nuclear fossa and extension of the distal centriole to form the microtubular axoneme. Thereafter, the neck region and middle, main and end <b>tail</b> <b>pieces</b> were developed. The later three <b>tail</b> <b>pieces</b> along their length encompassed the axonemal core which revealed the typical 9 + 2 arrangement of microtubules. The axonemal core in the middle piece was enveloped within two successive sheaths, the mitochondrial and fibrous ones while in the main piece it was only encircled by the fibrous sheath.
