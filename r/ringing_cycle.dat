40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of the origin and mechanism of randomization in late boundary layer transition over a flat plate without pressure gradient. The flow randomization is a crucial phase before flow transition to the turbulent state. According to existing literatures, the randomization was caused by the big background noises and non-periodic spanwise boundary conditions. It was assumed that the large ring structure is affected by background noises first, and then the change of large ring structure affects the small length scales quickly, which directly leads to randomization and formation of turbulence. However, by careful analysis of our high order DNS results, we believe that the internal instability of multiple <b>ring</b> <b>cycles</b> structure is the main reason. What we observed is that randomization begins when the third cycle overlaps the first and second cycles. A significant asymmetric phenomenon is originated from the second cycle in the middle of both streamwise and spanwise directions. More technically, a visible asymmetric phenomenon in the middle vortex <b>ring</b> <b>cycle</b> starts at time step t= 16. 25 T and x= 838. 9 δin where the top and bottom level rings are still completely symmetric. The non-symmetric structure of middle level ring affects the small length scale in boundary layer bottom quickly. The randomization phenomenon spreads to top level through ejections. Finally, the whole flow domain becomes randomized. A hypothesis of C- and K-types shift is given as a possible mechanism of flow randomization.

Here, I discuss what is known about the four stages of the cohesin <b>ring</b> <b>cycle</b> using the <b>ring</b> model as an intellectual framework. I postulate that cohesin loading onto chromosomes, catalysed by a separate complex called kollerin, is mediated by the entry of DNA into cohesin rings, whereas dissociation, catalysed by Wapl and several other cohesin subunits (an activity that will be called releasin here), is mediated by the subsequent exit of DNA. I suggest that the ring's entry and exit gates may be separate, with the former and latter taking place at Smc 1 -Smc 3 and Smc 3 -kleisin interfaces, respectively. Establishment of cohesion during S phase involves neutralization of releasin through acetylation of Smc 3 at a site close to the putative exit gate of DNA, which locks rings shut until opened irreversibly by kleisin cleavage through the action of separase, an event that triggers the metaphase to anaphase transition...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a short review of our recent DNS work on physics of late {{boundary}} layer transition and turbulence. Based on our DNS observation, we propose a new theory on boundary layer transition, which has five steps, that is, receptivity, linear instability, large vortex structure formation, small length scale generation, loss of symmetry and randomization to turbulence. For turbulence generation and sustenance, the classical theory, described with Richardson's energy cascade and Kolmogorov length scale, is not observed by our DNS. We proposed a new theory on turbulence generation that all small length scales are generated by “shear layer instability” through multiple level ejections and sweeps and consequent multiple level positive and negative spikes, but not by “vortex breakdown. ” We believe “shear layer instability” is the “mother of turbulence. ” The energy transferring from large vortices to small vortices is carried out by multiple level sweeps, but does not follow Kolmogorov's theory that large vortices pass energy to small ones through vortex stretch and breakdown. The loss of symmetry starts from the second level <b>ring</b> <b>cycle</b> {{in the middle of}} the flow field and spreads to the bottom of the boundary layer and then the whole flow field...|$|R

The results suggest two very robust and efficient protection methods. In premium method network experiences no loss, whereas the loss period for Regular traffic is limited to a portion of the Round Trip Time. Preliminary dimensioning results are obtained under the assumption that the ring is dimensioned to support a single link failure. The difference between resources for Premium and Regular schemes depends on the traffic matrix and may be negligible for the very common concentration/distribution scenario. In the uniform traffic case, the cost of a dual ring with Regular protection is shown to be very close to the cost of a single, unprotected ring...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of randomization in late boundary layer transition {{is a key}} issue of late boundary layer transition and turbulence theory. We studied the mechanism carefully by high order DNS. The randomization was originally considered {{as a result of}} large background noise and non-periodic spanwise boundary conditions. It was addressed that the large ring structure is affected by background noises first and then the change of large ring structure affects the small length scale quickly, which directly leads to randomization and formation of turbulence. However, what we observed is that the loss of symmetry starts from the middle level rings while the top and bottom rings are still symmetric. The nonsymmetric structure of second level rings will influence the small length scales at the boundary layer bottom quickly. The symmetry loss {{at the bottom of the}} boundary layer is quickly spread to up level through ejections. This will lead to randomization of the whole flow field. Therefore, the internal instability of multiple level ring structure, especially the middle <b>ring</b> <b>cycles,</b> is the main reason for flow randomization, but not the background noise. A hypothesis is given that the loss of symmetry may be caused by the shift from C-type transition to K-type transition or reverses. Comment: 50 th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meetin...|$|R

The potent natural antioxidant HT was obtained through a C 3 hydroxylation on the <b>ring</b> <b>cycle,</b> whereas DHPA was synthesized via the 4 -hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPA) pathway, which has been well described from other bacterial sources. HT was produced first, and then DHPA was detected in the medium accompanied by traces of HPA. HPA involved another pathway resulting from the activity of an aryl-dehydrogenase, which is suggested to be responsible for both tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol oxidation. Maximal HT content (2. 30 mM) and maximal DHPA (5. 15 +/- 0. 42 mM) were obtained from a culture inoculated in the presence of 20 mM tyrosol and 0. 5 g L- 1 yeast extract.
