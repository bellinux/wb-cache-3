50|$|ELISA may be {{run in a}} {{qualitative}} or quantitative format. Qualitative results provide a simple positive or negative <b>result</b> (<b>yes</b> or <b>no)</b> for a sample. The cutoff between positive and negative {{is determined by the}} analyst and may be statistical. Two or three times the standard deviation (error inherent in a test) is often used to distinguish positive from negative samples. In quantitative ELISA, the optical density (OD) of the sample is compared to a standard curve, which is typically a serial dilution of a known-concentration solution of the target molecule. For example, if a test sample returns an OD of 1.0, the point on the standard curve that gave OD = 1.0 must be of the same analyte concentration as the sample.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{efficacy}} of shortterm transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment in chronic pain with respect to pain intensity and patients' satisfaction with treatment results. We therefore performed a randomised controlled trial comparing TENS and sham TENS. Patients, researchers and therapists were blinded for treatment allocation. One hundred and sixty-three patients with chronic pain referred to the Pain Centre entered the study. Conventional TENS and sham TENS were applied in the segments of pain, for a period of ten days. Outcome measures were pain intensity (visual analogue scale) and patients' satisfaction with treatment <b>result</b> (<b>yes</b> or <b>no).</b> The proportions of patients satisfied with treatment result differed significantly for TENS compared to sham TENS (58 and 42. 7 % respectively, chi(2) = 3. 8, p= 0. 05). However, no differences in pain intensity were found for patients treated with TENS or sham TENS. Only for patients satisfied with treatment results pain intensity gradually decrease equally both for TENS and sham TENS with repeated treatment application...|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{traditional}} {{design rule}} checks (DRCs), {{which have a}} clear pass or fail definition, yield issues, such as density and antenna checks, are dependent {{on a number of}} variables, <b>resulting</b> in a <b>yes,</b> <b>no</b> or maybe paradigm. These issues, which {{have a major impact on}} total chip yield, have typically been identified as design constraints and embedded in DRC rule files. But there is little in the way of information on how a change in layout relates to overall improvement in yield. With advanced processes of 130 nm and smaller, designs that are verified DRC clean can still result in poorly yielding or even non-functioning silicon. For this reason, a new method of communication is needed between designer and manufacturer for determining yield issues. Rather than being provided information on a simple pass/fail basis, designers need immediate access from the manufacturer to how various layout characteristics impact chip yield. This new communication loop is the first and necessary step in adopting and implementing a design for manufacture (DFM) flow. Such an approach identifies trouble spots and provides the important data that allows the designer to determine a cost/yield analysis. Designers will be deciding on and implementing a "fix or fab" methodology, resulting in greater yield and control...|$|R

40|$|We analyze what {{functions}} as a YES response and a NO response for different yes/no questions. This problem is surprisingly complex: respondents do not always produce overt <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> lexical items {{in response to a}} yes/no question. In addition, when respondents don't include a clear <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> word, they may mean to communicate a clear <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b> meaning, or something else. We find that the classification of yes/no questions described in (Carletta et al., 1995) for the Edinburgh map task corpus correlates well with whether a response will be a bare <b>yes</b> or <b>no,</b> a <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> plus additional speech, or just speech without an overt <b>yes</b> or <b>no.</b> Correlation with responses described simply as as "direct" or "indirect" is less good.
