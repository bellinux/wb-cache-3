40|$|FOREWORD The use of {{ionizing}} radiation in various {{scientific and technological}} fields, including nuclear energy, is accompanied by inherent potential radiation hazards. One of the relevant objectives in occupational radiation protection is to limit the exposure of workers to internal contamination and for this purpose {{it is essential to}} assess the intake of radioactive material into the body since the limits are now expressed in terms of this intake. The subject of internal contamination has always been regarded by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as an important issue and has been included {{as an integral part of}} its <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> <b>programme.</b> T w o earlier symposia in this area were organized by the I A E A — one in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labou...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the final report of a {{research}} contract of RIVM {{in the framework of}} the <b>Radiation</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Programme</b> of the Commission of the European Communities. The aim of the project was to investigate the nature of the dose-effect relationship for radiobiological effects after different types of ionizing radiation and UV. The results of the contract support the idea that the linear-quadratic dose relationship for radiobiological effects does reflect a two-hit or two-event type of radiation effect. The track structure calculations of the linear term indicate that the DNA double-strand break could be the crucial lesion and that the two simultaneous events should occur close to each strand of the DNA molecule in a single track. The experimental data indicate that the quadratic term arises from the combination of two time independently induced events the role of which can be modified by repair but these data do not provide any information {{on the nature of the}} radiation induced lesions. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the Third International Department of Energy/ Commission of European Communities Workshop on Residential Radon Epidemiology held in February 1995 in Baltimore, MD.

Two prior meetings were held in 1989 and 1991. The goal of this effort {{is to work with}} the investigators and to pool these studies to increase their limited statistical power and to maximize any information that could be gained from them. That goal has now been met. At this Workshop the task moved from planning and agreement to implementation, as many of the studies were finally being completed and published.

40|$|The {{approaches}} {{applied for}} the management of post-accidental situations have revealed the multiplicity and interdependency of the problems at stake in such a context. These problems are not limited to the radiological protection dimension but are also related to psychological, social, economic, political and ethical ones. In this perspective, the new challenge for post-accident management is to improve the living conditions of the local population taking account of all the aspects of the life and to consider the long-term issue in the perspective of a sustainable development. In order to present and discuss these different issues concerning the rehabilitation of living conditions in contaminated territories, the lecture will be focussed on the approach developed in the ETHOS project. This project was implemented in a village of the Republic of Belarus {{with the support of the}} <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> research <b>programme</b> of the European Commission.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Radiography)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 2004 The {{radiation}} {{risks associated}} with children are higher than the risk for adults. Children have growing organs {{and they have a}} longer life expectancy than that of adults. As a consequence the effects of damage from radiation could be greater than in adults. Children who receive radiation damage may pass genetic damage onto future generations. This study was carried out to investigate the optimal effective x-ray dose young children need to receive who have radiographic examination to the chest at Tygerberg Hospital, South Africa. Chest radiographs are documented as being the most common radiographic examination done on children. The age groups of children participating in this study were 0 - 1 year, 1 - 5 years and 5 - 10 years. A total of 67 children were involved and the absorbed doses for 134 views of the anterior-posteria (AP) chest and lateral chest were measured. Entrance surface dose (ESD) values were determined, and measured mean ESD (mGy) and the ESD range was reported for each age group. This was done by attaching thermolurninescent dosirneters (TLD pellets) to the patients skin at the entrance point of the x-ray beam. The results were compared to similar studies done in Ireland and Nigeria From the ESD values obtained the absorbed doses ofthe eyes, heart, liver, thyroid and genitals could be calculated by using the "Childdose" programme ofthe NRPB. The ESD dose levels for South Africa compare favourably with Ireland. However the Nigerian values differed greatly from those of Ireland and South Africa It was very encouraging to note the comparative results achieved at Tygerberg Hospital especially {{due to the fact that}} this was the first time such study had been conducted in the Tygerberg Hospital Radiology Department. The results also compare favourable with that achieved by a group working in the United Kingdom. This group does similar surveys every five years as part of their <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> <b>programme.</b> The results were also in line with the UNSCEAR document of 2000. v This study could serve as a valuable source of reference to radiographers and radiologists when performing paediatric radiology especially as the radiation absorbed dose could be used as a baseline to create awareness of size of dose received, and to limit deleterious radiation doses to patients and to prevent unnecessary exposures. A second significant outcome of the study was the effect that added filters had on the x-ray beam generated. Experiments were done in which the filtration filters were added sequentially. It was found that if the filtration was increased to 2 mmAl the dose to the patient decreased by more than 20 %. At 50 and 60 kV the density of the x-ray image on film only increased by 2 %. From these results it may be concluded that an increase in filtration thickness used for paediatric chest x-rays should be giVIng reduced dose readings and assisting with radiation protection ofthe patient...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{current state}} {{and need for}} <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> {{training}} in Finland have been surveyed by the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority – STUK. The survey sought {{to determine whether the}} current requirements for <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training had been met, and to promote <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training. Details of the scope and quality of present <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training were requested from all educational institutes and organizations providing <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training. The survey covered both basic and further training, special training of radiation safety officers, and supplementary training. The questionnaire was sent to 77 educational organization units, 66 per cent of which responded. Radiation workers and radiation safety officers were asked about <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> knowledge and needs for additional training. The questionnaire was sent to 880 radiation users and 170 radiation safety officers, 70 per cent of whom responded. The survey covered all professional groups and fields of the use of ionizing radiation except nuclear energy. The amount of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training in basic and further (specialization) training in the same vocational or academic degree varied remarkably by educational organization. The average amounts of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> included in most professional degrees met the requirements. 32 per cent of workers considered their <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training inadequate for their duties, and 48 per cent had completed no supplementary training in <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> over the last five years.

30|$|Although the {{majority}} of students (83 %) reported that they had lectures about radiation during their study, only 39 % reported that these lectures focussed on radiation dose and associated risks. As the subjects are future doctors referring patients for imaging examinations, they should be taught about the approximate quantity of radiation involved and which imaging methods use radiation and which do not. Knowledgeable and well-trained students {{play an important role in}} the creation of a positive radiation safety culture. The revised Euratom basic safety standard (BSS) Directive, article 18, states that 'member states shall encourage the introduction of a course on <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> in the basic curriculum of medical and dental schools’ [29, p. 15]. <b>Radiation</b> <b>protection</b> courses for medical students should include knowledge needed by a referring physician, i.e., basic knowledge on patient <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> such as biological effects of radiation, justifications of exposures, procedure optimisation, risk-benefit analysis, typical doses for each type of examination, etc. In addition, knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of the use of ionising radiation in medicine, should be part of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> education and training for medical students [30, p. 14]. ICRP (2009) recommends a total of 5 – 10  h for <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> education and training for medical students [31]. However, universities, including the sampled universities, provide an average of only two hours of lectures on <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> and there are no learning outcomes for <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> lectures in the curriculum [32]. This is alarming and may reflect the attitudes of the academic staff towards <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> issues. It is, therefore, suggested that a <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> curriculum, that covers the topics and the learning outcomes that are recommended for referrers in EU Directive 2014 [30], is developed, and the number of teaching hours needs to be consistent with the ICRP (2009) recommendations [31]. Radiation safety training should be an essential part of a university’s commitment [33]. Appropriate knowledge about radiation dose and protective measures from ionising medical examinations are important components for guideline adherence [34].|$|R
