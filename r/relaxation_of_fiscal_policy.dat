40|$|The paper {{tries to}} clarify whether the Greek drachma {{exchange}} rate movements {{could be better}} understood by incorporating {{the dynamics of the}} political environment. Greece could be considered as an ideal laboratory to examine the impact of the elections on the drachma exchange rate dynamics, since its political environment is formed by the co-existence of three distinct characteristics: first, a partisan structure with two main political parties with well defined ideological differences. Second, an opportunistic structure with frequent pre-electoral <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> and, third, a high density of elections. Based on the assumption that foreign and domestic investors are sensitive to changes in political regime, the Greek foreign exchange rate is examined relative to the ECU and the US dollar. It is found that the incorporation of political variables {{in the form of the}} electoral cycle impact the volatility of the exchange rate. Specifically, with the incorporation of political variables in an EGARCH-M context, it is found that past innovations exert an asymmetric impact on the conditional volatility of the exchange rate relative to ECU and USD. Moreover, the results based on the six parliamentary elections suggest that the conditional variance of the exchange rate is impacted by political developments in Greece. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{asks how}} Asia should {{prepare for the}} disorderly {{correction}} of global imbalances. It recommends tightening monetary policy and allowing Asian currencies to appreciate {{as a way of}} achieving a better balance between internal and external demand. Leaving the overall level of demand unchanged requires that this monetary tightening be complemented by some <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> But because the scope for fiscal support of domestic demand differs across countries, so too does the optimal degree of monetary tightening and exchange rate adjustment. This observation makes clear that an attempt to suppress intra-Asian exchange rate movements would be counterproductive in this context. Other policy measures that produce effects over longer horizons that can further contribute to the rotation of demand away from exports to the US include the development of Asian financial markets and the completion of an Asian free trade area. These policy adjustments will occur most easily if they are coordinated within Asia. Asia economies; global imbalances; international economics; economic integration; regional cooperation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is not to make}} {{short-term}} predictions about the life expectancy of the current economic expansion in the United States, but to determine if the present stance of fiscal and trade policy is appropriate looking to the medium turn. The expansion has been generated by economic processes that are unsustainable [...] processes in private saving, private borrowing, and asset prices that have fueled the growth of demand against a negative impetus both from fiscal policy and from net export demand. Given unchanged fiscal policy and the consensus forecast for growth {{in the rest of the}} world, continued expansion requires that private expenditure continue to expand relative to income on a record and growing scale, and it seems impossible that this source of growth can be forthcoming indefinitely, although it may well continue into next year. When private demand falters, it will be necessary to bring about a substantial <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> and to ensure that there is a structural improvement in the United States's balance of payments. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> institutions and economic growth in Asian between 1982 and 2001 {{through the application of}} Pedroni’s Cointegration approach. It examines three different channels through which <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> can affect long run economic growth in Asia. The first channel is when components <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> affects the real per capita GDP and the second channel is when the institutions included in components <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> affects the real per capita GDP. The third channel is when institutions interact with aggregate of government expenditure and aggregate <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> affects the real per capita GDP.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{whether and}} how the {{cyclical}} pattern of macro policy can affect growth. We focus on <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> and study whether the degree <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> counter-cyclicality has any significant impact on growth. Following the Rajan-Zingales (1998) methodology, we draw a relationship between <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> counter-cyclicality –measured at the macro leveland growth (both value added and productivity) at the sector level. We provide evidence that (i) industries have grown faster in economies where <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> has been more countercyclical, {{both in terms of}} output and productivity (ii) that the positive growth effects <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> counter-cyclicality have been larger in industries which rely proportionally more on external finance. We show these two conclusions to be unaffected by a bunch of robustness checks. In particular the effect <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> counter-cyclicality is robust to the inclusion {{of a large number of}} structural macroeconomic variables, including financial development, openness to trade or net current account position. Hence, the cyclical pattern <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is probably at least as important as can be structural features in their impact on growth. Second we use a number of different measures <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> counter-cyclicality. In particular we separate between the different components <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> (revenues and expenditures, investment and consumption) to determine which item counter-cyclicality is more important for growth.

40|$|The central {{problem which}} is {{addressed}} by this thesis {{is that of}} attaining the goal of economic stabilization through the utilization <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> More specifically, the responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> to {{the political and economic}} conditions which prevail in the provinces is examined. The central hypothesis is that <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> instruments which are typically thought of in terms of economic stabilization policy are not utilized for such purposes. Rather, <b>fiscal</b> economic stabilization <b>policy</b> at both the federal as well as the provincial levels is responsive to political conditions. To the extent that this hypothesis is an accurate reflection of reality, one of its major implications is then that federal-provincial coordination <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is, at best, unlikely.

40|$|<b>Fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is {{the only}} {{available}} sovereign macroeconomic stabilization tool for countries that have adopted a fixed exchange rate regime. Among these countries are {{the members of the}} euro zone that have adopted a common currency. However, there exists little empirical evidence on the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> measures under such an economic environment. The effects <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> shocks have been mostly studied in the United States or other non-European countries operating under flexible exchange rate regimes. This thesis studies the effects <b>of</b> discretionary <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> shocks in small open economies under different exchange rate regimes. The empirical analysis is based on a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model that takes advantage of institutional knowledge on tax collection lags and automatic movements in government expenditure and net taxes. In particular, the thesis suggest that by estimating the effects <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> shocks in two structurally similar countries that have opted for different monetary policy regimes (Finland and Sweden) one can convincingly control for the economic environment and study the effect of exchange rate regime on <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> transmission. Further, the thesis proposes to augment the baseline model with quarterly fiscal forecasts and to study the effects <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> under <b>fiscal</b> foresight, i. e., when economic agents may anticipate and respond to <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> measures prior to their implementation. The results suggest that the effects <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> shocks depend on the exchange rate regime. The effects <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> shocks under a fixed exchange rate tend to be more expansionary when compared to a floating exchange rate regime. The quantitative estimates of the effects <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> shocks tend to be associated with notable uncertainty, but it is argued that the qualitative difference is robust to a variety of sensitivity tests. In addition, the thesis suggests that fiscal foresight may affect the identification <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> shocks and hence the estimated dynamic results within conventional SVAR models. The findings are consistent with previous <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> literature that has considered <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> shocks within different exchange rate regimes, but also with studies that have incorporated fiscal foresight into SVAR models...|$|R

40|$|The severe global {{economic}} downturn {{and the large}} stimulus programs that governments in many countries adopted in response have generated a resurgence in research on the effects <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> One key lesson emerging from this research {{is that there is}} no single fiscal multiplier that sums up the economic impact <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> Rather, the impact varies widely depending on the specific <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> put into effect and the overall economic environment. Over the past three years, there has been a resurgence in economic research on the impacts <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> as implemented through direct government spending and tax rates. This resurgence is due in large part to the severe {{global economic}} downturn and the massive fiscal stimulus programs put in place in many countries as a response. Now, as many countries pivot from stimulus to austerity despite uncertain recovery, the question of the economic effects of higher taxes and reductions in government spending takes on a new importance. This Economic Letter reviews recent research on the economic effects <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> This research makes clear that many factors can affect the size and direction <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> effects, suggesting that policymakers must carefully consider the specific context <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> to understand the probable effects of new spending and tax initiatives...|$|R

However, the countercyclical effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> depends critically {{on the extent to}} which it crowds out private investment and consumption.
