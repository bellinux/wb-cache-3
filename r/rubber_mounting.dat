Experimental study of engine and cabin mounts identifies the structural behaviour of the complicated metal-net elastomeric mounts to isolate driver from {{noise and vibration}} transfer.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hysteretic}} {{behavior of}} mechanical components permits efficient passive control of mechanical system vibrations but makes response prediction delicate {{due to their}} high non linearity. In this work, the generalized Dahl model is applied to <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> used to support automotive engine cooling module. The general idea is to define an analytical model for the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount,</b> and to implement it into a global finite element model of the engine cooling module. The work presented illustrates the method on a simplified system. The <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> exhibit a non-linear behavior which depends on preload and frequency. Analytical restoring force models are well adapted to simulate their behavior. An experimental investigation was conducted {{in order to identify}} the model parameters. The model considers: two envelop curves (upper and lower) which can be modeled by polynomial functions, a parameter beta that governs the transition between the compression and extension phases of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount.</b> Based on the load-deflection hysteretic loops measured, an automated procedure was realized to extract the polynomial coefficients of the envelop curves and beta. The calculated coefficients are function of the preload and the excitation frequency. Hence, the behavior of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> can predicted versus time. In a second time, the model identified is implemented in a finite element model of a cantilever beam supported by a <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> at its free end. The dynamic transient response to a forced excitation is predicted and compared to experimental results...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{experimental}} method {{is presented in}} this paper to evaluate the frequency dependent <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping characteristics by utilizing the measured complex frequency response function from impact test and by least-squares polynomial curve fitting the data obtained from the test. The study shows the transition of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness from static to dynamic values. Using the experimentally estimated values of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping, the dynamic response of the tested spring-mass system using a <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> as the elastic element can be accurately reproduced. In contrast, it is found that the single degree of freedom (SDOF) ideal spring-mass model using constant stiffness and damping values can only predict the response of the system accurately at resonance but not at non-resonance frequencies. The proposed method is validated by comparing its results with those obtained by using mechanical shaker excitations and those of conventional direct stiffness method using blocked transfer frequency response functions...|$|R

50|$|The {{mid-engined}} Europa used {{a modified}} version of the Chapman strut. Owing to the need to isolate the engine and transaxle from the chassis in order to reduce noise and vibration, the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> led to an excessive sideways movement of the driveshafts. In this case, sideways location of the hubs was controlled by an enlarged diagonal radius rod to the front. <b>Rubber</b> sandwich <b>mounts</b> were developed that allowed vertical movement whilst controlling lateral movement. Similar vibration problems were encountered with the Elite, but as these only had the vibration of the differential to control rather than engine vibration, it could be managed by suitable design of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R
40|$|In many {{technical}} systems {{which are}} exposed to dynamic loading (oscillating excitation), it is required to reduce {{the reaction of the}} system Eigen dynamic due to durability, functionality or comfort. A widespread means of the Eigen dynamic reaction redaction is uncoupling/isolating the excitation source from the examined Eigen dynamic and damping of this reaction. For this purpose the elastomer (<b>rubber)</b> <b>mounting</b> is often used. The elastomer material shows a distinct elastic and less viscose behavior. For increasing of viscosity the elastomer is intermixed with, for example, carbon particulate matter. The system operation in viscos mode involves energy dissipation so that oscillation redaction is very efficient. An alternative to the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounting</b> with or without the additives is polymer mounting that exhibits in addition to elastic characteristic a distinctive viscos behavior. The polymer mounting is also convenient to isolating and damping of system oscillation exciting by environment or other technical systems in the neighborhood. Furthermore the viscoelastic material is the base of many smart materials. Thus smart materials mounting are often interest for active application. That is why we pursuit the investigation of mechanical properties of the viscoelastic material. We investigated viscoelastic behavior of polymer mounting at one degree of freedom oscillator in translating mode and estimated the frequency response of this dynamic system. Thereby, the stiffness-damping ratio is varied. We considered a numerical model of the one mass point oscillator with polymer mounting. Due to aperiodic damping behavior, we used to describe of this oscillator the fractional differential formulation. The fractional differential formulation is powerful to represent wide more dynamic behavior than the integer differential formulation. The amplitude and phase plot even depends on the derivative order of terms of the corresponding differential equation. In many cases the formulation by fractional differential equations is not pays off, because the accuracy achieved by ordinary differential equation is well enough. However in the cases of strong damping {{it seems to be a}} required way...|$|E
