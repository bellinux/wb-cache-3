5|$|Built as a {{replacement}} for a ship lost during the Second World War, she was to serve on route between England and the east coast of South America. She was wrecked on her maiden voyage in 1949, the sixth ship built by Harland and Wolff to suffer this fate. The insurance payout of £2,295,000 was the largest made at the time for a marine casualty in the United Kingdom. Due to changing trading conditions RML decided not to build a <b>replacement</b> <b>vessel..</b>|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1907, a gas {{explosion}} aboard the ship injured several crewmen. During political unrest in April 1913, {{part of the}} crew of Vasco da Gama {{had to be removed}} from the ship, as they had been involved in a planned ultra-Radical coup d'état against the First Portuguese Republic. On 14 May 1915, the crew again participated in unrest; they mutinied and killed the ship's captain and bombarded Lisbon, killing around one hundred people. Vasco da Gama remained the flagship of the Portuguese Navy at least as late as 1914, as the Portuguese naval budget was insufficient to fund a suitable <b>replacement</b> <b>vessel.</b> Thoroughly obsolete, she remained in the Portuguese fleet until 1935, when she was sold for scrapping.|$|E
25|$|S. A. Agulhas {{retired from}} Antarctic service in April 2012 when the <b>replacement</b> <b>vessel,</b> S. A. Agulhas II, was commissioned. It was {{transferred}} to the South African Maritime Safety Authority as a training ship.|$|E
50|$|A single {{class would}} replace both the tugs and the fireboats, {{and would be}} {{operated}} by civilian crews. The <b>replacement</b> <b>vessels</b> would have water cannons that could be controlled remotely, by a single individual.

The <b>replacement</b> <b>vessels</b> would have water cannons that could be controlled remotely, by a single individual. The <b>replacement</b> <b>vessels</b> would have bollard pull of 40 tons. The <b>replacement</b> <b>vessels</b> {{would be limited to}} 33 metres or less, and limited to a draft of 6 metres or less. Since their intended role would be harbour duties, they would have limited range and crew berthing capacity.|$|R
50|$|During the war, UAC {{had tried}} to make good their losses by {{building}} three <b>replacement</b> <b>vessels,</b> namely, the Congonian (1942), the Kumasian (1943) and Lafian (1943). By 1945, UAC had only 10 ships.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} such admirable efforts, however, Woodbury was clearly an {{obsolete}} ship, and in barely serviceable condition due to rotting timbers and worn out boilers. In 1913, the Revenue Cutter Service succeeded in its request to Congress for a <b>replacement</b> <b>vessel,</b> which was slated to enter service in 1915.|$|E
25|$|Coastal villages {{served by}} Queen of the North {{expressed}} concern about replacement transportation, {{as many of the}} small communities rely on BC Ferries not only for transport, but for food, mail and supplies. BC Ferries employed M/V Queen of Prince Rupert as the temporary vessel on the Inside Passage route until the <b>replacement</b> <b>vessel,</b> M/V Northern Adventure began service at the end of March 2007. The ferry corporation declined suggestions that the replacement ship be named in honour of the village of Hartley Bay.|$|E
500|$|Even {{into his}} 60s, Worsley still sought adventure. In 1934, {{he was asked}} to join the Treasury Recovery Limited Expedition which was {{organised}} to locate treasure allegedly hidden at Cocos Island by pirates. In earlier times, the island had been used as a base by the pirates to attack Spanish ships transporting gold from South America back to Spain. At the time of mounting the expedition, it was believed that between £5 million and £25 million in gold and silver was buried on the island. Worsley sailed, with Jean for company, for Cocos Island in September 1934 aboard the Queen of Scots. [...] On arrival at the island in October, he assisted in unloading stores to set up a village at Wafer Bay, the safest landing point on Cocos. The island, off the coast of Costa Rica, was heavily forested and hard labour was necessary to clear likely spots for searching. [...] As the Queen of Scots was found to be too large for the expedition's needs, Worsley left with the ship to return to England via the Panama Canal. He was to source a <b>replacement</b> <b>vessel</b> and bring back supplies.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 the Jamaican Fire Brigade {{found itself}} in the {{embarrassing}} position of having only one of its four fireboats operational, and it had requested that the County-class patrol vessels help fill in until its more modern <b>replacement</b> <b>vessels</b> were delivered.|$|R
50|$|The {{service would}} operate 24 hours per day, 365 {{days a year}} under the {{operation}} of Harris County through June 2004 when hours were reduced to their current times. <b>Replacement</b> <b>vessels</b> have been under consideration by the county since late 2004, but {{have yet to be}} ordered.|$|R

2500|$|The CG(X) program, {{also known}} as the Next Generation Cruiser program, was a United States Navy {{research}} program to develop a <b>replacement</b> <b>vessel</b> for its 22 s. Original plans were for 18–19 ships, based on the 14,500ton [...] with additional ballistic missile defense and area air defense for a carrier group. These vessels were to enter service beginning in 2017. The program was ended in 2010 with the intention of instead achieving the desired result with a successor to the Flight III Arleigh Burke–class destroyers.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian Department of Defence {{predicted}} in 2006 that Success {{will reach the}} end of her useful operational lifespan sometime between 2015 and 2017. Following her double-hull refit, this was extended to the early 2020s, with the decision on the <b>replacement</b> <b>vessel</b> (acquisition project SEA 1654 Phase 3) to be made between 2016 and 2018, and the new ship in service by 2023. The 2013 Defence White Paper stated that the replacement of Success and [...] would be brought forward. As well as building replacement vessels (either in Australia, overseas, or a combination), leasing existing vessels was also to be considered.|$|E
2500|$|During Commandant Billard's tenure, the Coast Guard {{sought a}} {{replacement}} cutter for the aging USCGC Bear {{which had been}} built in 1874 and was used for Arctic service. After consultation with 47 Coast Guard officers that had {{years of experience in}} Arctic waters, the Coast Guard named Newport News Shipbuilding of Newport News, Virginia to build the <b>replacement</b> <b>vessel.</b> The result was a steel-hulled cutter that was specifically designed for icebreaking and had a brigantine sail rig for emergency use in the event of ice damage to her propellers. [...] was the last cruising cutter built with a sail rig and was commissioned 7 May 1927. Billard made it clear to Secretary Mellon in his budget requests that the addition of vessels used for prohibition enforcement did not satisfy the needs of the service for cruising cutters because the larger cruising cutters that were presently in service were fast approaching obsolescence and the smaller prohibition enforcement vessels served a different purpose. Accordingly, at Mellon's insistence, Congress authorized the construction of ten cutters in June 1926. The first five [...] Lake-class cutters were commissioned in the fall of 1928 and spring of 1929 with the other five being commissioned in 1930–1932. Other new cutters that were contracted during Billard's tenure included six [...] cutters that were designed for light icebreaking.|$|E
5000|$|Sirius was {{originally}} {{expected to remain}} in service for approximately 15 years. In 2012, the ship was predicted to remain in service until the early 2020s.

40|$|Vascular disease {{results in}} the {{decreased}} utility and decreased availability of autologus vascular tissue for small diameter (< 6 mm) <b>vessel</b> <b>replacements.</b> While synthetic polymer alternatives to date have {{failed to meet the}} performance of autogenous conduits, tissue-engineered <b>replacement</b> <b>vessels</b> represent an ideal solution to this clinical problem. Ongoing progress requires combined approaches from biomaterials science, cell biology, and translational medicine to develop feasible solutions with the requisite mechanical support, a non-fouling surface for blood flow, and tissue regeneration. Over the past two decades interest in blood vessel tissue engineering has soared on a global scale, resulting in the first clinical implants of multiple technologies, steady progress with several other systems, and critical lessons-learned. This review will highlight the current inadequacies of autologus and synthetic grafts, the engineering requirements for implantation of tissue-engineered grafts, and the current status of tissue-engineered blood vessel research...|$|R

50|$|The {{final cost}} of {{replacing}} the Vanguard submarines {{will not be}} known until the project has been completed. In October 2015, Reuters claimed it would cost £167 billion over its 30-year lifespan, or £5.56 billion per year; this figure was disputed by the Secretary of State for Defence, Michael Fallon. The MoD puts the cost of building, testing and commissioning the <b>replacement</b> <b>vessels</b> at £31 billion (plus a contingency fund of £10 billion) over 35 years, or about 0.2 per cent of government spending, or 6 per cent of defence spending, every year.
