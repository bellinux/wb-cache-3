40|$|Around the globe, {{chemical}} compounds {{are used to}} treat or <b>repel</b> <b>pests</b> and plagues that {{pose a threat to}} food and feed production. From epidemiological studies, it is known that there is a link between exposure to certain chemical classes of these so-called pesticides and the prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease in humans. However, which particular compound(s) account for this link or what underlying mechanisms are involved is still largely unresolved. The degenerative process in Parkinson's disease is largely limited to the dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. Cellular mechanisms that are implicated in parkinsonian neurodegeneration include mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, disturbance of intracellular calcium homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. A major characteristic that distinguishes the dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia from other dopaminergic neurons is a particular reliance on intracellular calcium for spontaneous activity. Considering the energy consuming nature of maintenance of the intracellular calcium homeostasis and its involvement in life and death of a neuron, this may explain the specific vulnerability of this neuronal population. Despite a large variation in primary mechanism of action it has been demonstrated that pesticides from different classes disturb intracellular calcium homeostasis, thus interfering with intracellular calcium signalling. This relates to altered dopaminergic signalling, disturbed protein homeostasis and increased oxidative stress. Therefore, effects of (mixtures of) pesticides on the intracellular calcium homeostasis {{may play a role in}} the development of Parkinson's disease in humans. Although human exposure to pesticides via e. g. food often occurs in complex mixtures, (human) risk assessment is largely based on the assessment of single compounds. The discovery of common modes of action across different classes of pesticides therefore underpins the urgency of development of new models and approaches in risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|Garlic - a {{powerful}} plant Cue: In European folk stories, garlic is perhaps {{known for its}} power to keep away vampires - the fictional creatures that live by drinking human blood. But the reputation of garlic for protecting humans from harm {{is not just a}} story. In fact the power of garlic to help the body to fight infections is well known, and some people eat garlic as an alternative medicine to treat fevers. Originating from Europe, China and Japan, garlic is widely used as a flavouring in European and Asian cooking. It?s also becoming more popular in African cooking, and the future for garlic farmers selling to local markets in Africa would seem to be bright. The power of garlic to <b>repel</b> <b>pests</b> is not just a folk tale either. Garlic plants act as a repellent to many insect pests, and if grown among other vegetable crops, such as tomatoes, garlic can help to protect all the plants from insect attack. Once harvested, the garlic bulbs - each one made from many smaller sections called cloves - can be stored in a well ventilated place for up to a year without losing their value. Canisius Mpala is a garlic farmer from Zimbabwe. He spoke to Busani Bafana about his experience of growing this powerful, high value crop. Busani began by asking him why he decided to grow garlic. IN:		?I saw the crop being grown at home? OUT:		? it is an easy crop to grow and the returns are very good. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 39 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Canisius Mpala, a garlic farmer from Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Transcript Mpala	I saw the crop being grown at home in the Lukosi irrigation scheme in Hwange. Then I decided to experiment on the crop because I was told that it was easy to grow. I tried it and then after harvesting I realised that it was an easy crop to grow, it had a good market. So I decided to retain most of the seed, I sold a bit, so that the following year I went into it and grew it on a much larger area. Bafana	What would you say are the necessary conditions for the cultivation of garlic? Mpala	It is a cold season crop which requires chilling. So you can only grow it in the winter months. So in the winter months you have to plough your land, put in your manure, mix it with your soil. After that you put rows which are about 20 cms apart. Then in between the plants, you need to plant it about 5 cms apart. And then from there the only thing {{you have to do is}} to weed. And once in a while you can use a bit of pesticide just to prevent some diseases, but otherwise it is an easy crop. Even without any chemicals you can grow it as long as you do some irrigation since it is grown in winter. You have to plant it in March. It will be ready by July/August for harvesting. Bafana	You sound very passionate about growing garlic. Are there any difficulties in growing garlic? Mpala	Usually I tell people that garlic is an easy crop to grow because it is not attacked by any pests. It is actually a repellent. When the guys in Hwange started it was on the IPM workshop, whereby they wanted to find out which crop would they grow with their tomatoes in order to reduce the amount of pesticides that they were using. So they did a crop of garlic and tomatoes, and tomatoes alone and garlic alone, and then looked at the yields. So from there most of those guys in Hwange have now sort of resorted to taking garlic as the major crop. So it is an easy crop to grow, you just need a bit of water in winter and then even the fertilisation, once you do your composting in manure that is ideal for the crop. Bafana	What would you say was the biggest challenge you faced when you went into garlic growing? Mpala	The biggest challenge was the availability of cloves and the availability of the proper seed, because there are two varieties. There is the pink garlic and there is the white garlic. The pink garlic, most of the guys say this is more pungent and most people like it but it is not favourable for export. The white garlic is easy to handle and it is favourable for export but the seed was not available or it is not readily available. I think that has been the biggest challenge, getting the right material for seed. Bafana		Is it also easy to find the market for garlic? Mpala	Locally it has been easy, I think because most of the big wholesalers, the fruit and vegetable sellers they take up the garlic. And many people are learning or getting to use garlic on a regular basis so that marketing of the garlic has not been a problem. Bafana	You talked about white garlic and the pink garlic. When you grow the garlic do you sell it as processed or do you sell it raw? Mpala	Right now the pink garlic that we are growing, we are selling it as raw garlic. You just have to remove the leaves, remove the roots, package it into 10 kg pockets, sell it to Interfresh or the vegetable wholesalers. The white garlic that is for export has bigger cloves. It is easy to process and the South African market want it crushed as puree. Therefore this will be semi-processed, that will be sold to the outside market. Bafana	As a passionate farmer no doubt, what is the future of garlic growing in Zimbabwe as far as you can see? Mpala	The future of garlic growing is very bright. The past years or the past decade it was associated with the people of Asian decent or the whites. Those are the people who were eating garlic. But right now most people are taking up garlic because of its medicinal effect and most people use it as an antibiotic. So most people are taking up garlic and so the demand is increasing. So I think the prospects are brighter. And then there is also the prospect of selling it across the borders. Most countries the demand for garlic is high, therefore there is going to be a ready market and to grow. Bafana	For a farmer who might be interested definitely to go into garlic growing, what would be your advice? Mpala	My advice is tell the farmer to get in touch with the extension services, find out who are the guys who are already growing garlic, if they want to be assisted. And last year at the farm we had about 15 people coming, even though I was not around my supervisor showed them on how to grow it. When it was harvesting time the people came back again and said ?OK, how do we harvest the garlic?? So I think there is quite a lot of extension that might be needed for people. But looking at the ease at which you can grow garlic, it might have a bit of labour on planting but it is an easy crop to grow and the returns are very good. End of track.

5000|$|Pennisetum purpureum, {{also known}} as Napier grass, {{elephant}} grass or Uganda grass, is a species of perennial tropical grass native to the African grasslands. It has low water and nutrient requirements, and therefore can make use of otherwise uncultivated lands. Historically, this wild species has been used primarily for grazing; recently, however, it has been incorporated into a pest management strategy. This technique involves the desired crop being planted alongside a 'push' plant, which <b>repels</b> <b>pests,</b> in combination with a 'pull' crop {{around the perimeter of}} the plot, which draw insects out of the plot. Napier grass has shown potential at attracting stemborer moths (a main cause of yield loss in Africa) away from maize and hence is the [...] "pull" [...] crop. This strategy is much more sustainable, serves more purposes and is more affordable for farmers than insecticide use. In addition to this, Napier grasses improve soil fertility, and protect arid land from soil erosion. It is also utilized for firebreaks, windbreaks, in paper pulp production and most recently to produce bio-oil, biogas and charcoal.|$|R
40|$|Plant {{volatiles}} include terpenoids, {{which are}} generally involved in plant defense, <b>repelling</b> <b>pests</b> and pathogens and attracting insects for herbivore control, pollination and seed dispersal. Orange fruits accumulate the monoterpene limonene {{at high levels}} in the oil glands of their fruit peels. When limonene production was downregulated in orange fruits by the transgenic expression of a limonene synthase (CitMTSE 1) in the antisense configuration, these fruits were resistant to the fungus Penicillium digitatum (Pers.) Sacc. and the bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri and were less attractive to the medfly pest Ceratitis capitata. These responses were reversed when the antisense transgenic orange fruits were treated with limonene. To gain more insight {{into the role of}} the limonene concentration in fruit responses to pests and pathogens, we attempted to overexpress CitMTSE 1 in the sense configuration in transgenic orange fruits. Only slight increases in the amount of limonene were found in sense transgenic fruits, maybe due to the detrimental effect that excessive limonene accumulation would have on plant development. Collectively, these results suggest that when limonene reaches peak levels as the fruit develops, it becomes a signal for pest and pathogen attraction, which facilitate access to the fruit for pulp consumers and seed dispersers...|$|R

Fieldwork was conducted as a 4 th-year project by a University of Canterbury wildlife management class. Objective • To measure the effect {{of a small group of}} eye-spot balloons on bird damage to grapes at various distances from the balloons and at various times before harvest. Methods • Six balloons were hung above a ripening crop of pinot noir grapes five weeks before harvest. • At weekly intervals a visual assessment was made of bird damage to bunches of grapes at distances of up to 40 m from the balloons. Results • Bird damage increased rapidly as harvest approached and the grapes ripened and coloured. • One week before harvest, bird damage to grapes directly beneath the balloons was only 55 % of that recorded 40 m from the balloons. • The deterrent effect of the balloons extended about 20 m during the first week of the trial, and over shorter distances thereafter. Recommendations • Eye-spot balloons <b>repel</b> <b>pest</b> birds, but need to be used in conjunction with other methods of bird control. • Eye-spot balloons have little effect on birds more than 20 m from them. • Birds begin to habituate to eye-spot balloons within 1 - 2 weeks.

The presence of tropical basil near cabbage plots significantly reduced insect pest abundance on cabbage. Damages were also less important on cabbage intercropped with tropical basil. Among both intercropping modalities, alternate rows showed the best results in terms of reducing pest populations and damages than compared to cabbage plots surrounded by tropical basil.

50|$|In agriculture, {{multiple}} cropping is {{the practice}} of growing two or more crops in the same piece of land during a single growing season. It {{is a form of}} polyculture. It can take the form of double-cropping, in which a second crop is planted after the first has been harvested, or relay cropping, in which the second crop is started amidst the first crop before it has been harvested. A related practice, companion planting, is sometimes used in gardening and intensive cultivation of vegetables and fruits. One example of multi-cropping is tomatoes + onions + marigold; the marigolds <b>repel</b> some tomato <b>pests.</b>|$|R
