5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either {{too early in the}} season or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds.

Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E
5|$|A U.S. Navy relief {{plane was}} sent to Chetumal, Mexico, to deliver food and other relief {{supplies}} after Janet struck the region. In areas previously affected by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year, federal <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. However, after crossing the Bay of Campeche and making landfall near Veracruz, relief measures were once again implemented in the western Gulf Coast of Mexico. The Mexican Air Force, commercial and private planes, and helicopters were sent to bring relief supplies and airlift refugees. The United States initiated the largest relief campaign ever staged in Mexico at the time. Various government and <b>relief</b> <b>agencies,</b> including the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army, participated in the relief efforts. The United States Air Force and United States Army began a joint-relief operation to send relief supplies to the Tampico area, beginning with the deployment of a Curtiss C-46 Commando from the Harlingen Air Force Base on October1. Ten other military transport aircraft from the United States Air Force were sent from Texas to provide food and clothing. Pan American World Airways sent a Boeing 314 from Miami, Florida to evacuate victims. Helicopters were sent from the USS Saipan to transfer food and medical supplies from the light aircraft carrier. Other ships also aided in delivering supplies, including the USS Siboney, which also deployed helicopters to assist in relief efforts. By October6, 1,500people were estimated to have been rescued from the Tampico area, and at least 280,000lb (130,000kg) of food and clothing materials were estimated to have been delivered by the US Air Force to the city. There, typhoid serum shots were administered as a precautionary measure.

5|$|Arlington was {{established}} in the 1880s by settlers and the area was platted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Arlington area became home to projects under the direction of federal <b>relief</b> <b>agencies,</b> including a municipal airport that would serve as a naval air station during World War II. Beginning in the 1980s, Arlington experienced the effects of suburbanization, growing by over 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of Smokey Point to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on September1, 1948, the then-active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin Island in the Philippines {{began to}} release lava {{in a series}} of {{eruption}} events which continued for the ensuing three years. On December4, 1951, a large, Peléan eruption event later rated between a 2 and 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, sending pyroclastic flows and lahars down the northeast flank of the volcano. The resultant ash flows alone killed an estimated 500people on the island, {{making it one of the}} deadliest volcanic eruption events in recorded history. As the typhoon approached the archipelago, <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> were forced to divert aid operations to victims of the recent eruption, slowing the recovery process.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the governor of Nueva Ecija requested then-Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to declare his province a disaster area. Additionally, UNICEF was asked to provide water-purifying tablets. The Philippine Red Cross, Philippine government, local authorities and civic organizations provided relief assistance {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the storm. Despite private appeals for up to $1.4million for reconstruction aid, the Philippine government did not submit a request for international aid. However, by October 25, eight non-government <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> provided relief, which totaled $1.15million. Furthermore, the government of Switzerland provided $8,061worth of aid.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the storm's first {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings beginning on August29 for areas of Florida's east coast from Palm Beach south to Key West, while storm warnings were issued from Key West to Boca Grande on the peninsula's western coast. Electrical power was purposely stopped in Miami as a precautionary measure {{prior to the}} storm's landfall. Two Red Cross officials were sent to Miami to monitor the area during the storm's passage. Other <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> were also preparing supplies {{in the event of}} an emergency. In Pahokee and Belle Glade, an estimated 2,000people evacuated to Okeechobee, fearing a repeat of the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane.|$|E
5|$|With the typhoon {{approaching}} landfall {{in an area}} {{still recovering}} from previous storms, <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> already servicing the region were forced to allocate additional resources to prepare for Nanmadol. Evacuation efforts assisted in moving almost 100,000people into shelters. Effects from Nanmadol were most severe in Cagayan Valley, where 14people were killed. Power outages were widespread across several islands. Overall, damage from the typhoon in the Philippines totaled ₱2.23billion (US$39.3million). Heavy rainfall, peaking at , was documented in Taiwan. Agricultural damage in Taiwan alone reached NT$670million (US$20.8million). Similar effects were felt in Japan, where the remnants of Nanmadol produced record-breaking rainfall and wind. Damage was particularly significant in Aichi Prefecture, totaling JP¥69.8 million (US$680,000). Overall, Nanmadol resulted in 77fatalities and US$60.8million in damage across three countries.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the storm, urgent requests {{for food and}} clean water were made by residents in the hardest hit areas. By the afternoon of October23, the Red Cross began deploying relief supplies to the affected region; 300 tents and 150 bags of rice were planned to be distributed to Kyaukphyu where at least 5,000 people were left homeless. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 176,823 people were affected by the storm and 70,795 were left homeless. By October30, the number affected and homeless had risen to 1.1million and roughly 100,000 respectively. Red Cross officials also reported that an estimated 60,000 people were in need of assistance throughout Myanmar. Later that day, a relief charity was opened in Rangoon to aid victims of the storm; in short order, the charity had received donations of 10million kyat ($10,000USD). By October25, temporary shelter camps set up by <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> housed an estimated 5,000 people.|$|E

Additional disaster relief teams were deployed to the region to further prepare residents for the cyclone. Food, water and other necessities were stored and ready to be provided to victims of the storm. Large swells produced by the storm affected {{a large portion of the}} western Indian coastline, especially in the city of Bombay. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. Offshore, between 1,500 and 2,000 fishing vessels had lost contact with the mainland. Later reports indicated that between 120 and 900 fishermen had gone missing as a result of the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared for Aklan, where property damage equated to ₱51million (US$1million). The Central Visayas region of the Philippines suffered the worst impacts, with a damage cost of ₱345.2million (US$7million), primarily to agriculture. Following the storm's passage, chapters of the Philippine Red Cross assisted in relief efforts in impacted areas. The Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development allocated ₱27.7million (US$600,000) to relief efforts. Food and sheltering were provided to 2,615people in three provinces by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency. Many localized <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> donated sacks of rice to impacted residents. The United Nations appealed for US$46million for use in recovery efforts following Utor {{in addition to the}} three Philippine typhoons which preceded it. Overall, the impacts of Utor killed 30people and injured 44in the Philippines. Another eight people were never accounted for. The damage toll wrought by Utor amounted to US$15.8million. Furthermore, 36,542houses were damaged by Utor, of which 9,439were destroyed. Capiz and Aklan were the areas that sustained the most residential damage. People who were evacuated out of hazardous regions in advance of Utor were able to return home beginning on December18, nine days after initial landfall.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{destruction}} wrought by Typhoon Durian just weeks prior, preparations began in earnest in the Philippines. Over 91,000people were evacuated from areas at risk, primarily from Albay. Two major summits {{to be held in}} Cebu were postponed {{as a result of the}} forecast inclement weather. In addition, recovery efforts for victims of Durian had to be suspended and all domestic flights in the Philippines were cancelled. Utor's impacts in the central Philippines were extensive, with 30casualties reported and the damage toll reaching US$15.8million. Widespread power outages affected the entirety of Eastern Visayas. Numerous ships sunk as a result of rough seas generated by the typhoon, including a ferry carrying 104passengers and crew. Following the storm, <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> began to allocate resources to those affected by the typhoon, in turn also adding to relief efforts for the three Philippine typhoons which preceded Utor. Precautionary efforts also took place in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while the Paracel Islands sustained marked damage but no fatalities. Although the storm mostly dissipated in the South China Sea, Utor's remnant moisture later contributed in part to Peninsular Malaysia's worst flood event in recorded history, as copious amounts of precipitation fell over a short, four-day period. Eight people were killed by the floods which were worst in Kota Tinggi and Segamat District.|$|E

5|$|Following the cyclone's passage, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society began {{dispatching}} relief teams, food, {{and other}} supplies to impacted areas. The Bangladesh Army and non-governmental organizations participated in both air- and water-borne relief operations, though inclement weather initially forced the suspension of several planned helicopter flights. Both the Bangladesh Navy and Indian Navy convened in the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal {{to search for the}} thousands of fishermen and islanders that went missing during the tropical cyclone's landfall. Due to the wide scope of the disaster, the Bangladeshi government appealed for international aid, particularly from Japan and Canada as those countries had played large roles in the relief efforts of past Bangladeshi disasters. The Government of the Netherlands donated US$370,000for use in the relief efforts following the storm. Lord Glenarthur, then British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, toured effected areas in Bangladesh for three days before announcing a ₤200,000grant (US$370,000) to voluntary <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> assisting in cyclone relief operations. Then-Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad also visited the worst impacted districts, including Khulna and Bagerhat. Following these visits, Ershad's administration established a national disaster committee composed of relief specialists to coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} Swan Islands, Janet made {{landfall}} on the Yucatán Peninsula between Corozal Town, British Honduras, and Chetumal, Mexico, at 1700UTC on September28. At the time, it had winds of 175mph (280km/h). Hurricane force winds were reported {{for two hours}} preceding the hurricane's landfall, with numerous pressure readings below 948mbar (hPa; 28.00inHg). Roads and crops on the peninsula sustained heavy damage due to Janet. In Xcalak, Quintana Roo, the strong winds from Janet flattened the port's infrastructure, and only one house remained intact after the storm's passage. 97people were killed in Xcalak, constituting {{more than a third}} of the port's population. Chetumal, Mexico was devastated, with only four buildings left standing. Storm surge pushed water to a depth of 6.5feet (2m), 1600ft (490m) inland, despite the peninsula protecting the city from the open ocean. The death toll in Chetumal remains uncertain; 120bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found. An additional 10,000people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane, and were forced to sleep in the open overnight. Federal <b>relief</b> <b>agencies</b> previously providing service for areas affected by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the Gulf Coast of Mexico were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. In Quintana Roo, Hurricane Janet was estimated to have caused $40million in damages and at least 500deaths, the most of any region affected by Janet.|$|E
