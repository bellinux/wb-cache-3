50|$|The <b>Rettig</b> <b>Commission</b> noted {{a wealth}} of {{information}} supporting the accusations of the use of the laundry owned by Colonia Dignidad for detention and torture of political detainees during Pinochet's military dictatorship. This farm, commonly known as Colonia Dignidad, is within Parral, on the banks of river Perquilauquén, near Catillo. The Commission has also noted that other sources concluded Colonia Dignidad was used, at least, as a detention center for political prisoners. Among these sources are spokesmen for the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. The <b>Rettig</b> <b>Commission</b> ultimately based its conclusions on evidence that it examined directly.|$|E

Survey data were gathered from 156 middle level mathematics teachers to access the use of standards-based cur-riculum and instruction practices in their classrooms. Results indicate there are few {{differences in}} curriculum and instruction based {{on the type of}} school schedule. Educational reform is an ongoing process with many ideas being offered to improve our school systems. In the late 1980 s, block scheduling emerged {{as an alternative to the}} traditional 6 - or 7 -period day schedules. Block scheduling, with its typical 85 - to 100 -minute periods, was promoted as a way to free the classroom from time constraints that encouraged the common direct/lecture method (Canady & <b>Rettig,</b> 1995; National <b>Commission</b> on Time and Learning, 1994).

Later, in November 2004, the Valech Report confirmed the number as less than 3,000 killed, and {{reduced the number of}} cases of forced disappearance; but some 28,000 people were arrested, imprisoned, and tortured.|$|E
50|$|Though the <b>Rettig</b> <b>Commission</b> {{puts the}} count of murdered {{individuals}} at approximately 3,000 during the 17-year Pinochet ruling, the deaths of these 75 individuals and the Caravan of Death episode itself are highly traumatic, especially {{as many of the}} victims had voluntarily turned themselves in to the military authorities, were all in secured military custody and posed no immediate threat because they had no history of violence, nor were threatening to commit any such violence.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} coup the junta moved to crush their left-wing opposition. In {{addition}} to pursuing armed revolutionary groups it embarked on a campaign against opponents and perceived leftists in the country. As a result, according to the <b>Rettig</b> <b>Commission,</b> approximately 3,000 people {{are known to have}} been killed, 27,000 were incarcerated and in a great many cases tortured. Many were exiled and received abroad, in particular in Argentina, as political refugees; however, they were followed in their exile by the DINA secret police, in the frame of Operation Condor which linked South-American dictatorships together against political opponents.|$|E
5000|$|Beside {{implementing}} the <b>Rettig</b> <b>Commission,</b> Aylwin's government established a Comisión Especial de Pueblos indígenas (Special Commission of Indigenous People), whose report provided the intellectual {{framework of the}} [...] "Indigenous Law" [...] (ley indígena) or law n° 19 253, promulgated on September 28, 1993, which recognized in particular the Mapuche people as inherent part of the Chilean nation. Other indigenous people officially recognized included Aymaras, Atacameñas, Collas, Quechuas, Rapa-Nui, Yámanas and Kawashkars. Despite this state proclamation of indigenous rights, conflicts brought by land-occupations and Mapuche's claims led to state repression {{and the use of}} the anti-terrorist law against Mapuche activists, a law voted by the military junta.|$|E

Pinochet’s name {{will forever be}} linked to the Desaparecidos, the Caravan of Death, and the institutionalized torture {{that took place in the}} Villa Grimaldicomplex." [...] Thor Halvorssen, president of the Human Rights Foundation, National Review [...] Following the 1988 plebiscite, the <b>Rettig</b> <b>Commission,</b> a multipartisan effort by the Aylwin administration to discover the truth about the human-rights violations, listed a number of torture and detention centers (such as Colonia Dignidad, the ship Esmeralda or Víctor Jara Stadium), and found that at least 3,200 people were killed or disappeared by the regime. Later, the 2004 Valech Report confirmed the figure of 3,200 deaths but reduced the estimated number of disappearances. It tells of some 28,000 arrests in which the majority of those detained were incarcerated and in a great many cases tortured. Some 30,000 Chileans were exiled, particularly to Argentina; however, they were followed in their exile by the DINA secret police, in the frame of Operation Condor which linked South American dictatorships together against political opponents. Some 20,000-40,000 Chilean exiles were holders of passports stamped with the letter [...] "L" [...] (which stood for lista nacional), identifying them as persona non grata and had to seek permission before entering the country. According to a study in Latin American Perspectives, at least 200,000 Chileans (about 2% of Chile's 1973 population) were forced into exile. Additionally, hundreds of thousands left the country in the wake of the economic crises that followed the military coup during the 1970s and 1980s. In 2003, an article published by the International Committee of the Fourth International claimed that [...] "Of a population of barely 11 million, more than 4,000 were executed or 'disappeared,' hundreds of thousands were detained and tortured, and almost a million fled the country." ...|$|E
40|$|Identity and anonymity: {{victims and}} {{perpetrators}} {{in human rights}} reports In this paper, we look into the construction of identity and anonymity in human rights reports, more concretely in the report by the <b>Rettig</b> <b>Commission</b> on human rights violations under the Pinochet regime. In the preliminaries to this report, the commission formulates its desire {{to give an account}} that is as complete as possible yet also its refraining from attributing individual responsibility (Oteíza 2010). We will analyze the consequences of this ambiguous position for the conceptualization of the perpetrators, the victims and the relationship between them. This corpus study draws upon insights from cognitive linguistics (especially conceptualization and windowing of attention) (Talmy 2000) as well as from discourse analysis. In the first place, we will show that the tension between completeness of information and refraining from attributing responsibility is reflected in the presentation of the victims and the perpetrators: whereas victims are at first being clearly identified, perpetrators are not. Moreover, we will show that, throughout the development of the cases, few extra information concerning the victim is being given, yet the responsibility of the perpetrators is expressed through varying degrees of implicitness, relying on a wide array of syntactic structures (Delbecque in press) and pragmatic-rhetoric phenomena (implicatures, metonymies…). In the second place, in view of the commission’s attitude to individual responsibility, we will show how the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator is described from an external point of view. Thus, neither participants’ perspective is adopted, as opposed to more testimonial human rights reports, such as the Peruvian or South-African truth commissions. We will then demonstrate in this research how the linguistic construction of this report reflects and realizes the political and juridical choices made by the commission.

40|$|The memorialisation of the Chilean {{military}} dictatorship (1973 - 1990) displays a dynamic polarisation, with Chileans strongly divided {{about the events}} of 11 September 1973, when the Chilean armed forces, led by General Augusto Pinochet, turned against democratically-elected President Salvador Allende. This dissertation analyses the processes of memorialisation in Chile, produced by the contestation and negotiation of narratives of the past by political and social actors. In these processes, new symbolic, discursive and physical spaces emerge, allowing people to voice multiple perspectives and understandings of the {{military dictatorship}}. In the context of transitional justice, the creation of memorials has become an important instrument of symbolic reparation and democracy building; {{it has become a}} ‘tool’ in the transitional justice toolbox, comparable with trials, truth commissions and reparation projects. This dissertation is a contribution to a ‘thicker’ understanding of transitional justice through anthropological research. It describes processes of memorialisation in Chile from an anthropological perspective. The goal is to reveal a profound historical perspective, intricate networks of social and political actors, and the power relations at play that tend to be ‘flattened out’ in overly instrumentalist use of the transitional justice toolbox. The processes of memorialisation are mapped out through the analysis of the <b>Rettig</b> <b>Commission</b> (1990 - 1), the Roundtable on Human Rights (1999 - 2000), the Valech Commission (2003 - 4) and of the material manifestations of understandings of the dictatorship in memorials, monuments, reclaimed former secret detention- and torture centres and museums in Santiago de Chile. The 1991 Rettig Report focussed primarily on the individual fate of the detained-disappeared, while the 2004 Valech Report outlined the imprisonment and torture used by the military dictatorship and acknowledging 27, 255 persons as victims of these human rights violations. Over time, the position of military leaders changed from open denial to formal recognition of human rights violations under the military regime. The dissertation looks at spatial and material expressions of processes of memorialisation from a landscape perspective, capturing the essential dynamic nature of the sites. The ethnographic history of the grounds of Peace Park-Villa Grimaldi, and the analysis of the creation of the Memorial del Detenido Desaparecido y el Ejecutado Politico (1990 - 1994), Monumento Mujeres en la Memoria (2003 - 2006) and the Memorial Londres 38 (2005 - 2008) show how they became part of the memory landscape of Santiago de Chile. The early focus on the victims of forced disappearance has shifted to include the living memory of victim-survivors in commemoration practices, adding the dimension of social and political agency. The analysis shows that memorialisation is co-constituted by the active forces of the government and the grassroots organisations. The inauguration of the memorial in honour of the assassinated senator Jaime Guzmán showed the memory politics of political elites, as did the burial of Pinochet in 2006. The Museum of Memory and Human Rights (2010) can be understood as an attempt at nation-building, but not solely as an expression of political strategy. It is now a powerful new site in the memory landscape of Santiago de Chile, embedded into the broader processes of memorialisation in Chile...|$|E
