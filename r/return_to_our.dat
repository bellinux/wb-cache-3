25|$|BitTorrent peers use tit-for-tat {{strategy}} to optimize their download speed. More specifically, most BitTorrent peers use {{a variant of}} Tit for two Tats which is called regular unchoking in BitTorrent terminology. BitTorrent peers have {{a limited number of}} upload slots to allocate to other peers. Consequently, when a peer's upload bandwidth is saturated, it will use a tit-for-tat strategy. Cooperation is achieved when upload bandwidth is exchanged for download bandwidth. Therefore, when a peer is not uploading in <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own peer uploading, the BitTorrent program will choke the connection with the uncooperative peer and allocate this upload slot to a hopefully more cooperating peer. Regular unchoking corresponds very strongly to always cooperating on the first move in prisoner’s dilemma. Periodically, a peer will allocate an upload slot to a randomly chosen uncooperative peer (unchoke). This is called optimistic unchoking. This behavior allows searching for more cooperating peers and gives a second chance to previously non-cooperating peers. The optimal threshold values of this strategy are still the subject of research.|$|E
25|$|The Goa'uld ruled Earth for {{thousands}} of years, in the personae of gods from Earth's classical religions. It is never clarified, however, whether the Goa'uld impersonate deities that already existed in human mythology or if they themselves were the origin of those deities. From the humans, the Goa'uld engineered the Jaffa, who serve as soldiers and incubators for their young. They also transplanted significant numbers of humans from Earth throughout the galaxy via the Stargate network to serve as slaves and potential hosts. After Ra's rule over Earth {{came to an end}} with a rebellion in the third millennium BC, after which the Stargate was buried in the ground to render it unusable, Earth was largely forgotten and for some reason never revisited; this is possibly because Earth contained no notable natural resources such as naqahdah, and the Goa'uld had already established sustainable human slave populations of sufficient size for genetic diversity elsewhere, obviating the need to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> inconveniently distant planet. Earth passed into legend amongst the human and Jaffa populations of the galaxy, until the 20th century, when the Stargate was discovered and eventually activated.|$|E

25|$|He {{declared}} {{that we were}} without the knowledge of self or anyone else. How we had been made blind, deaf and dumb by this white race of people and how we must <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> people, our God and His religion of peace (Islam), {{the religion of the}} prophets. We must give up the slave names of our slave-masters and accept the name of Allah (God) or one of His divine attributes. He also taught us to give up all evil doings and practices and do righteousness or be destroyed {{from the face of the}} earth. He taught us that the slave-masters had taught us to eat the wrong food and that this wrong food is the cause of our sickness and short span of life. He {{declared that}} he would heal us and set us in heaven at once, if we would submit to Him. Otherwise he would chastise us with a severe chastisement until we did submit. And that He was able to force the whole world into submission to his will. He said that he loved us (the so-called Negroes), his lost and found, so well that he would eat rattlesnakes to free us if necessary, for he has power over all things.|$|E
500|$|A later scene depicts Walter in a {{hospital}} recovering from a gunshot wound. Olivia and William Bell try to smuggle him out. As {{it was a real}} emergency room in a Vancouver hospital, the crew had only one day of shooting. One of the scenes included [...] "monitor acting", in which Torv had to react to a blank computer screen, because the writers had not yet chosen what images they wanted to display. The scene between Olivia, Walter, and Bell was originally set in a coffee shop, but the producers changed their minds when they realized they needed more funding for the finale. Consequently, they began [...] "hawking" [...] the scene in the hopes of gaining a sponsor. KFC responded, agreeing to pay them for shooting the scene at one of their locations. Walternate's office scenes were shot in a mortuary overlooking a cemetery. Goldsman had Joshua Jackson react in different ways during his first meeting with Fauxlivia, including showing [...] "anger and testiness". He ultimately decided he would be [...] "quite taken with her". For the second episode's cliffhanger, the producers worried about making it as [...] "provocative" [...] as the first season's. They were originally going to have Olivia sacrifice herself to allow Peter and Walter's <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>Our</b> Side, but changed their minds when Wyman suggested she be secretly swapped with Fauxlivia instead. Wyman commented, [...] "We were ecstatic when we figured [...] out." [...] Co-creator J.J. Abrams and other cast members were also pleased with it, with Abrams calling it [...] "different, but I think equally impactful." [...] They wrote the cliffhanger before they knew whether the series had been renewed—they would have had to make an [...] "eleventh-hour redraft" [...] had the show been canceled by Fox.|$|E

He has accounted for six enemy aeroplanes and one kite balloon, three of the aeroplanes being destroyed and three driven down out of control.

The Browns, who by the time Ulinski joined as a coach had moved to the National Football League (NFL), won championships in both of Ulinski's first two years as an assistant under Brown.|$|E

2500|$|In 213, Lü Meng {{followed}} Sun Quan to Ruxu (濡須; {{north of}} present-day Wuwei County, Anhui) {{to guard against}} Cao Cao's advances. Sun Quan wanted to construct a dock at Ruxu, but his subordinates said, [...] "We should land {{on the other side}} of the river and attack the enemy, then <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> ships. Why build a dock?" [...] However, Lü Meng supported the idea of building a dock, as he said, [...] "Battles are unpredictable and we might not always win. If we lose and the enemy closes in, and we don't have time to retreat to the riverbank, how can we even board our ships?" [...] Sun Quan agreed with Lü Meng and had the dock constructed to make boardings and landings more convenient. With this, Sun Quan's army defended their positions against Cao Cao's approaching forces, who retreated after several failed attempts to overcome the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|Having been {{approved}} for the Candidates' list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the 1997 general election. He {{was reported to have}} missed out on selection for Ashford in December 1994 after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays. In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for Stafford, a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority. The incumbent Conservative MP, Bill Cash, ran instead in the neighbouring constituency of Stone, where he was re-elected. At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron called for tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to [...] "small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going". He also said the Party [...] "should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements... It's time to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> tax-cutting agenda.
