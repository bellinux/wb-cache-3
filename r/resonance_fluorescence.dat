50|$|There is {{a related}} {{phenomenon}} {{at the level}} of electronic orbitals.

50|$|Due to {{randomness}} of the vacuum-field fluctuations, semiconductor luminescence is incoherent {{whereas the}} {{extensions of the}} SLEs include the possibility to study <b>resonance</b> <b>fluorescence</b> resulting from optical pumping with coherent laser light. At this level, one is often interested to control and access higher-order photon-correlation effects, distinct many-body states, as well as light-semiconductor entanglement.

50|$|In {{resonance}} Raman spectroscopy, {{certain parts}} of molecules can be targeted by adjusting the wavelength of the incident laser beam to the “color” (energy between two desired electron quantum levels) of {{the part of the}} molecule that is being studied. This is known as <b>resonance</b> <b>fluorescence,</b> hence the addition of the term “resonance” to the name “Raman spectroscopy”. Some excited states can be achieved via single or double photon absorption. In these cases however, the use of double photon excitation can be used to attain more information about these excited states than would a single photon absorption. There are some limitations and consequences to both resonance Raman and resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy.|$|E

40|$|Molten {{globules}} (MGs) are compact, partially folded intermediates {{that are}} transiently present during folding of many proteins. These intermediates reside {{on or off}} the folding pathway to native protein. Conformational evolution during folding of off-pathway MGs is largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the denaturant-dependent structure of apoflavodoxin's off-pathway MG. Using single-molecule <b>fluorescence</b> <b>resonance</b> energy transfer (smFRET), we follow conversion of unfolded species into MG down to denaturant concentrations that favor formation of native protein. Under strongly denaturing conditions, <b>fluorescence</b> <b>resonance</b> energy transfer histograms show a single peak, arising from unfolded protein. The smFRET efficiency distribution shifts to higher value upon decreasing denaturant concentration because the MG folds. Strikingly, upon approaching native conditions, the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>resonance</b> energy transfer efficiency of the MG rises above that of native protein. Thus, smFRET exposes the misfolded nature of apoflavodoxin's off-pathway MG. We show that conversion of unfolded into MG protein is a gradual, second-order-like process that simultaneously involves separate regions within the polypeptide...|$|R

An example of light exhibiting sub-Poissonian statistics is squeezed light. Recently researchers have shown that sub-Poissonian light can be induced in a quantum dot exhibiting <b>resonance</b> <b>fluorescence.</b> A technique used to measure the sub-Poissonian structure of light is a homodyne intensity correlation scheme. In this scheme a local oscillator and signal field are superimposed via a beam splitter. The superimposed light is then split by another beam splitter and each signal is recorded by individual photodetectors connected to correlator from which the intensity correlation can be measured. Evidence of the sub-Poissonian nature of light is shown by obtaining a negative intensity correlation as was shown in.|$|E

Koch and his coworkers have concentrated on explaining how the quantum features of light can be described in connection with semiconductors. The novelty and difficulty of this research stems from determining and controlling many-body and quantum-optical features simultaneously. The first step toward this direction emerged {{in the form of the}} semiconductor luminescence equations(abbreviated as SLEs); the SLEs describe the quantum physics where quantum fluctuations of light initiate incoherent light emission from spontaneous recombination of Coulomb-coupled electron-hole pairs. The SLEs not only set the standard in describing quantum-light emission in semiconductors but they are also ideally suited for modeling quantum-light sources and filters based onsemiconductor technology. The extensions of SLEs include <b>resonance</b> <b>fluorescence</b> and higher-order photon-correlation effects and are the basis to expand the quantum-optical spectroscopy.|$|E

In crystalline inorganic semiconductors where an electronic band structure is formed, secondary emission can be more complicated as events may contain both coherent contributions such as resonant Rayleigh scattering where a fixed phase relation with the driving light field is maintained (i.e. energetically elastic processes where no losses are involved), and incoherent contributions (or inelastic modes where some energy channels into an auxiliary loss mode), ...|$|E
