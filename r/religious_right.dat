5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} <b>Religious</b> <b>Right.</b> Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explains}} in outline how <b>religious</b> <b>rights</b> and freedoms are protected in South Africa's transitional constitution. It not only deals with these {{rights and freedoms}} as such, but also with related rights and freedoms which amplify and enhance constitutional entitlements in the religious sphere. The operation of section 14 of the constitution (in which <b>religious</b> <b>rights</b> and freedoms are mentioned by name) and o f related provisions is also discussed {{with reference to the}} operation {{of the bill of rights}} as a whole. The freedom of religion provisions in the constitution are furthermore assessed in view of: a clause proposed as an addendum to a Declaration on <b>Religious</b> <b>Rights</b> and Responsibilities approved and adopted by a National Inter- Faith Conference held under the auspices of the South African Chapter of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, and (to a lesser extent) certain universally accepted standards for the protection of <b>religious</b> <b>rights</b> and freedoms. Specific articles of the Declaration on <b>Religious</b> <b>Rights</b> and Responsibilities itself are also taken into account but the declaration as a whole is not considered. </p...|$|R
25|$|Some leftists and libertarians, {{including}} Christians who disavow the <b>Religious</b> <b>Right,</b> use {{the term}} Christian fascism or Christofascism to describe what some see as an emerging neoconservative proto-fascism or Evangelical nationalism and possible theocratic sentiment in the United States.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, with Ronald Reagan as {{president}} and the growing involvement of the <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> in conservative politics, Goldwater's libertarian views on personal issues were revealed; he {{believed that they were}} an integral part of true conservatism. Goldwater viewed abortion as a matter of personal choice and as such supported abortion rights.|$|E

Fields takes a balanced approach to the issue as he plays the initiative's backers against Nebraskans who oppose the measure, which passed with support from 71% of Nebraska voters. 416 purported to give an objective view of the issue but most reviewers suggested the film was {{highly critical of the}} <b>religious</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

25|$|In August, 2005 the Office of Special Counsel dropped Sternberg's {{religious}} discrimination complaint against the Smithsonian Institution. It {{was determined that}} as an unpaid {{research associate at the}} Smithsonian, Sternberg was not actually an employee, and thus the Office of Special Counsel had no jurisdiction. Nick Matzke, Jason Rosenhouse and other critics have commented that the Office of Special Counsel itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between the <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> and the Republican Party, with George W. Bush appointee James McVay authoring its opinion.|$|E
25|$|After an Interpol alert, Parmar {{was arrested}} while {{attempting}} to enter Germany. Germany chose to handle the case locally rather than hand him over to India. Parmar went on a hunger strike to win his <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> to wear a turban and have vegetarian meals in the Düsseldorf jail. After India received information that Parmar had made assassination threats against Indira Gandhi, they found that Germany had decided that the evidence was weak. They had expelled Parmar and released him to Canada in June 1984 after nearly a year in jail.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Graham {{publicly}} {{endorsed the}} Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. Shortly after, apparently {{in order to}} accommodate Romney who is a Mormon, references to Mormonism as a religious cult ("A cult is any group which teaches doctrines or beliefs that deviate from the biblical message of the Christian faith.") were removed from Graham's website. Observers have questioned whether the support of Republican and <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> politics on issues such as same-sex marriage coming from Graham—who no longer speaks in public or to reporters—in fact reflects the views of his son, Franklin, head of the BGEA. Franklin has denied this, and says that he will continue to act as his father's spokesperson rather than allowing press conferences.|$|E

25|$|Factors {{that have}} been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the United States include {{economic}} and political changes {{at the end of}} the 1970s, as well as burnout from the hedonistic lifestyles led by participants. In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the backlash as implicitly macho and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures. The backlash also made its way into US politics with the election of conservative Ronald Reagan in 1980 which also lead to Republican control of the United States Senate for the first time since 1954 plus the subsequent rise of the <b>Religious</b> <b>Right</b> around the same time.|$|E
25|$|National Republicans such as Richard Nixon {{began to}} develop their Southern {{strategy}} to attract conservative white Southerners, especially {{the middle class and}} suburban voters, in addition to migrants from the North and traditional GOP pockets in Appalachia. The transition to a Republican stronghold in the South took decades. First, the states started voting Republican in presidential elections, except for native sons Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. Then the states began electing Republican senators and finally governors. Georgia was the last state to do so, with Sonny Perdue taking the governorship in 2002. In addition to its middle class and business base, Republicans cultivated the <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> and attracted strong majorities from the evangelical or Fundamentalist vote, mostly Southern Baptists, which had not been a distinct political force prior to 1980.|$|E
25|$|Owing {{largely to}} the {{prominence}} of the <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> in conservative politics in the United States, the Republican Party has taken positions regarded by many as outwardly hostile to the gay rights movement. Republicans have historically strongly opposed same-sex marriage (the party's overall attitude on civil unions is much more divided, with some in favor and others opposed), with the issue a galvanizing one that many believe helped George W. Bush win re-election in 2004. In both 2004 and 2006, congressional Republican leaders promoted the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment which would legally restrict the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples. In both attempts, the amendment failed to secure enough votes to invoke cloture, and thus, ultimately was never passed. As more states legalized same-sex marriage in the 2010s, Republicans increasingly supported allowing each state to decide its own marriage policy.|$|E
