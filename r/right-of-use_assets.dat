Banking institutions are not only preparers of financial statements as lessees and lessors, but are also users of financial statements that analyze and depend on such statements of customers. In fact, credit officers at banking institutions probably make up the largest group of users of financial statements that will be affected by the ED. The most significant part of the ED affects lessees, and is the requirement to record <b>right-of-use</b> <b>assets</b> and lease liabilities for virtually all leases with terms longer than twelve months. These requirements will change key metrics used to analyze both a lessees ’ financial position and its financial performance if those metrics are derived strictly off of amounts recorded on the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. The requirements will naturally present operational challenges to any organization in the U. S. that leases property or equipment due to the need to set up and continuously account for the new assets and liabilities, as well as to auditors and users of financial statements who must understand the new and ongoing complexities. The ED also proposes to eliminate leveraged lease accounting for lessors. Current U. S. GAA...|$|E
50|$|For an {{operating}} lease, a liability and a <b>right-of-use</b> <b>asset</b> {{are set up}} at lease inception, at {{the present value of}} the rents plus any guaranteed residual. To the asset is added any initial direct costs and subtracted any lease incentives (such as a tenant improvement allowance). The liability is amortized using the interest method (like a mortgage). If the lease has the same rent over its life, the net asset at any point is equal to the liability, plus the unamortized balance of initial direct costs and lease incentives. If the rents change during the lease term, the difference between the cash rent and average rent is added to or subtracted from the asset as well.|$|R

S. based Financial Accounting Standards Board {{published}} a revised exposure draft that proposes significant changes to lease accounting under U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). One change involves the lessee recognizing a <b>right-of-use</b> <b>asset</b> and related lease liability for all leases, including those currently classified as operating leases. This case {{requires students to}} consider the impact that the proposed leasing standard will have on a lessee’s balance sheet. In addition, the case addresses how such an accounting change creates challenges for management who operate under a plethora of contracts based on accounting numbers determined by the accounting standards. Lastly, the case introduces an ethical dilemma faced by accountants of a hypothetical public company. Students are asked to reflect on this ethical dilemma {{with the help of}} the Institute of Management Accountant’s (IMA’s) Statement of Ethical Professional Practice...|$|R
