40|$|Due to high {{installation}} costs and relatively low output, the active use of solar energy is limited. The output from a collector {{can be improved}} e. g. by using a selective absorber, AR-treated cover glass or transparent insulation. The output/cost ratio can also be improved {{by the use of}} reflectors. The performance of a collector depends highly on the incidence angle dependent optical efficiency. In this report, detailed methods for measuring the optical efficiency is developed. In order to evaluate the performance of a collector, measurements are needed. For the evaluations in this work, a dynamic test method has been used. The collector output is modelled as: = h 0 bKta(Q) Ib + h 0 dId – kDT - (mC) e(dTf/dtð) where h 0 is the optical efficiency, I the irradiance, k the heat loss factor, DT the temperature difference between collector and ambient air, and (mC) e the effective collector thermal capacitance. Kta(Q) is a modifier accounting for the dependence of varying incidence angles during the day. It is often modelled as: Kta(Q) = 1 - b 0 (1 /cos(Q) - 1) where b 0 is the “incidence angle modifier coefficient”. In order to evaluate the energy output from different collector types, measurements were made on a number of collector prototypes. In the analysis, the collector parameters were identified by MLR on the measured data. In order to verify the determined parameters, the modelled output was compared with the measured output. The annual energy output was then estimated by using the collector parameters in the simulation program MINSUN. In one study in the work, the incidence angle dependence of the absorptance was investigated by outdoor testing. The tested absorbers had coatings of nickel-pigmented aluminum oxide (Ni-Al 2 O 3), and sputtered nickel/nickel oxide (Ni-NiOx). The results showed that the Ni-Al 2 O 3 absorber has a slightly better performance than the Ni-NiOx absorber at high incidence angles. In another study, detailed comparative tests were made on different glazings in order to study the influence of AR treatment on the collector output. The tests indicated that the AR treatment can increase the annual output by 9 % (at Top = 50 °C). Usually a structured glass is installed with the structures facing the absorber. The evaluation indicates, however, that facing the structure outwards can increase the annual performance by 4 %. A detailed study showed that the b 0 factor generally depends on the incidence angle. MaReCo collectors are studied in the work. This is a reflector collector, specially designed for northern latitudes. The MaReCo principally consists of an asymmetric reflector trough with a single, double-sided selective, absorber that runs along the trough. The purpose of the MaReCo is to replace the collector box, insulation, and some of the absorber material by a reflector. The standard MaReCo has an acceptance angle interval of 20 ° - 65 °, outside which the reflector is not active and the absorber only works with radiation direct from the sun. The MaReCo concept is flexible and can be used for stand-alone as well as building integrated applications. Several MaReCo prototypes have been tested in the work. The estimated yearly energy output at 50 °C from a stand-alone MaReCo with Teflon and from a Roof-MaReCo, both at a tilt of 30 °, were 282 and 336 kWh/m² respectively. The Spring/Fall-MaReCo is a special version that has a low optical efficiency during the summer. In this way, a larger collector area can be installed for increasing the solar fraction of the system without increasing the risk of overheating. The test results estimate a yearly energy output of 222 kWh/m² from this collector. For an asymmetric collector (e. g. the MaReCo), the incidence angle dependence will be different in different directions. The angular analysis then has to be made in two perpendicular planes (longitudinal and transverse) of the collector. In the transverse plane, not only the properties of glass and absorber affect the output, but also the reflectivity and shape of the reflector. In order to handle this, a biaxial incidence angle modifier should be used. One example is the common “product model”: Kta(Q) = KL(QL, 0) KT(0,QT). Shortcomings of this model are that it is not correct for plane collectors and that it is not defined for concentrators where normal incidence is outside the acceptance interval. In this work, a new expression for a biaxial incidence angle modifier is suggested: Kta = fL(Q) gTL(QT). The factor fL(Q) gives information about the influence of the glazing and gTL(QT) accounts for the influence of the reflector. This expression differs in principle from the product model, since QL is not used. In order to study the suggested model, measurements were made on MaReCo collectors. The “no-loss efficiency” was determined by eliminating the effect of heat losses from the measured output. The factor fL(Q) was decided from measurements in the L direction made around the equinox (when QT is constant). The factor FT(QT) was determined from measurements in the T direction for constant QL. In order to keep QL constant, the collector was rotated to a north/south direction. The results were then used to calculate the <b>reflector</b> <b>factor,</b> gTL(QT), as the ratio FT(QT) /fL(QT). The parameters were then used to model the energy output. The analyses indicate that the new suggested biaxial expression can be used to model the collector output for asymmetric collectors where the standard model does not work. One drawback of the method is, however, that it requires measurements to be made around either spring or autumn equinox. The new suggested model has also been tested for modelling the angular performance of PV modules with concentrators...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{approaches}} to solar heating and {{hot water system}} configurations were studied, parametrizing the number and location of the dampers, the number and location of the fans, the interface locations with the furnace, the size and type of subsystems, and operating modes. A two-pass air-heating collector was selected based on efficiency and ease of installation. Also, an energy transport module was designed to compactly contain all the mechanical and electrical control components. System performance calculations were carried out over a heating season for the tentative site location at Tunkhnana, Pa.

40|$|The {{case of a}} {{parabolic}} reflector and a point feed is considered, {{taking into account the}} question regarding the location in which the feed should be placed for an achievement of maximum directivity. Based on the tracing of geometrical rays, the obvious answer is obtained that the feed should be placed at the focal point. In the present paper, it is shown that this answer is not always correct. There are situations in which the maximum directivity is achieved when the feed is axially displaced toward the reflector or away from it. This 'focal shift' phenomenon is a result of three competing factors which affect the directivity of a <b>reflector.</b> The <b>factors</b> are related to phase synchronism over the reflector aperture, aperture illumination efficiency, and spillover loss. For achieving the maximum directivity, it is necessary to find the best compromise among the three factors...|$|R
40|$|Very high {{frequency}} deep radio sounding systems for ice thickness measurements are practically the only useful apparatuses for large scale radar flight surveys in polar regions. The morphology {{of the bottom}} surface of an Antarctic floating ice tongue, in the Ross Sea area, East Antarctica, was studied using the arrival times of signal echoes of the radio sounding system. The amplitude variations of radar signals from the reflecting surface were analyzed to determine the gain or {{the loss of the}} reflectors. Such surfaces show quasi-parabolic geometrical shapes at the ice/water interface with both concave and convex faces towards the sounding system. Electromagnetic analysis performed on radar echoes indicates that amplitude variations detected by the antenna are focusing or defocusing effects only due to the <b>reflector's</b> shape. A <b>factor</b> in the radar equation that represents the surface shape when coherent reflectors are involved is introduced. This factor allows us to determine more precisely the morphology and electromagnetic characteristics of the interface between the media investigated by means of radio echo sounding...|$|R

40|$|In {{a linear}} Fresnel {{reflector}} field, parallel rows of reflectors in a collector direct the incident sun rays towards a common linear receiver. Some portion of reflector aperture remains unused due to end effect, inter-row shading and blocking. In {{addition to these}} factors, cosine effect, cleanliness <b>factor,</b> reflectivity of <b>reflectors,</b> intercept <b>factor,</b> transmissivity of receiver cover, reflectivity of secondary reflector, absorptivity of absorber tube and thermal losses are other {{factors that contribute to}} energy losses and thus affect net energy collection by the heat transfer fluid in the absorber, electricity generation and cost of electricity. Conventionally, the collectors are oriented either along North South or East West directions in most cases. However the energy collection, electricity generation and cost of electricity need to be found out for all possible collector-orientations lying between North South and East West. This can be used in designing collectors for places where the available land strip does not align with any of these two directions. In this work, explicit analytical expressions for energy losses due to cosine effect, end effect, shading and blocking are derived for any desired time interval as functions of length (L) and width (w) of aperture of reflector-row, spacing between adjacent reflector-rows (p), number of reflector-rows in a collector (n), height of receiver (H), collector-orientation angle (52) and location. The expressions for the net energy collected by the working fluid, electricity generated by a collector and the cost of electricity are presented. The effects of L, w, p, n, H, Omega and location on energy losses, net energy collection by fluid, electricity generation and cost of electricity are studied. The minimum cost of electricity is found out for different collector-orientations at various locations and relative comparisons have been made. The corresponding collector parameters, annual energy collection by fluid and the annual electricity generation are also found out. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Deep crustal reflections, {{appearing}} at two-way times of 6 – 20 s, are characterised by a low signal-to-noise ratio and a low-frequency content (˜ 5 – 30 Hz). Optimising {{the visibility of}} these reflections requires that: 1. (1) the source energy be concentrated in this band; 2. (2) the receiver be as long as practically possible; 3. (3) the shot spacing be as snail as possible. An airgun array simulation program was used to investigate the effect of operating a 10 -gun array at different depths. It predicted that the source energy could be enhanced at low frequencies by running the gun array at depths of up to 25 m, which would improve the signal-to-noise ratio for deep <b>reflectors</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 2 relative to the same array at 7. 5 m depth {{at the expense of}} some loss of temporal resolution. The receiver length was limited to 4. 4 km by the number of cable sections available and the maximum tension allowable in the cable. It was configured as 88 channels of 50 m length. To reduce the shot spacing, minimise the tow noise and reduce tension in the cable, the ship speed was reduced to 4 knots. A cable depth of 20 m was chosen to reduce sea state noise and keep the receiver ghost notch frequency outside the frequency band of interest. A variety of operational problems was encountered. Fish bites holed 50 % of the total cable inventory and cable sections were damaged when they sank below their maximum rated depth after being holed. Shot-generated noise was the limiting factor in deep water. Despite these problems, useful data were obtained over the Lord Howe Rise, Dampier Ridge, Gippsland Basin margin and the deep abyssal plain and the survey demonstrated the use of an airgun array tuned for maximum energy...|$|R
