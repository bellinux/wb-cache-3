The spectral distribution of the solar simulator is as important as hard to control properly, especially for flash simulators often used for large modules and production lines. Knowing this spectral distribution allows to calculate the spectral mismatch. The spectral distribution of the solar simulator is the quantity least known in this procedure. For radiometric measurement a guideline exists [1], which excludes the special case of flash lamp measurements. For flash solar simulators it is more difficult to determine the spectral distribution. To measure the spectral distribution of such a flash pulse, single monochromator diode array spectroradiometers (SMDAS) are commonly used. The knowledge of the timing behaviour of SMDAS diode arrays and readout electronics is important for a spectroradiometric measurement of flash pulses. In this paper we discuss these properties in detail...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to find {{statistical}} relationships between the concentrations of accessory pigments in natural populations of marine phytoplankton and the absolute levels and spectral distributions of underwater irradiance. To this end, empirical data sets from some 600 stations {{in different parts of}} the seas and oceans were analysed. These data were obtained from the authors' own research and from the Internet's bio-optical data base. They included the vertical distributions of the concentrations of various pigments (identified chromatographically) and the vertical and spectral distributions of the underwater irradiance measured in situ or determined indirectly from bio-optical models. The analysis covered a total of some 4000 points illustrating the dependence of pigment concentration on underwater irradiance characteristics, corresponding to different depths in the sea.

This absorbed short-wave radiation (&#x 03 BB; * (z)). Analysis of the relationships between the concentrations of particular photosynthetic pigments (PSP), i. e. chlorophyll b, chlorophyll c, photosynthetic carotenoids (PSC), and the underwater irradiance characteristics indicated that these concentrations were only slightly dependent on the absolute level of irradiance E 0 (&#x 03 BB;), but that they depended strongly on the <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> of this irradiance f (&#x 03 BB;) = E 0 (&#x 03 BB;) / PAR 0. The relevant approximate statistical relationships between the relative concentrations of particular PSP and the function of spectral fitting F j, averaged in the layer &#x 0394; z, were derived. Certain statistical relationships between the pigment composition of the phytoplankton and the irradiance field characteristics are due to the photo- and chromatic acclimation of natural populations of marine phytoplankton.

Although there are some recent exceptions (Beigpour et al. 2014.

However, many scenes contain multiple illuminants with differing SPDs, and we investigate the effect this has on automatic colour balancing. Somewhat surprisingly, the Gehler-Shi data set of 568 images, which is widely used in evaluating competing illumination-estimation methods, contains many images of multiple-illuminant scenes: for example, indoor scenes that also include a window through which daylight is visible.

40|$|In Herschel {{images of}} the Galactic plane and many star forming regions, a major factor {{limiting}} our ability to extract faint compact sources is cirrus confusion noise, operationally defined as the "statistical error to be expected in photometric measurements due to confusion in a background of fluctuating surface brightness". The histogram of the flux densities of extracted sources shows a distinctive faint-end cutoff below which the catalog suffers from incompleteness and the flux densities become unreliable. This empirical cutoff should be {{closely related to the}} estimated cirrus noise and we show that this is the case. We compute the cirrus noise directly, both on Herschel images from which the bright sources have been removed and on simulated images of cirrus with statistically similar fluctuations. We connect these direct estimates with those from power spectrum analysis, which has been used extensively to predict the cirrus noise and provides insight into how it depends on various statistical properties and photometric operational parameters. We report multi-wavelength power spectra of diffuse Galactic dust emission from Hi-GAL observations at 70 to 500 microns within Galactic plane fields at l= 30 degrees and l= 59 degrees. We find that the exponent of the power spectrum is about - 3. At 250 microns, the amplitude of the power spectrum increases roughly as the square of the median brightness of the map and so the expected cirrus noise scales linearly with the median brightness.
