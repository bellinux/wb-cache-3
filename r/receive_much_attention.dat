5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to <b>receive</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E

It was developed in the Soviet Union in the mid-1960s, but didn't <b>receive</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> until the discovery of Karmarkar's algorithm, after which affine scaling was reinvented multiple times and presented as a simplified version of Karmarkar's. Affine scaling amounts to doing gradient descent steps within the feasible region, while rescaling the problem to make sure the steps move toward the optimum faster.|$|E

While a few critics praised the book, it did not <b>receive</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention.</b> This changed with the publication in 1992 of Kenan's second book, {{a collection of short}} stories titled Let the Dead Bury Their Dead. The stories, based in the fictional community of Tims Creek, focused on (among other things) what it meant to be poor, black, and gay in the southern United States. The book was hailed as a revival of classic southern literature and was nominated for the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Fiction, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and was named a New York Times Notable Book. The short story collection also brought renewed attention to his first novel, which was likewise set in Tims Creek.|$|E

500|$|Henry's reign did not <b>receive</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> from historians {{for many}} years after the 1950s: no {{substantial}} biographies of Henry were written after Powicke's, and the historian John Beeler observed in the 1970s that the coverage of Henry's reign by military historians remained particularly thin. At {{the end of the}} 20th century, there was a renewed interest in 13th-century English history, resulting in the publication of various specialist works on aspects of Henry's reign, including government finance and the period of Henry's minority. Current historiography notes both Henry's positive and negative qualities: historian David Carpenter judges Henry to have been a decent man, who failed as a ruler because of his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform, a theme echoed by Huw Ridgeway, who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court, but who considers him to have been [...] "essentially a man of peace, kind and merciful".|$|E
500|$|Seltmann and Chater did not {{initially}} think that Since I Left You would <b>receive</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention.</b> However, the album garnered widespread critical acclaim {{from the music}} industry. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 89, based on 21 reviews. It {{became one of the}} best reviewed albums of 2001, as well as being the highest rated dance album on that site. The album peaked in the top30 on the ARIA Albums Chart and number12 in Norway on the VG-lista Top40 Albums Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, the Avalanches won four awards from nine nominations, including Breakthrough Artist – Album, Best Dance Release and Producer of the Year (for Chater and Seltmann aka Bobbydazzler) for Since I Left You. The fourth award win was for the related single, [...] "Frontier Psychiatrist" [...] as Breakthrough Artist – Single.|$|E
500|$|Paolini and {{his family}} toured across the United States {{promoting}} the book. Over 135 talks were given at bookshops, libraries, and schools, many with Paolini dressed up in a medieval costume; but the book did not <b>receive</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention.</b> Paolini said he [...] "would stand behind a table in my costume talking all day without a break– and would sell maybe forty books in eight hours if I did really well. [...] It was a very stressful experience. I couldn't have gone on for very much longer." [...] In the summer of 2002, American novelist Carl Hiaasen was on vacation {{in one of the}} cities that Paolini gave a talk in. While there, Hiaasen's stepson bought a copy of Eragon that he [...] "immediately loved". He showed it to Hiaasen, who brought the book {{to the attention of the}} publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, contacted Paolini {{and his family}} to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish Eragon. The answer was yes, and after another round of editing, Knopf published Eragon in August 2003, with a new cover, drawn by John Jude Palencar.|$|E

500|$|Soon after {{recording}} the demo, Ivers left My Bloody Valentine and Conway's girlfriend, Tina Durkin, joined as a keyboard player. Around this time, Conway, on {{the suggestion of}} Shields, contacted Gavin Friday, the lead vocalist of the post-punk band Virgin Prunes. According to Shields, Conway approached Friday in Finglas, asked him for advice and was told to [...] "get out of Dublin." [...] Shields agreed with the advice, commenting in January 1991 that [...] "there {{was no room for}} us" [...] in Ireland; Ó Cíosóig explained that the Irish music scene was not receptive to their style. Friday provided the band with contacts that secured them a show in Tilburg, Netherlands. The band relocated to the Netherlands after the show and lived there for a further nine months, opening for R.E.M. on one occasion on 8 April 1984. Due to a lack of opportunities and a lack of correct documentation, the band relocated to West Berlin, Germany in late 1984 and recorded their debut mini album, This Is Your Bloody Valentine (1985). The album failed to <b>receive</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> and the band returned temporarily to the Netherlands, before settling in London, United Kingdom in the middle of 1985.|$|E
500|$|T.C. {{was portrayed}} by Rodney Van Johnson from July 5, 1999 to June 19, 2007; Johnson was dropped to {{recurring}} status in December 2006 before his last appearance in June 2007. On March 19, 2001, Jerry Gaona played the character in flashbacks. Once T. C. was developed beyond {{the role of}} [...] "the angry black man" [...] and {{it became clear that}} the contents of his secret shed were not important to the plot, Johnson felt that his presence in the show was dramatically reduced. After being reduced to the status of a recurring cast member, he expressed doubt that he would return to the show in its final episodes. T.C.'s relationship with Eve, and Johnson's chemistry with Ross, did not <b>receive</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> from the fans or the media. Other Passions cast members and representatives commented on the preference for Julian over T.C.; Masters said his character Julian should [...] "just kick T.C. out of his house" [...] and beat him with a 4x4, and a spokesperson from the show pushed Julian and Eve's romance to the forefront as [...] "a new supercouple in Harmony" [...] without any mention of T.C. Internationally, T. C. received a more positive response. African newspaper Mmegi said Johnson was invited to the 2005 Miss Culture and Heritage contest in Botswana due to his performance of T.C. as a [...] "husband and father in the soap that warms the hearts of many in different countries".|$|E
500|$|As one of {{a series}} of minor PC {{releases}} from the small publisher Softdisk, Keen Dreams did not <b>receive</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> from contemporary reviewers or players, despite its connection to the Commander Keen series. Accordingly, it has since been marketed as the [...] "lost episode" [...] of the series. As it fell between the 1990 episodes 1–3 of the Vorticon trilogy, and the 1991 episodes 4–5 of Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy, Keen Dreams has also been informally referred to as [...] "Episode 3.5" [...] of the series. Keen Dreams was included with the other series games in the 1996 id Anthology compilation release, but as the game had not been published through Apogee, Keen Dreams was not included in the 1998 Apogee Commander Keen compilation release or the 2014 3D Realms Anthology release. In June 2013, however, developer Super Fighter Team licensed the game from Flat Rock Software, the then-owners of Softdisk, and released a version for Android devices. The following September, an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign was started to attempt to buy the rights from Flat Rock for US$1500 in order to release the source code to the game and start publishing it on multiple platforms; while the campaign did not reach the goal, the creator Javier Chavez made up the difference, and the source code was released soon after. The game was then published on Steam through the Steam Greenlight program by Hard Disk Publishing for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux, with Steam achievements and multiple graphical options. According to Steam Spy, approximately 80,000 copies have been sold through Steam as of June 2016.|$|E
