40|$|The {{data type}} bigfloat is the high-precision {{floating}} point type of LEDA. A bigfloat is {{a number of the}} form s. 2 "e where s and e are integers. s is called the significant or mantissa and e is called the exponent. Arithmetic on bigfloats is governed by two parameters: the mantissa length and the rounding mode. Both parameters can either be set globally or for a single operation. The arithmetic on bigfloats works as follows: first the exact result of an operation is computed and then the mantissa is rounded to the prescribed number of digits as dictated by the rounding mode. The available rounding modes are TONEAREST (round to the nearest representable number), TOPINF (<b>round</b> <b>upwards),</b> TONINF (round downwards), TOZERO (round towards zero), TOINF (round away from zero) and EXACT. The latter mode only applies to addition, substraction and multiplication. In this mode the presicion parameter is ignored and no rounding takes place. Since the exponents of bigfloats are arbitrary integers (type integer) arithmetic operations never underflow or overflow. However, exceptions (division by zero, square root of a negative number) may occur. They are handled according of the IEEE floating point standard, e. g. 5 / 0 evaluates to #infinity#, - 5 / 0 evaluates to -#infinity#, + #infinity# + 5 evaluates to +#infinity# and 0 / 0 evaluates to NaN (=not a number). This report is structured as follows. Section 2 defines the bigfloat through its manual page and the remaining sections contain the implementation. The implementation is split into files bigfloat. h and bigfloat. c. (orig.)

50|$|The {{standard}} specifies how speed ratings {{should be}} {{reported by the}} camera.

The rationale is that exposure according to the lower saturation-based speed would not result in a visibly better image. In addition, an exposure latitude can be specified, ranging from the saturation-based speed to the 10:1 noise-based speed. If the noise-based speed (40:1) is lower than the saturation-based speed, or undefined because of high noise, the saturation-based speed is specified, <b>rounded</b> <b>upwards</b> to a standard value, because using the noise-based speed would lead to overexposed images.

The Book of Jeremiah reports that a total of 4600 were exiled to Babylon.

The Book of Kings also suggests that it was 8000. Israel Finkelstein, a prominent archaeologist, suggests that the 4600 represented the heads of households and 8000 was the total, and 10,000 is a <b>rounding</b> <b>upwards</b> of the second number. [...] Jeremiah also hints that an equivalent number may have fled to Egypt. Given such figures, Finkelstein suggests that three fourths of the Judahite population had remained in Judah.|$|R
40|$|Summary: A {{hardware}} unit for interval arithmetic (including division by an interval that contains zero) {{is described in}} this paper. After a brief introduction an instruction set for interval arithmetic is defined which is attractive from the mathematical point of view. These instructions consist of the basic arithmetic operations and comparisons for intervals including the relevant lattice operations. To enable high speed, the case selections for interval multiplication (9 cases) and interval division (14 cases) are done in hardware. The lower bound of the result is computed with rounding downwards and the upper bound with <b>rounding</b> <b>upwards</b> by parallel units simultaneously. The rounding mode must {{be an integral part}} of the arithmetic operation. Also the basic comparisons for intervals together with the corresponding lattice operations and the result selection in more complicated cases of multiplication and division are done in hardware. There they are executed by parallel units simultaneously. The circuits described in this paper show that with modest additional hardware costs interval arithmetic can be made almost as fast as simple floating-point arithmetic. ...|$|R

Using a sample of 16, 598 loan tranches signed by US borrowers between January 1988 and December 2010, this study explores the determinants of such interest rate clustering in the corporate syndicated loan market. We postulate that lead arrangers <b>round</b> spreads <b>upwards</b> because of the uncertainty about the riskiness of the borrowers. Consistent with this negotiation hypothesis, we find that clustering increases with the degree of uncertainty, e. g. the degree of information asymmetry between the lead arranger and the borrower. In contrast, clustering is less likely when lead arrangers have acquired information about the borrower through prior interactions. Finally, the fear of reputation loss incentivizes the most reputable lead arrangers to price loans at more competitive non-rounded spreads...|$|R
