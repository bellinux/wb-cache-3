25|$|The use of heparin {{following}} {{surgery is}} common {{if there are}} no issues with bleeding. Generally, a <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> is required, as all anticoagulants lead to an increased risk of bleeding. In people admitted to hospital, thrombosis is a major cause for complications and occasionally death. In the UK, for instance, the Parliamentary Health Select Committee heard in 2005 that the annual rate of death due to thrombosis was 25,000, with at least 50% of these being hospital-acquired. Hence thromboprophylaxis (prevention of thrombosis) is increasingly emphasized. In patients admitted for surgery, graded compression stockings are widely used, and in severe illness, prolonged immobility and in all orthopedic surgery, professional guidelines recommend low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administration, mechanical calf compression or (if all else is contraindicated and the patient has recently suffered deep vein thrombosis) the insertion of a vena cava filter. In patients with medical rather than surgical illness, LMWH too is known to prevent thrombosis, and in the United Kingdom the Chief Medical Officer has issued guidance to the effect that preventative measures should be used in medical patients, in anticipation of formal guidelines.|$|E
40|$|The Australian Defence Force (ADF) {{has used}} {{mefloquine}} for malaria chemoprophylaxis since 1990. Mefloquine {{has been found}} to be a plausible cause of a chronic central nervous system toxicity syndrome and a confounding factor in the diagnosis of existing neuropsychiatric illnesses prevalent in the ADF such as posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Overall health risks appear to have been mitigated by restricting the drug’s use; however serious risks were realised when significant numbers of ADF personnel were subjected to clinical trials involving the drug. The full extent of the exposure, health impacts for affected individuals, and consequences for ADF health management including mental health are not yet known, but mefloquine may have caused or aggravated neuropsychiatric illness in large numbers of patients who were subsequently misdiagnosed and mistreated or otherwise failed to receive proper care. Findings in relation to chronic mefloquine neurotoxicity were foreseeable, but this eventuality appears not to have been considered during <b>risk-benefit</b> analyses. Thorough <b>analysis</b> by the ADF would have identified this long-term risk as well as other qualitative risk factors. Historical exposure of ADF personnel to mefloquine neurotoxicity now also necessitates ongoing risk monitoring and management in the overall context of broader health policies...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} Texas elementary principals' level of computer technology use and their leadership in technology integration activities as defined by the National Educational Technology Standards for Administrators (NETS*A). Additionally the study addressed technology implementation as an innovation and used the literature concerning change and innovation models to identify organizational and personal factors that might affect the level of technology use and the leadership behaviors. Survey data retrieved from 216 Texas elementary public school principals led to the formation of the following conclusions. The elementary principals involved this study reported high level computer technology use, especially with the computer tools involving communication. Principals also reported high level leadership performance to the NETS*A standards. Multiple analyses of variance (MANOVA) revealed no significant difference in mean scores between the dependent variables of computer use or leadership performance to the NETS*A standards and the independent variables including the organizational factors of school location, district spending per student, campus minority status, and campus Title I status. A regression analysis revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between principals' computer technology use and personal variables of training and perceived <b>risk-benefit.</b> Another regression <b>analysis</b> revealed a statistically significant relationship between principals' technology leadership performance to the NETS*A standards and personal variables of training, perceived risk-benefit and perceived pressure to implement technology. Multiple regression analyses revealed no correlation between the dependent variables of technology use and technology leadership. A correlation analysis revealed a weak correlation between the two dependent variables with less than 4 % of the variance explained by that relationship. There is a need for continuing research examining possible relationships between principals' technology use, their technology leadership behaviors, and the degree of technology integration in their schools. The findings from this study could be used by principal preparation programs to focus on technology integration training and personal factors that may affect principals' technology leadership behavior and technology use...|$|R

5000|$|During World War II, Fort Detrick in Maryland was the {{headquarters}} of US biological warfare experiments. Operation Whitecoat involved the injection of infectious agents into military forces to observe their effects in human subjects. Subsequent human experiments in the United States have also been characterized as unethical. They were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, consent, or informed consent of the test subjects. Public outcry over the discovery of government experiments on human subjects led to numerous congressional investigations and hearings, including the Church Committee, Rockefeller Commission, and Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, amongst others. The Tuskegee syphilis experiment, {{widely regarded as the}} [...] "most infamous biomedical research study in U.S. history," [...] was performed from 1932 to 1972 by the Tuskegee Institute contracted by the United States Public Health Service. The study followed more than 600 African-American men who were not told they had syphilis and were denied access to the known treatment of penicillin. This led to the 1974 National Research Act, to provide for protection of human subjects in experiments. The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was established and was tasked with establishing the boundary between research and routine practice, the role of <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis,</b> guidelines for participation, and the definition of informed consent.

40|$|This thesis explores several {{guidelines}} regarding <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> {{in clinical}} research, how some investigators apply these guidelines and concludes that lacunas in both guidance and practice can be observed. <b>Risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> {{appears to be}} a difficult task in clinical research. Further, given its necessity for decision-making and its complexity in execution, this thesis explores how we must understand <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis.</b> Because of its natural roots, a discussion is started to come to a utilitarian interpretation of <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis.</b> Two modified features are articulated to meet the practice in clinical research. First, pain and pleasure from classical (hedonistic) utilitarianism are abandoned and replaced by Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs). Second, a constraint on the maximum allowable risks is introduced in order to avoid participants from being sacrificed in experimentation. After having presented a most plausible version of a utilitarian interpretation of <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis,</b> a substantial package of criticism remains.

40|$|Summary: Background: The {{management}} of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) remains controversial. The international study of UIAs (ISUIA) found {{low rates of}} rupture and appreciable treatment risks, which can be interpreted that many UIAs should not be treated. Results of endovascular coiling of 131 patients with UIAs are presented along with a <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> based on patient and aneurysm characteristics. Patients and methods: From December 1996 to September 2005, 131 patients (93 women and 38 men, mean age 51 years) with 151 UIAs were treated using detachable coil embolisation. Data on procedural complications, patient and aneurysm characteristics, clinical and radiological follow-up were entered into a prospectively collected database. A <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed. Results: Endovascular treatment was successful in 145 (96 %) aneurysms. One aneurysm ruptured intraoperatively with a fatal outcome. Ten thromboembolic events occurred, leaving one patient moderately disabled. The combined morbidity and mortality rate at 6 months per patient is 1, 5 % (95 % confidence interval: 0, 07 - 5, 7 %). <b>Risk-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> comparing these data with published natural history suggests that treatment with low complication rates can be offered to most patients with UIAs.
