25|$|On March 18, 2016, California State Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez of the Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management {{conducted}} {{a hearing in}} which first responders were to share details of {{the response to the}} attack and possible aspects that could be improved on. During the hearing, Michael Madden, a lieutenant with the San Bernardino Police Department {{and one of the first}} responders to respond to the Inland Regional Center, <b>requested</b> <b>state</b> aid in encrypting police radio channels. He explained that police communications were playing out real-time across the U.S. during the attack, being broadcast on YouTube and other network systems. According to Madden, this put first responders at risk, as potential suspects could have been monitoring the communications and tracking the actions of law enforcement. He added that the City of San Bernardino, as well as San Bernardino County, were moving towards a radio system that will incorporate encrypted frequencies.|$|E
25|$|By 1964, Henrico County was {{planning}} a circumferential highway {{in the western}} part of the county, and county officials <b>requested</b> <b>state</b> aid for the new Parham Road circumferential. Construction of the new Parham Road began between 1965 and 1967 and was completed in 1968. The work consisted of new construction from just south of Quioccasin Road to the intersection of Three Chopt Road and existing Parham Road and from just west of US 250 to the intersection of US 1 and SR 73. Existing Parham Road was expanded from Three Chopt Road to US 250; in addition, Ridge Road was expanded from the present Ridge RoadParham Road intersection south of SR 6 to Quioccasin Road. Parham Road was extended south as a two-lane road from Ridge Road to River Road by 1971. On the opposite end of the highway, the highway was extended east from I-95 to US 301 and SR 2 and the I-95 interchange was expanded to a full cloverleaf in 1978. The ChippenhamParham Connector was proposed as early as 1972. Its course from Forest Hill Avenue south of the James River to Parham Road at Ridge Road was approved in 1984; the section from River Road to the southern end of the four-lane portion of Parham Road would be constructed by Henrico County. The cross-James portion of SR 150 and the four-lane connecting portion of Parham Road were completed in 1990.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} the Abduction Convention is to cause the prompt return of a child {{to his or her}} [...] "habitual residence." [...] In certain exceptional cases under Article 13b, the court's mandatory return obligation is changed to a discretionary obligation, specifically, [...] "the judicial or administrative authority of the <b>requested</b> <b>State</b> is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation." [...] It {{is important to note that}} the duty to return a child is not abrogated by a finding under Art. 13(b) but merely changes from mandatory to discretionary. Since the general intent of the Convention is to cause the return of a child to his or her [...] "habitual residence," [...] unless there are some powerful and compelling reasons otherwise the court is normally and routinely expected to exercise its discretion and return the child to his or her [...] "habitual residence".|$|E
5000|$|Through the {{extradition}} process, {{a sovereign}} (the requesting state) typically makes a formal request to another sovereign (the <b>requested</b> <b>state).</b> If the fugitive is {{found within the}} territory of the <b>requested</b> <b>state,</b> then the <b>requested</b> <b>state</b> may arrest the fugitive and subject him or her to its extradition process.

50|$|Extradition is the {{mechanism}} by which one sovereign requests and obtains custody of a fugitive located within the jurisdiction and control of another sovereign. It is an ancient mechanism, dating back to at least the thirteenth century BCE, when an Egyptian Pharaoh negotiated an extradition treaty with a Hittite King. Through the extradition process, a sovereign (the requesting state) typically makes a formal request to another sovereign (the <b>requested</b> <b>state).</b> If the fugitive is found within {{the territory of the}} <b>requested</b> <b>state,</b> then the <b>requested</b> <b>state</b> may arrest the fugitive and subject him or her to its extradition process. The extradition procedures to which the fugitive will be subjected are dependent on the law and practice of the <b>requested</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} secure the {{confiscation}} of the instruments and proceeds from crime, the Convention provides two forms of international co-operation.

50|$|The {{consensus}} {{in international law}} is that a state {{does not have any}} obligation to surrender an alleged criminal to a foreign state, because one principle of sovereignty is that every state has legal authority over the people within its borders. Such absence of international obligation, and the desire for the right to demand such criminals from other countries, have caused a web of extradition treaties or agreements to evolve. When no applicable extradition agreement is in place, a sovereign may still request the expulsion or lawful return of an individual pursuant to the requested state’s domestic law. This can be accomplished through the immigration laws of the <b>requested</b> <b>state</b> or other facets of the requested state’s domestic law. Similarly, the codes of penal procedure in many countries contain provisions allowing for extradition to take place {{in the absence of an}} extradition agreement. Sovereigns may, therefore, still request the expulsion or lawful return of a fugitive from the territory of a <b>requested</b> <b>state</b> in the absence of an extradition treaty.|$|E

5000|$|The {{parties to}} the Convention agree to offer each other [...] "the widest measure of mutual assistance" [...] in {{investigating}} crimes, procuring evidence, and in prosecuting criminal suspects.

50|$|However, {{satisfying}} {{conditions for}} international asset recovery using criminal convictions remains problematic.
