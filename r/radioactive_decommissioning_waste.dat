40|$|A {{new concept}} termed the Innovative Nuclear Power Plant Building Arrangement (INBA) {{strategy}} {{is a new}} nuclear power plant building arrangement method which encompasses upfront consideration of more efficient decommissioning. Although existing decommissioning strategies such as immediate dismantling and differed dismantling {{has the advantage of}} either early site restoration or <b>radioactive</b> <b>decommissioning</b> <b>waste</b> reduction, the INBA strategy has the advantages of both strategies. In this research paper, the concept and the implementation method of the INBA strategy will be described. Two primary benefits will be further described: (1) early site restoration; and (2) radioactive waste reduction. Several other potential benefits will also be identified. For the estimation of economic benefit, the INBA strategy, with two primary benefits, will be compared with the immediate dismantling strategy. The effect of a short life cycle nuclear power plant in combination with the INBA strategy will be reviewed. Finally, some of the major impediments to the realization of this strategy will be discussed...|$|E

30|$|Bentonite is {{identified}} as potential buffer material in deep geological repositories for disposal of high level radioactive wastes (HLW) owing to its very low hydraulic conductivity, large swelling ability and high adsorptive capacity to retain cations (Pusch 2008). However, owing to negative surface charge, bentonite repels anions (van Olphen 1963). 129 I (Iodide- 129) is a fission product encountered in nuclear power plant wastes and is generated from ion-exchange resins, filter sludge, evaporator bottoms, off-gas cartridge filter, trash, and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>wastes</b> (Zhang et al. 2002). The ability to retain iodide ions by bentonite buffer employed in deep geological repositories is important as high-level radioactive wastes contain long-lived radioactive iodide species (Oscarson et al. 1986; Krumhansl et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this course, conducted by Jóvenes Nucleares (Spanish Young Generation in Nuclear, JJNN), a non-profit organization {{that depends on the}} Spanish Nuclear Society (SNE) is to pass on basic knowledge about Science and Nuclear Technology to the general public, mostly students and introduce them to its most relevant points. The purposes of this course are to provide general information, to answer the most common questions about Nuclear Energy and to motivate the young students to start a career in nuclear. Therefore, it is directed mainly to high school and university students, but also to general people that wants to learn about the key issues of such an important matter in our society. Anybody could attend the course, as no specific scientific education is required. The course is done at least once a year, during the Annual Meeting of the Spanish Nuclear Society, which takes place in a different Spanish city each time. The course is done also to whichever university or institution that asks for it to JJNN, with the only limit of the presenter´s availability. The course is divided into the following chapters: Physical nuclear and radiation principles, Nuclear power plants, Nuclear safety, Nuclear fuel, <b>Radioactive</b> <b>waste,</b> <b>Decommission</b> of nuclear facilities, Future nuclear power plants, Other uses of nuclear technology, Nuclear energy, climate change and sustainable development. The course is divided into 15 minutes lessons on the above topics, imparted by young professionals, experts in the field that belongs either to the Spanish Young Generation in Nuclear, either to companies and institutions related with nuclear energy. At the end of the course, a 200 pages book with the contents of the course is handed to every member of the audience. This book is also distributed in other course editions at high schools and universities in order to promote the scientific dissemination of the Nuclear Technology. As an extra motivation, JJNN delivers a course certificate to the assistants. At {{the end of the last}} edition course, in Santiago de Compostela, the assistants were asked to provide a feedback about it. Some really interesting lessons were learned, that will be very useful to improve next editions of the course. As a general conclusion of the courses it can be said that many of the students that have assisted to the course have increased their motivation in the nuclear field, and hopefully it will help the young talents to choose the nuclear field to develop their career...|$|R

For 3 H, direct counting can be significantly affected by variations in sample composition/colour resulting in varying degrees of sample quench, does not distinguish between aqueous/organically-bound 3 H and is limited to small sample sizes.

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the generation of}} low- and intermediate-level waste (LILW) and high-level waste (HLW) from open and closed nuclear fuel cycles. The closed fuel cycle reflects the development and deployment of fast reactors and pyroprocessing from 2013 to 2100, while the open fuel cycle only considers pressurized water reactors. The closed fuel cycle hardly affects short-term spent fuel management but can save nearly 60 % space of interim storage compared with the open fuel cycle. Compared with the open fuel cycle, the accumulated volume of HLW can be significantly reduced in the closed fuel cycle up to over 95 % in 2100. For this volume reduction, high heat generating fission products should be separated from transuranic waste in pyroprocessing and stored in decay storages for a few hundred years. Mining and milling waste in the closed fuel cycle decreases by about 31 %. In contrast, the closed fuel cycle generates 3. 0 %- 4. 5 % more LILW than the open fuel cycle because fast reactors and pyroprocessing produce more LILW and conversion, enrichment, and fabrication produce less LILW. In the closed fuel cycle, operation and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>wastes</b> from reactor and pyroprocessing, respectively, contribute to 74 % and 8 % of LILW excluding mining and milling wasteclose 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The ongoing {{program of}} nuclear {{facilities}} decommissioning within the UK has generated {{a requirement for}} the characterization of diverse waste forms. Many of the radionuclides requiring quantification are rarely encountered in routine radioanalytical studies. One such radionuclide is 113 mCd, which is produced via neutron activation of Cd in reactor control rods and shielding. The nuclide decays predominantly via beta emission (Eβmax = 580 keV; 99. 86 %), which is accompanied by gamma emission with very low yields (Eγ = 263. 7 keV; Iγ = 0. 02296 %). Quantification of 113 mCd in <b>decommissioning</b> <b>wastes</b> by gamma spectrometry is therefore mostly limited to high-activity samples. Liquid scintillation counting offers an attractive alternative for sensitive measurement of this nuclide but is restricted {{by the lack of}} any reference standard suitable for instrument calibration. Calibration using the Ciemat-NIST approach has therefore been evaluated. 113 mCd was purified using a validated separation procedure from irradiated Cd obtained from a UK research reactor. The purified fractions were then measured on a Wallac 1220 Quantulus liquid scintillation counter previously calibrated using the Ciemat-NIST (CN) approach and results compared with those obtained by gamma spectrometry. Good agreement was observed, confirming the suitability of liquid scintillation counting for the quantification of 113 mCd and the validity of using the CN calibration method for radionuclides where no reference standards are currently available...|$|R
40|$|Decommissioning and dismantlement {{of nuclear}} power plants (NPP) present a final phase of the nuclear power plant {{lifetime}} and essential part of an effective nuclear safety culture. While some countries are implementing nuclear exit strategies and other building new nuclear power plants or prolonging their lifetimes, decommissioning of facilities is imminent. This paper gives a short overview on decommissioning and dismantling strategies and techniques as {{an introduction to the}} applicability of radioactive metal waste recycling and reuse. General estimations suggest that majority of the waste mass resulting from decommissioning and dismantling is radiologically unrestricted material. Remaining one-third is the radioactive material with different ranges of radioactivity. To present radioactive metal scrap recycling in practice, paper addresses estimations on metal waste amounts resulting from decommissioning, use of melting as a possible recycling method (with regard to secondary waste generated) and aspects of environmental and health impacts. Additionally, a best practice example of decommissioning process in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology NPP is given to provide context for possible future decommissioning of NPP Krško. After consideration of available data on <b>decommissioning</b> <b>waste</b> management, the conclusion is that while the decision on decommissioning strategies and technologies is not straightforward but unique to each country, current experiences give important context to complexity and potential of decommissioning and provide a basis for future actions...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{amount of}} decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) being performed {{throughout the world}} not only strains nuclear cleanup budgets, but places severe demands on the capacities of nuclear waste disposal sites. Although budgets and waste disposal sites {{have been able to}} accommodate the demand thus far, the increasing number of large facilities being decommissioned will cause major impacts to the waste disposal process. It is thus imperative that new and innovative technologies are applied within the D&D industry to reduce costs and waste disposal requirements for the decommissioning of our inventory of large and aging nuclear facilities. One of the most significant problems reactor owner’s deal with is the accurate determination of the types and volumes of wastes that will be generated during decommissioning of their facilities. Waste disposal costs, restrictions, and transportation issues can account for as much as 30 % of the total costs to decommission a facility and thus {{it is very important to}} have accurate waste volume estimates.
