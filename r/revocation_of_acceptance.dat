40|$|The {{interaction}} between standardized computer languages and contracts for programs which use these languages {{is important to}} the buyer or seller of software. The rationale for standardization, the problems in standardizing computer languages, and the difficulties of determining whether the product conforms to the standard are issues which must be understood. The contract law processes of delivery, acceptance testing, acceptance, rejection, and <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> are applicable to the contracting process for standard language software. Appropriate contract language is suggested for requiring strict compliance with a standard, and an overview of remedies is given for failure to comply...|$|E
50|$|The {{posting rule}} {{applies only to}} acceptance. Other {{contractual}} letters (such as one revoking the offer) do not take effect until the letter is delivered, as in Stevenson, Jacques & Co v McLean (1880) 5 QBD 346. The implication {{of this is that}} it is possible for a letter <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> to be posted after a letter <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the offer has been posted but before it is delivered, and acceptance will be complete {{at the time that the}} letter <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> was posted—the offeror's revocation would be inoperative.|$|R
50|$|The {{provision}} {{allowing for}} <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> naturalisation {{as a consequence}} of residence abroad has been criticised as creating two classes of Liberian citizens and for reducing the capabilities of naturalised Liberians to pursue employment and educational opportunities abroad. The provision for the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> a minor's naturalisation following the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the father's naturalisation has been criticised as unfair to the child.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{naturalisation}} awarded to children {{on the basis of}} a father's naturalisation, the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the father's naturalisation entails the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the child's naturalisation unless the child has reached age 21.|$|R
