40|$|Abstract A {{total of}} 277 <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrows,</b> Zonotrichia capensis Müller, 1776 (Emberizidae), were {{examined}} for external parasites. The birds were captured using mist nets in seven locations in northern and central Chile. Additionally, seven carcasses from central Chile (the Biobío region) were necropsied {{to evaluate the}} presence of endoparasite infection. Ectoparasites were found on 35. 8 % (99 / 277) of the examined birds and they were represented by the following arthropods: feather mites Amerodectes zonotrichiae Mironov and González-Acuña, 2014 (Analgoidea: Proctophyllodidae), Proctophyllodes polyxenus Atyeo and Braasch, 1966 (Analgoidea: Proctophyllodidae), and Trouessartia capensis Berla, 1959 (Analgoidea: Trouessartiidae); a louse Philopterus sp. (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera); and ticks Amblyomma tigrinum Koch, 1844 (Acari: Ixodidae) and Ixodes auritulus Neumann, 1904 (Acari: Ixodidae). Two of the seven necropsied carcasses were infected with the acanthocephalan Mediorhynchus papillosus Van Cleave, 1916 (Gigantorhynchida: Gigantorhynchidae).

40|$|High-latitude {{vertebrates}} generally breed seasonally and synchronously as {{the primary}} environmental cue used to time seasonal processes is photoperiod. Investigations of tropical vertebrates have also documented seasonal reproduction, but {{it is unclear how}} synchronous reproduction is, both within and between populations. In this study, we investigated whether seasonal reproduction in a tropical species is synchronous between two populations in close proximity and, if not, whether asynchrony is correlated with genetic and cultural differentiation. We describe two equatorial populations of <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Zonotrichia capensis), at the same latitude and separated by 25 km, that each breed seasonally but out of phase with each other. This asynchronous reproductive phenology is associated with local weather patterns and is independent of photoperiod. At a finer scale, reproductive timing is more highly synchronized within monogamous pairs than within the population as a whole. Associated with the difference in reproductive phenologies, we document that males in each population sing different song dialects. Using microsatellite DNA analysis, we found limited gene flow and significant genetic differentiation between the two populations. From these results we hypothesize that cultural and genetic differentiation between populations, which can be greater in tropical populations than temperate ones, can be associated with locally adapted reproductive phenologies.

40|$|<b>Rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Zonotrichia capensis peruviensis) from valleys in the Atacama Desert of Chile, {{live in an}} {{extremely}} stable environment, and exhibit overlap in molt and reproduction, with valley-specific differences {{in the proportion of}} birds engaged in both. To better understand the mechanistic pathways underlying the timing of life-history transitions, we examined the relationships among baseline and stress-induced levels of corticosterone (CORT), testosterone, and bacteria-killing ability of the blood plasma (BKA), as well as haemosporidian parasite infections and the genetic structure of two groups of sparrows from separate valleys {{over the course of a}} year. Birds neither molting nor breeding had the lowest BKA, but there were no differences among the other three categories of molt-reproductive stage. BKA varied over the year, with birds in May/June exhibiting significantly lower levels of BKA than the rest of the year. We also documented differences in the direction of the relationship between CORT and BKA at different times during the year. The direction of these relationships coincides with some trends in molt and reproductive stage, but differs enough to indicate that these birds exhibit individual-level plasticity, or population-level variability, in coordinating hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity with life-history stage. We found weak preliminary evidence for genetic differentiation between the two populations, but not enough to indicate genetic isolation. No birds were infected with haemosporidia, which may be indicative of reduced parasite pressure in deserts. The data suggest that these birds may not trade off among different life-history components, but rather are able to invest in multiple life-history components based on their condition...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> relies {{entirely on}} its kidneys for {{osmoregulation}} and ionoregulation. It {{is able to}} tolerate {{a wide range of}} salt intake despite lacking a salt gland, however the metabolic cost in energy is too great to maintain the necessary osmoregulatory processes {{for an extended period of}} time. As a result, the <b>Rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> tends not to inhabit marine environments such as salt marshes. Under conditions of higher salt intake, the mass of the kidney and heart can increase up to 20%. This response in organ size causes an increase in basal metabolic rate (BMR) by up to 30%. Kidney size is also affected by the amount of water available in the environment. In arid environments, the urine is more highly concentrated, and the kidneys tend to be smaller than in wetter environments.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2006. Glucocorticoid hormones have {{multiple}} purposes. At low levels, they function to maintain basic energy and salt balance. At high levels, they are key hormones {{in the emergency}} response to noxious stimuli. In the short term, glucocorticoids help the individual cope with a given challenge. Chronic exposure to high glucocorticoid levels can be detrimental to health and may increase mortality. In this dissertation, I explore how corticosterone (CORT) is modulated with life stage, season, habitat, and perturbations in song birds. In <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Zonotrichia capensis costaricensis), I studied the effects of season, breeding, and molt on baseline CORT levels and the CORT response to stress. Month explained most {{of the variation in}} the CORT data, with higher CORT levels occurring in the spring. Breeding individuals had a higher HPA axis response to stress than non-breeding individuals, most likely to favor self-maintenance over a current reproductive attempt. Unlike past research, we found that CORT levels did not change or were higher in molting birds. I measured CORT levels, body condition, behavior, and hematocrit in song wrens (Cyphorhinus phaeocephalus) along a rainfall-induced habitat gradient. Birds living in drier habitat had lower body condition and {{were more likely to have}} an abnormally low hematocrit score. The relationship between rainfall and baseline CORT was not significant, but birds with the highest baseline CORT levels lived at the dry edge of the range. Birds in better body condition and with lower baseline CORT levels were captured more quickly. Our results indicate that physiology and behavior can change with an environmental gradient. To better understand the consequences of living in a disturbed environment, I studied the effects of repeated, acute pulses of CORT on the HPA axis and body condition in captive, wild Gambel's white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii). CORT-treated birds had higher endogenous baseline CORT levels and failed to increase CORT levels with exposure to stress. Body mass, flight muscle, and food intake all declined with CORT treatment. CORT-treated birds expressed migratory restlessness but delayed the onset of molt. We conclude that frequent, acute CORT administration can create a chronic stress phenotype...|$|R

By means of a field and experimental approach, we evaluated the effect of diet on the activity of three esterases involved in FA hydrolysis; carboxylesterase (CE: 4 -NPA-CE and a-NA -CE) and butyrylcholinesterase, in two South American passerines: the omnivorous <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Zonotrichia capensis) and the granivorous common diuca-finch (Diuca diuca). The activity of the three esterases was measured in the intestines of freshly caught individuals over two distinct seasons and also after a chronic intake of a UFA-rich or SFArich diet in the laboratory. In turn, we assessed the feeding responses of the birds choosing amongst diets contrasting {{in the kind of}} specific FA (UFA- vs. SFA-treated diets). During summer, field CE activities (4 -NPA-CE and a-NA -CE) in the small intestine were higher in the <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> (25. 3 ± 3. 3 and 81. 4 ± 10. 8 μmol min− 1 g tissue− 1, respectively) than in the common diuca-finch (10. 0 ± 3. 0 and 33. 9 ± 13. 1 μmol min− 1 g tissue− 1, respectively). Two hour feeding trial test indicated that both species exhibited a clear preference for UFA-treated diets. On average, the <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> consumed 0. 46 g 2 h− 1 of UFArich diets and 0. 12 g 2 h− 1 of SFA-rich diets. In turn, the consumption pattern of the common diuca-finch averaged 0. 73 and 0. 16 g 2 h− 1 for UFA-rich and SFA-rich diets, respectively. After a month of dietary acclimation to UFArich and SFA-rich diets, both species maintained body mass irrespective of the dietary regime. Additionally, the intestinal 4 -NPA-CE activity exhibited by birds fed on a UFA-rich or SFA-rich diet was higher in the <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> (39. 0 ± 5. 3 and 44. 2 ± 7. 3 μmol min− 1 g tissue− 1, respectively) than in the common diuca-finch (13. 3 ± 1. 9 and 11. 2 ± 1. 4 μmol min− 1 g tissue− 1, respectively). Finally, the intestinal a-NA -CE activity exhibited by the <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> was about two times higher when consuming an UFA-rich diet.

We used molecular and microscopic methods to estimate the prevalence of haemoparasites in birds inhabiting the Pampa del Tamarugal.

40|$|Background]: The Neotropics are {{exceptionally}} diverse, containing {{roughly one}} third of all extant bird species on Earth. This remarkable species richness {{is thought to be}} a consequence of processes associated with both Andean orogenesis throughout the Tertiary, and climatic fluctuations during the Quaternary. Phylogeographic studies allow insights into how such events might have influenced evolutionary trajectories of species and ultimately contribute {{to a better understanding of}} speciation. Studies on continentally distributed species are of particular interest because different populations of such taxa may show genetic signatures of events that impacted the continent-wide biota. Here we evaluate the genealogical history of one of the world's most broadly-distributed and polytypic passerines, the <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Zonotrichia capensis). [Results]: We obtained control region DNA sequences from 92 Zonotrichia capensis individuals sampled across the species' range (Central and South America). Six additional molecular markers, both nuclear and mitochondrial, were sequenced for a subset of individuals with divergent control region haplotypes. Median-joining network analysis, and Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses all recovered three lineages: one spanning Middle America, the Dominican Republic, and north-western South America; one encompassing the Dominican Republic, Roraima (Venezuela) and La Paz (Bolivia) south to Tierra del Fuego, Argentina; and a third, including eastern Argentina and Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the Middle American/north-western South American clade is sister to the remaining two. Bayesian and maximum likelihood coalescent simulations used to study lineage demographic history, diversification times, migration rates and population expansion together suggested that diversification of the three lineages occurred rapidly during the Pleistocene, with negligible gene flow, leaving genetic signatures of population expansions. [Conclusions]: The Pleistocene history of the <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> involved extensive range expansion from a probable Central American origin. Its remarkable morphological and behavioral diversity probably represents recent responses to local conditions overlying deeper patterns of lineage diversity, which are themselves produced by isolation and the history of colonization of South America.

We carried out this study for {{a year in a}} population inhabiting riparian habitats in the Atacama Desert in Chile, one of the most climatically stable and driest places in the world. This environment shows minimal yearly change in average temperature and precipitation is virtually zero. We found individuals breeding, molting and overlapping breeding and molt year round, although most individuals were molting during March and in breeding condition during October. T levels were not related to individual breeding condition, and at population level they were not significantly different across sampling months. Baseline levels of CORT did not vary across the year. Stress-induced levels of CORT were suppressed during March when most of the birds were molting. This phenomenon was also observed in birds not molting during this period suggesting a mechanism other than molt in determining the stress-response suppression. Our results strongly suggest that in this study site, long-term extremely stable conditions could have relaxed the selective pressures over the timing of life history stages which was evidenced by the breeding and molt schedules, its overlap and endocrine profiles...|$|E
40|$|Bird-window {{collisions}} are {{a dramatic}} cause of bird mortality globally.

Nevertheless, civilians have applied preventive methods (e. g. adhesive bird-of-prey decals) sparsely but, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated their effectiveness in Brazil. Here, we estimated the mortality rate of bird-window collisions and tested the effectiveness of bird-of-prey decals at preventing such accidents. We undertook daily searches for bird carcasses, presumably resulting from window collisions, near all buildings on a university campus over seven months. Adhesive bird-of-prey decals were then applied to the two buildings with the highest mortality rates and surveys continued for over 12 more months. The mortality rates {{before and after the}} application of decals and between seasons were then compared using Friedman test. We recorded 36 collisions, 29 around the two buildings with the highest collision rates 19 prior and 10 after our intervention with associated collision rates of 0. 08 and 0. 04 collisions/day. Although mortality was reduced by almost half, this difference was not statistically significant. The Blue-black grassquit, Volatinia jacarina (Linnaeus, 1766), and Ruddy ground dove, Columbina talpacoti (Temminck, 1810) suffered the highest number of collisions, followed by the <b>Rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow,</b> Zonotrichia capensis (P.

40|$|Animal personalities are interindividual {{behavioral}} {{differences that}} are consistent across time or contexts. Increasing research is revealing the adaptive significance of personalities, although the mechanisms driving this variation remain largely unknown. A possible source of variation in personality traits is interpopulational differences in the strength of selection acting upon them. The response to selection can be measured indirectly via the behavior's repeatability, as repeatability generally sets an upper limit to trait heritability. However, no information currently exists on geographic variation in personality repeatability. We therefore quantified repeatability in exploratory behavior, a common personality trait, over multiple trials for 3 populations of <b>rufous-collared</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Zonotrichia capensis), focusing on 3 specific measures (exploration speed, diversity of perches visited, and number of hops). We also asked how differences in repeatability of these 3 measures affect other aspects of exploration, such as the temporal consistency of intercorrelations between the measures. Exploration speed was highly repeatable across all populations, whereas diversity was only repeatable in 2 of 3 populations and hopping behavior not at all. These differences in repeatability lead to temporal variation in the correlation matrices of the 3 exploration measures. Finally, only trial number influenced interindividual variability in exploration, whereas population identity, experimental conditions (i. e., conducting the novel environment assay under laboratory or field conditions), and time since capture all had no effect. Our findings highlight the complexity of using measures of behavioral consistency as a definition of personalities and emphasize the value of quantifying interpopulational patterns of trait repeatability.

40|$|Data on the brood {{parasitism}} of the Shiny Cowbird, Molothrus bonariensis on the <b>Rufous-collared</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> Zonotrlchia capensis, {{was collected}} during 10 breeding seasons (l 970 - 1979 : 70 nests), {{in a study}} site at Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Though the cowbird parasitised 14 species of local passerines (40 %"of the total) most parasitic fledglings (46 %), were reared by the sparrows. During the breeding season sparrows considerably outnumbered the cowbirds. Home ranges of banded female cowbirds ranged in size from 21 to 48 ha, and other females were not excluded; the females were rather gregarius. After 1975 the incidence of parasitism in nests of sparrows declined significantly; the overall incidence was 61, 90 %. Two morphs of cowbirds eggs were found in similar proportions in sparrow nests; measurements, {{size and shape of}} the egg morphs are included. The distribution of all cowbirds eggs in the nests of this accepter host departed significantly from Poisson and Preston (1948) distributions, but those of separate egg morphs agreed closely with expected distribution. Cowbird females laid 1 or 2 eggs per sparrow nest; with 1 exception, sets of 3 or more cowbird eggs represent parasitism by 2 or more females. The nesting success of host and parasite was low, being only 5, 56 % for cowbird eggs. Cowbirds destroyed relatively few (6, 58 %) cowbird eggs. In order to have 1 fledgling cowbird reared by sparrows each breeding season female cowbirds should lay 18 eggs in the nests of this host. The results are compared with those of other studies...|$|E
