The Cambrian {{rocks to}} the north and west of St. Valentines Peak are exposed in the core of the north-south trending St. Valentines Peak Anticline. In the best exposed section (3 km north of the main fossil locality), the oldest Cambrian unit is a massive, cherty, pyritic meta-sandstone and meta-siltstone at least 100 m thick. This is overlain by 100 m of <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>welded</b> <b>tuff,</b> 75 to 100 m of meta-sandstones and meta-siltstones, 100 m of a possible contact metasomatic rock and 230 to 375 m of a pale grey chert which in turn is overlain by about 17 m of fine breccia and poorly fossiliferous siltstone. This sequence is overlain with probable disconformity by the basal chert conglomerate of the essentially Ordovician Junee Group. It is suggested that the sediments of the main fossiliferous locality occur stratigraphically below the section noted above.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{construction}} of the mountain tunneling in Japan, the accident resulting from face collapse accounts for about 65 % of the total. Therefore, in order to perform tunnel construction safely, {{it is important to}} grasp the situation of geology, bedrock and groundwater of an unexcavated part in detail before construction. This paper reports the risk management example which reduced geological risks and performed suitable construction by various geological investigations during construction stage in deteriorated ground that was predicted to be in the mountain tunnel. In these sections of ground, while geological survey had been inadequate in a prior stage, tunnel The recent trend of tunneling is toward larger and longer tunnels. From the viewpoint of safety and efficiency of operation, it is highly advantageous to grasp geological conditions before tunneling. Geological evaluation ahead of tunnel face and face stability are especially an important issue to make effective use of the TBM was started, and face collapse accident was encountered. Since this tunnel has long length and high overburden, suitable and more effective investigation technique which can be performed in a short time is needed during construction. Test for physical properties and consistency of soil applied the concrete slump test was carried out in altered sandy Granite ground. Moreover, fractured and altered zone are distributed repeatedly in <b>Rhyolitic</b> <b>welded</b> <b>tuff</b> ground, it analyzed by the seismic imaging method using three-component geophone. These investigation results were analyzed synthetically, drainage drift and advanced drainage boring were performed, the geological risk was reduced and tunnel construction was continued more safely and economically.

Brian Mahoney and Chad Wittkop. Death Valley, California has a rich geologic history and a landscape shaped by diverse tectonic and volcanic activities. Modern-day Death Valley {{is the product of}} extensional tectonism, rhyolitic volcanism, and basin development during Miocene basin and range extension. Fault scarps, turtleback faults, alluvial fans, eolian processes, and weathering can be observed in an environment which lacks vegetation making this an ideal locale to study geologic relationships. The most reent Miocene extensional basin and range tectonics have produced a series of normal faults which shaped the horst and graben features observed on the floor of Death Valley. Extensive Miocene volcanism produced widespread pyroclastic sheets which dominate most of Death Valley. To gain insight on magmatic partitioning a detailed geochemical investigation was conducted on a compound cooling unit of the Miocene (ca. 9 Ma) Resting Springs Tuff, east of Shoshone, California. The sequence included a basal vitrophyre, slightly <b>welded</b> <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuff,</b> strongly <b>welded</b> <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuff,</b> <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuff,</b> and <b>welded</b> <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuff.</b> Major and trace element geochemical stratigraphy analyses were conducted using X-ray fluorescence to assess elemental partitioning during pyroclastic transport.

Five {{stratified}} units, forming a composite section over 22, 000 ft (6700 m) thick, are recognized in the area. They were deformed and later intruded by granodiorite and quartz monzonite porphyry of the Snoqualmie batholith (middle Miocene). The oldest unit, the Denny Formation (Permian), 7000 ft (2100 m) thick, consists of interstratified basalt, andesite and dacite volcanic rocks and limestone and chert beds. This formation is unconformably overlain by a thick conformable sequence of early Tertiary strata which are subdivided, from oldest to youngest, into the Guye Formation, Mount Catherine Tuff, and Naches Formations (Paleocene to early Oligocene). The Guye Formation, 6500 ft (1980 m) thick, consists of carbonaceous mudstone, quartzofeldspathic siltstone and sandstone, and chert conglomerate. The Mount Catherine Tuff, 900 ft (274 m) thick, consists of interstratified dacitic and <b>rhyolitic</b> crystal-vitric <b>welded</b> <b>tuff.</b> The Naches Formation, more than 6000 ft (1830 m) thick, is composed of carbonaceous mudstone and quartzofeldspathic siltstone and sandstone with interstratified andesitic lava and pyroclastic rock. The Denny Mountain Formation, informally named, 1800 ft (550 m) thick,(Oligocene or early Miocene) overlies the Guye Formation along a major angular unconformity. This unit consists of interstratified dacitic and andesitic tuff, volcanic breccia, and intercalated andesitic lava. The rocks of all stratified formations except the Denny Mountain Formation were deformed at different times before emplacement of the Snoqualmie batholith. During batholithic emplacement, four stages of deformation are recognized: (1) development of an anticline in the Guye, Mount Catherine Tuff, and Naches Formations, (2) break-up of this anticline and downfaulting of limbs with displacements up to 2 mi (3. 2 km), (3) uplift of blocks of the Denny Formation and juxtaposition of these with younger formational units, and (4) uplift of additional blocks of the Denny Formation along trends that cut obliquely across stratigraphic contacts and previous structural trends.

The author has investigated the variation of the chemical composition of the river waters with the difference of geological feature. The results are as follows. In the Ono river system, the SiO 2, content of the drainage from Aso <b>welded</b> <b>tuff</b> area is 53. 6 ppm (43. 4 % to the salinity), in tributaries which start from other igneous rocks and flow through Aso tuff it is 42. 0 ppm (39. 8 % to the salinity), and in tributaries which start from argillaceous sedimentary rocks and flow through Aso <b>welded</b> <b>tuff</b> it is 24. 8 ppm (26. 6 % to the salinity). In the Banjo river system, the whole of which basin is covered with argillaceous sedimentary rocks, the Si 02 content is 12. 9 ppm (25. 7 % to the sallinity). This fact indicates that the SiO 2, content in the water of the rivers varies with the geological feature of their reaches. The SiO 2, content in the drainage of Aso <b>welded</b> <b>tuff</b> is in direct proportion to HCO 3 content. Therefore the dissolution of rocks is cuased by the water charged with carbon dioxide. In Aso <b>welded</b> <b>tuff</b> area the Na content in river waters is out of proportion to Cl content. On the other hand, the quantity of (Na + K) - Cl is in direct proportion to SiO 2, content.

Where the Lematang River unites with the Moelak River, the acid <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> of the Pasoemah highland, to which attention will be drawn in this paper, are cut off by a steep bluff, formed undoubtedly by retrogressive erosion, which was substantially facilitated {{by the presence of}} vertical cleavage planes in the rhyolitic tuff series. In the Goemai Mts., described elsewhere in detail by K. A. F. R. Musper (1937) and also dealt with by the present writer in a previous paper (J. Westerveld, 1941), a core of strongly folded lower-Cretaceous sediments, cut by various intrusiva, is covered unconformably by a steeply tilted series of Eogene or old-Miocene andesitic tuffs and breccias, the Lower Kikim tuffs, which again are covered with slight unconformity by the old-Miocene Upper Kikim tuffs or basal section of the Batoeradja-Telisa series. The base of the Pasoemah volcanics is generally formed by the S-ward dipping Telisa beds or upper part of the latter series; a monotonous sequence of Globigerina marls and shales with intercalated andesitic tuffs and breccias, layers of glauconitic sandstone, platy or concretionnary limestones, and occasional horizons with plant remains.

In this study, potential groundwater flow paths were investigated for subsurface tuffs at Yucca Flat by studying how these units are connected. The virtual absence of site-specific hydraulic conductivity data dictates that as a first step a surrogate attribute (geophysical logs) be utilized. In this first phase, the connectivity patterns of densely <b>welded</b> ash-flow <b>tuffs</b> were studied because these tuffs are the most likely to form zones of high hydraulic conductivity. Densely <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> were identified based on the response shown on resistivity logs and this information was transformed into binary indicator values. The spatial correlation of the indicator data was estimated through geostatistical methods. Equiprobable three-dimensional maps of the distribution of the densely-welded and nonwelded tuffs (i. e., subsurface heterogeneity) were then produced using a multiple indicator simulation formalism. The simulations demonstrate that resistivity logs are effective as soft data for indicating densely <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs.</b> The simulated <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> reproduce the stratigraphic relationships of the <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> observed in hydrogeologic cross sections, while incorporating the heterogeneity and anisotropy that is expected in this subsurface setting.
