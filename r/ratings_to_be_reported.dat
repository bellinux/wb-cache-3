The main finding of the paper is that current economic and financial indicators alone do not determine ratings. In addition, the relevance of economic variables is not the same across the different rating categories. Economic variables do not carry the same importance for the sample of high rated countries with a long financial stability history as compared to the low rated sample of countries that are still undergoing structural changes...|$|R

40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} trait relevance to a specific task on people's projection of their characteristics onto a cooperative partner. We either measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2) the relevance of a trait to a specific cooperative task. In both studies, participants first rated themselves {{on a list of}} traits. Then they imagined completing a cooperative task with an unknown partner. Finally, they rated the partner on the same list of traits. In Study 1, we found partner <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively influenced by self ratings and the idiosyncratic measure of trait relevance. In Study 2, participants rated the self and the partner on competence and warmth traits while completing an intellectual or a social task. We found partner <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively influenced by self ratings more on competence than on warmth in the intellectual task, but more on warmth than on competence in the social task. These results suggest that people project onto others in a way that maximizes their chances to succeed in cooperation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of soliciting a rating on the actual outcome of bank ratings. Using two sample banks (one rated by Fitch and one rated by S&P), I find evidence that unsolicited <b>ratings</b> tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lower than solicited ones, after accounting for differences in observable bank characteristics. This downward bias does not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{explained by the fact}} that better-quality banks self-select into the solicited group. Rather, unsolicited <b>ratings</b> appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lower because they are based on public information and are therefore dependent on the quantity of public information disclosed by the banks. As a result, unsolicited <b>ratings</b> tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more conservative than solicited ratings, which incorporate both public and non-public information. While the latter result is also consistent with the fact that credit rating agencies may blackmail low-disclosure firms, the findings suggest that blackmailing-if it is actually used-is ineffective in making these firms start to pay for a rating. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Three studies of this "Thatcher illusion " employed faces that were grotesque when upright because: (a) their eyes and mouths had beeninv rted("Thatcherized " faces), (b) their eyes and mouths had beenmoved(spatially distorted faces),or (c) they had grotesque posed expressions. Inversion reduced the apparent grotesqueness ofbothThatch-erizedandspatially distorted faces, butnotgrotesque-expression faces. More-over, Thatcherized and distorted faces, although not grotesque-expression faces, were judged as more similar to normal, smiling faces when face-pairs were in-verted than when they <b>were</b> upright. Similarity <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> inverted face-pairs <b>were</b> correlated with latencies of response to these pairs in a task that encouraged attention to components (e. g., mouths, eyes) rather than wholistic properties.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of online product review forums has enabled firms to monitor consumer opinions about their products in real-time by mining {{publicly available information}} from the Internet. This paper studies the value of online product ratings in revenue forecasting of new experience goods. Our objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> understand what metrics of online ratings are the most informative indicators of a product’s future sales and how the explanatory power of such metrics compares {{to that of other}} variables that have traditionally been used for similar purposes in the past. We focus our attention on online movie ratings and incorporate our findings into practical motion picture revenue forecasting models that use very early (opening weekend) box office and movie <b>ratings</b> data <b>to</b> generate remarkably accurate forecasts of a movie’s future revenue trajectory. Among the metrics of online ratings we considered, we found the valence of user <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most significant explanatory variable. The gender diversity of online raters was also significant, supporting the theory that word-of-mouth that is more widely dispersed among different social groups is more effective. Interestingly, our analysis found user <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more influential in predicting future revenues than average professional critic reviews. Overall, our study has established that online ratings are a useful source of information about a movie’s long-term prospects, enabling exhibitors and distributors to obtain revenue forecasts of a given accuracy sooner than with older techniques...|$|R

Previous {{studies have}} been suggestive {{of the fact that}} {{reputation}} ratings may be provided in a strategic manner for reasons of reciprocation and retaliation, and therefore may not properly reflect the trustworthiness of rated parties. It thus appears that supporting privacy of feedback providers could improve the quality of their ratings. We argue that supporting perfect privacy in decentralized reputation systems is impossible, but as an alternative present three probabilistic schemes that support partial privacy. On the basis of these schemes, we offer three protocols that allow <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> privately provided with high probability in decentralized additive reputation systems. ...|$|R
