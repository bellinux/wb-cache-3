40|$|The {{study of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is concerned with the}} oval shape optimization of ax symmetric shells. An oval shape equation which is able to represent circles, an ellipse and egg shape is found successfully in this study. Coordinates of shell nodes are represented by parameters of the oval shape equation. Shell thickness at the nodes and the parameters of the oval shape equation become design variables, while a minimum shell material volume is the objective function of this shape optimization problem. Actual stresses at the shell nodes which are less or equal to allowable stress becomes inequality constraints which must be satisfied. A content in the shell which is equal to a constant become an equality constraint which must be satisfied too. A Gauss quadrature method is used to solve integration problems of the shell material volume and the content in the shell numerically. A finite element method which uses a curve element is used to calculate the actual stresses at the shell nodes. A displacement function which indirectly includes by rigid body motions is used in this study. The displacement function has two additional constants which explain a strain value decrease due to the rigid body motions, such that a condensation of element stiffness matrices and element load vectors are needed before the element stiffness matrices and the element load vectors are assembled into a structure stiffness matrix and a structure load vector respectively. Genetic algorithms are based on genetics and Darwin theory "survival of the fittest" is used to know characteristics of the problems and to solve the oval shape optimization of ax symmetric shells. In this study, continuous genetic algorithms are developed, and then the continuous genetic algorithms are combined with a flexible polyhedron method and an arranged mutation technique. The optimization methods which form the combination of some methods are called a hybrid method. A computer program is written based on the oval shape equation, the finite element formulation, the continuous genetic algorithms and the hybrid method. The computer program is used to solve the oval shape optimization of ax symmetric shells on a <b>roll</b> <b>support</b> and a continuous elastic support, with a uniform pressure load, a water load and a combination of the water load and a shell self weight...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{signatures}} of balance deficits observed in vestibular loss subjects is the greater {{instability in the}} roll compared to pitch planes. Directional differences in the timing and strengths of vestibular and proprioceptive sensory signals between roll and pitch {{may lead to a}} greater miscalculation of roll than pitch motion of the body in space when vestibular input is absent. For this reason, we compared the timing and amplitude of vestibular information, (observable in stimulus-induced head accelerations when subjects are tilted in different directions), with that of proprioceptive information caused by stimulus induced rotations of ankle and hip joints [observable as short latency (SL) stretch responses in leg and trunk muscle EMG activity]. We attempted to link the possible mode of sensory interaction with the deficits in balance control. Six subjects with bilaterally absent vestibular function and 12 age-matched controls were perturbed, while standing, in 8 directions of pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>support</b> surface rotation in random order. Body segment movements were recorded with a motion analysis system, head accelerations with accelerometers, and muscle activity with surface EMG. Information on stimulus pitch motion was available sequentially. Pitch movements of the support surface were best coded in amplitude by ankle rotation velocity, and by head vertical linear acceleration, which started at 13 ms after the onset of ankle rotation. EMG SL reflex responses in soleus with onsets at 46 ms provided a distal proprioceptive correlate to the pitch motion. Roll information on the stimulus was available simultaneously. Hip adduction and lumbo-sacral angular velocity were represented neurally as directionally specific short latency stretch and unloading reflexes in the bilateral gluteus medius muscles and paraspinal muscles with onsets at 28 ms. Roll angular accelerations of the head coded roll amplitude and direction at the same time (31 ms). Significant differences in amplitude coding between vestibular loss subjects and controls were only observed as a weaker coding between stimulus motion and head roll and head lateral linear accelerations. The absence of vestibular inputs in vestibular loss subjects led to characteristic larger trunk in motion in roll in the direction of tilt compared to pitch with respect to controls. This was preceded by less uphill flexion and no downhill extension of the legs in vestibular loss subjects. Downhill arm abduction responses were also greater. These results suggest that in man vestibular inputs provide critical information necessary for the appropriate modulation of roll balance-correcting responses in the form of stabilising knee and arm movements. The simultaneous arrival of roll sensory information in controls may indicate that proprioceptive and vestibular signals can only be interpreted correctly when both are present. Thus, roll proprioceptive information may be interpreted inaccurately in vestibular loss subjects, leading to an incorrect perception of body tilt and insufficient uphill knee flexion, especially as cervico-collic signals appear less reliable in these subjects as an alternative sensory input...|$|E

Methods: A randomized observer blind controlled trial of 123 very preterm infants was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of the sole tertiary referral centre in Western Australia. Infants were stratified by gestational age (< 29 weeks or 29 - 30 weeks), then randomized into one of three intervention groups: postural support nappy, postural support nappy and postural <b>support</b> <b>roll,</b> or disposable nappy and postural <b>support</b> <b>roll.</b> Interventions started when infants were stable and ceased when routine side-lying commenced.

Results: Infants nursed with a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> and a postural support nappy demonstrated improved hip posture to term equivalent age compared with infants nursed with either a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> only, or a postural support nappy only.

40|$|A {{basic concept}} in {{object-oriented}} approaches {{is the notion}} of object as integrated unit of structure and behavior. Conceptually, objects are modeled as processes of which certain dynamic characteristics of their internal state can be observed using attributes. Objects are the basic units of design. Systems are composed from objects that interact to provide the desired services. In the semantics domain, concepts related to the object-oriented paradigm like interaction, inheritance and object aggregation can be uniformily modelled by object morphisms. In this paper we introduce the language T ROLL to conceptually specify dynamic information systems. T <b>ROLL</b> <b>supports</b> abstract description of temporal evolvement of objects, classification of objects, complex objects, active objects and specialization hierarchies. Additionally, the integration of concepts like modularization support, and component reusability into the T ROLL framework is briefly discussed. 1 Introduction The modeling of com [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Multibody {{simulation}} {{model of the}} roller test rig is presented in this work. The roller test rig consists of a paper machine’s tube <b>roll</b> <b>supported</b> with a hard bearing type balancing machine. The {{simulation model}} includes non-idealities that are measured from the physical structure. These non-idealities are the shell thickness variation of the roll and roundness errors of the shafts of the roll. These kinds of non-idealities are harmful since they can cause subharmonic resonances of the rotor system. In this case, the natural vibration mode of the rotor is excited when the rotation speed is {{a fraction of the}} natural frequency of the system. With the simulation model, the half critical resonance is studied in detail and a sensitivity analysis is performed by simulating several analyses with slightly different input parameters. The model is verified by comparing the simulation results with those obtained by measuring the real structure. Comparison shows that good accuracy is achieved, since equivalent responses are achieve...|$|R
