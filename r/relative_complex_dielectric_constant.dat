Moisture content is given special attention because of its practical significance in remote sensing and because it represents the single most influential parameter as far as soil dielectric properties are concerned. <b>Relative</b> <b>complex</b> <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> curves are derived {{as a function of}} volumetric soil water content at three frequencies (1. 3 GHz, 4. 0 GHz, and 10. 0 GHz) for each of three soil textures (sand, loam, and clay).
