Its aim is to secure common and effective action {{to prevent the spread}} of plant pests across borders and to permit measures for their control. It provides for the establishment of national plant protection services and the issuance of phytosanitary certificates. IPPC also sets <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>imports</b> and international cooperation and provides a system for settlement of disputes. Under the IPPC governments agree to cooperate in establishing Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RRPOs), to function as coordinating bodies for the conformation of legislation and its enforcement, inspection and treatment techniques and standards and certification. RPPOs exist in Asia; Africa; North, Central and South America; the Caribbean; Europe and the South Pacific. Some 100 countries are signatories to the IPPC leaving some 60 or more yet to sign the Convention. The IPPC has been given additional technical responsibility for developing recommendations, guidelines and standards for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the members of which recognize that unjustified quarantine restrictions could be used as non-tariff barriers to trade. IPPC's response has been to seek agreement of the principles of quarantine and pest risk analysis, together with other aspects listed above. 'Transparency' ensuring that import restrictions are clearly 'visible' to trading partners and that the mechanism for determining restrictions is Pest Risk Analysis 7 is a major concern.

The optimal strategy is the one that maximizes the integrator's utility (minimizes disutility of integrator's additional costs). Adventitious commingling is defined stochastically. Results indicate that traceability requirements can be met with specified buyer and seller risk at a total cost of approximately 50 c/non-GM bushel.

Cows were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three pre-grazing HM treatments: 1150 - Low HM (L), 1400 - Medium HM (M) or 2000 kg DM/ha - High HM (H). Herbage accumulation under grazing was lowest (P< 0. 01) on the L treatment and cows grazing the L pastures required more grass silage supplementation during the grazing season (+ 73 kg DM/cow) to overcome pasture deficits due to lower pasture growth rates (P< 0. 05). Treatment did not affect daily milk production or pasture intake, although cows grazing the L pastures had to graze a greater daily area (P< 0. 01) and increase grazing time (P< 0. 05) to compensate for a lower pre-grazing HM (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Two {{different}} functions {{have been}} proposed for the phosphate carrier protein/p 32 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria: transport of phosphate and <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>import</b> of precursor proteins into mitochondria. We characterized a yeast mutant lacking the gene for the phosphate carrier/p 32 and found both a block in the import of phosphate and a strong reduction in the import of preproteins transported to the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix. Binding of preproteins {{to the surface of}} mutant mitochondria and import of outer membrane proteins were not inhibited, indicating that the inhibition of protein import occurred after the recognition step at the outer membrane. The membrane potential across the inner membrane of the mutant mitochondria was strongly reduced. Restoration of the membrane potential restored preprotein import but did not affect the block of phosphate transport of the mutant mitochondria. We conclude that the inhibition of protein import into mitochondria lacking the phosphate carrier/p 32 is indirectly caused by a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential (delta(gamma)), and we propose a model that the reduction of delta(psi) is due to the defective phosphate import, suggesting that phosphate transport is the primary function of the phosphate carrier/p 32...|$|R
40|$|The current, {{generally}} accepted approach to formulating health <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> the international movement of embryos is to base {{them on the}} health status of {{the male and female}} donor animals. The alternative approach of basing them on the health status of the embryos themselves has been blocked by the lack of scientific information about the potential of the early embryo to transmit agents of infectious disease. Consequently, most research into infectious disease transmission by embryos has had the objective of assessing the potential of the embryo to transmit infectious disease, at the stage of development at which it is transferred commercially, with the thought in mind that, for some diseases, it may be possible in the future to focus on the embryo rather than the donor when drawing up health <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>import</b> permits.

Steroid removal switches off import thus allowing direct visualization of the Rev export pathway in living cells. After digitonin permeabilization of these cells, we found that a functional nuclear export sequence (NES), ATP, and fractionated cytosol were sufficient for nuclear export in vitro. Nuclear pore-specific lectins and leptomycin B were potent export inhibitors. Nuclear export was not inhibited by antagonists of calcium metabolism that block nuclear import. These data further suggest that nuclear pores do not functionally close when luminal calcium stores are depleted.
