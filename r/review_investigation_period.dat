40|$|To {{validate}} {{the reliability of}} the Medication Appropriateness Index in the appraisal of quality of prescribing by assessing the inter- and intra-group variation in Dutch residential home patients. Eight raters evaluated 81 medication records of 15 patients from a group of older patients living in a residential nursing home the Netherlands. These patients had been recruited for a medication <b>review</b> <b>investigation</b> throughout a <b>period</b> of 12 months over the period April 2003 until April 2004. Patient information was acquired by connecting the medical record with the complete prescription record and pharmaceutical record. Each patient was assessed twice by two independent reviewers {{on the basis of a}} patient profile in combination with the extracted medical record and using a structured procedure. A summed MAI score, percent agreement, kappa, positive and negative agreement as well as intra-class correlation coefficient were calculated for each criterion. Medication appropriateness was assessed with the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) by an independent panel of Dutch hospital and community pharmacists. The overall percentage agreement was 83 %. For each of the 10 different medication appropriateness questions it ranged from 79 to 100 % for appropriate and from 47 to 60 % for inappropriate ratings. The overall chance adjusted inter-rater agreement reached a moderate kappa score of 0. 47. The overall intra-group agreement was very good with an overall percentage of 98 and a kappa score of at least 0. 84 (all schemes). In a Dutch institutionalised setting with representative raters, the unmodified MAI can be used as an instrument to quantify changes in appropriateness of prescribing...|$|R

The AP-PCR type fingerprinting was perfomed with primers 10514 and 208. Resistance was evaluated by the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration method.

During the <b>investigation</b> <b>period</b> patients were always colonised by the same genotype. A possible correlation between resistance pattern and genotype with both primers has shown, within the same patient, a correspondence of about 20 % for 10514 and a correspondence of only 10 % for 208.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the association between}} corporate governance attributes and firm performance of Finnish firms during 1990 – 2000. The empirical results suggest that corporate governance matters for firm performance. First, univariate test results indicate that firms characterized by a high (efficient) level of corporate governance have delivered greater stock returns, are higher valued based on the measure of Tobin’s Q, and exhibit higher ratios of cash flow to assets, on average, in comparison to their counterparts characterized by a low (inefficient) level of corporate governance. Second, controlling {{for a number of}} well-known determinants of stock returns, we find evidence that firms categorized by inefficient corporate governance have delivered inferior returns to shareholders during the <b>investigation</b> <b>period.</b> Finally, after controlling for several common determinants of firm value, we find that firms characterized by efficient corporate governance have been valued higher during the <b>investigation</b> <b>period,</b> measured by Tobin’s Q.

To answer this question we used two methods, content analysis and survey. Firstly we analysed data from a quantitative content analyses to examine changes in the media coverage about nuclear power between 2010 and 2011. The first <b>investigation</b> <b>period</b> lasted from 10. 07. 2010 to 04. 09. 2010, immediately before the German Bundestag vote for the lifetime extension of nuclear power stations. The second <b>investigation</b> <b>period</b> covered {{the first two months}} of media coverage after Fukushima from 12. 03. 2011 to 16. 5. 2011. Secondly our data consist of a representative telephone panel survey (n= 341). As the first wave was carried out from 16. 8. 2010 to 06. 9. 2010 and the second wave from 15. 5. 2011 to 04. 06. 2011 these data set gives us the unique possibility to investigate attitude changes about nuclear power on the individual level...|$|R
