40|$|International audienceCore formation, crystal/melt separation, {{mingling}} of immiscible magmas, and diapirism {{are fundamental}} geological processes that involve differential motions driven by gravity. Diffusion modifies the compo- sition or/and {{temperature of the}} considered phases while they travel. Solid particles, liquid drops and viscous diapirs equilibrate while sinking/rising through their surroundings with a time scale {{that depends on the}} physics of the flow and the material properties. In particular, the internal circulation within a liquid drop or a diapir favors the diffusive exchange at the interface. To evaluate time scales of chemical/thermal equilibration between a material falling/rising through a deformable medium, we propose analytical laws that can be used at multiple scales. They depend mostly on the non-dimensional Péclet and Reynolds numbers, and are consistent with numerical simulations. We show that equilibration between a particle, drop or diapir and its host needs to be considered in light of the flow structure complexity. It is of fundamental importance to identify the dynamic regime of the flow and take into account the role of the inner circulation within drops and diapirs, as well as inertia that reduces the thickness of boundary layers and enhances exchange through the interface. The scaling laws are applied to predict nickel equilibration between metals and silicates that occurs within 130 m of fall in about 4 minutes during the metal <b>rain</b> <b>stage</b> of the Earth's core formation. For a mafic blob (10 cm diameter) sinking into a felsic melt, trace element equilibration would occur over 4500 m and in about 3 years...|$|E

The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), a small estuarine species of emydid turtle {{is no exception}} as they are currently rated as a species of concern in many states on the East Coast including Delaware and New Jersey and have been declining throughout their range. There is concern that increased anthropogenic disturbances could be influencing terrapin population declines especially during their nesting season in late May-July.

50|$|The next year, they {{imported}} the French spectacle The Deluge to Niblo's Garden, {{and were}} noted for producing <b>rain</b> on <b>stage.</b> The Deluge, {{otherwise known as}} Paradise Lost, opened Niblo's Garden's 1874-1875 season, on September 4, 1874. This production was called a “delectability” by the historian George Odell. Its players included actresses Julia Seamen, Lillie McDonald and Katie New, {{as well as the}} Kiralfy Sisters as dancers. The Deluge ran until November 14, 1874 and a competing theater company, Bryant's Minstrels, opened their own The Deluge on the same day. Odell said it brought “a veritable flood-tide of success”. When one of the many revivals of the Kiralfy Brothers’ production was brought to the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia in April 1879, reviewers praised the ballet and scenery, while essentially ignoring the acting. One reviewer comments that the sets of “Pandemonium, the Garden of Eden, and the Temple of Enoch were wonderful to behold, and were master-pieces of scenic painting,” and goes on to note that, because the piece was {{under the direction of the}} Kiralfys, it would “undoubtedly draw full houses”. The Deluge is a perfect example of the Kiralfys’ mastery of the key concepts of burlesque; the plot was weak but the gorgeous set, astonishing special effects, and beautiful girls served well to cover this up.|$|R

Cloud cover in a COL is highly dependent on its stage of development, but a higher percentage of cloud cover is always present in the frontal zone, attributable due to higher amounts of high and deep convective clouds. These general characteristics are most marked during the first stage (when the amplitude of the geopotencial wave increases) and second stage (characterized by the development of a cold upper level low), closed cyclonic circulation minimizing differences between rearward and frontal zones during the third stage.

The horses' hoofs made a musical chime, accompanying their young voices. She was laughing at his equipment, for he was the reverse of a dandy, and he was enjoying her laughter; the freshness of the morning mingled with the freshness of their youth; and every sound that came from their clear throats, every glance they gave each other, was the bubbling outflow from a spring of joy. It was all morning to them, within and without. And thinking of them in these moments one is tempted to that futile sort of wishing--if only things could have been a little otherwise then, so as to have been greatly otherwise after--if only these two beautiful young creatures could have pledged themselves to each other then and there, and never through life have swerved from that pledge! For some of the goodness which Rex believed in was there. Goodness is a large, often a prospective word; like harvest, which at one stage when we talk of it lies all underground, with an indeterminate future; is the germ prospering in the darkness? at another, it has put forth delicate green blades, and by-and-by the trembling blossoms are ready to be dashed off by an hour of rough wind or <b>rain.</b> Each <b>stage</b> has its peculiar blight, and may have the healthy life choked out of it by a particular action of the foul land which rears or neighbors it, or by damage brought from foulness afar.|$|R

In August, they were slotted to play on Friday when all the folk-orientated and acoustic acts were expected to perform. However, the band refused to perform in the pouring <b>rain,</b> so <b>stage</b> manager John Morris rescheduled their performance for the following day.

The following day, 16 August 1969, at approximately 6:30 p.m., the band played in between the Keef Hartley Band and Canned Heat. The crowd was not anticipating the band's performance on a day that featured mainly hard rock acts. For that reason, the group was generally disfavored and, perhaps more importantly, were not included in the filming of the festival. Over the Labor Day weekend in 1969, they appeared at the Texas International Pop Festival, in Lewisville, Texas. In November, they released the album Changing Horses, which was generally seen as a disappointment after their earlier work. By late 1969, they had established a communal base at Glen Row near Innerleithen, and the relationships between Mike and Rose and between Robin and Licorice had ended.

40|$|New {{rainfall}} techniques urge microwave physically based retrievals {{to produce}} an estimate error, {{to be more precise}} at the instantaneous level and to provide a correct geolocation of the raining areas. Within 3 D structured clouds the coupling between horizontal and vertical inhomogeneity introduces additional uncertainties to instantaneous estimate because of the azimuthal dependence of the radiation field. In fact conical scanning microwave radiometers looking at the same point at the ground from different positions may measure quite different brightness temperatures. For radiometric scene over mirror surfaces, this 3 D radiative effect, averaged over TMI-like footprint, can be fully described by 1 D slant path models, except for strongly scattering highly developed raining cells at 85 GHz.

40|$|Climate risk {{assessment}} in cropping is generally undertaken in a top-down approach using climate records while critical farmer experience {{is often not}} accounted for. In the present study, set in south India, farmer experience of climate risk is integrated in a bottom-up participatory approach with climate data analysis. Crop calendars are used as a boundary object to identify and rank climate and weather risks faced by smallhold farmers. A semi-structured survey was conducted with experienced farmers whose income is predominantly from farming. Interviews {{were based on a}} crop calendar to indicate the timing of key weather and climate risks. The simple definition of risk as consequence × likelihood was used to establish the impact on yield as consequence and chance of occurrence in a 10 -year period as likelihood. Farmers’ risk experience matches well with climate records and risk analysis. Farmers’ rankings of ‘good’ and ‘poor’ seasons also matched up well with their independently reported yield data. On average, a ‘good’ season yield was 1 · 5 – 1 · 65 times higher than a ‘poor’ season. The main risks for paddy rice were excess rains at harvesting and flowering and deficit rains at transplanting. For cotton, farmers identified excess rain at harvest, delayed rains at sowing and excess <b>rain</b> at flowering <b>stages</b> as events that impacted crop yield and quality. The {{risk assessment}} elicited from farmers complements climate analysis and provides some indication of thresholds for studies on climate change and seasonal forecasts. The methods and analysis presented in the present study provide an experiential bottom-up perspective and a methodology on farming in a risky rainfed climate.
