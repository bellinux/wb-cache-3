50|$|The most {{significant}} improvement of position {{observations of the}} Moon have been the Lunar Laser Ranging measurements, obtained using Earth-bound lasers and special <b>retro-reflectors</b> placed {{on the surface of}} the Moon. The time-of-flight of a pulse of laser light to one of the reflectors and back gives a measure of the Moon's distance at that time. The first of five reflectors that are operational today was taken to the Moon in the Apollo 11 spacecraft in July 1969 and placed in a suitable position on the Moon's surface by Neil Armstrong.Its precision is still being extended further by the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation, established in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|The {{successor}} to GEOSAT is the Geosat Follow-On (GFO) mission, launched 10 February 1998 by a Taurus rocket from Vandenberg AFB. [...] GFO carried a water vapor radiometer {{as well as}} a radar altimeter, and operated in the same orbit as GEOSAT's Exact Repeat Mission. In addition, GFO carried a GPS receiver (which was never used operationally), Doppler receivers, and laser <b>retro-reflectors</b> for orbit determination. [...] GFO was scheduled for retirement on December 31, 2008, but in late September 2008, the deteriorating state of the spacecraft resulted in a decision to accelerate the shutdown. Despite a series of system failures aboard the spacecraft, controllers were able to successfully lower GFO to a disposal orbit and shut it down on November 25, 2008. [...] A successor mission, named GFO-2, was planned for launch in 2014, and would have featured a dual-band altimeter, instead of the single-band altimeter on the previous spacecraft. GFO-2 was cancelled by the U.S. Navy on 30 June 2010.|$|E
40|$|Satellite laser ranging system calculates the {{distance}} from ground-based observatories to satellites using the round-trip travel time of laser pulse. The position of <b>retro-reflectors</b> on satellites needs to be corrected which is helpful to improvie the measuring precision of satellite laser ranging. The correction errors of center-of-mass(CoM) are mainly caused by the distribution effects of <b>retro-reflectors</b> on satellites. CoM is related to incident angle, structural alignment of <b>retro-reflectors</b> and ground-based position. Based on the reflecting probability of photons for <b>retro-reflectors</b> {{is proportional to the}} cross sections of <b>retro-reflectors,</b> the cross section area of corner reflectors is fitted and the probabilistic model is established using incident angle as the random variable. The corrections of CoMs of spherical satellite such as LAGEOS- 1 / 2 are calculated and different CoM values are applied for SLR precise orbit determination using long-term full rate observation data with different WRMS results analyzed. At last, for the planar array <b>retro-reflectors,</b> the CoMs of BeiDou navigational satellite such as BeiDou-M 3 are also calculated and analyzed using one month SLR full rate data. The result shows that the calculated CoMs based on probability theory have the comparative precision in SLR precise orbit determination...|$|E

The NRL modulating <b>retro-reflector</b> uses a semiconductor based multiple quantum well shutter capable of modulation rates up to 10 Mbps, depending on link characteristics. The technology enables the use of near-infrared frequencies, which is well known to provide covert communications immune to frequency allocation problems. The multiple quantum well modulating <b>retro-reflector</b> has the added advantage of being compact, lightweight, covert, and requires very low power. Up to an order of magnitude in onboard power can be saved using a small array of these devices instead of the Radio Frequency equivalent.

40|$|This paper applies {{acoustic}} {{principles and}} a novel scanning method motivated by acoustic flow to recognize <b>retro-reflectors</b> directly from sonar echoes while performing drive-by scanning. Right-angle corners and cylinders form specular <b>retro-reflectors</b> that produce strong echoes whose features {{can be easily}} identified. A multi-point sonar produces a point process whose density encodes the echo amplitude and allows strong echoes to be isolated. In drive-by scanning an obliquely-oriented sonar beam passes over a retro-reflector which then exhibits a sequence of strong echoes having a pattern predicted by a forward model. Drive-by scans of a simple retro-reflector, a complex hallway environment and distant objects illustrate the method. An algorithm recognizes and localizes the retro-reflector by performing a two-dimensional search to find coordinates producing range readings matching the data in a weighted-least-squared error sense...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the reflectivity of the <b>retro-reflectors</b> in LHD reduced drastically {{in a short period of}} time due to plasma-surface interaction. In the present work, it was tried to find mechanism for the reflectivity reduction by carrying out reflectivity measurements, surface observation and surface chemical analysis. The surface at the central part of the reflectors, which were used for the reflection of the laser, were covered by thick deposition composed of Fe, Cr, Ni and O, because deposition exceeds erosion by sputtering. Due to the inner corner structure like a funnel, impurity atoms were effectively transported toward the center by sputtering and this directional movement resulted in the very rough surface structure, which was the main reason for the reduction of the optical reflectivity. These results suggest effective measures against the reduction of reflectivity of the <b>retro-reflectors</b> in LHD...|$|E
40|$|In near to eye {{displays}} {{based on}} scanning laser projectors, <b>retro-reflectors</b> seem as convenient image relay components since they can ideally be placed at any {{location on the}} scanned beam path. In case of practical retro reflectors though, such as corner cube <b>retro-reflectors</b> (CCRs), the relayed image suffers from loss in quality and resolution due to the positional shift in the retro-reflected rays and the diffraction effects. We perform a wave optics simulation to analyze the image relay performance of a CCR. Our model assumes that the scanned spot of the projector is imaged by the CCR into an array of spots, which superpose and interfere to yield the effective scan spot seen by an eye looking at the CCR. The {{results indicate that the}} CCR results in a significant broadened spot size. Experimental results verify the simulation model in terms of achievable resolution and image quality...|$|E
