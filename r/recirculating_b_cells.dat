40|$|CD 22 is a B cell–specific {{transmembrane protein}} known to {{function}} as a negative regulator of B cell signaling. It has also been implicated in cell adhesion through recognition of � 2, 6 -linked sialic acids on glycans of target cells. Previous studies showed that CD 22 -deficient mice had a strongly reduced population of mature <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> in the bone marrow despite normal B cell development. Using a soluble recombinant form of the receptor (CD 22 -Fc), we demonstrate here that sialylated ligands for CD 22 are expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells of murine bone marrow but not on endothelial cells in other tissues examined. Injection of CD 22 -Fc revealed that the CD 22 ligands in the bone marrow were accessible to the circulation. Treatment of mice with either CD 22 -Fc or affinity-purified anti-CD 22 antibody led to an � 50 % reduction in mature <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> in the bone marrow without affecting numbers in the spleen. Finally, consistent with the notion that CD 22 is a homing receptor, we show that compared with wild-type mice, CD 22 -deficient animals have a lower number of immunoglobulin M–secreting plasma cells in the bone marrow.

40|$|SummaryMature <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> are {{generally}} assumed {{to exist in}} follicular niches in secondary lymphoid organs, and these cells mediate T-dependent humoral immune responses. We show here that {{a large proportion of}} mature B lymphocytes occupy an anatomically and functionally distinct perisinusoidal niche in the bone marrow. Perisinusoidal B cells circulate freely, as revealed by parabiosis studies. However, unlike their counterparts in the follicular niche, these cells are capable of being activated in situ by blood-borne microbes in a T-independent manner to generate specific IgM antibodies. The bone marrow represents a unique type of secondary lymphoid organ in which mature B cells are strategically positioned in the path of circulating microbes...|$|E
40|$|Inflammation {{promotes}} granulopoiesis over B lymphopoiesis in {{the bone}} marrow (BM). We studied B cell homeostasis in two murine models of T cell mediated chronic inflammation, namely calreticulin-deficient fetal liver chimeras (FLC), which develop severe blepharitis and alopecia due to T cell hyper responsiveness, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) caused by injection of CD 4 (+) naïve T cells into lymphopenic mice. We show herein that despite the severe depletion of B cell progenitors during chronic, peripheral T cell-mediated inflammation, the population of BM mature <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> is unaffected. These B cells are poised to differentiate to plasma cells in response to blood borne pathogens, in an analogous fashion to non-recirculating marginal zone (MZ) B cells in the spleen. MZ B cells nevertheless differentiate more efficiently to plasma cells upon polyclonal stimulation by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, and are depleted during chronic T cell mediated inflammation in vivo. The preservation of mature B cells in the BM is associated with increased concentration of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in serum and BM plasma. MIF produced by perivascular dendritic cells (DC) in the BM provides a crucial survival signal for <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells,</b> and mice treated with a MIF inhibitor during inflammation showed significantly reduced mature B cells in the BM. These data indicate that MIF secretion by perivascular DC may promote {{the survival of the}} recirculating B cell pool to ensure responsiveness to blood borne microbes despite loss of the MZ B cell pool that accompanies depressed lymphopoiesis during inflammation...|$|E
40|$|The {{tyrosine}} kinase Syk has been implicated {{as a key}} signal transducer from the <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> antigen receptor (BCR). We show here that mutation of the Syk gene completely blocks the maturation of immature <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> into <b>recirculating</b> cells and stops their entry into <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> follicles. Furthermore, using radiation chimeras we demonstrate that this developmental block {{is due to the}} absence of Syk in the <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> themselves. Syk-deficient <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> are shown to have the life span of normal immature <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> If this is extended by over-expression of Bcl- 2, they accumulate in the T zone and red pulp of the spleen in increased numbers, but still fail to mature to become <b>recirculating</b> follicular <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> Despite this defect in maturation, Syk-deficient <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> were seen to give rise to switched as well as nonswitched splenic plasma cells. Normally only a proportion of immature <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> is recruited into the recirculating pool. Our results suggest that Syk transduces a BCR signal that is absolutely required for the positive selection of immature <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> into the <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> pool.

40|$|Studies of B {{lymphopoiesis}} in {{the bone}} marrow of adult mice (1, 2) and rats (3) suggest {{that the rate of}} production is sufficient to totally replace the peripheral <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> pool within 4 - 5 d. This assumes first that there is no significant loss of cells between the stages of A. chain gene rearrangement and light chain gene rearrangement, and second that most of the newly produced surface membrane IgM + <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> are exported from the marrow. While the scale of export is difficult to assess because of the diffuse nature of the bone marrow, in situ labeling has shown that significant numbers do emerge into peripheral lymphoid organs (4, 5).

40|$|Continuous {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} rat interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) for 3 days provokes profound alterations of splenic architecture in LEW rats. The marginal {{zone of the}} white pulp is almost totally depleted of B lymphocytes and the follicles are reduced to small remnants. IgM kappa + plasmablasts and plasma cells increase substantially in the outer periarteriolar lymphatic sheath (PALS) and in the splenic red pulp. In addition, marginal metallophilic and marginal zone macrophages are augmented, partially by proliferation. It is discussed whether the activation and proliferation of these macrophages prevent replenishment of the marginal zone and follicles with <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> Changes in B lymphocyte and medullary macrophage distribution are also present in submandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes...|$|E
40|$|CD 22 is a B-cell-restricted transmembrane protein, {{which acts}} as a {{negative}} regulator of B-cell signalling. CD 22 also has lectin-like adhesive properties. When expressed on transfected fibroblasts, {{it is capable of}} mediating adhesion to other cells via recognition of cell-surface glycoconjugates terminating in α 2, 6 -linked sialic acids. In previous studies in the mouse, CD 22 was implicated as a bone marrow homing receptor for recirculating immunoglobulin D+ (IgD+) B cells through recognition of sialylated ligands on marrow sinusoidal endothelium. As the adhesive function of CD 22 can be masked when α 2, 6 -linked sialic acids are co-expressed at the cell surface, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> have unmasked forms of CD 22 that could be involved in bone marrow homing. Using α 2, 6 -sialyllactose coupled to biotinylated polyacrylamide as a probe for detection of unmasked CD 22, we showed that ≈ 2 – 5 % of IgD+ murine B cells in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were able to bind this synthetic ligand. In the bone marrow, however, the fraction of IgD+ B cells with unmasked CD 22 was increased by two- to fivefold. B cells from CD 22 -deficient mice were not stained with the polyacrylamide probe, confirming that staining of B cells in wild-type mice was caused by CD 22 and not by other potential sialic acid-binding lectins. In conclusion, we have identified a new subset of mature B cells in the mouse with unmasked CD 22. This subset of <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> may bind to CD 22 ligands on bone marrow sinusoidal endothelium, leading to their selective homing and subsequent enrichment in this tissue...|$|E

40|$|Secondary {{lymphoid tissue}} {{organogenesis}} requires tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin � (LT�). The role of TNF in <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> positioning and formation of follicular structure was studied {{by comparing the}} location of newly produced naive <b>recirculating</b> and antigen-stimulated <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> in TNF�/ � and TNF/LT��/ � mice. By creating radiation bone marrow chimeras from wild-type and TNF�/ � mice, formation of normal splenic <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> follicles was shown to depend on TNF production by radiation-sensitive cells of hemopoietic origin. Reciprocal adoptive transfers of mature <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> between wild-type and knockout mice indicated that normal follicular tropism of <b>recirculating</b> naive <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> occurs independently of TNF derived from the recipient spleen.

40|$|Dietary {{restriction}} (DR) delays ageing {{and extends}} life span. Both long- and short-term DR, {{as well as}} short-term fasting provide robust protection against many "neuronal and surgery related damaging phenomena" such as Parkinson's disease and ischemia-reperfusion injury. The exact mechanism behind this phenomenon {{has not yet been}} elucidated. Its anti-inflammatory actions prompted us to thoroughly investigate the consequences of DR and fasting on <b>B</b> and T <b>cell</b> compartments in primary and secondary lymphoid organs of male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. In BM we found that DR and fasting cause a decrease in the total <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> population and arrest early <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development, while increasing the number of <b>recirculating</b> mature <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> In the fasting group, a significant reduction in peripheral <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> counts was observed in both spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN). Thymopoiesis was arrested significantly at double negative DN 2 stage due to fasting, whereas DR resulted in a partial arrest of thymocyte development at the DN 4 stage. Mature CD 3 (+) T cell populations were increased in BM and decreased in both spleen and mLN. Thus, DR arrests <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development in the BM but increases the number of <b>recirculating</b> mature <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> DR also arrests maturation of T cells in thymus, resulting in depletion of mature T cells from spleen and mLN while recruiting them to the BM.

40|$|In rats, the {{glycoprotein}} Thy- 1 {{is expressed}} on recently bone marrow (BM) -generated <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> {{but not on}} mature <b>recirculating</b> follicular (RF) <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> Here we demonstrate that Thy- 1 (+) <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> consist of two phenotypically distinct, but developmentally related, populations: a population of newly formed (NF) <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> (IgM(br) -IgD(du)) {{that give rise to}} the second, less immature, Thy- 1 (+) population of so-called early <b>recirculating</b> follicular (ERF) <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> (Thy- 1 (+) IgM(du) IgD(br)) cells.

40|$|Despite earlier {{evidence}} to the contrary, it has recently been claimed that most B lymphocytes, including lymph node (LN) and thoracic duct B cells, are short-lived cells of recent marrow origin. To seek direct information on this question, we transferred unprimed LN or thoracic duct B cells from normal mice to xid mice, i. e., mice unresponsive to the T-independent antigen, trinitrophenyl (TNP) -Ficoll. At varying periods after B cell transfer the recipients were challenged with TNP- Ficoll; anti-TNP plaque-forming cells were assayed in the spleen 6 d later. The {{results showed that the}} B cell recipients retained responsiveness to TNP-Ficoll for at least 3 mo after transfer. Responsiveness increased within the first 3 wk but then remained relatively constant. These findings imply that, at least for TNP-Ficoll- reactive cells, B cells residing in LN and thoracic duct lymph are not short-lived cells of recent marrow.

Labeled <b>cells</b> in the <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> pool are identified in tissue sections using an mAb to BUdR. BUdR is shown to have no cytostatic effects at the dose used. Over a 5 -d period of infusion, only 20 % of the peripheral recirculating pool incorporate label (approximately 4 % per day); labeling over various periods indicates that the peripheral <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> pool turns over in approximately 4 wk.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{roles of}} the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl- 2, and pro-apoptotic Fas receptor-ligand interactions in cell death decisions during the development of B lymphocytes in mouse bone marrow and their maturation in the spleen have been evaluated in gene-modified and mutant mice. In Emu-bcl- 2 transgenic mice, the population dynamics and tissue organisation of phenotypically defined precursor <b>B</b> <b>cells,</b> have been evaluated by immunofluorescence labeling, mitotic arrest, BrdU uptake, flow cytometry and in vivo radioimmunolabeling combined with light and electron microscope radioautography. In bone marrow of Emu-bcl- 2 mice, the number and production rate of proliferating precursor <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> were increased. Immature B lymphocytes also increased in number, accumulating extravascularly around the central venous sinus, and the total rate of production of these rapidly-renewed IgM + <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> was increased. Phenotypically mature B lymphocytes and B lymphocytes having a slow turnover rate greatly increased in number. Many mature <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> were located within the lumen of venous sinusoids and in perisinusoidal locations. In the spleen, the usual population of rapidly-renewed IgM + <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> was undetectable. In contrast, both slowly renewing <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> and a further stable population of very long-lived <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> were greatly increased in numbers but had unchanged longevity. The rates of apoptosis among <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> subsets in short term bone marrow cultures from bcl- 2 transgenic mice were reduced, while bcl- 2 /scid mice accumulated many B 220 +mu- pro-B cells in bone marrow. The results indicate that overexpression of bcl- 2 inhibits apoptosis during <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development in bone marrow and promotes survival of newly-formed <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> in the spleen and their entry into a long-lived <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> pool.

Panhematopoietic or B cell–specific deletion of Zfx in the bone marrow blocked B-cell development at the pre-BCR selection checkpoint. Zfx deficiency in peripheral B cells caused accelerated B-cell turnover, depletion of mature <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells,</b> and delayed T-dependent antibody responses. In addition, the numbers {{and function}} of B- 1 cell lineage were reduced. Zfx-deficient B cells showed normal proximal BCR signaling, but impaired BCR-induced proliferation and survival in vitro. This was accompanied by aberrantly enhanced and prolonged integrated stress response and by delayed induction of cyclin D 2 and Bcl-xL proteins. Thus, Zfx restrains the stress response and couples antigen receptor signaling to cell expansion and maintenance during B-cell development and peripheral homeostasis.

40|$|IgE, {{forming an}} immune complex with small proteins, {{can enhance the}} {{specific}} antibody and CD 4 (+) T cell responses in vivo. The effects require the presence of CD 23 (Fc epsilon-receptor II) (+) B cells, which capture IgE-complexed antigens (Ag) in the circulation and transport them to splenic B cell follicles. In addition, also CD 11 c(+) cells, which do not express CD 23, are required for IgE-mediated enhancement of T cell responses. This suggests that some type of dendritic cell obtains IgE-Ag complexes from B cells and presents antigenic peptides to T cells. To elucidate {{the nature of this}} dendritic cell, mice were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) -specific IgE and OVA, and different populations of CD 11 c(+) cells, obtained from the spleens four hours after immunization, were tested for their ability to present OVA.

In addition, the humoral immune response to a T cell–dependent antigen is impaired. VCAM- 1 serves an important role for B cell localization and the T cell–dependent humoral immune response.

Ig-switched, IgD-IgM+ (IgM-only) and IgD+IgM+ cells, and that together they form the CD 27 + compartment of <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> We investigated the Ig isotype switch capacity of these cells. Peripheral blood B subsets were sorted and IgG subclass secretion in presence or absence of IL- 4 was compared in B cell assays which lead to Ig secretion in all (coculture with EL- 4 thymoma cells) or only in CD 27 + (CD 40 L stimulation) B cells. Already switched IgG+ B cells showed no significant sequential switch and IgM-only cells also had a low switch capacity, but IgD+CD 27 + switched as much as IgD+CD 27 - B cells to all IgG subclasses. Thus, in switched B cells some alterations compromising further switch options occur frequently; IgM-only cells may result from aborted switch. However, IgD+CD 27 + human B cells, extensively V(D) J mutated and "naive" regarding switch, build up a repertoire of B cells combining (1) novel cross-reactive specificities, (2) increased differentiation capacity (including after T-independent stimulation by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I) and (3) the capacity to produce appropriate isotypes when they respond to novel pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} brought {{significant}} breakthroughs {{in the understanding}} of tumor biology, related to discovery of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in acute myelogenous leukemia as well as in a number of solid tumors. This finding revealed that not all tumor cells are able to divide indefinitely, and that the bulk of tumor cells are expanded because of divisions and differentiation of CSC fraction. Although the CSCs identified in acute leukemia have a phenotype of early hematopoietic progenitors, it seems that CSCs in multiple myeloma (MM) may resemble the memory B cell fraction. Previous studies in patients with MM have documented the existence of cells without plasma cell characteristics expressing MM-type immunoglobulin genes—so-called “clonotypic” B cells. These cells have been characterized functionally and phenotypically as chemoresistant <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> They have been found to self-renew and to be capable of initiating MM growth in immunocompromised animals. Controversy exists as to whether these cells truly belong to an MM clone, however; they may represent only the remaining clones of premalignant B cells. The identification of MM stem cells responsible for the recurrence of MM is of primary importance in designing targeted therapies to definitely cure this disease. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on these hypothetical “MM stem cells. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of genes specifically in <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> {{is of great}} interest in both experimental immunology {{as well as in}} future clinical gene therapy. We have constructed a novel enhanced B cell-specific promoter (Igk- E) consisting of an immunoglobulin kappa (Igk) minimal promoter combined with an intronic enhancer sequence and a 30 enhancer sequence from Ig genes. The Igk- E promoter was cloned into a lentiviral vector and used to control {{expression of}} enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Transduction of murine B-cell lymphoma cell lines and activated primary splenic <b>B</b> <b>cells,</b> with IgK-E-eGFP lentivirus, resulted in expression of eGFP, as analysed by flow cytometry, whereas expression in non-B cells was absent. The specificity of the promoter was further examined by transducing Lin bone marrow with Igk-E-eGFP lentivirus and reconstituting lethally irradiated mice. After 16 weeks flow cytometry of lymphoid tissues revealed eGFP expression by CD 19 (+) cells, but not by CD 3 (+), CD 11 b(+), CD 11 c(+) or Gr- 1 (+) cells. CD 19 (+) cells were comprised of both marginal zone <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>recirculating</b> follicular <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> Activated human peripheral mononuclear cells were also transduced with Igk-E-eGFP lentivirus under conditions of selective B-cell activation. The Igk-E promoter was able to drive expression of eGFP only in CD 19 (+) cells, while eGFP was expressed by both spleen focus forming virus and cytomegalovirus constitutive promoters in CD 19 (+) and CD 3 (+) lymphocytes. These data demonstrate that in these conditions the Igk-E promoter is cell specific and controls efficient expression of a reporter protein in mouse and human <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the context of a}} lentiviral vector...|$|R
40|$|Although most {{chemotherapeutic}} {{agents are}} known to cause primarily reduction or suppression of immune responses, surprisingly {{little is known about}} the influence of cytostatic agents on lymphoid tissue compartments such as the splenic marginal zone. The marginal zone plays an important role in the defence against encapsulated bacteria, which are potential candidates for postchemotherapeutic infections. We studied the effect of three different cytostatic agents (cisplatin, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide) on <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> subpopulations in a rat model. Rats received a single dose of a single cytostatic agent and were sacrificed at different time points after treatment. Bone marrow, blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens were analysed by flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry. All three cytostatic agents showed severe bone marrow depression. CP and MTX showed only mild reduction of cell populations in the spleen. CyPh showed a severe reduction of <b>recirculating</b> follicular <b>B</b> (RF-B) <b>cells</b> and marginal zone <b>B</b> (MZ-B) <b>cells.</b> At day 24 most populations were already recovered, but RF-B cells and MZ-B cells were still reduced. The reduction of the marginal zone and late recovery may imply that, beside the overall increased infection risk due to neutropenia, patients treated with chemotherapy are at risk for developing infections from encapsulated bacteria for a considerable period of time after treatment, extending beyond the period of bone marrow depression...|$|R

Immune responses to T-independent and T-dependent antigens are affected. Lyn(-/-) mice fail to mediate an allergic response to IgE cross-linking, indicating that activation of LYN plays an indispensable role in Fc epsilon RI signaling. Lyn(-/-) mice have circulating autoreactive antibodies, and many show severe glomerulonephritis caused by the deposition of IgG immune complexes in the kidney, a pathology reminiscent of systemic lupus erythematosus. Collectively, these results implicate LYN as having an indispensable role in immunoglobulin-mediated signaling, particularly in establishing <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> tolerance...|$|R
40|$|While Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) {{is known}} to {{establish}} latency in the memory B-cell compartment, there is controversy {{as to whether the}} memory or the naïve B cell is the initial target for infection. Here we have explored the infectability of the B-cell subsets contained in peripheral blood and tonsils, as distinguished by their surface expression of the immunoglobulin isotypes that help to define naïve and memory pools. First we show that both CD 21 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules – respectively, the major receptor and co-receptor for EBV on B cells – are expressed at similar levels on blood and tonsillar B cells, irrespective of surface immunoglobulin class, indicating that each of the subsets demonstrate an equal potential, at least for infection. Then, following in vitro infection of total tonsillar B cells, we found that the relative frequencies of immunoglobulin (Ig) M-, IgG- and IgA-positive cells containing EBV-encoded Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen 5 (EBNA 5) protein at 48 hr were {{similar to those of the}} starting population. However, IgD expression was uniformly decreased, probably as a consequence of cellular activation.

40|$|Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF 2) {{controls}} T lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs by regulating sphingosin- 1 phosphate receptor 1 (S 1 Pr 1). Here we {{show that}} this is not the case for B cells. Instead, KLF 2 controls homeostasis of B cells in peripheral lymphatic organs and homing of plasma cells to the bone marrow, presumably by controlling the expression of β 7 -integrin. In mice with a B cell-specific deletion of KLF 2, S 1 Pr 1 expression on B cells was only slightly affected. Accordingly, all splenic B cell subsets including B 1 cells were present, but their numbers were increased with a clear bias for marginal zone (MZ) B cells. In contrast, fewer peyers patches harboring fewer B cells were found, and fewer B 1 cells in the peritoneal cavity as well as <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> in the bone marrow were detected. Upon thymus-dependent immunization, IgG titers were diminished, and antigen-specific plasma cells were absent in the bone marrow, although numbers of antigen-specific splenic plasmablasts were normal. KLF 2 plays also a role in determining the identity of follicular B cells, as KLF 2 -deficient follicular B cells showed calcium responses similar to those of MZ B cells and failed to down-regulate MZ B cell signature genes, such as CD 21 and CXCR 7...|$|E

Here we analyzed earlier stages of B lymphopoiesis in BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 -deficient mice. Examination of B-cell development in the bone marrow revealed that the numbers of transitional immature (B 220 + IgMhi) B cells were reduced and that B-cell apoptosis was increased. When in competition with wild-type cells, BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 −/− bone marrow cells exhibited defects in repopulating the bone marrow B-cell compartment and were unable to establish a presence in the periphery of host mice. The defective bone marrow populations in BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 −/− mice were rescued by conditional expression of a BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 transgene controlled by the tetracycline gene expression system. However, the restored populations did not restore the numbers of IgDhi B cells in the periphery, where the BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 transgene was not expressed. These results show that BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 −/− B cells exhibit multistage defects in B-cell development, including impaired production of transitional B cells and defective maturation of <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|E
40|$|Actively {{acquired}} self-tolerance and immunity are opposite {{processes that}} pose a central conun-drum: how do antigen receptors switch between signaling lymphocyte death or proliferation when engaged {{by the same}} antigen in different con-texts? This problem is exemplified by the sur-face immunoglobulin antigen receptors (BCRs) on mature, <b>recirculating</b> <b>B</b> lymphocytes. Upon binding antigen, these receptors trigger multi-ple rounds of <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> clonal proliferation {{in the context of}} infection or immunization but in-duce anergy and apoptosis when they bind continuously to antigens {{that are part of the}} body (self-antigens). Differential amplitude and duration of signaling to intracellular calcium, PI 3 kinase, MAP kinases, and the transcription factors NFAT, Jun/Fos, and NF-B corre-late with differential signaling of growth or death by the <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> antigen receptor (Healy and Goodnow, 1998). However, as with most tolerance/immunity checkpoints, the nature of the switch in mature <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> remains unre-solved because no individual genetic altera-tion of these pathways has yet been found to be sufficient to switch self-antigen–induced <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> death into proliferation. An experiment of nature that provides clues to this problem comes from a group of com-mon human cancers that includes non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Rui et al., 2011), in which a clone of <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> that has accumulated 30 damaging somatic muta-tions on average (Morin et al., 2011; Pasqualucci et al., 2011) becomes locked in an endless growth cycle. It is not yet known how these mutations individually or collectively affect the normal re-sponse to self-antigens, although multiple lines of evidence suggest that the growth of human <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> malignancies is promoted by continuous BCR stimulation by self-antigens (Cleary et al. ...|$|R
