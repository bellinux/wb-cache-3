The explosion created a 600-metre wide crater and caused the almost total destruction of the naval base and very severe damages to the nearby power station of Vasilikos. As {{a result of the}} damages sustained by the explosion, the Vasilikos power station, which accounted {{for more than half of}} all power production in Cyprus was disabled, causing a severe power shortage and <b>rotating</b> <b>power</b> cuts throughout the island.

50|$|By Lenz's law, an {{eddy current}} creates a {{magnetic}} field that opposes {{a change in the}} magnetic field that created it, and thus eddy currents react back on the source of the magnetic field. For example, a nearby conductive surface will exert a drag force on a moving magnet that opposes its motion, due to eddy currents induced in the surface by the moving magnetic field. This effect is employed in eddy current brakes which are used to stop <b>rotating</b> <b>power</b> tools quickly when they are turned off. The current flowing through the resistance of the conductor also dissipates energy as heat in the material. Thus eddy currents are a cause of energy loss in alternating current (AC) inductors, transformers, electric motors and generators, and other AC machinery, requiring special construction such as laminated magnetic cores or ferrite cores to minimize them. Eddy currents are also used to heat objects in induction heating furnaces and equipment, and to detect cracks and flaws in metal parts using eddy-current testing instruments.|$|E
5000|$|When Ramos {{was elected}} in May 1992, the Philippines had been {{experiencing}} widespread <b>rotating</b> <b>power</b> outages, known as [...] "brownouts", for nearly a year; this happened suddenly when growing customer demand exceeded the reliable supply of electricity, which was mostly provided by the government-owned Napocor. It had been caused by the age and condition of the existing power plants, {{as well as the}} long-term lack of continuing investment in the energy sector. During his State of the Nation address on July 27, 1992, he requested that the Congress enact a law that would create an Energy Department to plan and manage the Philippines' energy sector. Congress not only created the Department of Energy, but gave the president special emergency powers to resolve the power crisis. Using those powers, Ramos issued licenses to independent power producers (IPP) to provide additional power plants within 24 months. Ramos issued supply contracts that guaranteed the government would buy whatever power the IPPs produced under the contract; the contracted prices were denominated in U.S. dollars to entice foreign investment in local power plants. Following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis however, this structure became a problem, as the Philippine peso lost half of its value, and the local price for the contracted electricity essentially doubled. This resulted in the Philippine price of electricity becoming the second-highest in Asia, after Japan.|$|E

5000|$|Born at Livorno Vercellese (Kingdom of Sardinia), Ferraris {{gained a}} master's degree in {{engineering}} {{and became an}} assistant of technical physics near the Regal Italian Industrial Museum. Ferraris independently researched the rotary magnetic field in 1885. Ferraris experimented with different types of asynchronous electric motors. The research and his studies resulted {{in the development of}} an alternator, which may be thought of as an alternating-current motor operating in reverse, so as to convert mechanical (<b>rotating)</b> <b>power</b> into electric power (as alternating current). [...] On 11 March 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin (two months later Nikola Tesla gained , application filed October 12, 1887. Serial Number 252,132). These alternators operated by creating systems of alternating currents displaced from one another in phase by definite amounts, and depended on rotating magnetic field for their operation. The resulting source of polyphase power soon found widespread acceptance. The invention of the polyphase alternator is key in the history of electrification, as is the power transformer. These inventions enabled power to be transmitted by wires economically over considerable distances. Polyphase power enabled the use of water-power (via hydroelectric generating plants in large dams) in remote places, thereby allowing the mechanical energy of the falling water to be converted to electricity, which then could be fed to an electric motor at any location where mechanical work needed to be done. This versatility sparked the growth of power-transmission network grids on continents around the globe.|$|E

40|$|As {{finite element}} {{analysis}} (FEA) enters the engineering environment as a tested and reliable tool, more and more designs in diverse areas of engineering are being analyzed {{through the use of}} this software. FEA provides the ability to analyze the stresses and displacements of a part or assembly, as well as the reaction forces other elements are to impose. FEA can be applied to many engineering areas, one of which is couplings, yet minimal research has been conducted in this area. ^ Couplings provide the ability to transfer <b>rotating</b> <b>power</b> from a <b>rotating</b> <b>power</b> source to a <b>rotating</b> <b>power</b> consumer. This transfer of power not only develops stresses from the torque applied to the coupling, but also from the angular velocity in which it is applied. The stresses developed can be combated, not only by the coupling design, but also by the type of coupling. ^ This thesis guides the path through a coupling design based on the misalignment of the power supplier and consumer, as well as application, design life, fatigue life, wear life, service and safety factors. In addition to the factors governing the design, the material selection process through the use of Ashby charts is outlined to choose the proper material for the design and the environment. Lastly, the FEA model is described to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} mesh type, mesh size and boundary conditions applied to complete an effective FEA model. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the steady-state, dynamic and control aspects of new type of {{brushless}} configuration of a doubly-fed induction machine in which the slip rings and carbon brushes are replaced by <b>rotating</b> <b>power</b> electronics and a rotating exciter. The aim is to study the stability of this novel configuration of the generator under mechanical and grid disturbances for wind power applications. The derivation, development {{and analysis of the}} steady-state model of the brushless doubly-fed induction machine with a rotating excitor and the power electronic converters mounted on the shaft and rotating with it, is studied. The study is performed at rated power of the generator between ± 20 % slip range. Moreover unity power factor operation between ± 20 % speed range is also discussed. Furthermore dynamic modeling and control aspects of the generator are also analyzed. The controllers were designed using Internal Model Control principles and vector control methods were used in order to control the generator in a closed-loop system. It is shown that through the use of proper feedback control, the generator behaves in a stable state both at super-synchronous and sub-synchronous speeds. Moreover Low Voltage Ride Through of the generator during symmetrical and unsymmetrical voltage dips is also investigated. Passive Resistive Network strategy is employed for Low Voltage Ride Through of the generator during symmetrical voltage dips. On the other hand, Extended Vector Control is used in order to control the negative sequence currents during unsymmetrical voltage dips. Suppression of negative sequence currents is important as they cause extra heating in the windings and affects the lifetime of the mechanical and electrical components of the generator and system due to oscillations in power and torque. In addition to the above studies a steady-state model of a single-fed induction machine is also developed and investigated where the rotating exciter is removed and the rotor windings are short-circuited through the two <b>rotating</b> <b>power</b> electronic converters. In this way the slip power circulates in the rotor {{and with the help of}} the two rotating electronic converters, rotor current is used to magnetize the induction machine thereby improving the power factor. The steady state model is verified through experimental results. 20120914 Brushless Wind Generator with <b>Rotating</b> <b>Power</b> Electronic Converter...|$|E
