5000|$|Fluoride mouth <b>rinses</b> can be {{professional}}ly-applied by {{a dental}} professional or used at home. The most common fluoride compound used in mouth <b>rinse</b> is neutral sodium fluoride. Fluoride mouth <b>rinses</b> range from 0.05% to 0.2% (225-1,000 ppm) in concentration. The fluoride <b>rinse</b> with a 0.05% fluoride content {{is used for}} daily <b>rinsing,</b> while the <b>rinse</b> with 0.2% fluoride content is used for weekly <b>rinsing</b> and in school-based weekly <b>rinsing</b> programs. Fluoride at these concentrations is not strong enough for people {{at high risk for}} tooth decay. Regular use of a daily (230 ppm) or weekly (900 ppm) fluoride mouth <b>rinse</b> under supervision results into a reduction of tooth decay in children’s permanent teeth. [...] After a fluoride mouthrinse treatment, the fluoride in the mouthrinse is retained in the saliva which helps prevent tooth decay.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{is ongoing}} debate {{regarding}} the ideal sequence, volume, and concentration of irrigants, {{length of time}} for irrigation, and irrigation technique to achieve debridement of the root canal system. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the impact of the final <b>rinse</b> technique on smear layer removal ability of 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Methods: Sixteen single-rooted human teeth were instrumented and divided into 2 groups at the final <b>rinse</b> step according to the following final <b>rinse</b> techniques used: continuous <b>rinse</b> group, continuous <b>rinse</b> with EDTA during 3 minutes, and <b>rinse</b> and soaking group, <b>rinse</b> with 1 mL of EDTA, soaking of the canal for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, and <b>rinse</b> completion with the remaining 4 mL for 30 seconds. The specimens were split lengthwise and observed under scanning electron microscope. Results: Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests. The continuous <b>rinse</b> group presented more debris-free surfaces when compared with the <b>rinse</b> and soaking group (P. 05). Conclusions: It can be concluded that a continuous <b>rinse</b> with 5 mL of EDTA for 3 minutes can more efficiently remove the smear layer from root canal walls. (J Endod 2010; 36 : 512 - 514...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compared}} the staining potential of two experimental amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouth <b>rinses</b> (A and B), a phenolic/essential oil <b>rinse</b> (C) and a negative control, water, <b>rinse</b> (D). The {{study was a}} single centre, randomized, single-blind, four treatment crossover study design among healthy participants. Prior to each study period, participants received a dental prophylaxis. On the Monday of each period, subjects suspended oral hygiene, and under supervision, <b>rinsed</b> with the allocated mouth <b>rinse</b> immediately followed by a warm black tea solution at hourly intervals eight times a day for 4 days. On Friday, the area and intensity of staining on the teeth, the primary outcome measure and dorsum of tongue were assessed. This regimen was repeated for all the three subsequent treatment periods. <b>Rinse</b> B produced less stain than <b>rinse</b> A, but {{the difference was not}} significant (p[*]=[*] 0. 20). <b>Rinse</b> B produced significantly more stain than <b>rinse</b> C (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) and D (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). For tongue staining, <b>rinse</b> B produced significantly more staining than D (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) but not A or C. Overall, all test <b>rinses</b> produced more staining than placebo with an overall pattern for more staining with stannous formulations. Individuals using stannous or phenolic/essential oil mouth <b>rinse</b> formulations should be advised of the possible staining side effect and that this can be easily removed by a professional dental cleaning...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of a novel nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) desensitizing oral <b>rinse</b> to occlude dentine tubules compared to selected commercially available desensitizing oral <b>rinses.</b> Methods. 25 caries-free extracted molars were sectioned into 1 [*]mm thick dentine discs. The dentine discs (n= 25) were etched with 6 % citric acid for 2 minutes and <b>rinsed</b> with distilled water, prior to a 30 -second application of test and control oral <b>rinses.</b> Evaluation was by (1) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the dentine surface and (2) fluid flow measurements through a dentine disc. Results. Most of the oral <b>rinses</b> failed to adequately cover the dentine surface apart from the nHa oral <b>rinse.</b> However the hydroxyapatite, 1. 4 % potassium oxalate, and arginine/PVM/MA copolymer oral <b>rinses,</b> appeared to be relatively more effective than the nHA test and negative control <b>rinses</b> (potassium nitrate) in relation to a reduction in fluid flow measurements. Conclusions. Although the novel nHA oral <b>rinse</b> demonstrated the ability to occlude the dentine tubules and reduce the fluid flow measurements, some of the other oral <b>rinses</b> appeared to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in fluid flow through the dentine disc, in particular the arginine/PVM/MA copolymer oral <b>rinse...</b>|$|R

40|$|The present work {{reports a}} method to prevent the {{condensation}} defects on contact hole patterns by improving the <b>rinsing</b> process after a dry etching. In general, residual gases on the surface after the dry etching can be easily removed by using a DI water <b>rinse.</b> However, the residual gas can not be completely removed in high aspect ratio contact holes, resulting in the condensation defect. In this work, in order to completely remove the residual gas inside the contact holes, several <b>rinse</b> processes were employed such as a megasonic <b>rinse,</b> a sequential <b>rinse</b> and a hot temperature <b>rinse.</b> These proposed <b>rinse</b> methods were effective in eliminating the residual dry etching gases in the high aspect ratio contact holes and thus were able to remove condensation defects on contact holes...|$|R

The study {{was carried out}} by enumerating the total colony counts of bristles-adhered microbes after three weeks of normal oral hygiene followed by <b>rinsing</b> the toothbrushes with CHX, HX, tap water and deionized water independently following a strict planned schedule. <b>Rinsing</b> toothbrush with tap water was included in the study as a control due to the normal way of cleaning toothbrush after use in every home. Whereas, sterilized deionized water do not contain any ions, minerals and is microbes-free. The total colony counts of microbes obtained from the toothbrush <b>rinsed</b> with tap water, deionized water, CHX and HX were 62. 6 × 106 CFU mL- 1, 74. 4 × 106 CFU mL- 1, 2. 4 × 106 CFU mL- 1 and 7. 6 × 106 CFU mL- 1, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Clostridium sp. were isolated from toothbrush <b>rinsed</b> with tap water. Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus sp. were obtained from toothbrush <b>rinsed</b> with deionized water. Actinomyces sp. and Clostridium sp. were recovered from toothbrush <b>rinsed</b> with CHX and only Staphylococcus aureus was obtained from toothbrush <b>rinsed</b> with HX. Although toothbrush <b>rinsed</b> with mouth <b>rinses</b> containing antimicrobial agent such as CHX and HX still harbour microorganisms, but the microbial load has been very much lowered compared to the control toothbrush. Thus, this indicates that toothbrush <b>rinsing</b> with mouth <b>rinse</b> after the normal oral hygiene is very convenient and cost effective to reduce toothbrush contamination...|$|R

40|$|Bone {{defects in}} {{revision}} hip surgery can be reconstructed with impacted morselized bone grafts. <b>Rinsing</b> these trabecular allografts may enhance graft incorporation by washing out immunogenic factors present in blood, marrow, and fat. However, {{it has been}} proposed that impaction of the graft releases biologically active factors, which can provide sufficient activity to stimulate new bone formation. <b>Rinsing</b> before impaction could enhance bone allograft incorporation, but <b>rinsing</b> after impaction could diminish the incorporation process of impacted bone graft. To study the effect of <b>rinsing</b> and impaction of morselized bone grafts on bone ingrowth, a bone chamber study was done in goats. Autografts and allografts were divided into three treatment groups: (A) impacted; (B) <b>rinsed</b> and impacted; and (C) <b>rinsed,</b> impacted, <b>rinsed,</b> and impacted again. Ten goats received three bone chambers in each proximal tibia. The chambers were filled with either allograft or autograft, yielding six different implants per goat. After 6 weeks, histologic analyses were done and bone and tissue ingrowth were measured. New bone and total tissue ingrowth were higher in autografts than in allografts, especially in the nonrinsed group. With <b>rinsing,</b> total tissue ingrowth increased in the allograft group to approach that of autografts. <b>Rinsing</b> after impaction did not additionally alter bone ingrowth.
