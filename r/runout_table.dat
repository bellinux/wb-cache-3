50|$|Online {{computer}} control of steel making processes became a reality {{with the first}} use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was {{to set up the}} initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the <b>runout</b> <b>table.</b> The finishing train started running under continuous {{computer control}} on November 1, 1962.|$|E

Accelerated cooling has been implemented in hot strip mills to reduce the heat loss on the delay table, to achieve the required coiling temperature and to obtain the desirable grain structure. Appropriate cooling application with better understanding of strip cooling characteristic guarantees the precise temperature and cooling rate control.

40|$|The key {{metallurgical}} parameters {{affecting the}} incidence of coil collapse (soft slump) of C-Mn steels has been investigated using industrial data and laboratory simulation. <b>Runout</b> <b>table</b> (ROT) cooling/coiling simulations were performed on a Gleeble 1500 D to study transformation before and during coiling of thin strip. For low C (< 0. 07 %) grades, coiling temperatures above 650 ˚C coupled with high nitrogen contents decreased the transformation-end temperature, Ar 1, and increased collapse. Coiling temperatures above the Ar 1 for ROT cooling increased both dilation and the time to complete transformation during coiling. These effects correlated with industrial conditions where a high frequency of coil collapse was observed...|$|E
40|$|In a {{hot strip}} mill, the strip is cooled by {{spraying}} water from {{top and bottom}} on the <b>runout</b> <b>table</b> (ROT), before the strip is coiled. The desired mechanical properties and metallurgical structure of the strip is achieved by controlling the cooling rate and temperature of the strip on the ROT. This paper describes a novel real time simulator for ROTs. The simulator has been implemented in parallel on a multi-transputer system. The proposed simulator can interact with a controller in real time and {{can serve as a}} valuable design tool for evaluating the performance of controllers for ROTS. In addition, the simulator {{can be used as a}} tool for the design of new ROT layouts as well...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{important}} steps to control the quality in steel hot rolling is the <b>Runout</b> <b>Table</b> (ROT) Cooling. In this investigation, the heat transfer of water jets impinging on a hot flat steel plate was studied under temperatures below the boiling point to understand the convection heat transfer phenomena which is a major step preceding the boiling. Single axisymmetric jet and a pair of interacting jets are simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The RANS model under steady and transient conditions as well as the k-ɛ turbulence model are used for both 2 D axisymmetric and 3 D simulations. The water flow rate influence on the jets cooling characteristics is investigated. Two sets of boundary conditions, constant temperature and constant heat flux were applied at the surface of the steel plate and evaluated. The single jet numerical results are successfully compared to published data based on measurements and analytical models. The two jets thermal performance was found to be unaffected because the jets are too far from each other to generate any additional thermal interaction...|$|E
40|$|The CANMET-McGill Mathematical Model {{has been}} {{expanded}} and improved {{to provide a}} more comprehensive predictive tool for simulation of temperature evolution in the hot rolling of steel. The model uses a Windows(TM) -based, user-friendly, graphical interface and the explicit finite-difference method in two dimensions to simulate the rolling of flat product. Data input options were expanded to allow an initial temperature gradient in the steel to be rolled, the inclusion of a <b>runout</b> <b>table</b> in the calculations, specific chemical compositions and a choice of emissivity values. A novel, chemistry-dependent thermal conductivity term was developed to account for the variation in heat conduction through the thickness of the steel and to ensure that the temperature of the entire cross-section is accurately predicted. In addition, the model now calculates a heat of transformation for phase changes from austenite to ferrite, pearlite and bainite. An automated self-calibration module was included to facilitate the calibration of the model's predictions to empirically obtained temperature setpoints. The model's temperature predictions were validated against both industrial and laboratory data with excellent results...|$|E
40|$|Cooling from {{impinging}} water jets in <b>runout</b> <b>table</b> (ROT) processing {{depends on}} the fluid flow and depth of water accumulated in the water pool that forms {{on the surface of}} the moving steel strip. This effect is investigated with a three-dimensional (3 -D) computational model of fluid flow, pressure, and free surface motion for realistic banks of nozzles within the flow rate region of the ROT process (2400 to 9200 L/min m 2). The volume of fluid (VOF) method with the high-resolution interface capturing (HRIC) scheme was implemented to handle the free surface flow of the water jet, and the k-emodel was used for turbulence. The governing equations are discretized by a second-order accurate scheme and solved with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Fluent. The model was validated with experimental measurements of free-surface shape and hydraulic jump position for a single water jet impinging onto a moving surface that included turbulent flow and multiphase regions of mixed bubbles and water. For banks of water jets impinging onto the surface of the moving strip in a realistic ROT, the free surface shape, velocity, and pressure distributions have been calculated for various flow rates and surface widths. A deeper water pool is expected on the moving surface with increasing water flow rate and with increasing width. In addition, as the water pool height increases, the pressure variations on the moving surface below the water jets decrease. A simple relation to predict the water pool height from the water flow rate per unit area and strip width has been derived. The predictions agree well with both the 3 -D calculations and measurements from water model experiments...|$|E
