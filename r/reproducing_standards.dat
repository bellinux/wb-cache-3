In this regime, the instantaneous laser phase dependence differs dramatically from both quasistatic tunneling and multiphoton limits.

By means of the permutation group of N= 3 elements, we first propose a measure which satisfactorily reproduces the entanglement values {{reported in the literature}} for tripartite entangled states. We then give a measure for the general, multipartite entanglement case and show that this corrects some inconsistencies previously reported in Refs. [2 - 4].

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{holographic}} description of four-dimensional single-scalar inflationary universes, and show how cosmological observables, {{such as the}} primordial power spectrum, are encoded in the correlation functions of a three-dimensional QFT.

In the opposite limit, wherein gravity is strongly coupled at early times, we propose a holographic description in terms of perturbative large N QFT.

40|$|Using the Cartan {{formulation}} of General Relativity, we construct a well defined lattice-regularized theory capable to describe large non-perturbative quantum fluctuations {{of the frame}} field (or the metric) and of the spin connection. To that end we need to present the tetrad by a composite field built as a bilinear combination of fermion fields. The theory is explicitly invariant under local Lorentz transformations and, in the continuum limit, under general covariant transformations, or diffeomorphisms. Being well defined for large and fast varying fields at the ultraviolet cutoff, the theory simultaneously has chances of <b>reproducing</b> <b>standard</b> General Relativity in the infrared continuum limit.

Most home analog video equipment record a signal in (roughly) composite format: LaserDiscs store a true composite signal, while consumer videotape formats (including VHS and Betamax) and lesser commercial and industrial tape formats (including U-Matic) use modified composite signals (generally known as color-under). On playback, these devices often give the user the option to output the baseband signal or to modulate it onto a VHF or UHF frequency compatible with a TV tuner (i.e., appearing on a selected TV channel).

40|$|AbstractLattice regularizations of the bosonic string do {{not allow}} us to probe the tachyon. This has often been viewed as the reason why these {{theories}} have never managed to make any contact to standard continuum string theories when the dimension of spacetime is larger than two. We study the continuum string theory in large spacetime dimensions where simple mean field theory is reliable. By keeping carefully the cutoff we show that precisely the existence of a tachyon makes it possible to take a scaling limit which reproduces the lattice-string results. We compare this scaling limit with another scaling limit which <b>reproduces</b> <b>standard</b> continuum-string results. If the people working with lattice regularizations of string theories are akin to Gulliver they will view the standard string-world as a Lilliputian world no larger than a few lattice spacings...|$|R
40|$|We compare {{different}} Polyakov loop actions yielding effective {{descriptions of}} finite-temperature SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on the lattice.

To keep things simple we limit ourselves to nearest-neighbor interactions. Some truncations involving the most relevant characters are studied within a novel mean-field approximation. Using inverse Monte-Carlo techniques based on exact geometrical Schwinger-Dyson equations we determine the effective couplings of the Polyakov loop actions. Monte-Carlo simulations of these actions reveal that the mean-field analysis is a fairly good guide to the physics involved.
