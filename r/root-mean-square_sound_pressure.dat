40|$|Porous metal {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in noise control with high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> applications such as aircraft engine liners and combustion chambers for rocket engines due to their excellent performance of sound absorption characteristics and distinguished advantages in heat resistance, lightness, and stiffness. Understanding the effect of <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> on the acoustic properties of these materials is crucial when attempting to predict silencer performance. In this article, we experimentally investigate the sound absorption characteristics of porous metal materials at high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level. The effects of material parameters on the sound absorption characteristics of porous metal materials under high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level are further explored experimentally. Measurements are carried out by using a standard impedance tube that has been modified to accommodate <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level of up to 150 [*]dB. The experimental results show that {{with the increase in}} <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level, the effect of <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level on the sound absorption characteristics yields different variation regularities in different frequencies. The sound absorption performance of porous metal materials increases with the increase in <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level in low frequency, which is reasonably consistent with the theoretical results. Under high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level, the <b>sound</b> absorption characteristics are significantly dependent upon the material parameters such as the metal fiber diameter, the material porosity, and the material thickness.

Acoustic dose-behavioral response relationships were determined for sea bass in a pool exposed for 20 min to pile driving sounds at seven mean received <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels [SPLrms; range: 130 - 166 dB re 1 μPa; single strike sound exposure level (SEL ss) range: 122 - 158; 6 dB steps]. Initial responses (sudden, short-lived changes in swimming speed and direction) and sustained responses (changes in school cohesion, swimming depth, and speed) were quantified. The 50 % initial response threshold occurred at an SEL ss of 131 dB re 1 μPa 2 s for 31 cm fish and 141 dB re 1 μPa 2 s for 44 cm fish; the small fish thus reacted to lower SEL ss than the large fish. Analysis showed that there is no evidence, even at the highest sound level, for any consistent sustained response to sound exposure by the study animals. If wild sea bass are exposed to pile driving sounds at the levels used in the present study, there are unlikely to be any adverse effects on their ecology, because the initial responses after the onset of the piling sound observed in this study were short-lived. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of sonar signals in a surface ducted environment, or {{in a shallow}} ocean, is affected by reflection losses at the ocean surface, when wind action or swell causes the surface to be roughened. Under these circumstances, the amplitude of the specular reflection of sound at the ocean surface is reduced {{by a number of}} complex phenomena, including: the sea surface shape; acoustic shadowing of parts of the surface to sound incident at small angles; diffraction of sound into the shadow zones; and bubble formation from white-caps. Recent work has shown that the inclusion of these effects within a ray model of transmission is a formidable prospect, as ray theory cannot describe all the phenomena explicitly, and the inclusion of acoustic wave effects in combination with a ray model is required. This paper addresses several of the complexities, in the search for a comprehensive solution to this modelling issue. In particular, the appropriateness of the Small-Slope Approximation roughness model used by Williams et al, (JASA, 116, Oct. 2004) is investigated, using a Parabolic Equation (PE) model, Also, the refraction near the ocean surface caused by wind-induced bubbles (e. g.

40|$|AbstractMost recent {{research}} and monitoring of under-water “soundscapes” {{has focused on}} marine systems in open water conditions. Here we present the first long-term assessment of the diel and seasonal patterns of a fresh-water aquatic soundscape under-ice cover. Acoustic data recorded in Yellowknife Bay, Great Slave Lake in Canada's Northwest Territories, measured the under-ice soundscape near an ice road and airport. From December to late January, the soundscape consisted of geophony from ice cracking and anthrophony from snowmobiles, aircraft, and road vehicles. In late January, burbot spawning calls began and added a localized biophony source to the soundscape that increased the total sound pressure level due {{to an increase in}} sound levels in the 10 – 425 Hz frequency band. The median 1 min <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level (rms SPL) in the period without burbot biophony was 90. 3 dB re 1 μPa. The measured hourly rms SPL was negatively correlated with air temperature in the 200 – 800 Hz band but positively correlated with average hourly wind speed in the 800 – 8000 Hz band. The nightly mean rms SPL was 88 dB re 1 μPa and increased to 96 dB re 1 μPa in late afternoon. This diel cycle had a strong positive correlation with the number of minutes per hour where ice-road vehicles were detected. Further work is recommended to quantify the soundscape in deep-water areas of large lakes and to include particle motion. Such information will enable the assessment of cumulative impacts of anthrophony and geophony on aquatic biota...|$|E

40|$|Understanding female mate {{preference}} {{is important for}} determining the strength and direction of sexual trait evolution. The <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level (SPL) acoustic signalers use is often an important predictor of mating success because higher <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels are detectable at greater distances. If females are more attracted to signals produced at higher <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels, then the potential fitness impacts of signalling at higher <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels should be elevated beyond what would be expected from detection distance alone. Here we manipulated the <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level of cricket mate attraction signals to determine how female phonotaxis was influenced. We examined female phonotaxis using two common experimental methods: spherical treadmills and open arenas. Both methods showed similar results, with females exhibiting greatest phonotaxis towards loud <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels relative to the standard signal (69 vs. 60 dB SPL) but showing reduced phonotaxis towards very loud <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level signals relative to the standard (77 vs. 60 dB SPL).

40|$|Underwater sound {{consists}} of particle motion and <b>sound</b> <b>pressure.</b> Due to technical difficulties only <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is measured in}} most sound impact studies on fish and invertebrates. However, <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> alone may not adequately reflect the actual acoustic stimulus, especially in tanks, basins and near-field conditions. To test the acoustic validity of different experimental settings, we measured particle motion (in velocity) and <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> soundscapes of two set-ups for sound impact studies on fish: an outdoor floating pen and an indoor basin. During sound exposure, there was a gradient in particle velocity {{as well as in}} the outdoor floating pen and a standing wave in the basin.

This condition is not anticipated during the east span SFOBB new east span construction. The reduction in <b>sound</b> <b>pressures</b> provided by the bubble curtain system ranged considerably. The direct reduction in <b>sound</b> <b>pressures,</b> which is evaluated by comparing bubble curtain ON and OFF measurements, for Piles 1 and 2 was 6 to 17 dB for peak pressures and 3 to 10 dB for RMS <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels. Piles 1 and 2 were located next to each other. Reductions at Pile 3, which was in shallower water, were over 20 dB for both peak <b>pressures</b> and RMS <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels on the north side.
