5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E

Serge and Kid's fates are ultimately revealed to find their <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> events of Chrono Trigger.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E

5|$|Most state-run {{radio and}} {{television}} stations are based in Ankara, but Istanbul is the primary hub of Turkish media. The industry has its <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former Ottoman capital, where the first Turkish newspaper, Takvim-i Vekayi (Calendar of Affairs), was published in 1831.

5|$|Much {{of modern}} popular music can trace its roots to the {{emergence}} in the late 19th century of African American blues {{and the growth of}} gospel music in the 1920s. The African American basis for popular music used elements derived from European and indigenous musics. There are also strong African <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music tradition of the original white settlers, such as country and bluegrass. The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the Ukrainian, Irish, Scottish, Polish, Hispanic, and Jewish communities, among others.|$|E

5|$|The AFM {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} Pentecostal {{movement}} is South Africa with <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Azusa Street Revival, the Holiness Movement teachings of Andrew Murray and the teachings of John Alexander Dowie. The AFM had an interracial character when it started, but, as in American Pentecostalism, this interracial cooperation was short-lived. The decades from the 1950s to the 1980s were marked by the implementation of apartheid. After 1994, the white AFM moved rapidly towards unification with the black churches. By 1996, all the AFM churches were united in a single multi-racial church.|$|E
5|$|The Assemblies of God has <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pentecostal {{revival in}} the early 20th century.

The new church was named the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. It was a predecessor to the contemporary Presbyterian Church (USA).|$|E
