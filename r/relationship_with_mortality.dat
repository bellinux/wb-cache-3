This cohort study assessed {{the relationship between the}} lowest ionised calcium concentration during the 24 -hour period of critical bleeding and the hospital mortality of 352 consecutive patients, while adjusting for diagnosis, acidosis, coagulation results, transfusion requirements and use of recombinant factor VIIa. Hypocalcaemia was common (mean concentrations 0. 77 mmol/l, SD 0. 19) and had a linear, concentration-dependent <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>mortality</b> (odds ratio [OR] 1. 25 per 0. 1 mmol/l decrement, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 04 to 1. 52; P= 0. 02). Hypocalcaemia accounted for 12. 5 % of the variability and was more important than the lowest fibrinogen concentrations (10. 8 %), acidosis (7. 9 %) and lowest platelet counts (7. 7 %) in predicting hospital mortality. The amount of fresh frozen plasma transfused (OR 1. 09 per unit, 95 % CI: 1. 02 to 1. 17; P= 0. 02) and acidosis (OR 1. 45 per 0. 1 decrement, 95 % CI: 1. 19 to 1. 72; P= 0. 01) were associated with the occurrence of severe hypocalcaemia (< 0. 8 mmol/l).

40|$|Studies {{of obesity}} and its <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>mortality</b> risk in older persons have yielded {{conflicting}} results.

Methods 1230 adult patients admitted to our hospital from 2005 to 2009 for CAP were reviewed retrospectively. ResultsHospital mortality rose sharply from 0. 3 %, 1. 0 % and 3. 3 %, respectively, for patients with none, one and two minor criteria to 10. 5 % for patients with three minor criteria. Arterial oxygen pressure/fraction inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2)  ≤  250  mm Hg, confusion, and uremia had the strongest association <b>with</b> <b>mortality</b> (Odds ratio, 22. 162, 22. 148, 16. 343; respectively).

Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores and costs increased significantly with the number of minor criteria present. Uremia and PaO 2 /FiO 2  ≤  250  mm Hg were most strongly associated with SOFA scores [rank correlation coefficient (rs), 0. 352, 0. 336; respectively]. PaO 2 /FiO 2  ≤  250  mm Hg and confusion were in closest relation to hospital length of stay (LOS) (rs, 0. 114, 0. 114; respectively).

Our objectives, therefore, were to a) quantify the association between bAA administration and mortality in feedlot cattle, and b) explore those variables that may confound or modify this association. Three datasets were acquired for analysis: one included information from randomized and controlled clinical trials of the bAA ractopamine hydrochloride, while the other two were observational data on zilpaterol hydrochloride administration to large numbers of cattle housed, fed, and cared for using routine commercial production practices in the U.

30|$|BNP {{has been}} {{established}} to be a predictor of mortality {{in a variety of}} chronic and acute conditions, including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndromes [36, 37], and acute pulmonary embolism [4]. In critically ill patients, the prognostic value of elevated BNP is less clear. In several studies, BNP has been predictive of outcome in patients with cardiogenic and septic shock [7, 38, 39]. However, in a mixed population of patients who present with severe sepsis and septic shock, the results are inconsistent; some studies have shown BNP to be predictive of mortality [40], others have not [41]. Similarly, in patients presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure due to CHF or ALI, the studies have shown conflicting results. Jefic et al. [9] showed no relationship of BNP with mortality in 41 critically ill patients with respiratory failure (909 ± 264 in survivors vs. 841 ± 171 in nonsurvivors). Rana et al. [42] in a study of 204 patients who presented with pulmonary edema found that BNP levels did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors (median 528 vs. 774, p = 0.24; O. Gajic, personal communication). Our data are consistent with those findings. In contrast, in a study by Karmpaliotis et al. [10], BNP showed a strong graded <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>mortality</b> risk in 79 subjects admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. In the subgroup of patients with ALI (n = 51), this relationship did not reach statistical significance but the trend was present (p = 0.07). We are unable to fully explain the discrepancies between these studies, but these may be partially attributed to different patient populations, study designs, and statistical analyses. We found interesting that Karmpaliotis et al. elected to analyze the mortality data using tertiles of BNP; however, using this method to analyze our data did not change our results. Also, in their study, 52 % of the patients with ALI were in shock, and BNP has been shown to predict mortality in patients with shock. Because the authors did not stratify for the presence of shock, it is possible that shock could have accounted for the significant <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>mortality.</b>|$|E

New data from the Progetto Veneto Anziani (PRO. V. A.) study were also included. Results: From the PRO. V. A. study (N= 2, 927), there was no significant increase in CVD mortality risk for participants with any-joint OA (N= 1, 858) compared to non-OA (all-cause, HR= 0. 95; 95 % CI: 0. 77 - 1. 15; CVD, HR= 1. 12; 95 % CI: 0. 82 - 1. 54). On meta-analysis, seven studies (OA: 10, 018 /non-OA: 18, 541), with a median 12 -year follow-up, reported no increased risk of any-cause <b>mortality</b> in those <b>with</b> OA (HR= 1. 10; 95 % CI: 0. 97 - 1. 25). After removing data on hand OA, a significant association between OA and mortality was observed (HR= 1. 18; 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 1. 28). There was a significant higher risk of overall mortality for (1) studies conducted in Europe, (2) patients with multi-joint OA; and (3) a radiological diagnosis of OA. OA was associated with significantly higher CVD mortality (HR= 1. 21; 95 % CI: 1. 10 - 1. 34). Conclusions: People with OA are at increased risk of death due to CVD. The <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> overall <b>mortality</b> is less clear and may be moderated by the presence of hand OA...|$|R
