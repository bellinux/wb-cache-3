25|$|Rodman's Neck {{was part}} of the {{historic}} Pell property, and since the city acquired the peninsula in 1888, it has been used for multiple purposes. A dock for the eastern shore of Rodman's Neck was approved in 1891, with funds appropriated for said dock. The land was first used as a United States Army training location from 1917 to 1919, during World War I, when it was used by the 105th and 108th Infantry Regiments. It became parkland in the 1920s, but was seldom utilized. In 1930, the peninsula was incorporated as a part of Camp Mulrooney, a summer camp for the NYPD, and was used in that sense until 1936. The Army used Rodman's Neck again in the 1950s during the Cold War, building a <b>radar</b> <b>fire</b> control center there. In 1959, the peninsula's operation was transferred to the NYPD who built the current firing range at the peninsula's southern tip. In the 2000s, officials proposed to close the now-outdated Rodman's Neck facility and move all operations to a new police academy in College Point, Queens, but due to shortages in funding, it was deemed cheaper to renovate Rodman's Neck for $275 million.|$|E
500|$|The Mk 13 FC Radar {{supplied}} present target range, and {{it showed}} the fall of shot around the target so the Gunnery Officer could correct the system's aim with range and deflection spots put into the Rangekeeper. It could also automatically track the target by controlling the director's bearing power drive. Because of <b>radar,</b> <b>Fire</b> Control systems are able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy during the day, night, or inclement weather. This was demonstrated in November 1942 when the battleship [...] engaged the Imperial Japanese Navy battlecruiser Kirishima at a range of [...] at night. The engagement left Kirishima in flames, and she was ultimately scuttled by her crew. This capability gave the United States Navy a major advantage in World War II, as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control {{to the level of}} the US Navy and were at a significant disadvantage.

500|$|On August 31, 1940, Bush {{met with}} Henry Tizard, and {{arranged}} {{a series of}} meetings between the NDRC and the Tizard Mission, a British scientific delegation. [...] At a meeting On September 19, 1940, the Americans described Loomis and Compton's microwave research. They had an experimental 10cm wavelength short wave radar, but admitted that it did not have enough power and that they were at a dead end. Taffy Bowen and John Cockcroft of the Tizard Mission then produced a cavity magnetron, a device far in advance of anything the Americans had ever seen, with an amazing power output of around 10 KW at 10cm, enough to spot the periscope of a surfaced submarine at night from an aircraft. To exploit the invention, Bush decided to create a special laboratory. The NDRC allocated the new laboratory a budget of $455,000 for its first year. Loomis suggested that the lab should be run by the Carnegie Institution, but Bush convinced him that it would best be run by MIT. The Radiation Laboratory, as it came to be known, tested its airborne radar from an Army B-18 on March 27, 1941. By mid-1941, it had developed SCR-584 radar, a mobile <b>radar</b> <b>fire</b> control system for antiaircraft guns.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-April, the {{destroyer}} underwent a tender availability alongside [...] {{during which the}} DASH system was removed. Although unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would return to warships in the future, the DASH system's immature technology proved too unreliable for continued operation. Carpenter spent {{the next few months}} conducting refresher training in preparation for a major fleet exercise that summer. Underway for San Diego, California and STRIKEX 1-68 on 14 June, Carpenter carried out shore bombardment, anti-surface and anti-cruise missile operations in the waters off southern California until 2 July. She then steamed to Santa Monica, California, for a port visit before returning to Pearl Harbor. Following a series of pre-deployment tests and inspections, and a tender availability alongside Bryce Canyon, Carpenter received upgrades to her <b>radar</b> <b>fire</b> control systems in preparation for her next Vietnam tour. After testing the new equipment in early September, Carpenter got underway for another Far East deployment on 17 September.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1950s the US Army {{had given up}} on the SPAAG concept, {{considering}} all gun-based weapons to be useless against modern aircraft. This belief was generally held by many forces, and the anti-aircraft role turned almost exclusively to missile systems. The Soviet Union remained an outlier, beginning development of a new SPAAG in 1957, which emerged as the ZSU-23-4 in 1965. This system included search-and-track <b>radars,</b> <b>fire</b> control, and automatic gun-laying, greatly increasing its effectiveness against modern targets. The ZSU-23 proved very effective when used in concert with SAMs; the presence of SAMs forced aircraft to fly low to avoid their radars, placing them within range of the ZSUs.|$|R

At 03:55, California and Tennessee joined in, firing a total of 63 and 69 14 in shells, respectively. <b>Radar</b> <b>fire</b> control allowed these American battleships to hit targets from a distance at which the Japanese battleships with their inferior fire control systems could not return fire.|$|E

The tail gun was aimed and fired automatically by the new AN/APG-15B <b>radar</b> <b>fire</b> control system that detected the approaching enemy plane and made all the necessary calculations. The elimination of the turrets and the associated General Electric computerized gun system increased the top speed of the Superfortress to 364 mph at 25,000 feet and made the B-29B suitable for fast, unescorted hit-and-run bombing raids and photographic missions.|$|E
