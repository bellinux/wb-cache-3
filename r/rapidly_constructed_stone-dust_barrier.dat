40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} for the Avian Flu (H 5 N 1) virus to become a pandemic disease has mandated an examination of public health surveillance, response and containment strategies for developing countries. We have developed a Multi Agent System Simulation system known as IDESS (Infectious Disease Epidemic Simulation System) that <b>rapidly</b> <b>constructs</b> infectious disease models from existing data for any geographical region. This approach addresses an important area of infectious disease outbreak management, as it allows public health professionals to <b>rapidly</b> <b>construct</b> a simulation model for any geographic region and observe how an infectious disease spreads between communities. Such simulations will facilitate testing of containment strategies for rapid response. ...|$|R

40|$|It remains {{challenging}} for information visualization novices to <b>rapidly</b> <b>construct</b> visualizations during exploratory data analysis. We conducted an exploratory laboratory {{study in which}} information visualization novices explored fictitious sales data by communicating visualization specifications to a human mediator, who <b>rapidly</b> <b>constructed</b> the visualizations using commercial visualization software. We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. From our observations, we derived abstract models that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications. Our findings support the need for tools that suggest potential visualizations and support iterative refinement, that provide explanations and help with learning, and that are tightly integrated into tool support for the overall visual analytics process...|$|R
