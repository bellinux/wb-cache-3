25|$|The general {{pattern of}} plumage in adult gulls {{is a white}} body with a darker mantle; {{the extent to which}} the mantle is darker varies from pale grey to black. A few species vary in this, the ivory gull is entirely white, and some like the lava gull and Heermann's gull have partly or entirely grey bodies. The wingtips of most species are black, which {{improves}} their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> and tear, usually with a diagnostic pattern of white markings. The head of a gull may be covered by a dark hood or be entirely white. The plumage of the head varies by breeding season; in nonbreeding dark-hooded gulls, the hood is lost, sometimes leaving a single spot behind the eye, and in white-headed gulls, nonbreeding heads may have streaking.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} {{application}} of [...] was abrasive and cutting tools. Bulk, monolithic silicon nitride {{is used as}} a material for cutting tools, due to its hardness, thermal stability, and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear.</b> It is especially recommended for high speed machining of cast iron. Hot hardness, fracture toughness and thermal shock resistance mean that sintered silicon nitride can cut cast iron, hard steel and nickel based alloys with surface speeds up to 25 times quicker than those obtained with conventional materials such as tungsten carbide. The use of [...] cutting tools has had a dramatic effect on manufacturing output. For example, face milling of gray cast iron with silicon nitride inserts doubled the cutting speed, increased tool life from one part to six parts per edge, and reduced the average cost of inserts by 50%, as compared to traditional tungsten carbide tools.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Physical modelling of isothermal annealing for a transition point of 520 - 620 °C was carried out using a Gleeble simulator.

The need for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> both adhesive and abrasive wear is often greatest in wear rings and similar components, where close clearances must be maintained between rotating and stationary components.

Traditionally, pump manufacturers have specified hardened martensitic stainless steels for critical wear parts, maintaining a 50 - 100 Brinell hardness difference between rotating and stationary components as experience has shown this is adequate to prevent galling. Coatings have been used to a limited extent, primarily in specialized applications, such as the plungers in reciprocating pumps.
