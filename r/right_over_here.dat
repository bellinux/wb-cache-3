It was not a surprise to him that she spoiled her courier; she naturally would spoil her courier. But civilisation begins at home, he brooded; and the incident threw an ironic light on her desire to get into society. It failed, however, to divert her thoughts from the subject she was discussing with her friend, for as Max ascended the box and the carriage went on its way she threw out another note of defiance. “If once I’m all <b>right</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> I guess I can make New York do something!

People get drunk and turn into themselves in a way, and they go to experience some kind of emotion. But it's not always about fun. There's a destructive side to it. But I'm more into the empowerment of going out, because it's always been the place where I could be myself and get inspired. Even if I'm sad, dancing is a way to let stuff out." ...|$|E

It is pointed out that polarization observables represent an attractive alternative for absolute electronuclear two-nucleon knockout measurements. In the polarization transfer P-t' for ((e) <b>over</b> <b>right</b> arrow,e'(p) <b>over</b> <b>right</b> arrow p), the effect of central short-range correlations is predicted to be large {{while at the same time}} the final-state interaction effects are small.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} fact that land use {{regulations}} can directly affect assignment and reassignment of property <b>rights</b> <b>over</b> land, the authors examine the link between land use regulation and property rights in Serbia by analyzing relevant literature, as well as legislation and regulations. Current legal framework that regulates property <b>rights</b> <b>over</b> land is inconsistent in many parts, while the effects of land use regulations are very dependent on structural institutional transformations and interdependent on property rights. In this regard, the paper gives a critical overview of framework of property <b>rights</b> regime <b>over</b> land and urban construction and agricultural land regulation in Serbia. After reviewing existing literature, legislation and institutional regulation on the main issues of land use regulations and property rights, the authors discuss in particular redefinition of property <b>rights</b> <b>over</b> land, processes of privatization and restitution of land. The authors indicate that resolving property <b>rights</b> <b>over</b> land is very important both for social issues and for economy and regarding this, land restitution, supported by efficient land administration, is the precondition for successful privatization process...|$|R
