25|$|Montgomery {{held the}} first patent on a rotary blade mower. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, mowers were {{equipped}} with a rotating reel assembly that was either pushed by hand or was propelled by a small gasoline engine. This kind of mower worked well in short grass, but it clogged up in tall grass. Montgomery did not invent this mower, but he obtained the patent from a frustrated inventor in Chicago, Illinois. The first commercially produced <b>rotary</b> <b>mower,</b> the Yazoo Master Mower, was then produced by a small manufacturing plant in Jackson, Mississippi. Montgomery was the Louisiana distributor of Yazoo until 1981, when he closed his lawnmower business in Ruston.|$|E

5000|$|Rotary mowers {{were not}} {{developed}} until engines were small enough and {{powerful enough to}} run the blades at sufficient speed. Many people experimented with rotary blade mowers in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and Power Specialties Ltd. introduced a gasoline-powered <b>rotary</b> <b>mower.</b> Kut Kwick replaced the saw blade of the [...] "Pulp Saw" [...] with a double-edged blade and a cutter deck, converting the [...] "Pulp Saw" [...] into the first ever out-front <b>rotary</b> <b>mower.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{agriculture}} a <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> {{takes the}} form of a piece of tractor machinery that is often pulled behind the tractor and powered by the Power take-off; it uses thick blades of sharpened metal to cut thick grass, heavy bushes, weeds, and small trees. Due to the high torque and power associated with the implement, shields made of hanging heavy chain or thick vinyl or rubber are often provided around the discharge chute to control flying debris. French agricultural machinery manufacturer Rousseau SA claims to have invented the mechanical <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> in 1962.|$|E

40|$|Modern <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> {{are well}} known in green forage harvesting. These {{machines}} are powerful and reliable, but energy consumption is high and cutting quality is restricted. To optimize the process, an overlaid cutting principle was developed and realized as functional prototype. This cutting method is characterized by two vertical arranged mowing discs with several blades. Thus with reduced cutting speeds the energy efficiency and the cutting quality could be improved...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation thesis deals with <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers,</b> specifically {{with the issue}} of mulching. In the theoretical part the reader is being familiar with the technology of mulching and its importance. Further, the individual types of mulchers and its advantages and disadvantages are described. The literary analysis of energy demands of <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> is stated. Further, the parameters influencing energy demands of the mulcher are also analyzed. The results of measurement of the energy demands of the mulcher with vertical axis of rotation are presented. The dependency of input power, specific energy consumption and fuel consumption on mass performance of the machine are created. Furthermore, the energy demands was determined, while mulcher was working continuously at the permanent grassland. The energy losses of the mulcher were also analyzed. The effect of modification of operational and constructional parameters on the energy demands and quality of work of the mulcher wit vertical axis of rotation is studied. From the constructional parameters the shape of working tool, especially cloth angle and rake angle of the tool, and shape of the cover of the mulcher workspace is modified. From the operational parameters the cutting speed and mass performance according to conditions is modified...|$|R
50|$|Mulching mowersSpecial {{mulching}} blades {{are available}} for <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers.</b> The blade is designed to keep the clippings circulating underneath the mower until the clippings are chopped quite small. Other designs have twin blades to mulch the clippings to small pieces. This function has the advantages of forgoing the additional work collecting and disposing grass clippings while reducing lawn waste {{in such a way}} that also creates convenient compost for the lawn, forgoing the expense and adverse environmental effect of fertilizer.|$|R
50|$|In {{horticulture}} a <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> {{is usually}} an integral machine that is either pushed by hand or {{driven by a}} riding operator, and used to cut amenity and sports turf. The first successful such machine was developed in Australia in 1952 by the Victa company.|$|E

50|$|A {{brushcutter}} (also {{called a}} brushsaw or clearing saw) is a powered garden or agricultural tool used to trim weeds, small trees, and other foliage not accessible by {{a lawn mower}} or <b>rotary</b> <b>mower.</b> Various blades or trimmer heads can {{be attached to the}} machine for specific applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>mowers,</b> {{also called}} drum mowers, have a rapidly {{rotating}} bar, or disks {{mounted on a}} bar, with sharpened edges that cut the crop. When these mowers are tractor-mounted they are easily capable of mowing grass at up to 20 miles per hour (32 km/h) in good conditions. Some models {{are designed to be}} mounted in double and triple sets on a tractor, one in the front and one at each side, thus able to cut up to 20 foot (6 metre) swaths.|$|R
50|$|Two main {{styles of}} blades {{are used in}} lawn mowers. Lawn mowers {{employing}} a single blade that rotates about a single vertical axis are known as <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers,</b> while those employing a cutting bar and multiple blade assembly that rotates about a single horizontal axis are known as cylinder or reel mowers (although in some versions, the cutting bar is the only blade, and the rotating assembly consists of flat metal pieces which force the blades of grass against the sharp cutting bar).|$|R

50|$|The {{deck of a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> is {{typically}} made of steel. Lighter steel is used on less expensive models, and heavier steel on more expensive models for durability. Other deck materials include aluminium, which does not rust and is a staple of higher priced mowers, and hard composite plastic, which does not rust and is lighter and less expensive than aluminium. Electric mowers typically have a plastic deck.|$|E
50|$|Two archetypes of {{this type}} of mower are the Bush Hog which is made by Bush Hog, Inc. Selma, Alabama and the Flex-Wing by RhinoAg Gibson City, Illinois. The formal name for this type of {{implement}} is a rotary cutter or <b>rotary</b> <b>mower,</b> although it differs from mowers in that it does not cut with a sharp blade, but rather severs with an intentionally very dull wedge-like blade.|$|E
50|$|One {{company that}} {{produced}} <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> commercially was the Australian Victa company, starting in 1952. Its mowers were lighter {{and easier to}} use than similar ones that had come before. The first Victa mowers were made at Mortlake, an inner suburb of Sydney, by local resident Mervyn Victor Richardson. He made his first model out of scrap in his garage. The first Victa mowers were manufactured, going on sale on 20 September 1952. The new company, Victa Mowers Pty Ltd, was incorporated on 13 February 1953.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} {{developer of}} the rollermower is uncertain, but Howard Rotavator Pty Ltd manufactured {{and sold the}} 72RLM (later the HS20RLM/180) Rollamowa in Australia from the early 1970s. These were linkage-mounted three-spindled <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> with a cutting width of 1.8m (72”). A larger version (HS20RLM/300) was also produced before manufacturing ceased in about 1984. The company was absorbed by Howard Australia Pty Ltd and from 1985 sourced its rollermowers from Trimax Industries Ltd (later Trimax Mowing Systems) in New Zealand. Trimax then sold the same machines under the Trimax brand around the world.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{attachment}} for a <b>rotary</b> <b>mower,</b> either using the three-point hitch or via a draw bar. The height of the cut on models attached on the three-point hitch is adjusted using the hitch control lever. This adjusts the height of the front of mower. For more radical height adjustment the rear wheel can also be adjusted. Typically the mowers in this category range from 3.3 to 22 ft mowing widths.|$|E
5000|$|A brush hog or [...] "bush hog" [...] {{is a type}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>mower.</b> Typically these mowers {{attach to}} the back of a farm tractor using the three-point hitch and are driven via the Power {{take-off}} (PTO). It has blades that are not rigidly attached to the drive like a lawnmower blade, but are on hinges so if the blade hits a rock or stump, it bounces backward and inward, and then centrifugal force makes it go outwards again.|$|E

50|$|A roller mower, or rollermower, is a tractor-powered multi-spindled <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> {{that have}} full width rollers front and rear. Most rollermowers attach to a four-wheeled tractor via the three-point linkage and are {{powered by the}} tractor’s power {{take-off}} (PTO), though larger models connect three or more complete mowing decks to a separate chassis that is towed behind the tractor. Good rollermowers can produce a finish rivalling that of reel (cylinder) mowers while generally being far more robust and requiring considerably less maintenance. Modern machines can also cope efficiently with {{a wider range of}} grass lengths and densities than cylinder mowers.|$|R
