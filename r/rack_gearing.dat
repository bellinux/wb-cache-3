40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the animation of planar involute gearing. The thesis gives a theoretical basis for understanding the problems of gears. Introduction {{of the work is}} focused on the description of the geometry and mesh of uncorrected planar gears focusing on the line of action. Gradually meshing of gear pairs with external, internal and <b>rack</b> <b>gearing</b> is described. Following part describes mesh of planar wheel with manufacturing rack, thus creating teeth flanks by rolling. The next section describes the problems of interference with the root curve {{and its impact on the}} gear's teeth number. The last part deals with correction of teeth by shifting profile and its effect on meshing ratios...|$|E

50|$|Demand for the {{components}} used in Ashly's mixers caused {{the company to}} develop their equipment in a modular fashion. Their first successful product came in 1976, when they developed the SC-66 stereo parametric equalizer.

5000|$|The {{prototype}} {{vehicle design}} on X2 allows riders to spin 360-degrees forwards and backwards, {{independent of the}} train's primary movement. Weighing 5 tons, each vehicle has a wing-shaped design that spans 20 ft. Riders sit {{on the outside of}} the coaster track in pairs. Four, 1 ft tall <b>rack</b> <b>gears</b> move up and down following the profile of the seat rotation rails below the vehicle. This gear rotates the seats forwards and backwards throughout the ride. Unlike traditional roller coasters, 4th Dimension roller coasters, like X2, have four rails. The seat rotation rails bend up and down slightly pushing the <b>rack</b> <b>gear</b> up and down which in turn rotates the seats. [...] These [...] "rotation" [...] rails don't support the train. The other two rails are for the weight-bearing wheels, capable of supporting these heavy trains.|$|R

The connecting rods of the inside engine were not connected directly to the crank pins, but to projections on the coupling rods which actuated the <b>rack</b> <b>gear.</b> This method of coupling was unavoidable due to the restricted width of only 3 ft between tyres.|$|R

50|$|The rack {{carries the}} full load of the {{actuator}} directly {{and so the}} driving pinion is usually small, so that the gear ratio reduces the torque required. This force, thus torque, may still be substantial {{and so it is}} common for there to be a reduction gear immediately before this by either a gear or worm <b>gear</b> reduction. <b>Rack</b> <b>gears</b> have a higher ratio, thus require a greater driving torque, than screw actuators.|$|R
500|$|Apogee's {{branding}} {{was largely}} Jackson's doing. Bennett said in 2005 that the company's decision to sell purple-coloured products {{was one of}} Jackson's ideas: [...] "He has a good eye for design, {{and we wanted to}} distinguish ourselves from the all-black <b>rack</b> <b>gear</b> that everybody had at that point." [...] Jackson encouraged a lighting designer from Clair Brothers to sketch a company logo on a cocktail napkin over dinner one evening, and that was immediately made the Apogee logo.|$|R

When gashing spur <b>gears,</b> <b>racks,</b> or bevel <b>gears</b> the cutter is plunged into the workpiece and then moved linearly in the proper direction. If a helical gear is being roughed out, then the table rotates and moves along the vertical axis to interpolate the helical path.|$|R
30|$|In our {{previous}} {{work on a}} dual-actuated robot hand [8], the hand provided a longer range of action in the HF phase by using a rack-gear clutch connection. To prevent gear teeth jamming during rack-gear engagement, a rack-tilting mechanism {{was introduced to the}} rack part, which will be discussed in the next section. The use of a <b>rack</b> <b>gear</b> increased the overall length of the mechanism, and design difficulties were encountered in our attempt to make the mechanism more compact. We also developed a more compact mechanism by replacing the dual-actuated mechanism with a single-actuated load-sensitive mechanism [9]. However, the use of a cable requires frequent maintenance and exhibits lower reliability than a gear-driven mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Tuning of the R-390A's radio {{frequency}} and intermediate frequency front end is synchronized {{by means of}} an ingenious mechanical system of <b>racks,</b> <b>gears,</b> and cams. When the front panel tuning controls are rotated, this system raises and lowers ferrite slugs {{in and out of the}} receiver's tuning coils. This ensures that all front-end circuits are tracked, meaning all circuits are tuned to the correct frequency to maintain excellent selectivity and sensitivity. The receiver's construction is modular for easy servicing. Each major area of the receiver is contained in easily removable subassemblies, and these can be repaired or replaced as needs be. Though the R-390A is mechanically and electrically complex, alignment and servicing were designed to follow simplified procedures published by the Signal Corps.|$|R

2500|$|The company's {{solution}} to this problem was an automated conveyor, similar to the track-based systems being introduced for industrial automation and warehousing systems. Unlike those systems, however, the mooring points were so far offshore that the movement from the ship to the land-side terminal would be a significant delay. The system they designed operated at speeds up to [...] in order to reduce these delays. A variety of options were available to improve flexibility. The cars were normally powered by two electric motors spinning steel wheels that ran on steel rails at high speeds, but could optionally include a traction <b>gear</b> that engaged <b>rack</b> <b>gears</b> between the running rails that allowed them to climb high grades at lower speeds. Optional elevator-like systems allowed the cars to move vertically as well.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a simplified algorithm for the profiling of the <b>rack</b> <b>gear</b> tool {{to generate the}} active profile associated with rolling centrodes. The algorithm {{is based on the}} enveloping surfaces principles and reduces the computational problem by proposing an approximate representation of tool’s profile using only 3 or 4 points on the profile to be generated by using Bezier representations of the surfaces. The algorithm computes the coefficients of a Bezier substitution polynomial instead of computing hundreds of points on the active profile. This simplifies the solution methodology and requires {{only a limited number of}} points along the profile to be generated. The algorithm is computationally efficient and can also be used in the case when the active profile to be generated is physically measured at a few points. Examples include mill tools, splined shafts and gears. Key-Words:- Bezier substitution polynomial, tool profiling, approximate profiling metho...|$|R

30|$|The {{clearance}} matching of chainless haulage {{system with}} a pitch of 147  mm was studied. First of all, the variable range of meshing central distance of the shearer walk wheel and scraper conveyor pin rail was determined. Its determination principles are: under the correct meshing situation, the minimum meshing central distance can warrant the no interference and no gear jam between walk wheel and pin rail (two section pin row connection), and it is usually approximately 10  mm less than the pitch radius of the walk wheel; the maximum meshing central distance must satisfy the rational meshing, the simulation shows that the increase of the meshing central distance has little effect, based on analysis and experience, the value is taken as 15  mm larger than the corresponding pitch radius of the walk wheel; a further increase of meshing central distance would cause: imprecise rolling, impact on gears from every contact and alteration, the wear of wheel <b>gear</b> and <b>rack</b> <b>gear,</b> etc.|$|R

This paper presents comparative analysis of tooth-root strength evaluation methods used within ISO and AGMA standards and verifying them with developed models and simulations using the {{finite element method}} (FEM).

FEM of tooth-root strength is performed for each modeled gear. FEM results are compared with stresses calculated based on the ISO and AGMA standards. The comparative analysis for various combinations of design, manufacturing, and performance parameters are illustrated graphically and discussed briefly.
