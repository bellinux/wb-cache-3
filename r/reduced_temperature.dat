40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) {{have the}} potential to <b>reduce</b> <b>temperature</b> fluctuations in retail display cabinets. There are several areas where <b>reducing</b> <b>temperature</b> fluctuations may be beneficial, e. g. minimising effects of defrosts and to damp the day/night variation in refrigeration duty. PCMs were placed below the shelves in a closed door multi-deck cabinet with the aim of <b>reducing</b> <b>temperature</b> fluctuations during defrosts. The cabinet was tested in a test room conforming to the EN 23953 test standard (climate class 3). The cabinet was tested with and without the PCMs. No measurable effect for the PCMs was found. A finite difference model was used to explain the results and suggest improvements. Predictions showed the problem was due to the limited heat transfer coefficient, surface area and low thermal conductivity of the PCM...|$|R
40|$|Shading windows {{has been}} shown to reduce energy costs by <b>reducing</b> <b>temperatures</b> inside of {{buildings}}. Previous studies focused on office buildings and shades that respond to changing light levels, and found that automatic window shades are more effective at <b>reducing</b> <b>temperature</b> than manual shades. Few studies have been done on the effectiveness of <b>reducing</b> <b>temperature</b> with window shades controlled by motion detectors, however, motion detectors have been found to reduce energy consumption from lighting systems. To see if motion detectors are also effective at <b>reducing</b> <b>temperature</b> when used with window shades, this study focused on a cheap, easy to install automatic window shade that uses a motion detector to open only when the room is occupied. It was found that the window shade with a motion detector had no effect on the temperature of the room. However, there was a strong correlation found between the temperature of the room and the inside temperature of the house, possibly due to inadequate isolation of the experimental room during testing. Further study is recommended that addresses this issue before the effectiveness of the window shade is determined...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} relationships between manual dexterity performance, <b>reduced</b> ambient <b>temperatures,</b> exposure time to the ambient temperatures and simple reaction time. Human subject testing, statistical modeling and analyses were used in this research. ^ The objectives of this research were: (1) To determine if a decrement in human manual dexterity performance occurs with a reduction in ambient temperature. (2) To determine if simple reaction time is decreased by exposure to <b>reduced</b> ambient <b>temperatures.</b> (3) To describe {{the relationships between}} the cold exposure time, the performance level of a manual task, and the reaction time at <b>reduced</b> ambient <b>temperatures.</b> (4) To determine if the exposure to <b>reduced</b> ambient <b>temperatures</b> alters the MTM- 12 ̆ 7 s element motions, combined motions, and simultaneous motions. This includes (1) identifying the effect of the <b>reduced</b> <b>temperatures</b> on work methods as well as MTM- 1 element motions, and (2) recommending a methodology that may yield predictive models for manual tasks under <b>reduced</b> <b>temperatures.</b> ^ The experiment was conducted in a controlled environmental chamber with the hand skin temperature continuously monitored. The manual dexterity performance was analyzed by evaluating a video tape of the assembly task performed. The simple reaction time task involved pushing several sequential lighted push buttons. The performance task scores were the completion time of these tasks. Performance was measured for 12 subjects at six ambient temperatures (35 (DEGREES) F, 40 (DEGREES) F, 45 (DEGREES) F, 50 (DEGREES) F, 55 (DEGREES) F and 60 (DEGREES) F) during one-hour exposure trials. ^ The data analysis indicated that a decrement of manual dexterity performance due to the <b>reduced</b> <b>temperatures</b> does exist. Within the exposure time of one hour, the simple reaction times were not affected by the <b>reduced</b> ambient <b>temperatures.</b> Neither the dexterity performance nor the simple reaction time was significantly different at different exposure times (25, 35, 45 minutes) to the <b>reduced</b> ambient <b>temperature.</b> Recommendations are made for an analysis procedure for tasks at cold working environments using MTM- 1. ...|$|R

Diffusion coefficients were also determined for the ferrocenecarboxylic acid monomer (Fc-COOH) at <b>reduced</b> <b>temperatures</b> with similar effects. The potential peak spacing (∆E p) for both species increases as the solution temperature is lowered. This effect is largely attributed to the increased solution resistance rather than the increased solvent viscosity at lower temperatures...|$|R
