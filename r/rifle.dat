5|$|Jackson was {{eventually}} sent to Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan to help form the first Air Force <b>Rifle</b> Team and trained at Palm Beach Air Force Base in West Palm Beach, Florida {{during the winter}} months. His next international stop was the 1952 ISSF World Shooting Championships, where he took home gold in the 50 m <b>rifle</b> prone position with 60 (individual and team) and 40 shots (individual) and the bronze in the 300 m standard <b>rifle</b> (individual) and 50 m <b>rifle</b> prone position with 40 shots (team).

5|$|The 1954 ISSF World Shooting Championships were {{dominated}} by the Soviet Union, but Jackson still managed to take home a gold medal {{as a member of}} the United States' 50+100 m <b>rifle</b> prone position team. He fared better at the 1955 Pan American Games, taking home gold medals in both the individual and team versions of the <b>rifle,</b> three positions and prone at 50 meters, as well as the team high power <b>rifle,</b> three positions at 50 meters.

5|$|The {{success of}} these <b>rifle</b> units during the skirmishing period, coupled {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of new army recruits, led Washington to create {{additional}} provisional <b>rifle</b> companies. He placed them under the command of Daniel Morgan in early June 1777, calling the unit the Provisional <b>Rifle</b> Corps, although it was most commonly known as Morgan's <b>Rifle</b> Corps in period documents. Morgan then simultaneously led the 11th Virginia Regiment, his permanent unit, and this provisional unit. Thirty-five officers and enlisted men in Smith's and Long's composite companies, as well as others selected from their regular musket regiments, were detached from their permanent units to form this elite regiment-sized force. The men from the Maryland and Virginia <b>Rifle</b> Regiment all served in one of the <b>Rifle</b> Corps' eight companies, Capt. Gabriel Long's Provisional <b>Rifle</b> Company; {{with the exception of a}} single man, all other members of the company came from the 11th Virginia Regiment. Like Morgan, Long was now technically in command of two Continental Army units, one permanent and one provisional. Long served in the <b>Rifle</b> Corps until his resignation in May 1779, at which time command of his company passed to Marylander Lt. Elijah Evans, also one of the original officers of the Maryland and Virginia <b>Rifle</b> Regiment. Evans returned to Rawlings' regiment, his permanent unit, when his detached duty in the <b>Rifle</b> Corps ended with its formal disbanding in early November 1779. The <b>Rifle</b> Corps is most notable for the major role it played in the Battles of Saratoga.|$|E
