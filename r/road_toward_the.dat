5|$|Around 01:00 on August 27, the British {{approached}} {{the vicinity of}} the Red Lion with 200–300 troops. The American troops fired upon the British; after approximately two fusillades, they fled up the Gowanus <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Vechte-Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd had been in command, but he was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates. This first engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38th and 39th streets between 2nd and 3rd avenues near a swamp located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.|$|E
5|$|MD 313 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 50 in Mardela Springs, Wicomico County, where the route heads east past residences along Delmar Road, a two-lane undivided road. A short distance past US 50, the route turns north onto Sharptown Road, with MD 54 continuing east on Delmar <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Delaware-Maryland state border town of Delmar. The route continues north past more residences before it leaves Mardela Springs and heads into farmland {{a short distance}} west of the Delaware border. It continues through a mix of woods and farms with some residences before reaching Sharptown. Here, the road intersects unsigned MD 813F (Twiford Road). MD 313 bypasses Sharptown {{to the south and}} intersects MD 348 (Laurel Road). Past this intersection, the route turns north and runs along {{the eastern edge of the}} town before crossing over the Nanticoke River.|$|E

White flags had appeared {{in front of the}} American line, and civilians in the area said many North Koreans wanted to surrender. The US patrol's mission was to investigate this situation and to form an estimate of North Koreans losses. The patrol advanced about , engaging small North Korean groups and receiving some artillery fire. On its way it destroyed five disabled North Korean tanks with thermite grenades. The patrol also found a 37mm anti-tank gun, two SU-76 self-propelled guns, and a 120mm mortar among the destroyed North Korean equipment, as well as recognizing a large number of North Korean dead. At the point of farthest advance, the patrol found and destroyed an abandoned T-34 tank in a village schoolhouse courtyard.|$|E
5|$|The silk <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{west was}} opened by the Chinese in the 2nd century CE. The main road left from Xi'an, going {{either to the}} north or south of the Taklamakan desert, {{one of the most}} arid in the world, before {{crossing}} the Pamir Mountains. The caravans that employed this method to exchange silk with other merchants were generally quite large, including from 100 to 500 people as well as camels and yaks carrying around 140 kg (300 lb) of merchandise. They linked to Antioch and the coasts of the Mediterranean, about one year's travel from Xi'an. In the South, a second route went by Yemen, Burma, and India before rejoining the northern route.|$|E
5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E

25|$|After {{the outer}} works fell, General Wilson led the 4th U.S. Cavalry Regiment in a mounted charge down the Range Line <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{unfinished}} inner line of works. The retreating Confederate forces, upon reaching the inner works, united and fired repeatedly together into the charging column. This {{broke up the}} charge and sent General Wilson sprawling to the ground when his favorite horse was wounded. He quickly remounted his stricken horse and ordered a dismounted assault by several regiments.|$|E
25|$|Grant ordered Warren's V Corps to outflank Lee's {{line and}} to support Sheridan's cavalry. Warren's corps moved out at 3:00a.m. over the Vaughan Road toward Dinwiddie Court House. Warren's orders were {{subsequently}} modified to make a movement over the Quaker <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Confederate defenses. Grant ordered Humphrey's II Corps to march at 9:00a.m. to positions from the Quaker Road-Vaughan Road intersection to Hatcher's Run. Warren was to move along the Boydton Plank Road to cut that key Confederate communication line. Both corps were ordered to keep the Confederates in their trenches while the Union advance proceeded.|$|E

25|$|Turning {{north and}} marching up the Quaker <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Confederate line, Warren's lead brigade, {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain, engaged three brigades of Johnson's {{division at the}} Lewis Farm. Reinforced by a four-gun artillery battery and later relieved by two large regiments from the brigade commanded by Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory, the Union troops ultimately forced the Confederates back to their defenses and captured an important road junction. Chamberlain was wounded and narrowly escaped capture. Union Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson was awarded the Medal of Honor 32 years later for his heroic actions at the battle.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a big}} bushfire in the Tinderry Range in November 1957 which burnt out 90% of {{the reserve}} and was not {{contained}} until 24December. In January 2003, bushfires ravaged the Canberra region and, spreading from Namadgi National Park, devastated much of the flora and bush landscape around Michelago, particularly down from the Clearview <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Murrumbidgee River. While the village itself was not affected by the fires, several farms and houses were destroyed and mountains of the Clear Range were left blackened and barren. A bushfire which began on 17December 2009 devastated the area east of Michelago, burning out over 9,000 hectares and destroying three homes and a sawmill.|$|E
25|$|Warren's V Corps, {{followed}} by Humphrey's II Corps, and {{further to the}} south, Sheridan's cavalry corps, moved south and west early on March 29, 1865. Their mission was to occupy Dinwiddie Court House, cut the Boydton Plank Road, Southside Railroad and Richmond and Danville Railroad and to outflank the Confederates on their western (right) flank {{at the end of}} their White Oak Road line southwest of Petersburg. Under revised orders, Warren sent Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin's First Division north on the Quaker <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> intersection with the Boydton Plank Road and the end of the White Oak Road Line. Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain's First Brigade led the advance.|$|E

50|$|In Anderson County, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> travels <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> south, then curves <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southeast, {{and then}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east. 3.8 mi from the Spencer County line, the route meets {{the eastern end}} of the KY 53 overlap in Glensboro, where it becomes Glensboro Road. It {{continues}} eastward, passing through Anderson City and meeting the southern terminus of KY 395 east of Anderson City. Roughly 2 mi east of KY 395, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> curves <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> north, then back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east at McDonald Road. KY 44 enters the city of Lawrenceburg where it intersects with US 62 Truck/US 127 Bypass, also known as the Lawrenceburg Bypass or Bypass North. The route ends at its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 127 and US 62 1 mi further east.|$|R
25|$|Immediately after {{crossing}} Canaseraga Creek, a {{tributary of}} the Genesee River, NY408 meets I-390 at the freeway's exit7. Just northeast of the interchange is a junction with NY63, where NY408 comes to an end. NY63, meanwhile, turns north here to follow the right-of-way of NY408 northward on Mount Morris–Geneseo <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> village of Geneseo. Although I-390 passes close to Geneseo, there is no exit for the village itself; instead, the connection is made via exit7 (NY408 and NY63) heading northbound and exit8 (U.S. Route20A) heading southbound. As a result, the segment of NY408 between I-390 and NY63 has the second-highest traffic volume of any section of the route—an estimated 9,400 vehicles per day as of 2009. In fact, the piece of NY408 from Mount Morris east sees far higher traffic volumes than the remainder of the highway, with the part that overlaps NY36 carrying an average of 11,680 cars per day in 2009.|$|E
25|$|NY366 {{turns to}} the {{northeast}} through Dryden, intersecting the northern terminus of CR161 (Turkey Hill Road) before intersecting with NY13 after Baker Hill Road. NY13 and NY366 form a concurrency on this stretch, as a four-lane arterial known still as Dryden Road. The roads parallel Fall Creek nearby, eventually narrowing in lanes. At the intersection with Main Street, NY13 continues eastward, while NY366 turns northward on Main Street, entering the hamlet of Etna. In Etna, NY366 intersects with CR109 (Etna Lane) {{on the shore of}} Fall Creek. The two routes are concurrent for less than a block before CR109 heads eastward towards NY13. NY366 parallels Fall Creek through Dryden, sticking as a two-lane local road before entering the town of Freeville. In Freeville, NY366 retains its Main Street moniker, but becomes a residential street before intersecting with NY38 (Railroad Street / Groton Road). This intersection serves as the eastern terminus for NY366, but the right-of-way continues out of Freeville as CR105 (Fall Creek <b>Road)</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Red Mills.|$|E
25|$|After a {{pause in}} the fighting, Chamberlain's {{division}} commander, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin came forward and told Chamberlain that the Confederate position must be taken. Deploying men to {{both sides of the}} Quaker Road, Chamberlain, on horseback, led a charge up the Quaker <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Confederate strong point, a large sawdust pile that provided cover for many Confederate soldiers. Chamberlain got ahead of his men and became an obvious target. He was wounded in the arm and his horse was wounded in the neck. Chamberlain slumped on his horse, initially unconscious, but regained consciousness in time to respond to General Griffin who had come up to check on Chamberlain's condition. Then Chamberlain rallied his Pennsylvania regiment who were retreating from a Confederate charge. When his wounded horse could not continue, Chamberlain went to the front of his line on foot. Several Confederate soldiers soon appeared and demanded Chamberlain's surrender. Chamberlain had lost his hat and was wearing a faded coat, almost gray in color. Pretending to be a Confederate officer, he led the Confederates back toward Union soldiers who promptly captured them.|$|E
50|$|At a short {{distance}} the road crossed a clear babbling brook which flowed under a rustic bridge, away through a grove of oaks, down beside the meadows and wheat fields, bisecting other <b>roads</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Rock River, {{of which it is}} a tributary. There was an orchard protected by a belt of willows. Some rods away was a spring, the overflow of which formed a rill leading to the creek.

25|$|An {{example of}} the {{difficulties}} inherent in the enlarged war was the siting of Lima Site 85 on a mountaintop at Phou Pha Thi, Laos. This clandestine guidance radar facility was proposed at a mid-1967 meeting chaired by General Hunter Harris. Its purpose was radar directed air raids into Hanoi. Lair's opinion of the installation was asked, as he was the local expert, and he was being charged with its defense. He predicted that the Vietnamese would build a <b>road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> radar site until they could attack it. When asked if LS 85 could be defended, Lair pointed out that guerrilla forces were not equipped or trained for fixed defensive battles. He recommended the use of special forces or other trained infantry for defense, but his request was rejected. In January 1968, North Vietnamese forces bypassed the site temporarily to attack royalist positions at the Battle of Nam Bac. Despite the PAVN's delay of the battle, Lair's prediction of Lima Site 85's fall was prophetic. The radar site was captured by Vietnamese sappers on 11 March 1968 even though Hmong guerrillas and Thai mercenaries remained on the mountain. Shackley had predicted in a cable to headquarters that the site could not hold out beyond 10 March. The accuracy of his estimate burnished his reputation in the agency.|$|E
25|$|MD 458 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 5 (Branch Avenue) in Silver Hill.

MD 458 heads east as a four-lane divided highway and intersects MD 414, which heads south as St. Barnabas Road and north as Old Silver Hill Road. The highway expands to six lanes east of MD 414 and passes a Smithsonian Institution Libraries support center. MD 458 enters Suitland at its partial cloverleaf interchange with the Suitland Parkway. Just beyond the parkway, the highway passes the Suitland station on the Washington Metro's Green Line. MD 458 continues past the Suitland Federal Center, whose main tenant is the U.S. Census Bureau, and intersects Suitland Road, which heads northwest as MD 218 {{in the center of}} Suitland. The highway passes Suitland High School before its intersection with MD 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue). Just east of MD 4, unsigned MD 972 splits east along Old Silver Hill <b>Road</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> center of District Heights. MD 458 passes {{along the edge of the}} town and intersects Marlboro Pike before reaching its northern terminus at Walker Mill Road. The intersection is a T-intersection with Walker Mill Road turning from southeast to northeast at the junction; this portion of Walker Mill Road is unsigned MD 458A.|$|E
