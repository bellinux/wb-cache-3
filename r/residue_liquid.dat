METHODS: Eighty children with inguinoscrotal disorders (aged 1 - 10 years) were studied prospectively. They were divided into eight groups that each contained 10 children who were fed normal liquid food (NLF) and a high-calorie diet (HCD) 2, 3, 4 and 5 h before surgery, in two doses at 6 -h intervals. NLF was given to four groups and HCD to the other four. In all groups, glucose, prealbumin and cortisol levels in the blood were measured twice: just after oral feeding and just before the operation.

However, this culture technique produced the organisation of cells that were far from the natural tissue and the outcomes for biological studies were not reliable. In this research, liquid crystal was exploited as a new culture technique to produce 3 D micro-tissues of human keratinocyte cell lines (HaCaT). The development of 3 D micro-tissues technique initiated with the optimisation of different cell density on the coated cholesteryl ester liquid crystal (CELC) substrate to obtain a higher number and larger sized of micro-tissues. The investigation of 3 D micro-tissues physical characteristic included the analyses of cell-to-cell interaction, cell organisation, biochemistry element in micro-tissues, cell response to enzymatic dissociation treatment, immunostaining and cell viability study of micro-tissues. A microfluidic vibrational cleaner constituted polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chip and electronic system were developed to remove the <b>residue</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal from the extracted micro-tissues.

40|$|Fluidized-Bed {{technology}} has been successfully applied {{for the use of}} solid fuels as energy source. It proved to be an improvement on traditional methods such as pulverized or suspension for combustion and fixed-bed for gasification. Biomass. low-quality coals, industrial and urbane solid residues are among the solids for which the fluidized-bed technique is especially advantageous. As the fluidized bed usually requires an inert solid (such as sand) as temperature regulator and support media for fluidization, the ash content of a fuel can replace part or even the total amount of that inert. Therefore, the bed can accept fuels with low heat values. Among these there are the biomass and forest residues. In the case of coal or other fuels with high sulfur content, removal of that pollutant can be very efficient through the addition of limestone or dolomite to the bed. In addition, when compared with pulverized-fuel combustion, the relative low and uniform temperatures found in fluidized-beds lead to low NO, emissions, not to mention savings in building materials.

40|$|Forensic {{chemical}} analysis of fire debris addresses {{the question of}} whether ignitable <b>liquid</b> <b>residue</b> is present in a sample and, if so, what type. Evidence evaluation regarding this question is complicated by interference from pyrolysis products of the substrate materials present in a fire. A method is developed to derive a set of class-conditional features for the evaluation of such complex samples. The use of a forensic reference collection allows characterization of the variation in complex mixtures of substrate materials and ignitable liquids even when the dominant feature is not specific to an ignitable liquid. Making use of a novel method for data imputation under complex mixing conditions, a distribution is modeled for the variation between pairs of samples containing similar ignitable <b>liquid</b> <b>residues.</b> Examining the covariance of variables within the different classes allows different weights to be placed on features more important in discerning the presence of a particular ignitable <b>liquid</b> <b>residue.</b> Performance of the method is evaluated using a database of total ion spectrum (TIS) measurements of ignitable liquid and fire debris samples. These measurements include 119 nominal masses measured by GC-MS and averaged across a chromatographic profile. Ignitable liquids are labeled using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 1618 standard class definitions. Statistical analysis is performed in the class-conditional feature space wherein new forensic traces are represented based on their likeness to known samples contained in a forensic reference collection. The demonstrated method uses forensic reference data as the basis of probabilistic statements concerning the likelihood of the obtained analytical results given the presence of ignitable <b>liquid</b> <b>residue</b> of each of the ASTM classes (including a substrate only class). When prior probabilities of these classes can be assumed, these likelihoods can be connected to class probabilities. In order to compare the performance of this method to previous work, a uniform prior was assumed, resulting in an 81 % accuracy for an independent test of 129 real burn samples...|$|R

This is problematic for fire debris analysis as samples may be stored at room temperature for extended periods before they are analyzed due to case backlog. As a result, selective loss of key components due to bacterial metabolism can make identifying and classifying ignitable <b>liquid</b> <b>residues</b> by their chemical composition and boiling point range very difficult. The ultimate goal of this project is to preserve ignitable <b>liquid</b> <b>residues</b> against microbial degradation as efficiently and quickly as possible. Field and laboratory studies were conducted to monitor microbial degradation of gasoline and other ignitable liquids in soil samples. In addition to monitoring degradation in potting soil, as a worst case scenario, the effect of soil type and season were also studied. The effect of microbial action was also compared to the effect of weathering by evaporation (under nitrogen in the laboratory and by the passive headspace analysis of the glass fragments from the incendiary devices in the field studies). All studies showed that microbial degradation resulted in the significant loss of n-alkanes and lesser substituted alkylbenzenes predominantly and quickly, while more highly substituted alkanes and aromatics were not significantly affected. Additionally, the residential soil during the fall season showed the most significant loss of these compounds over the course of 30 days. To combat this problem, a chemical solution is to be immediately applied to the samples as they are collected.

Factors that may influence microbial responses in foods and food environments, such as food structure and composition, microbial interactions and mode of growth were identified and assessed in the present study. The fate of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 was monitored both in and on teewurst, a raw spreadable sausage, at different storage temperatures. Regardless of the storage temperature and inoculation type, pathogen numbers decreased during storage. The increase of endogenous lactic acid bacteria and the concomitant reduction of pH mostly accounted for this reduction. The inactivation of all three pathogens inoculated into batter or onto slices varied considerably among trials possibly due to variations in the initial batch-to-batch levels of lactic acid microflora and the associated microbial interactions. The effect of structure, composition and microbial interactions on the growth kinetics of L. monocytogenes was evaluated in different growth substrates, including broth, agar, sterile meat blocks, naturally contaminated meat blocks and minced meat. The growth responses of L. monocytogenes were significantly different in the different growth media and food products tested. These differences were more pronounced at low temperatures. The validation of a model {{based on data from}} broth against the observed growth of the pathogen {{in the rest of the}} tested media showed that broth models may result in significant prediction errors. The potential for mono- or multi-strain cultures of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 to attach and form biofilm in combinations of food-contact surfaces, growth substrates and storage temperatures was examined. The susceptibility of biofilms to sanitizers was also evaluated. Attachment and biofilm formation was strain dependent. The presence of food <b>residues</b> (<b>liquid</b> or solid) facilitated the attachment/transfer of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on food-contact surfaces. At moderately cold temperatures culture broth was more conducive to subsequent growth. At chill temperatures the presence of natural microflora in <b>liquid</b> <b>residues</b> enhanced further attachment of the pathogen. Biofilms were less susceptible to sanitation treatments as compared to planktonic cells. Biofilm cells surviving sanitation were able to survive and present slight increases at refrigeration and abuse temperatures, respectively, in cross-contaminated ground meat.

Furthermore, methylations associated with active genes have faster rates than methylations associated with silent genes. Finally, the presence of both an active and silencing mark on the same peptide results in a slower rate of methylation than the presence of either mark alone. Here we show that quantitative proteomic approaches such as this can determine the dynamics of multiple methylated residues, an understudied portion of histone biology...|$|R
40|$|The {{handling}} {{and disposal of}} hot tarry <b>liquid</b> <b>residues</b> can be problematic in industry, in this case, a phthalic anhydride plant using naphthalene as feed stock. The residue from the plant contains an appreciable amount of phthalic anhydride which desublimates from the residue during draining, resulting in an unsafe working environment. In addition, the residue is a hot liquid that solidifies upon cooling, causing additional risks to personnel during {{handling and}} various problems associated with disposal. Research was conducted into finding a treatment method to reduce or eliminate the desublimation of phthalic anhydride from the residue and addressing the hot <b>liquid</b> <b>residue,</b> making the residue safer to handle and easy to dispose of. Laboratory experiments showed that the addition of Dicalite 4151 (a filter aid) in a concentration of 0, 3 kg Dicalite 4151 per kg phthalic anhydride residue, resulted {{in the formation of}} a powdered residue. This was confirmed during plant trials where using the same concentration proved that a powdered residue could be obtained, {{while at the same time}} desublimation of the phthalic anhydride from the residue was negated by distilling the product from the residue mixture. An opportunity exists to test the use of filter aid in other residue producing industries to determine if the same results can be achieved.
