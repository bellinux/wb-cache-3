25|$|When Ambrosio was 12 years old, she partook in {{modeling}} classes, {{and then}} began modeling for Dilson Stein at age 15.

25|$|Tommy Hilfiger {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} brands in 1990s sportswear, though Polo <b>Ralph</b> <b>Lauren,</b> Calvin Klein, Nautica, and DKNY were also popular. When Snoop Doggy Dogg wore a Hilfiger sweatshirt during an appearance on Saturday Night Live, it sold out of New York City stores the next day. Hilfiger's popularity was due to its perceived waspiness, which made it seem exclusive and aspirational. Moreover, Hilfiger courted the new hip hop market: black models featured prominently in the company's advertising campaigns, and rappers like Puffy and Coolio walked during its runways shows.|$|E
25|$|The first Costco Home {{warehouse}} {{opened in}} 1983 and was rebuilt / expanded in 2002 Seattle, Washington.

The Costco Home warehouses sold furniture, housewares, kitchen products and accessories from higher-end brands such as Lexington, <b>Ralph</b> <b>Lauren</b> and Waterford in a warehouse-club setting. Costco claimed that, similar to its main warehouses, it accepted lower margins in return for greater volume with minimal overhead.|$|E
25|$|Blue jeans were popularized as {{work clothes}} in the 1850s by {{merchant}} Levi Strauss, a Jewish-German immigrant in San Francisco, and adopted by many American teenagers a century later. They are now widely worn on every continent by {{people of all ages}} and social classes. Along with mass-marketed informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably U.S. culture's primary contribution to global fashion. The country is also home to the headquarters of many leading designer labels such as <b>Ralph</b> <b>Lauren</b> and Calvin Klein. Labels such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Eckō Unltd. cater to various niche markets.|$|E
25|$|Seal skins {{have been}} used by {{aboriginal}} people for millennia to make waterproof jackets and boots, and seal fur to make fur coats. Pelts account for over half the processed value of a seal, selling at over C$100 each as of 2006. According to Paul Christian Rieber, of GC Rieber AS, the difficult ice conditions and low quotas in 2006 resulted in less access to seal pelts, which caused the commodity price to be pushed up. One high-end fashion designer, Donatella Versace, has begun to use seal pelts, while others, such as Calvin Klein, Stella McCartney, Tommy Hilfiger, and <b>Ralph</b> <b>Lauren,</b> refrain from using any kind of fur.|$|E

Confirmed attendees included Barbara Walters, Jimmy Fallon, Sting, Katie Couric, Woody Allen, Michael Douglas and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as designers Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, <b>Ralph</b> <b>Lauren</b> and Michael Kors. In June 2013 she gave two concerts in Bloomfield Stadium, Tel Aviv.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the campaigns}} {{have focused on}} large corporations. Fast food {{companies}} such as KFC, Wendy's, and Burger King have been targeted. In the animal-testing industry, PETA's consumer boycotts have focused on Avon, Benetton, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Chesebrough-Pond's, Dow Chemical, General Motors, and others. The group's modus operandi includes buying shares in target companies such as McDonald's and Kraft Foods in order to exert influence. The campaigns have delivered results for PETA. McDonald's and Wendy's introduced vegetarian options after PETA targeted them; Petco stopped selling some exotic pets; and Polo <b>Ralph</b> <b>Lauren</b> said {{it would no longer}} use fur. Avon, Estée Lauder, Benetton, and Tonka Toy Co. all stopped testing products on animals, the Pentagon stopped shooting pigs and goats in wounds tests, and a slaughterhouse in Texas was closed down.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Land Rover {{launched}} the Defender in the North American (i.e. the United States and Canada) market. Although the Range Rover {{had been sold}} there since 1987, {{this was the first}} time utility Land Rovers had been sold since 1974. To comply with the strict United States Department of Transportation regulations, ranging from crash safety to lighting, as well as the very different requirements of American buyers, the North American Specification (NAS) Defenders were extensively modified. The initial export batch was 525 Defender 110 County 4x4s: 500 to the United States and 25 to Canada. They were fitted with the 3.9-litre V8 petrol engine and five-speed manual transmission. All of the vehicles were white (except one specifically painted black for <b>Ralph</b> <b>Lauren).</b> They sported full external roll-cages and larger side-indicator and tail-lights. All were equipped with the factory-fitted air conditioning system.|$|E
25|$|After statehood, {{priority}} {{was given to}} establishing industries in areas slated for development, among them Lachish, Ashkelon, the Negev and Galilee. The expansion of Israel's textile industry was {{a consequence of the}} development of cotton growing as a profitable agricultural branch. By the late 1960s, textiles were one of the largest industrial branches in Israel, second only to the foodstuff industry. Textiles constituted about 12% of industrial exports, becoming the second-largest export branch after polished diamonds. In the 1990s, cheap East Asian labor decreased the profitability of the sector. Much of the work was subcontracted to 400 Israeli Arab sewing shops. As these closed down, Israeli firms, among them Delta, Polgat, Argeman and Kitan, began doing their sewing work in Jordan and Egypt, usually under the QIZ arrangement. In the early 2000s, Israeli companies had 30 plants in Jordan. Israeli exports reached $370million a year, supplying such retailers and designers as Marks & Spencer, The Gap, Victoria's Secret, Walmart, Sears, <b>Ralph</b> <b>Lauren,</b> Calvin Klein, and Donna Karan.|$|E
