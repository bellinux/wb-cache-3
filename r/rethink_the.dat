5|$|The Shrine {{went through}} a {{prolonged}} process of development which began in 1918 with the initial proposal to build a Victorian memorial. Two committees were formed, the second of which ran a competition for the memorial's design. The winner was announced in 1922. However, opposition to the proposal (led by Keith Murdoch and The Herald) forced {{the governments of the}} day to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> design, and a number of alternatives were proposed, the most significant of which was the ANZAC Square and cenotaph proposal of 1926. In response, General Sir John Monash used the 1927 ANZAC Day march to garner support for the Shrine, and finally won the support of the Victorian government later that year. The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, and the Shrine was officially dedicated on 11 November 1934.|$|E
5|$|The biggest festival yet {{was held}} in 1990; however, {{the day after the}} festival ended, {{violence}} – between the security guards and new age travellers (the so-called Battle of Yeoman's Bridge) – led to the organisers taking 1991 and 1996 off to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> festival. An expanded festival returned in 1992, and this proved a great success. 1992 was the first year that the new age travellers were not initially allowed onto the site free, and a sturdier fence was designed. This success was carried through to 1993 which, like 1992, was hot and dry.|$|E
5|$|Theatre also greatly {{influenced}} Alejo Carpentier's work. In all his work, Carpentier uses the characters he creates {{to explore the}} notions of subjectivity and identity, analyzing {{the way in which}} individuals see themselves and others within cultural settings. In order to achieve such an analysis, Carpentier makes use of spectatorship: his characters perceive a spectacle in alterable ways which parallel their alterable ways of experiencing the world. Spectacle situations are also sometimes used by Carpentier as a tool for the characters to reframe and <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> world, as well as to establish individual and group identity.|$|E

5|$|With {{the help}} of Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, Ghatotkacha creates a magical town {{consisting}} of an illusory marketplace and palace. He names the town Mayabazar and invites the Kauravas to stay there. Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jamu introduce themselves to the Kauravas as servants appointed by Balarama to look after them. They manage to trick Sarma and Sastry, Shakuni's lackeys. Ghatotkacha (in Sasirekha's form) makes Duryodhana's wife <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> marriage arrangement and teases Lakshmana Kumara. He plans the wedding of the real Sasirekha and Abhimanyu in his hermitage which is attended by Krishna. Using his divine powers, Krishna also attends as a guest for the marriage {{taking place in the}} Mayabazar.|$|E
5|$|The troubled {{development}} of Final Fantasy XIII {{that had been}} caused by the simultaneous creation of the company-wide engine Crystal Tools gave reason to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> production process for high-budget games at Square Enix. For Final Fantasy XIII-2, the team consulted the European subsidiary Eidos to more closely adapt a Western approach to game development. As a consequence, monthly schedules and project milestones were introduced to better monitor the staff members' progress. Furthermore, unlike its predecessor, Final Fantasy XIII-2 was not entirely developed in-house; Japanese studio tri-Ace was contracted to help out with aspects of the game design, art and programming. This was done to keep the number of internal staff members on the game lower. The contributions of external developers were planned and clearly divided beforehand to achieve a more structured team organization. Concept videos and frequent test playing during production helped constantly engage the staff and keep to the original vision of the game.|$|E

25|$|Many historians {{originally}} {{agreed that}} the American victory over the British at Saratoga, New York was the deciding factor {{in the formation of}} the alliance.

25|$|The 1973 oil shock, however, forced Ber Gelbard to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> Central Bank's {{projected}} reserves and, accordingly, undid planned {{reductions in}} stubborn budget deficits, then around US$2billion a year (4% of GDP).

25|$|The priest Kūkai (best {{known by}} the posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) journeyed to China to study Shingon, a form of Vajrayana Buddhism, which he {{introduced}} into Japan in 806. At the core of Shingon worship are the various mandalas, diagrams of the spiritual universe that influenced temple design. The temples erected for this new sect {{were built in the}} mountains, far away from the court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced their designers to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design.|$|E

25|$|On 12 September 2012 it was {{reported}} that BAE and EADS were in discussions regarding a possible merger. In the event of the merger, BAE shareholders would own 40% and EADS 60% of the new enlarged organisation. A key French EADS shareholder Lagardere asked EADS to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> proposed merger plan as the conditions were unsatisfactory. The bosses of BAE Systems and EADS issued a joint statement seeking political support for their proposed 35 billion euro (US$45 billion) merger from the British, French and German governments; and reiterated that the combination is borne out of opportunity, not necessity and the new company would be greater {{than the sum of its}} parts. It {{was reported}} on 10 October 2012, that the merger between BAE Systems and EADS had been called off.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the PPACA, {{hospitals}} and medical care facilities are forced to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> demand for nurses and non-physician providers. This is mainly because this new Act drew millions of people the opportunity at medical attention that did not have it before, and {{because there are so many}} new people in need of medical attention, the need for medical professionals also grows. With the combination of this new Act, and the aging Baby Boomer population, there is expected to be a large increase in the need for medical staff, especially physicians. Unfortunately, the Act did not account for the need for increased physician residency expansion thus creating an artificial shortage of physicians in an already-overloaded system. According to a study published in American Medical News (an online publication that no longer exists), nurse practitioners' jobs are expected to grow up to 130 percent from 86,000 in 2008 to 198,000 in 2025 through aggressive lobbying. Though there is some skepticism to these vast figures, they are backed up by many studies and the opinions of very well known medical professionals.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, he {{transferred}} to Columbia University, where he studied psychology, taking a BA in 1923 and an MA in 1924. Although White studied at the same university where Franz Boas had lectured, White's understanding of anthropology was decidedly anti-Boasian. However, his interests even {{at this stage of}} his career were diverse, and he took classes in several other disciplines and institutions, including philosophy at UCLA, and clinical psychiatry, before discovering anthropology via Alexander Goldenweiser's courses at the New School for Social Research. In 1925, White began studies for a Ph.D. in sociology/anthropology at the University of Chicago and had the opportunity of spending a few weeks with the Menominee and Winnebago in Wisconsin. After his initial thesis proposal—a library thesis, which foreshadowed his later theoretical work—he conducted fieldwork at Acoma Pueblo, New Mexico. Ph.D. in hand, he began teaching at the University at Buffalo in 1927, where he began to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> antievolutionary views that his Boasian education had instilled in him. In 1930, he moved to Ann Arbor, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} active career.|$|E

[...] "I had to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> whole thing, and decided that we needed to build up some credibility again".

500|$|Through a metafictional and [...] voice, the contemporary, postmodern narrator {{questions}} {{the role of}} the author and the historian in thinking about the past. In her article discussing the use of paratext, or the contextualizing text printed in the book such as the footnotes and epigraphs, Deborah Bowen argues that the novel's paratext forces the reader, like in other postmodern works, to <b>rethink</b> <b>the</b> importance of such peripheral material that in other contexts will get overlooked in light of preference for the main text. Instead of nicely complementing the main plot and adding meaning, these paratextual elements can distract from the effectiveness of the novel and challenging the authority of the narrative voice.|$|E
