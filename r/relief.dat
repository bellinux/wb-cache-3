5|$|A U.S. Navy <b>relief</b> {{plane was}} sent to Chetumal, Mexico, to deliver food and other <b>relief</b> {{supplies}} after Janet struck the region. In areas previously affected by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year, federal <b>relief</b> agencies were ordered to extend <b>relief</b> operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. However, after crossing the Bay of Campeche and making landfall near Veracruz, <b>relief</b> measures were once again implemented in the western Gulf Coast of Mexico. The Mexican Air Force, commercial and private planes, and helicopters were sent to bring <b>relief</b> supplies and airlift refugees. The United States initiated the largest <b>relief</b> campaign ever staged in Mexico at the time. Various government and <b>relief</b> agencies, including the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army, participated in the <b>relief</b> efforts. The United States Air Force and United States Army began a joint-relief operation to send <b>relief</b> supplies to the Tampico area, beginning with the deployment of a Curtiss C-46 Commando from the Harlingen Air Force Base on October1. Ten other military transport aircraft from the United States Air Force were sent from Texas to provide food and clothing. Pan American World Airways sent a Boeing 314 from Miami, Florida to evacuate victims. Helicopters were sent from the USS Saipan to transfer food and medical supplies from the light aircraft carrier. Other ships also aided in delivering supplies, including the USS Siboney, which also deployed helicopters to assist in <b>relief</b> efforts. By October6, 1,500people were estimated to have been rescued from the Tampico area, and at least 280,000lb (130,000kg) of food and clothing materials were estimated to have been delivered by the US Air Force to the city. There, typhoid serum shots were administered as a precautionary measure. Former president Manuel Ávila Camacho {{died of a heart}} ailment, in part due to over-exertion in helping in the <b>relief</b> efforts.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} form of decoration is <b>relief.</b> <b>Relief</b> became more extensive over time, and in late temples, walls, ceilings, columns, and beams were all decorated, as were free-standing stelae erected within the enclosure. Egyptian artists used both bas <b>relief</b> and sunken <b>relief.</b> Bas <b>relief</b> allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than sunken <b>relief.</b> Sunken <b>relief</b> was therefore used on harder, more difficult stone {{and when the}} builders wanted to finish quickly. It was also appropriate for exterior surfaces, where the shadows it created made the figures stand out in bright sunlight. Finished reliefs were painted using the basic colors black, white, red, yellow, green, and blue, although the artists often mixed pigments to create other colors. In some cases, gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or faience substituted for paint.|$|E

5|$|Although Desha {{was clearly}} {{aligned with the}} <b>Relief</b> faction, the faction's leader was John Adair, {{a veteran of the}} War of 1812 whose {{popularity}} was augmented because of his very public defense of the Kentuckians who served under him at the Battle of New Orleans against charges of cowardice by Andrew Jackson. Adair won a close election with 20,493 votes, besting William Logan's 19,947 votes, Desha's 12,418 votes, and Anthony Butler's 9,567 votes. <b>Relief</b> partisans also secured control of both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. Much debt <b>relief</b> legislation was passed during Adair's term, but as his term neared expiration, the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down one popular and expansive debt <b>relief</b> law as unconstitutional, ensuring that debt <b>relief</b> would again be the central issue in the upcoming gubernatorial election.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this essay is to analyse and {{interpret}} artist Hans Hedberg’s monumental, ceramic <b>reliefs</b> in Sweden and France. Hedberg is internationally famous for his ceramic fruits and eggs in different glaces and formats. A mostly unknown side of his artistic production is that he produced about 50 ceramic <b>reliefs</b> during the 1950 s {{and up to the}} 1970 s in public buildings. Hedberg was one of very few foreign artists in France, who, during a long period of time, produced monumental, public <b>reliefs</b> for the French state. The essay analyses the European Postwar Period in France and Hedberg’s <b>reliefs</b> from his early figurative works to his abstract <b>reliefs.</b> It also links Hedberg to Nouveau Réalisme and the Renaissance in Italy. ...|$|R
