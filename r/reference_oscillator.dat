Here we analyze {{the effect of the}} additional noise due to the optical modulators used for removing the phase fluctuations of the onboard <b>reference</b> <b>oscillators.</b> We use a recently measured noise spectrum of an individual modulator to quantify the contribution of modulator noise to the first and second-generation Time-Delay Interferometric (TDI) combinations {{as a function of the}} modulation frequency. We show that modulator noise can be made smaller than the expected proof-mass acceleration and optical-path noises if the modulation frequencies are larger than ≈ 682 MHz in the case of the unequal-arm Michelson TDI combination X_ 1, ≈ 1. 08 GHz for the Sagnac TDI combination α_ 1, and ≈ 706 MHz for the symmetrical Sagnac TDI combination ζ_ 1. These modulation frequencies are substantially smaller than previously estimated and may lead to less stringent requirements on the LISA's oscillator noise calibration subsystem.

The harshest requirements for this contract are surviving and functioning, to within 20 ppm of its center frequency, 30 ms after sustaining a shock pulse of 100, 000 (g) for 0. 5 ms on any axis. Additional requirements call for the transmitter to be no larger than 0. 2 in 3, and to operate within a 20 ppm frequency stability throughout the temperature range of - 400 to + 850 centigrade and during centrifugal spins of up to 300 Hz or 25, 000 (g).

5000|$|The {{superior}} close-in {{phase noise}} {{performance of a}} DDS {{stems from the fact}} that it is a feed-forward system. In a traditional phase locked loop (PLL), the frequency divider in the feedback path acts to multiply the phase noise of the <b>reference</b> <b>oscillator</b> and, within the PLL loop bandwidth, impresses this excess noise onto the VCO output. A DDS on the other hand, reduces the reference clock phase noise by the ratio [...] because its output is derived by fractional division of the clock. Reference clock jitter translates directly to the output, but this jitter is a smaller percentage of the output period (by the ratio above). Since the maximum output frequency is limited to , the output phase noise at close-in offsets is always at least 6dB below the reference clock phase-noise.|$|E

This differentiates GPSDOs from their cousins NCOs (numerically controlled oscillator). Rather than disciplining an oscillator via frequency adjustments, NCOs typically use a free-running, low-cost crystal oscillator and adjust the output phase by digitally lengthening or shortening the output phase many times per second in large phase steps assuring that on average the number of phase transitions per second is aligned to the GPS receiver reference source. This guarantees frequency accuracy {{at the expense of}} high phase noise and jitter, a degradation that true GPSDOs do not suffer.|$|E
