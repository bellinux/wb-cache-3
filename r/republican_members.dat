5|$|On January 18, 1993, Reagan {{received}} the Presidential Medal of Freedom (awarded with distinction), the highest honor that the United States can bestow, from President George H. W. Bush, his Vice President and successor. Reagan was also awarded the Republican Senatorial Medal of Freedom, the highest honor bestowed by <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Concerned about a {{divide in}} the party costing the party McConnell's seat in the general election, the Republican Party of Kentucky asked both {{candidates}} to sign a pledge to support the party's eventual nominee in the general election. McConnell signed the pledge, but Bevin did not. All <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> of Kentucky's congressional caucus joined McConnell in signing the pledge except 4th District congressman Thomas Massie, a legislator aligned with the Tea Party.|$|E
5|$|During {{her visit}} to the United States, Marine Le Pen met two <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> of the U.S. House of Representatives {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, Joe Walsh, {{who is known for}} his strong Islamophobic stance, and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul, whom Le Pen complimented for his stance on the gold standard. In February 2017, two more conservative Republican Congressmen, Steve King and Dana Rohrabacher, also met with Le Pen in Paris.|$|E

50|$|Roy L. McCulty (1889-1968) was an American World War I combat veteran, a Roane County, West Virginia businessman, a six term <b>Republican</b> <b>member</b> of the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1942 to 1954, and a <b>Republican</b> <b>member</b> of the West Virginia Senate, {{representing}} its 4th district from 1957-1960.|$|R
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Paul {{served on the}} House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for {{inflation}} and spoke against the banking mismanagement {{that resulted in the}} savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by <b>Republican</b> <b>members,</b> Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E
5|$|An {{advocate}} for universal and single-payer health care, Wolf is {{a supporter of}} both Massachusetts health care reform and President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). On July 10, 2012 Wolf testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss {{the effects of the}} two laws. Despite repeated jabs by <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> on the committee that it laws would stifle business and hurt employees, Wolf defended the reforms waveringly. Wolf's further statements on the positive aspects of PPACA were eventually cut short by Chairman Darrell Issa, a staunch PPACA opponent. Wolf supported a failed amendment in 2012 which would have implemented single-payer health care in Massachusetts if a study proved it was more effective in reducing costs than the state's current model.|$|E

5|$|The {{compromise}} proposal {{was referred to}} a special committee proposed by Crittenden's fellow Kentucky senator, Lazarus Powell. Though {{it was believed that}} Republicans in general, including their representatives on the committee, were disposed to accept Crittenden's compromise or one substantially similar to it, President-elect Lincoln had already instructed his trusted allies in the legislature to resist any plan to extend slavery into the territories. Consequently, when the committee held its first meeting, the <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> blocked Crittenden's plan and six others from coming to the floor for a vote. Despite their opposition, however, the Republicans presented no alternative plan. After the rejection of Crittenden's plan in committee, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia followed South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession.|$|E
5|$|Warren was {{an early}} {{advocate}} {{for the creation of}} a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, President Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to set up the new agency. While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups pushed for Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, Warren was strongly opposed by financial institutions and by <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> of Congress who believed Warren would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director, Obama turned to former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray and in January 2012, over the objections of Republican senators, appointed Cordray to the post in a recess appointment.|$|E
5|$|With Speaker Schuyler Colfax’ {{election}} to the Vice Presidency in 1868, {{the leadership of the}} House became vacant. Blaine had only been a member of Congress since 1863, but he had developed a reputation for parliamentary skill and, aside from a growing feud with Roscoe Conkling of New York, was popular with his fellow Republicans. He was elected with the unanimous vote of the <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> {{at the start of the}} 41st Congress in March 1869. Blaine was an effective Speaker with a magnetic personality. Moreover, President Ulysses S. Grant valued his skill and loyalty in leading the House. He enjoyed the job and made his presence in Washington more permanent by buying a large residence on Fifteenth Street in the city. At the same time, the Blaine family moved to a mansion in Augusta.|$|E

5|$|The voters {{returned}} Sherman {{to office}} for a third term in 1858. After a brief special session in March 1859, the 36th Congress adjourned, and Sherman and his wife went on vacation to Europe. When they returned that December, the situation {{was similar to that}} of four years earlier: no party had an absolute majority. Republicans held 109 seats, Democrats 101, and Know Nothings 27. Again, sectional tension had increased while Congress was in recess, this time due to John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. The election for Speaker of the House promised to be contentious. This time, Sherman was among the leading candidates, receiving the second-largest number of votes on the first ballot, with no candidate receiving a majority. The election for Speaker was sidetracked immediately by a furor over an anti-slavery book, The Impending Crisis of the South, written by Hinton Rowan Helper and endorsed by many <b>Republican</b> <b>members.</b> Southerners accused Sherman of having endorsed the book, while he protested that he only endorsed its use as a campaign tool and had never read it. After two months of balloting, no decision had been reached. After their attempts to adopt a plurality rule failed, Sherman accepted that he could not be elected, and withdrew. Republicans then shifted their support to William Pennington, who was elected on the forty-fourth ballot.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{spent much}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in both the House and the Senate, though they still remained in the minority. Few <b>Republican</b> <b>members</b> of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.|$|E
