5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E

25|$|On 8 August 2017 The Washington Post {{reported}} that the Defense Intelligence Agency, in a confidential assessment, stated that North Korea has sufficiently miniaturized a nuclear warhead to fit inside one of its long-range missiles. On August 12 The Diplomat {{reported that}} the Central Intelligence Agency, in a confidential assessment from early August, has concluded that the <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> in the July 28 test of Hwasong-14 didn't survive atmospheric reentry due to apogee of 3,700 kilometers which caused structural stresses in excess of what an ICBM would have had in minimum energy trajectory. The CIA also concluded that North Korean <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> is likely advanced enough that it would likely survive reentry under normal minimum energy trajectory.|$|E

25|$|First {{trials of}} the Agni-III saw {{problems}} and the missile test did not meet its objectives. The second test was successful. Further tests of the Agni-III are planned to validate the missile and its subsystems, which include new propellant and guidance systems, a new <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> and other improvements.|$|E
25|$|The HOE used a Kinetic Kill Vehicle (KKV) {{to destroy}} a {{ballistic}} missile. The KKV was equipped with an infrared seeker, guidance electronics and a propulsion system. Once in space, the KKV could extend a folded structure similar to an umbrella skeleton of 4m (13ft) diameter to enhance its effective cross section. This device would destroy the ICBM <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> on collision.|$|E
25|$|The program {{demonstrated}} that the vehicle was able to generate lift/drag ratio of 3.5 to 1, allowing it to greatly extend its range. Although this was not put to immediate use, the tests provided valuable data that was used for later programs like the Boost Glide <b>Reentry</b> <b>Vehicle</b> and the ASSET and PRIME programs. Better understanding of the hypersonic lift process also led to the lifting body designs of the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The Agni-V missile is an Intercontinental {{ballistic}} missile meant for long-range deterrence. The Agni-V {{is the newest}} version and has the longest range of up to 5000–6000km. Agni-V would also carry Multiple independently targetable <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> payloads and will have countermeasures against Anti-{{ballistic missile}} systems. It was successfully test fired on 19 April 2012. The missile will utilise a canister and will be launched from it. Sixty percent of the missile will {{be similar to the}} Agni-III missile. Advanced technologies like ring laser gyroscope and accelerometer will be used in the new missile.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{developed}} {{a new series of}} long-range missiles, called the SS-9 (NATO codename Scarp). A question developed concerning the extent of their capability to carry nuclear weapons; at issue was whether the missile were a Multiple independently targetable <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> (MIRV) or not. The CIA information was that these missiles were not 'MIRVed' but Defense intelligence considered that they were of the more potent kind. If so, the Soviet Union was possibly aiming at a first strike nuclear capacity. The Nixon administration, desiring to employ the existence of such Soviet threat to justify a new American antiballistic missile system, publicly endorsed the Defense point of view. Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security advisor, asked Helms to review the CIA's finding, yet Helms initially stood by his analysts at CIA. Eventually, however, Helms compromised.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2007 United States Air Force {{nuclear weapons}} {{incident}} when six AGM-129 Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM), each loaded with a W80-1 variable yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a B-52H at Minot AFB and transported to Barksdale AFB and the 2008 {{incident in which}} four MK-12 forward-section <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> assemblies were mistakenly shipped to Taiwan, former Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger led {{an investigation into the}} status of U.S. Air Force nuclear surety. Secretary Schlesinger's recommendation was the creation of a single major command under which all Air Force nuclear assets should be placed for better accountability. On 24 October 2008, the Secretary of the United States Air Force, Michael Donley, announced the creation of the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) as a new Air Force major command (MAJCOM). Along with Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, AFGSC is one of two Air Force component commands reporting to United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) at Offutt.|$|E

500|$|The {{first section}} of the Bell study was {{returned}} to the Army Ordnance department at the Redstone Arsenal on 2 December 1955. It considered {{the full range of}} threats including existing jet aircraft, future ramjet powered aircraft flying at up to , short-range ballistic missiles of the V-2 type flying at about the same speed, and an ICBM <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> (RV) traveling at [...] They suggested that a missile with a common rocket booster could serve all of these roles by changing between two upper stages; one with fins for use in the atmosphere against aircraft, and another with vestigial fins and thrust vectoring for use above the atmosphere against missiles.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{possible}} to deploy radar decoys to confuse the defense. Decoys are made of lightweight materials, often strips of aluminum or mylar balloons, which can be packed in with the <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> (RV), adding little throw weight. In space, these are ejected to create a threat tube a few kilometers across and tens of kilometers long. Zeus had to get within about [...] to kill a warhead, which could be anywhere in the tube. The WSEG suggested that a single ICBM with decoys would almost certainly defeat Zeus. Considering a large missile with multiple warheads, a summer 1961 staff report by ARPA suggested a single missile could require four entire Zeus batteries to defeat it, making the system impractical.|$|E
500|$|On 5 June 2008, Robert Gates {{announced}} {{the results of}} an investigation into the misshipment in 2006 of four Mk 12 forward-section <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicle</b> assemblies to Taiwan. The investigation, conducted by Admiral Kirkland H. Donald, director of U.S. Naval Nuclear Propulsion, found that the Taiwan missile incident was, in Gates' words, [...] "a degradation of the authority, standards of excellence and technical competence within the nation's ICBM force. Similar to the bomber-specific August 2007 Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident, this incident took place within the larger environment of declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance" [...] and that [...] "the investigation identified commonalities between the August 2007 Minot incident and this [...] event." [...] In his investigation report, Donald stated that the issues identified by his investigation were [...] "indicative of an overall decline in Air Force nuclear weapons stewardship, a problem that has been identified but not effectively addressed for over a decade. Both the Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident and the Taiwan misshipment, while different in specifics, have a common origin: the gradual erosion of nuclear standards and a lack of effective oversight by Air Force leadership." ...|$|E
