In May 1999, the Head of Track had said that insufficiently skilled work was causing more rails to break.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify and determine trends in the uncertainty in the life cycle cost (LCC) associated with the maintenance and renewal (M&R) of the rail of a railway track under a fixed set of input parameters and conditions. Rail maintenance models were identified in the literature which use the mean or expected value of the input distributions to determine a corresponding mean or expected LCC. Although these models display important trends with regard to input parameters such as inspection intervals, they provide no means to quantify the uncertainty related to maintenance and renewal decisions. Thus, a numerical model was developed and programmed using MATLAB which allows the quantification of the uncertainty in the LCC estimated for a given set of conditions. The model uses Monte Carlo simulation to determine the LCC associated with the installation, maintenance and renewal of the rail. The model incorporates imperfect inspections, a hazard function for <b>rail</b> <b>fatigue</b> defects modelled using the Weibull probability distribution and a P-F interval for <b>rail</b> <b>fatigue</b> defects modelled using an exponential probability distribution. The model also allows the modelling of maintenance as either perfect or minimal maintenance as well as the use of either flash butt or alumino-thermic welds to conduct the maintenance. This allowed the development of a method to assess which weld type to use to minimise the minimum attainable mean LCC. The developed model was validated against a similar stochastic rail maintenance model from the literature. However, the model from the literature considers only the expected LCC and does not show any uncertainty related thereto. The novelty in this study therefore lies in the fact that the LCC uncertainty can be quantified in the form of a probability distribution at any given renewal tonnage for a given set of conditions. It was found that the distribution of the LCC at a given renewal tonnage followed a lognormal probability distribution. The standard deviation of the lognormal distributions fitted using the method of maximum likelihood was used as a metric to quantify the uncertainty related to the life cycle cost at a given renewal tonnage. The LCC uncertainty was found to increase with an increase in inspection interval length. Furthermore, the uncertainty was also found to increase with a respective increase in renewal tonnage. For varying inspection interval lengths it was found that the uncertainty of combined maintenance costs (planned plus unplanned maintenance costs) tended more strongly towards the uncertainty in the planned maintenance costs for smaller inspection intervals and more strongly towards the uncertainty in unplanned maintenance costs for larger inspection intervals. A critical cost ratio was found of flash butt weld cost to alumino-thermic weld cost at which the minimum attainable mean LCC was equal. It is more economical to use flash butt welding for maintenance if the cost of flash butt welding maintenance produces a cost ratio lower than the critical cost ratio. The developed model could allow railway operators to assess the risk associated with renewal of the rail at varying renewal tonnages for given conditions such as inspection interval lengths, detectability of <b>rail</b> <b>fatigue</b> defects and the arrival rate of <b>rail</b> <b>fatigue</b> defects.

Over the last two decades, the railroad industry has experienced a significant increase in heavy axle loads acting on railroad rails. In addition, railroad operations have been consolidated resulting in the elimination of redundant routes and increased train traffic on the remaining routes. These changes in railroad industry practice have caused an increase in the rate of occurrence of <b>rail</b> head <b>fatigue</b> defects, one potential cause of train derailment. The primary form of maintenance employed by the individual railroads to combat the formation of <b>fatigue</b> defects is <b>rail</b> grinding. Current rail grinding practices involve removal of surface defects and reshaping worn rail, but they do not involve grinding as a means to mitigate internal fatigue damage. In this study, a model for optimizing a grinding schedule which will prevent the formation of internal fatigue defects is proposed. The model includes a statistical representation of wheel loads, a rail head stress analysis, a <b>rail</b> head <b>fatigue</b> analysis, and optimization of a grinding schedule via mathematical programming. Results from using this model indicate that rail grinding might be performed {{in such a way as}} to double the useful service life of railroad rail...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>fatigue</b> is a {{major problem}} for {{railroad}} industry. It can lead to catastrophic derailment causing loss of lives and great financial loss. A new technology has recently been developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) showed desirable results. This technology involves the use of laser to treat (glaze) the gage side of the rail. Treating steel rails by "laser glazing " reduces friction between the rails and train wheels by approximately 40 %. Reducing friction can save an estimated $ 60 million in fuel costs and $ 16 million in rail replacements, as well as lower the risk of derailment. Reducing rail friction results in reducing wear and prolonging fatigue life. This paper investigates the potential of laser glazing process to improve the fatigue life of railroad tracks.

40|$|The Association of American Railroads {{wished to}} {{determine}} the effect of a maintenance practice known as grinding on the occurrence of <b>rail</b> <b>fatigue</b> defects and on the subsequent total traffic usage before a track must be replaced. Because a designed experiment was not practical, an analysis of historical data from the Canadian Northern Railroad is presented. In the analysis, certain covariate data are available, specifically the amount of grinding and some physical characteristics of the rail; other important covariate data are not available, however. A model for the number of defects as a function of traffic usage is developed based on a modulated Poisson point process. The model incorporates the effect of the available covariates and a mixture of Dirichlet processes set-up for the scale parameters of the individual rail sections that allows an assessment of the overall effect of the unavailable covariates. The model is then used to determine an optimal replacement period for a whole rail track. The analysis demonstrates that grinding reduces the expected number of defects and increases the optimal replacement interval...|$|E

Another derailment had occurred the previous year of 1869, for example, in the Dalton Junction <b>rail</b> crash. <b>Fatigue</b> was the basic cause of the problem, but the hairline cracks characteristic of fatigue {{are very difficult to}} detect, and were frequently missed, until they became critical.

Improvements in the quality and capacity of current services {{and the development of}} new railway infrastructure are needed to meet the increasing demand for transferring more people and goods in a more sustainable way. In particular, the performance of the track system is crucial to the successful and cost-effective operation of the railway. This has motivated much scientific research with the aim of better understanding the performance of the railway system, including both existing railway tracks and improved tracks for the future. Much current research on railway track focuses on individual aspects of the design and performance, e. g. track settlement, <b>rail</b> <b>fatigue,</b> ballast degradation, ride quality, maintenance, and noise and vibration. However to achieve substantial advances in railway track design, {{it is important to consider}} all these aspects in an integrated way. Changes that can benefit one aspect should not be allowed to have a negative impact on others. To facilitate this, a single tool should be developed or the computational tools that consider individual aspects of the design need to be integrated. The resulting tool can therefore be used to assess the behaviour of railway tracks in a holistic manner. A preliminary version of such a holistic tool is presented here. In this version, fast running models and empirical relationships are put together in order to calculate the performance of a railway track with regard to ride quality, ground-borne noise and vibration and rolling noise. Results for practical case studies are presented and discussed.

The results were found to be in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the newly developed Three Mechanism (TM) model of rolling contact fatigue, which is introduced here.

Due to the brittleness of the weld material and HAZ and the scatter in its mechanical properties, a statistical approach is necessary.

The investigations presented here comprise weld material characterization, simulation of fatigue crack propagation and finally {{the determination of the}} failure probability using the Monte Carlo method. The effect of various parameters, such as axle weight, initial crack size, residual stresses, fatigue crack propagation threshold and date of inspection were analyzed. The results show that, independent of the date of the last inspection, almost any failure event happens in wintertime. This is in accordance with practical experience.

Twin-disc contact simulation tests {{were carried out}} to investigate the influence of intermittent lubrication on <b>rail</b> steel <b>fatigue</b> life, using both a colloidal suspension of molybdenum disulphide in an oil carrier fluid (similar to a commercial {{flange lubrication}} product) and water. A brief interruption of the lubricant supply during molybdenum disulphide lubrication produced rapid surface failure of the rail steel, which was followed by rapid contact fatigue crack growth upon reapplication of the lubricant. During water lubrication the interruption of the lubricant (water) supply did not produce such rapid crack growth. The results {{were found to be}} in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the three-mechanism model of rolling contact fatigue, which combines the mechanisms of ratchetting (accumulation of unidirectional plastic strain until the critical failure strain of the material is reached) and the fracture mechanics-based mechanisms of shear stress driven and tensile fluid assisted crack growth.

40|$|Several {{different}} kinds of steel are used for railway rails. From simple pearlitic steels for rarely used tracks over premium pearlitic steels for high performance lines to special bainitic, martensitic and austenitic steels for switches and crossings. Most of these steels have been trial and error developed over time in track. The main reasons for replacement of <b>rails</b> are <b>fatigue</b> and wear. For material selection purposes fatigue properties {{must be taken into}} account. Simple fatigue testing methods that allow comparison of different steels are scarce in literature. In this thesis results from low cycle fatigue test of four different steels are compiled and a comparison based on strain energy density is presented. The steels are all used for railway rail application. One is near fully pearlitic steel which is mainly employed in common track. The other three are used for different parts in switches and crossings. It is one carbide free bainitic steel, one high manganese austenitic steel and a martensitic steel. Results show the martensitic and bainitic steel as the superior steels at low strain ranges (< 0. 4 %). At high strain ranges the bainitc steel fails to perform due to crack sensitivity and the martensitic and the pearlitic steels are superior. The austenitic steel can not readily be compared to the other steels through low cycle fatigue tests because of its unique hardening property. The comparison of strain energy densities is a viable way to compare standard steels...|$|R

The complexity of deciding the optimal rail grinding intervals for improving the reliability and safety of rails is because of insufficient understanding of the various factors involved in the crack initiation and propagation process. This paper focuses on identifying the factors influencing rail degradation, developing models for rail failures and analyzing the costs of various grinding intervals for economic decision making.

40|$|The rail–wheel contact generates plastic {{deformation}} and {{cracks in the}} top layer of a <b>rail.</b> Rolling contact <b>fatigue</b> (RCF) cracks in rail samples from track and from a full scale test rig were examined. Due to the shear forces arising in the wheel rail contact, the microstructure close to the surface becomes aligned in the shear direction. Thereby, the pearlite becomes anisotropic, and resistance to cracks is lower in certain directions. RCF cracks follow the weakest direction of the microstructure, which in pearlitic railway rails is the aligned pearlite structure or singular weaknesses such as pro-eutectoid ferrites or slags. The deformation of the microstructure is different depending on loading situation and original microstructure (rail grade). Once the {{plastic deformation}} is present, the cracks follow the path of the weakest crack resistance.

40|$|Highly {{localized}} stresses generated at {{the gauge}} {{corner of the}} outer <b>rail</b> cause <b>fatigue</b> cracking. The longitudinal bending stresses in the rail underhead radius position are of special interest, as tension spikes have been identified at this location during in-track measurements under high axle load conditions. The tension spike {{is a result of}} vertical and lateral head bending on the web. This effect is highly localized and is additional to the stresses generated due to vertical and lateral bending of the whole rail profile (the so-called global bending). This study examined contact and bending stresses by modelling the rail on a discrete foundation using finite elements and by considering the loading to be a fully slipping elliptical Hertzian contact patch. The analysis revealed that the tensile longitudinal stress was highly dependent on several service conditions: the contact patch offset from the rail centreline, the ratio of lateral (L) to vertical (V) loads, the direction of lateral traction, foundation stiffness and seasonal temperature variations. The tension spike increases, and the depth below the contact surface at which the stresses become tensile reduces, as the contact patch offset and/or the L/V ratio increases. Both these enhance the tendency for rolling contact fatigue cracks to turn downwards and become transverse defects. This is because an increase in tensile bending stresses together with both residual and thermally induced stresses can facilitate cracks to turn perpendicular to the tensile stresses once they reach a critical length. Shear traction towards the gauge corner was found to be the most damaging phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} plastic strain accumulation, wear, and rolling contact fatigue (RCF) crack {{initiation}} in rail steel has been developed.

The model is being further refined to account for detailed microstructural changes. Sections of worn and <b>fatigued</b> <b>rail,</b> removed from service, have been metallurgically analysed. To obtain further data on rail-steel deformation and RCF crack initiation, twin-disc tests have been performed using discs cut from across a railhead and wheel rim. Two heat treatments were applied to some rail discs to investigate the effect of pro-eutectoid ferrite phase distributions and volume fractions. Tests were run to failure (defined by an eddy current crack-detection system) and to percentages of fatigue lives. Micro- and nano-hardness tests, and microstructural observations, have been used to suggest a micromechanism of fatigue crack initiation for the model.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a theoretical Structural Impairment Detection System (SIDS) for timber railway bridges. Due to fatigue, the timber stringers in timber railway bridges develop shear cracks. These shear cracks lead to higher bridge deflections, higher stresses in the stringers and <b>rail,</b> and shorter <b>fatigue</b> life of the system. A SIDS is proposed which links wheel path accelerations obtained from traversing freight cars to the condition of the bridge. In order to develop the SIDS, two models of timber railway bridges with various levels of structural impairment were developed. The first model was a quasi-static model developed from classical beam theory and implemented in MATLAB. The second model was a dynamic, finite element model created in LS-DYNA. Traversing axle loads were imposed on the models. The results obtained from the model were the wheel paths the axles take as they traverse the bridge. The paths were expressed as vertical displacements as a function of position on the bridge. Wheel path accelerations were obtained by numerically differentiating the vertical displacements. The accelerations were then used to train neural networks to have an input of an acceleration vector and an output of a bridge condition vector. The neural networks were trained on results from both models under three train speeds: 40 mph, 30 mph, and 20 mph. The networks were able to determine the correct bridge condition 90 % of the time when the train speed was 40 mph and 70 % of the time when the train speed was 30 mph.

However, characterization of the constitutive and fatigue behavior of this region is difficult due to the large gradient of properties. In the present thesis, the deformed microstructure in this region is characterized. An axial-torsion test rig is used to predeform cylindrical low-cycle fatigue specimens {{in order to obtain}} material properties {{similar to those of the}} near-surface region in rails. These specimens are more suitable for further mechanical testing, compared to those resulting from many of the other predeformation methods described in the literature. The obtained material is compared to field samples in terms of the material hardness and microstructure. The microstructure is evaluated with both optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. This comparison shows that the predeformed material state closely resembles what is found in some used rails at a depth between 50 and 100 μm. In order to describe the behavior of the material during the large shear deformations, a sound framework for finite strain metal plasticity is needed. Several options are available in the literature, but in this thesis two frameworks for hyperelasto-plasticity with kinematic hardening are investigated. It is shown that for appropriate choices of Helmholtz' free energy these frameworks are equivalent. Furthermore, several material models formulated within this framework are evaluated in terms of their abilities to predict the mechanical response during the predeformation. Particular emphasis is put on the role of the kinematic hardening laws and how these influence the response during the biaxial loading. It is found that by combining different models from the literature, the predeformation process can be modeled accurately...|$|R
40|$|Rolling contact {{fatigue crack}} growth {{continues}} to affect many railways worldwide. It {{is most often}} controlled through rail grinding in a preventive maintenance strategy, but to plan the required frequency and depth of grinding, prediction of crack growth rates has a vital role. This paper presents crack growth rate results from a new three-dimensional rail model containing an inclined surface breaking rolling contact fatigue crack. The calculations {{are based on a}} shear mode of crack growth, driven by the Hertzian contact pressure on the railhead and moderated by friction between the crack faces ("crack face friction"). The results from the model show good correlation with those from the previously published work in the area, with particularly good agreement at higher levels of surface friction coefficient. Applying the new model to a range of surface and crack face friction coefficients predicted that crack growth rate will rise with reduced internal crack face friction at all crack sizes. For small cracks (2 and 5 mm radius) rates were predicted to rise with increased surface traction, but this trend was reversed at larger crack sizes (10 and 19 mm radius). Identical trends were found when the modelling was repeated using the previously developed half-space based " 2. 5 d" model, indicating that although this older model cannot represent the rail geometry its high speed means it remains a useful tool for investigating the effects of contact parameters on <b>rail</b> rolling contact <b>fatigue.</b> The next study in this area could therefore consider if there is a uniform or crack size related ratio for mapping 2. 5 d results to three-dimensional rail geometry to produce closer agreement in crack growth rates as well as trends. For the three-dimensional model, consideration of alternative crack morphologies and movement of the contact running band away from the rail centreline would provide additional data on the effect of rail grinding and re-profiling on rolling contact fatigue...|$|R
40|$|In wheel-rail contact, the {{locomotive}} adhesion characterises {{the capability of}} {{the locomotive}} to convert available friction into traction at the interface. Recently developed AC (Alternating Current) drive induces a higher adhesion level compared to DC (Direct Current) drive. This significantly affects the wheel-rail contact conditions such as damage initiation, high contact temperature due to frictional rolling, and wear of the rails. Three-dimensional (3 D) elasto-plastic finite element model (FEM) {{was used in this}} thesis to examine the wheel-rail contact on a straight track. Some sub-components of the track such as railpads, sleepers and ballast were also included in the model. Rolling contact stress states and material response of wheel/ rail under three contact situations (high adhesion, low adhesion and full slip) were investigated. Canted and non-canted rails were considered to determine the effect of the cant angle on the contact stress levels. Furthermore, the effects of contact curvature on the contact zone and contact pressure were also observed, and the response of material was predicted by a shakedown diagram. The more complicated rolling phenomenon of the wheel on a curved track was also investigated numerically in this thesis. Due to the influences of super-elevation (also called track cant), angle of attack (AOA) and rail cant, stress states on the high rail are significantly different from that on the low rail. The new and worn profiles were considered in the simulation to examine different contact situations: new wheel/new rail, new wheel/worn rail, and worn wheel/worn rail contacts. Material responses, the formation of <b>rail</b> corrugation and <b>fatigue</b> defects on both low and high rails were anticipated based on the results from simulations. In order to compare stress states AC and DC locomotives, two locomotive models of AC (C 44 ACi) and DC (Cv 40 - 9 i) currently run in Australia were evaluated under diverse operational situations (wheel loads, angle of attack and adhesion level). The software LS-DYNA was employed to build up a comprehensive wheel/rail contact model. The numerical model was constructed based on Australian wheel/rail profiles. Moreover the analytical method was also applied to evaluate the temperature rise on the rail, respectively. Calculation of wear volume on rail was eventually performed using the Archard’s wear model. Finally a 3 D coupled thermal-mechanical FE model was developed to examine the temperature rise due to high adhesion contact and the thermal influence on residual stress-strain, wear and rail life. The numerical model employed the moving heat source code developed by Goldak. The mechanical and thermal properties of the rail material were governed by temperature. The influence of repeated multi-passes from multiple wheels on one point of the rail was also taken into account. Moreover the formation of white etching layer (WEL) on the rail surface combined with rolling cycles can potentially lead to rail damage. A sub- 2 D FE model of WEL was also carried out to examine the stress state on the WEL if formed on the rail surface. The current thesis focuses on modelling wheel-rail contact under high adhesion condition, and explanation of the subsequent damage formation on the rail. The model provides {{a better understanding of the}} influences of high adhesion condition on contact stress states, damage initiation and also temperature rise on the rail. To the best of the author’s knowledge, the simulation of wheel-rail contact under high adhesion condition has not been studied elsewhere, and is presented in this study for the first time...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. The aim of Spoornet is {{to provide}} a {{minimise}} predictable service. In order to provide a predictable service, it is necessary to move trains safely and effectively from the place of departure to their destination. The keywords here are safely and effectively. Although support functions such as infrastructure and train control procedures are vital in moving the train, the train or rolling stock as it is generally known, warrants some attention. Defects on the rolling stock are very costly to Spoornet. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} a defect on the rolling stock that goes undetected can cause damage to the rolling stock and the infrastructure. This damage can eventually lead to derailments. Considering that a derailment can cost Spoornet millions of rand and cause delays to the services, it is only logical to spend time preventing derailments. It is for this reason that a workgroup was formed to investigate and solve the problem of defects causing derailments and delays by developing an early warning system. The need for an integrated train condition monitoring system became apparent when considering an early warning system. The objectives of the integrated train condition monitoring system are to provide train condition information to different users, and alarms on detection of emergency or dangerous conditions. Various train defects that may cause damage or derailments were identified. One of them being a flat wheel on a rail vehicle. A flat wheel is characterised by the flattening of the wheel on one or more positions on its circumference, so that the wheel does not have an even and completely round profile. Flat wheels are mostly caused by the wheels of a vehicle becoming locked during braking, and sliding along the rail track. The friction created by this action grinds a flat spot on the wheel. The flat wheel leads to a decline in the riding quality of the rolling stock and a rise in the levels of vibration and noise is evident. But more importantly, the flat spot causes the wheel to roll unevenly, creating impacts on the rail on some points. It is these impacts that can cause damage to the rail and the rolling stock. Depending on the length of the flat spot, the vehicle type and speed, the stresses may be sufficient to cause final failure of the <b>rail</b> or initiate <b>fatigue</b> cracks in the rail. Severe flat wheels are a safety hazard and can in some cases, cause derailments and consequent delays to trains. Smaller flat spots contribute to track deterioration and so increase maintenance costs by damaging the rails, sleepers and ballast. Flat wheels can thus be very costly to Spoornet and its public image. In addition to safety and economic considerations, wheel flats reduce the comfort levels in the passenger coaches and the noises they make is annoying. In an attempt to restrict the damage caused by flat wheels, most railway administrations place a limit on the length of the flats that may stay in service. But to effectively find a flat wheel on rolling stock is currently a very expensive exercise. Flat wheels can be detected by an audible knocking sound when standing next to the rail. This sound is impossible for the driver to hear and therefore goes undetected. Normally flat wheels are detected by random inspection of the rolling stock or when they are brought in for a routine service. The service cycle on rolling stock can be up to 24 months in Spoornet. Considering that a flat wheel has an impact roughly every 3 m, a serious flat generates roughly 160 000 impacts on a single trip on the coal heavy haul export line. It is therefore clear that a flat wheel can cause a considerable amount of damage between service cycles. The severity of the problem is however not accurately defined in Spoornet, because up to a few months ago there was no detection system in use to determine the distribution of flat wheels. The research department of the Deutsche Bundesbahn however considers rail fractures due to the flat wheels to be a serious problem with a significant annual replacement cost. There are thus sound safety and economic reasons for wishing to understand the mechanisms of flat wheels and to develop an early warning system using an automatic detector...|$|R
