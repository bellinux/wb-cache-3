We show that a cyclonic background rotation strongly stabilizes the radiative instability. The modes become neutral when the Rossby number Ro is below a critical value which depends on the azimuthal wavenumber of the wave. In the limit of small Rossby number, there exist fast neutral waves that are not captured by the quasi-geostrophic theory. In the presence of anticyclonic background rotation, the centrifugal instability dominates the radiative instability only when - 400 less than or similar to Ro < - 1. The numerical stability analysis is completed by asymptotic analyses for large wavenumbers which explain the properties and mechanisms of the waves and the instabilities. The stability of a continuous smoothed <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex</b> is also investigated.

40|$|Being able {{to predict}} the {{properties}} of a decaying vortex is of value to various technological and scientific problems. The hazards presented by the vortices shed by large, heavily loaded, aircraft to an incoming plane are well known. A safe separation distance makes sure that the vortices shed by the first aircraft have been decayed to a level that is safe for the following aircraft. The decay of geophysical vortices is a highly complex phenomenon. Nevertheless, simplified time-dependent vortex models, like the one presented in this thesis, do elaborate on the basic processes involved during the energy dissipative phase. The general approach also provides a method that enables us to study the transient flow development in a plethora of swirling flow problems that evolve by starting or halting a pair of circular cylinders. In the present thesis, a novel analytical method is developed to study the decay of a strong, concentrated vortex. Based on the equations representing the transient fluid motion and using a standard solution formulation via Fourier-Bessel expansions will show that different initial profiles of the velocity produce distinct velocity time distributions. Three initial velocity shapes will be explored here. The first deals with the decay of a potential vortex. This type presents the known theoretical discrepancy of infinite velocity and vorticity in the center at the start. The second case considers an initial velocity distribution of a <b>Rankine's</b> <b>vortex.</b> The latter although possess a continuous velocity and static pressure distributions, it is also theoretically dubious since in this situation the vorticity presents a jump discontinuity at the core radius.

The FLOW- 3 D {{is a general}} purpose computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package. The fluid motion is described with non-linear, transient, second-order differential equations. Additionally the free surface also exists in many simulations carried out with FLOW- 3 D because flow parameters and materials properties, such as density, velocity and pressure experience a discontinuity at it. After analysis of the vortex by mentioned details, the finding of time-averaged velocity components, turbulent components, turbulence dissipation, in the 2 D briefed sections of chamber were depicted. It was found that there are different flow patterns like clockwise/anticlockwise vortices and some sink points combined {{with each other in}} different time intervals, decaying and generating along the time.

The vorticity holes evolve similarly to a pair of vortices in an otherwise quiescent fluid; their interaction with the boundary of the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex</b> being relevant only when they are close to it.

The {{data were collected}} just above the ground at close range with a mobile, W-band (3 -mm wavelength) Doppler radar having an azimuthal (radial) resolution of 3 – 5 m (30 m) at {{the range of the}} dust devils. Most dust devils appeared as quasi-circular rings of relatively high radar reflectivity. Four dust-devil vortices were probed, three of which were cyclonic and one anticyclonic. Documentation was obtained of a pair of adjacent cyclonic vortices rotating cyclonically around each other. Approximate radial profiles of azimuthal and radial wind components and of radar reflectivity are detailed and discussed. The diameters of the core of the dust devils ranged from 30 to 130 m; the latter diameters are much wider than that of typical dust devils in a homogeneous environment. The widest vortex was cyclonic and exhibited evidence of a two-cell structure (i. e., sinking motion near the center and rising motion just outside the radius of maximum wind), a broad, calm eye, and an annulus of maximum vorticity just inside the radius of maximum wind. As the vortex widened, it developed an asymmetry, and some evidence was found that two waves propagated cyclonically around it.

Mathematical {{description}} of vortex flows {{as a part}} of basic fundamental concepts of continuum mechanics, hydro- and gas dynamics, thermal physics, theoretical basics of chemical engineering, geophysics, meteorology. Objective. Replenishment of existing information in traditional scientific, technical and educational publications about vortices and their analytical models by new data for scientists, teachers, post-graduates and students with the purpose of using in further investigations of fluids and gas vortex motion. Methods. Analytical review of existing vortex current models, including monopole compact vortices, on a basis of the latest data from scientific articles and specialized monographs and their comparison with traditional data containing in the known textbooks and educational materials. Results. The lack of modern compact vortices models was revealed in traditional scientific, technical and educational literary sources. They include the compact analogs of the point <b>vortex</b> and <b>Rankine</b> vortex: quasi-point <b>vortex</b> and compact compensated vortex. On basis of these ones and similar to them solutions (circular vortex, vortex with triad constant vorticity zones) the models of compact helical flows and vortices with helical symmetry were elaborated. The solutions of such tasks were analyzed: diffusion of compact vortices (Taylor vortex, Kloosterziel solution), turbulent diffusion of compact vortex, solutions for quasi-compact (laminar and turbulent) vortex-source, vortex-sink and also solution of the problem about compact turbulent vortex generation by rotating cylinder. All considered models are consistent with the energy conservation law and have advantages in their use. Conclusions. The article contains series of the latest analytical models that describe both laminar and turbulent dynamics of monopole vortex flows which have not been reflected in traditional publications up to the present. The further research must be directed to search of analytical models for the coherent vortical structures in flows of viscous fluids, particularly near curved surfaces, where known in hydromechanics “wall law” is disturbed and heat and mass transfer anomalies take place...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of free surface vortices {{has been a}} major source of problems in different kinds of hydraulic intakes. Strong free surface vortices have a tendency to introduce swirl, floating matter and air into the intake, all of which are considered more or less harmful for intake and its subsequent structure operation. Formation and strength of free surface vortices can be minimised by proper design of the intake and/or using vortex suppressors. Intake submergence being the main governing factor in free surface vortex formation, it is chosen as the main design factor in vortex-free intake design. The free surface vortex formation at a hydraulic intake and subsequently its strength and position are, however, also highly influenced by the shape of the surrounding boundaries and approach flow conditions. As these properties always vary with each different installation sites, it is necessary to test the proposed designs thoroughly, even though they had been created according to the design criteria. The testing has to be done with properly scaled hydraulic models, as the geometries at the intake sites tend to be so complex that it is not possible or cost-effective to use computational methods. In this study, the formation of free surface vortex and the affecting factors on its strength were studied at spillway intakes of 1 : 100 hydraulic scale model of Xiluodu hydropower dam. The findings presented in this thesis reflect the true behaviour of vortices in the prototype. Data collection was done using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) on the free surface flow field around the spillway intakes of the dam. The surface flow field data produced by the PTV system was interpolated, and the obtained full flow fields were analysed according to the Helmholtz <b>vortex</b> theorems and <b>Rankine</b> combined <b>vortex</b> theory principles: velocities around irregularly shaped vortices were averaged and the circulation strengths were calculated according to the theory. The shape of the intake surroundings was found to be a highly affecting factor in the vortex formation, mainly affecting the local approach flow condition, {{which is one of the}} main governing factors in vortex formation, and vortex pinning position, which determines the length of the vortex core and simultaneously affects the strength of the vortex. By changing the discharge inside the spillways with control gates and using only one of the each contiguous spillways, was found to be a way to control vortex formation. During the flood peak conditions it is not possible to avoid harmful vortices, and when compared to vortex-free intake design criteria, it is not possible to avoid harmful vortices even with higher intake submergences. However this kind of conditions occur very seldom, which may not be so harmful for the structures as they have withstand the conditions only for short time periods. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

We revisit {{the development of}} waves on vortical cores, namely, the linear stability problem. It is widely accepted that the Widnall instability is responsible for development of unstable waves. This is an instability for a straight vortex tube subjected to a straining field in a plane perpendicular to the tube axis (Moore & Saffman [1], Tsai & Widnall [2]). When viewed locally, a thin vortex ring is crudely approximated by a straight tube. For simplicity, we restrict our attention to a circular core of uniform vorticity, that is, the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex.</b> The waves of infinitesimal amplitude on the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex,</b> the Kelvin waves, {{are known to be}} neutrally stable. The vortex ring induces, on itself, not only a local uniform flow but also a local straining field akin to pure shear [3]. A pure shear with the principal axes perpendicular to the vorticity de-forms the core into an ellipse.

40|$|International audienceThe {{stability}} of axisymmetric vortices to inertial perturbations is investigated {{by means of}} linear stability analysis, taking into account stratification, vertical eddy viscosity, as well as finite depth of the flow. We consider different types of circular barotropic vortices in a linearly stratified shallow layer confined with rigid lids. For the simplest case of the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex</b> we develop an asymptotic analytic dispersion relation and a marginal stability criterion, which compares well with numerical results. This is a further generalization to the well-known generalized Rayleigh criterion, which is only valid for non-dissipative and non-stratified eddies. Unlike the Rayleigh criterion, it predicts that intense anticyclones may be stable even with a core region of negative absolute vorticity, and that the dissipation and stratification work together to stabilize the flow. Numerical analysis reveals that the stability diagrams for various types of vortices are almost identical in the Rossby, Burger and Ekman parameter space. This allows extension of our analytical solutions for the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex</b> {{to a wide variety}} of vortices. Furthermore, we show that a more suitable parameter for the intensity of the vortex is the vortex Rossby number, while for the inviscid case it is the local normalized vorticity.

In the past decade, data center design has shifted giving more weight to operational energy use and sustainability. This thesis outlines two work streams aimed at allowing data center designers and operators to design more efficient, cost effective, sustainable data centers. The first track deals with evaluating data center sustainability quickly and easily. The metric chosen to quantify data center sustainability is life-cycle exergy consumption. Other sustainability indicators are investigated, and reasons for choosing this metric for data centers are provided. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the sustainability ramifications of different design and operation decisions. A Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA), perhaps the most widely accepted industry practice of assessing the environmental ramifications of a product or process, is also completed for comparison purposes. A MATLAB based graphical user interface (GUI) developed to perform a life-cycle exergy consumption analysis (LCEA) on data centers was designed and its usefulness is demonstrated. The second track of this thesis deals with expeditious velocity and temperature field prediction in data centers, developed to be an ultrafast alternative to conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. This expeditious predictive scheme {{is based on a}} potential flow velocity prediction method with a <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex</b> superposition correction scheme to correct for physical processes neglected by the relatively simpler but much more computationally efficient potential flow equations. Energy considerations are accomplished through convective energy transport equations. It is shown that without the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex</b> superposition correction, potential flow is inadequate for accurately predicting velocity and temperature fields in data centers. It is also shown that with the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex</b> superposition, in areas of interest within data centers, temperature predictions are as accurate or are more accurate than a commercially available, conventional CFD software package that uses the full Navier-Stokes and energy equations to solve for velocity and temperature fields.

A general steady spiral solution of incompressible inviscid axisymmetric flow was obtained analytically by applying separation of variables to the 3 D Euler equations. The solution, depending on 3 parameters, describes the spiral path of the fluid material element on the Bernoulli surface, whereas some new exact solutions were obtained to be bounded within the whole region. The first one is a continued typhoon-like vortex solution, where there are two intrinsic length scales. One is the radius of maximum circular velocity r_m, the other is the radius of the vortex kernel r_k=√(2) r_m. The second one is a multi-planar solution, periodically in z-coordinate. Within each layer, the solution is a umbrella vortex similar to the first one. The third one is also a multi-planar solution in z-coordinate. In each layer, it is a combination of two independent solutions like the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex,</b> which is also finite but discontinued for either vertical or horizontal velocity. The fourth one is a multi-paraboloid vortex solution finite for z-coordinate but infinite for r-coordinate.

This distinguishes the current model from the conventional Eddy Viscosity Models (EVMs) that are known to fail to predict the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex</b> in swirling flows. Although computationally more expensive approaches, the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), have demonstrated a high capability of dealing with such flows, these techniques are often unsuited for use in complex design studies where computational speed and robustness are key factors. In the present approach, the Shear Stress Transport with Curvature Correction (SSTCC) turbulence model is modified by the introduction of the Richardson number to account for the rotation and curvature effects. The numerical predictions were validated using experimental results and also compared to the data obtained using the RSM model and various EVMs without the proposed modifications. The investigations started with a benchmark case of a flow through a channel duct with a U-turn, after which more challenging simulations of a high swirling flow within a cyclone separator device were performed. The results show that the proposed model is competitive in terms of accuracy when compared to RSM and proves to be superior to the RSM model in terms of computational cost. Furthermore, it is found that the proposed model preserves the ability to represent the <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex</b> profile at different longitudinal levels of the cyclone. It is also more efficient in terms of the computational cost than the SSTCC model without the introduced modifications...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} scheme using Navier-Stokes computations {{was applied}} to simulate bubble dynamics in a vortex flow. A moving grid generation scheme and a Chimera grid scheme were integrated with the Navier-Stokes solver to automatically generate the appropriate grids based on the moving bubble surface. A general free surface boundary condition was implemented to describe the bubble surface motion. The numerical scheme was validated by comparing results with those obtained from the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and from the potential flow solver, 3 DynaFS, for bubble dynamics in an infinite volume of quiescent water with/without the gravity effect. Important numerical factors that influenced the accuracy of solution are reported. Finally, the computations were conducted for bubbles released within a <b>Rankine</b> <b>vortex.</b> Different bubble behaviors were observed for different cavitation numbers...|$|E
