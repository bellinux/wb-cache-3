2500|$|A {{traditional}} {{drink of}} Argentina is an infusion called mate (in Spanish, mate, with the accent {{on the first}} syllable [...] ). The name comes from the hollow gourd from which it is traditionally drunk. The mate (gourd) or other small cup is filled about three-quarters full with yerba mate, the dried leaves and twigs of the Ilex paraguariensis. The drink, which is rather bitter, is sipped through a metal or cane straw called a bombilla. Mate can be sweetened with sugar, or flavored with aromatic herbs or dried orange peel. Hot but not boiling water is poured into the gourd, drunk, then the mate is refilled. The mate is nearly full of leaves, so each refill only makes a small drink, but many refills are possible before the yerba is spent. In small gatherings it is traditional for one mate to be passed from person to person, filled by whoever has the kettle. It is customary not to thank the <b>refiller</b> routinely; a final gracias (thank you) implies that the drinker has had enough. Drinking mate together is an important social ritual. Mate cocido is the same leaf, which rather than brewed is boiled and served, like tea, with milk and sugar to taste.|$|E

5000|$|The plaintiff, a {{manufacturer}} of photocopiers and laser printers, incorporated the parts which might need replacing during the lifetime of a machine and a supply of toner in a disposable cartridge, which could be inserted in the machine by its owner when the toner had to be renewed. The plaintiff was therefore entitled, under LB (Plastics) Ltd. v. Swish Products Ltd., to artistic copyright in the drawings from which of the parts for the cartridge had been made, and {{by the same token}} the plaintiff had the exclusive right to reproduce the drawings in any material form, such as replacement toner cartridges. The aftermarket in cartridges contributed significantly to the plaintiff’s profits, and the initial cost of one of its machines was much lower than the aggregate cost of cartridges used during the life of the machine. In Hong Kong <b>refillers</b> of used cartridges had 40% of the cartridge market. The defendant manufactured new cartridges in Hong Kong for sale there and for export in competition with the plaintiff’s cartridges.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{experiences}} {{show that}} it is possible for agents such as robots cooperating asynchronously on a sequential task to enter situations where one robot does not fulfill its obligations in a timely manner due to hardware or planning failure, unanticipated delays, etc., leaving the other robot in an infinite wait state. Our approach is derived from a formal multilevel process theory of emotions where emotions both modify active behaviors at the sensorymotor level and change the set of active behaviors at the schematic level. The resulting implementation of a team of heterogeneous robots using a hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture produced the desired emergent cooperative behavior. Data collected at two different public venues illus- trate how a dependent agent selects new behaviors (e. g., stop serving, move to intercept the <b>refiller)</b> to compensate for delays from a subordinate agent (e. g., blocked by the audience). The subordinate also modifies the intensity of its active behaviors in response to feedback from the dependent agent. The agents communicate asynchronously through KQML via wireless Ethernet...|$|E
