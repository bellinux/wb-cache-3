5000|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} exploring the details of the bond between carboxypeptidase A and substrate and how this affects the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> In 1934, it was first discovered through kinetic experiments that, in order for substrate to bind, the peptide that is to be hydrolyzed must be adjacent to a terminal free hydroxyl group. Also, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> can be enhanced if the C-terminal residue is branched aliphatic or aromatic. However, if the substrate is a dipeptide with a free amino group, it undergoes hydrolysis slowly; this, however, can be avoided if the amino group is blocked by N-acylation ...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a-chymotrypsin {{has been studied}} in the simultaneous presence of two different substrates, each present in the reaction mixture at its saturation level. Mixtures of two esters were hydrolyzed at rates intermediate between the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>of</b> each ester when present alone, suggesting, in this case, competitive hydrolysis. In contrast, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> in mixtures <b>of</b> casein with gelatin or of either protein with an ester were equal to the sum <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>of</b> the separate substrates, indicating in these cases independent <b>hydrolysis.</b> The activity <b>of</b> the a-chymotrypsin preparation used could not be attributed to contamination with other enzymes. Studies {{of the effect of}} soy bean inhibitor on chymotrypsin indicate that the mechanism of inhibition with protein substrates differs from that when esters are used, providing further evidence that a-chymotrypsin reacts differently with esters and proteins. These results indicate that if chymotrypsin forms specific complexes with its substrates, it must possess at least three distinct active sites. However there is independent chemical evidence that the proteolytic and esterolytic activities of this enzyme reside in the same active center. If this is true, the experimental observations reported here cannot be explained unless it is supposed that this enzyme does not form specific Michaelis complexes with its substrates...|$|R

50|$|Further {{work has}} shown that the effect of 1,3-dioxanes and 1,3-dioxolanes on disarming sugars can be {{attributed}} to the electronics of the systems as well as torsional strain. When a 1,3-dioxane is formed between O-4 and O-6, the oxygens adapt an anti-periplanar geometry with O-5. This orientation allows for hyperconjugation of O-5 to O-4 and O-6, removing electron density from O-5. The loss of electron density at O-5 results in a destabilization of the oxocarbenium ion, slowing its formation, and “disarming” the sugar. Experiments were conducted by altering the configuration of the O-6 and examining the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of these compounds. The gauche-gauche orientation seen in the second example has a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> due to its longer bond length. The hydrogen at C-5 is able to hyperconjugate with O-6, effectively lengthening the bond. This increase in bond length decreases the inductive electron withdrawing ability of O-6, causing a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> than the other two conformations. The effect of anti-periplanar orientation is also visible in comparing glucopyranose and galactopyranose hydrolysis. Glucopyranose has an anti-perplanar orientation between O-4 and O-5, while galactopyranose does not and shows the appropriate increase in reactivity.|$|E
