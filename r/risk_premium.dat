5|$|The unbiasedness {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} given conditions of rational expectations and risk neutrality, the {{forward exchange rate}} is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Without introducing a foreign exchange <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> (due to the assumption of risk neutrality), the following equation illustrates the unbiasedness hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate and the future spot rate.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of foreign exchange <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> that can explain the forward bias puzzle, defined as the tendency of high-interest rate currencies to appreciate rather than depreciate. These <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> arise endogenously from imposing the no-arbitrage condition on {{the relation between the}} term structure of interest rates and exchange rates, and they compensate for both currency risk and interest rate risk. In the empirical analysis, we estimate <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> using an affine multi-currency term structure model and find that model-implied <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> yield unbiased predictions for exchange rate excess returns. While interest rate risk affects the level of <b>risk</b> <b>premiums,</b> the time variation in excess returns is almost entirely driven by currency <b>risk.</b> Furthermore, <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> are closely related to global risk aversion, countercyclical to the state of the economy, and tightly linked to traditional exchange rate fundamentals. ...|$|R

40|$|How {{should we}} adapt {{monetary}} economics and {{the analysis of}} monetary policy to account for <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> in the term structure of interest rates? I show how <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> in the term structure are of first-order importance in analyzing monetary policy via the term structure of interest rates. The switch from a negatively sloping prewar yield curve to a positive slope now reflects the anchoring of the price level under the gold standard. Alas, I see {{no evidence that the}} current yield curve has returned to this characteristic inversion, or any other evidence for a regime-shift to “anchored expectations. ” Taking <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> into account, expected future interest rates track current rates, not relatively-stable forward rates as we enter a recession. This adds support for Atkeson and Kehoe’s hypothesis that monetary policy reacts to and does not cause <b>risk</b> <b>premiums.</b> Bond <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> are earned in compensation for level, not slope <b>risk,</b> and <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> do not forecast activity, both providing suggestive evidence for Atkeson and Kehoe’s hypothesis...|$|R

25|$|Another {{explanation}} is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends {{on the notion that}} the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect {{is referred to as the}} liquidity spread. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even if interest rates are anticipated to decline, the increase in the <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.|$|E
25|$|Risks of investment: There {{is always}} a risk that the {{borrower}} will go bankrupt, abscond, die, or otherwise default on the loan. This means that a lender generally charges a <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> to ensure that, across his investments, he is compensated for those that fail.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} methods {{of determining the}} appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the risk-free rate, which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment {{in excess of the}} risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.|$|E
40|$|Forward {{exchange}} rates convey {{information about the}} <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> of the currency exposures of the investors. The extraction of these <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> provides market information for the expected future values of a currency, which may be useful for policymakers in their market surveillance and monitoring. This study utilises a state-space model and the Kalman-filtering technique to estimate <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> of Hong Kong dollar from the forward exchange market from 1996 to 2005. The estimated <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> of the 12 -month forward contract were as high as 3. 4 % of the spot exchange rate during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. The study also finds that the <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> have reverted from a discount in late 2004 to close to zero in mid- 2005, reflecting that the appreciation pressure on the Hong Kong dollar along with the speculation on the revaluation of the renminbi in early 2005 has subsided after {{the introduction of the}} three refinements to the operation of the Linked Exchange Rate system in May 2005 and the reform of the renminbi exchange rate regime in July 2005. The forward {{exchange rates}}, after taking the estimated <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> into account, do not have a good forecasting capability for the future spot exchange rates. Between the two financial factors that drive the <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> in the Hong Kong dollar forward rates, the renminbi non-deliverable forward rates appear to have a larger impact than the Aggregate Balance of the banking system. Nonetheless, both factors are important for monitoring the <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. ...|$|R

The results show that the response of stock market <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> becomes positive immediately following the shocks to business confidence and consumer confidence. Based on the variance decomposition analysis, the variability of stock market <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> is 95 % due to its own shock and the rest is due to the shocks to business confidence (1 %) and consumer confidence (4 %) for the 3 -month horizon. For the 6 -month horizon, the variability of stock market <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> is 93 % due to its own shock, 2 % due to business confidence shock and 5 % due to consumer confidence shock. The forecast error of stock market <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> is 90 % due to its own shock and the rest is due to the shocks to business confidence (4 %) and consumer confidence (6 %) for the 12 -month horizon.

40|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence that stock prices have a time-varying predictable component. This paper tests for time-varying systematic risk, market compensation for systematic <b>risk,</b> and <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> in the single-factor market model to determine (1) whether the predictable stock-price component {{is due to}} time-varying <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> in an efficient market or an inefficient market with constant <b>risk</b> <b>premiums,</b> and (2) whether the time-varying <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> are due to time-varying systematic risk or time-varying market compensation for systematic risk.

It finds consistent evidence of time variation in all three risk components over the full 35 -year sample, but largely sporadic evidence of time variation over the five seven-year subsamples. Of the portfolios that show evidence of time-varying <b>risk</b> <b>premiums,</b> they are most likely the result of time-varying market compensation for systematic risk and not time-varying systematic risk. ...|$|R
25|$|In finance, {{standard}} deviation {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk {{is an important factor in}} determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as mean-variance optimization). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the <b>risk</b> <b>premium.</b> In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>premium.</b> IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E

In the Nordic energy market Electricity Price Area Differentials (EPADs) were introduced {{at the end of}} year 2000 in order to manage this risk. This thesis investigates the pricing of the monthly EPAD contracts by applying the methods of Marckhoff and Wimschulte (2009) to a new time period, 2008 - 2015.

My findings regarding the ex-post <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> coincides with those of Marckhoff and Wimschulte (2009), who said that ex-post <b>risk</b> <b>premiums</b> varies because areas are subject to transmission congestion to varying degrees.

The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a [...] "build-up" [...] method {{because it is the}} sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. Investors who buy large-cap equity stocks, which are inherently more risky than long-term government bonds, require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity <b>risk</b> <b>premium.</b> In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite.
