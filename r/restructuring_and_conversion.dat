This was initially developed at IMAIAA - the Institute for Agricultural Markets and Agro Food Industries - in performing tasks related to the program PAMAF. There followed a brief passage by a private consulting firm with work related to the preparation of applications for obtaining support from the European Union (EU). Finally, my integration into IFADAP - Institute of Finance and Development Support of Agriculture and Fisheries - that with the recast of the Ministry of Agriculture has been integrated with INGA - the National Guarantee Fund, passing its name to IFAP - Institute of Finance for Agriculture and Fisheries, in which I exercised functions of analysis of applications submitted under the Operational Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) and tasks developed to operationalize the Scheme of <b>Restructuring</b> <b>and</b> <b>Conversion</b> of Vineyard (VITIS and RARRV). Parallel to the description of the tasks at the professional level that I have developed will also be presented some issues which are deemed important to mention about the programs in which I was involved, in particular AGRO program, and the support scheme for <b>Restructuring</b> <b>and</b> <b>Conversion</b> of Vineyards, from 2007 to the present. Throughout the entire professional career were being applied the knowledge gained within the degree in Agricultural Economy and Rural Sociology (ISA-UTL), having been developed skills and professional experience in the area of Agrarian Economy and Land Management, from the application of rules and requirements defined in different support programs, as well as by national and Community legislation analysis for the operationalization of these programs...|$|E
40|$|National {{defense is}} the arsenal’s problem ” claimed banners in 1996 - 97 demonstrations by French {{armament}} workers. And so {{it certainly was}} for centuries. However, their ongoing restructuring experiences the greatest difficulties within the defense industry. This paper investigates the specific nature of the arsenal’s organization, {{and its impact on}} existing <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> <b>conversion</b> plans. We argue that, {{because of the lack of}} capital, an arsenal cannot be considered as a regular firm. Any public policy in that field must therefore first decide between an institutional status quo (and fully accept the associated constraints) or a radical transformation aimed at capitalizing the existing assets and activities in an independent firm. We show that compromise solutions inevitably weaken the former arsenal’s coherence, without securing its long-term economic viability. 1. Introduction an...|$|E

40|$|On September 5 th 2003 the European Commission {{announced}} {{the adoption of}} two decisions covering aid to <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> <b>conversion</b> of vineyards, totalling € 443 million. The aim is to support the improvement {{in the quality of}} EU vineyards and to support the conversion of certain vineyards to other uses. This maintains the size of the programme for 2002 / 2003, which was 15 % larger than the 2000 / 2001 programme. Each programme is implemented in line with national plans. Comment: This type of EU support aims to assist the EU industry to restructure in response to changing market demands, thereby maintaining the EU's competitiveness vis-à-vis new third-country suppliers. The EU sees such aid as non-trade-distorting, but since it covers costs of modernisation which wine producers in developing countries have to cover themselves, it inevitably impacts favourably on the competitiveness of EU wine production.

40|$|Currently, RELAP 5 is {{undergoing}} a transformation that will replace much of its coding with equivalent structured Fortran 90 coding. Four efforts are underway to modernize the code architecture of RELAP 5 - 3 D. These are parallelization, vectorization, code <b>restructuring,</b> <b>and</b> <b>conversion</b> to Fortran 90. The first two improve code run speed via on computer platforms of certain architectures. These code modifications have little effect on normal code performance on non-vector and non-parallel computers because they are mostly done with compiler directives. The third and fourth efforts involve considerable rewriting of the source code. The third code improvement effort addresses code readability and maintainability. These are being greatly enhanced by application of a Fortran code-restructuring tool. The fourth effort is conversion to Fortran 90. The bulk of the coding is being rewritten in Fortran 90. This is a ground up reworking of the coding that begins with completely reorganizing the underlying database and continues with the source code. It will reach every part of RELAP 5 - 3 D. Each of these efforts is discussed in detail in a different section. Section 1 relates background information. Section 2 covers the parallelization effort. Section 3 covers the efforts to vectorize the code. Section 4 covers the code restructuring. Section 5 covers the Fortran 90 effort.

40|$|Since the 1970 s and 1980 s, the {{vineyard}} {{areas in the}} Mediterranean region of north east Spain have undergone profound transformation to allow greater mechanization. This has involved land levelling, deep ploughing {{and the elimination of}} traditional soil conservation measures. Recently the EU Common Agricultural Policy encourages this through {{the vineyard}} <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> <b>conversion</b> plans (Commission Regulation EC No 1227 ⁄ 2000 of 31 May 2000) by subsidizing up to 50 % of the cost of soil preparation such as soil movement and land levelling. A clear example of the problems that this causes is in the Penede`s vineyard region (Catalonia, north east Spain), and the present research analyses the changes in soil properties caused by erosion, deep ploughing and land levelling. The study was carried out in an area of 30 000 ha for which a Soil Information System at a scale of 1 : 50 000 was developed based on 394 field observations (89 soil profiles and 251 auger hole samples down to 120 cm). The results show that 74 % of the described soil profiles are disturbed with evidence of soil mixing and ⁄ or profile truncation due to erosion, deep ploughing and ⁄ or land levelling. The evidence from the topsoils is mainly the presence of fragments of calcic or petrocalcic horizons, marls and sandstones. Other important properties for crops such as organic matter (OM) content and soil depth show statistically significant differences between disturbed soils and undisturbed soils (22. 3 - 33. 3 % OM content depletion and 35. 1 % soil depth reduction). These results confirm that the soils of the region are significantly altered by mechanical operations which also influence soil erosion and contribute to global warming effect through depletion of soil OM...|$|E
