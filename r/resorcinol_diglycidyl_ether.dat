40|$|Structural {{differences}} in cross-linked epoxy networks {{from the use}} of different isomers (ortho-, meta- and para-) of disubstituted aromatic <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ethers</b> can have a dramatic effect on the polymer properties. By changing the disubstitution from meta- to para- {{it has been shown that}} there is a direct correlation between the diffusion of gasses and the symmetry of related polymers. The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of the chemical structure of aromatic <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ethers</b> on the ability of the resulting amine-cured epoxy polymer networks to adsorb organic solvents. Pure <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ethers</b> based on hydroquinone and catechol, have been synthesised in high purity and good yields using a process previously developed at Durham University which utilise elemental fluorine to produce hypofluorous acid. The <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ether</b> of <b>resorcinol</b> is commercially available and readily purified via vacuum distillation. Using the pure epoxides model networks have been produced by reacting the <b>diglycidyl</b> <b>ethers</b> with the diamine 4, 4 ’-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) to produce highly cross-linked films. Analytical techniques including DSC, DMTA, TGA, FTIR, solid state NMR, thermodynamic testing, PALs and density measurements have been used to investigate the influence of polymer structure on the network properties. With these materials we are determining the effect of the different epoxide isomers on the chemical resistance of the polymers.
