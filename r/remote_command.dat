25|$|Another fully {{autonomous}} tractor technology involves {{using the}} native electrical (or CAN bus) {{system of the}} tractor or farm equipment to send commands. Using GPS positioning and radio feedback, automation software manages the vehicle's path and controls farming implements. A retrofit radio receiver and on-board computer are generally used to receive commands from the <b>remote</b> <b>command</b> station and translate it into vehicle commands such as steering, acceleration, braking, transmission, and implement control. Sensor technologies such as lidar improve safety by detecting and reacting to unforeseen obstacles.|$|E
