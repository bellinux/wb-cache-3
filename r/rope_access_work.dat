50|$|<b>Rope</b> <b>access</b> {{is a form}} of work positioning, {{initially}} {{developed from}} techniques used in climbing and caving, which applies practical ropework to allow workers to access difficult-to-reach locations without the use of scaffolding, cradles or an aerial <b>work</b> platform. <b>Rope</b> <b>access</b> technicians descend, ascend, and traverse <b>ropes</b> for <b>access</b> and <b>work</b> while suspended by their harness. Sometimes a work seat may be used. The support of the rope is intended to eliminate the likelihood of a fall altogether, but a back-up fall arrest system is used in case of the unlikely failure of the primary means of support. This redundancy system is usually achieved by using two ropes - a working line and a safety line.|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} this ragtag group were {{required}} to join the South African Police shooting club in order to acquire R1 battle rifles. Camouflage uniforms were also unofficially acquired. Because this group, who had taken on the name of 'Bliksems', was an unofficial group within the Police Force, the normal training facilities were not accessible. A vacant area near the Baviaanspoort Correctional Services {{that could be used}} for live-fire handgun and rifle training, and which also had an urban environment with rural terrain, was eventually found by Col. van der Merwe. Capt. J.J. de Swardt then proceeded to hire instructors from Hunter Group of the South African Defence Force (SADF) such as martial arts specialist, Joe Grant Grierson. Training was based around weapons handling, rural patrol formations and tactics, ambushes and skirmishes and was based on military protocol. Rock climbing, <b>rope</b> <b>access,</b> rescue <b>work,</b> skydiving and parachute training also occurred later on. Other instructors of the team were Bill du Toit (an ex-special forces soldier) who specialised in terror tactics, Mr K. Lucy who was an expert in rope work and abseiling, Mr T. Segala who had an extensive knowledge of booby traps and Improvised explosive devices, Gary Magnusson and Hannes Smit who were experienced civilian skydivers and Major Jakkals de Jager who was a paratrooper in the SADF.|$|R

5000|$|Mountain rescue {{refers to}} {{search and rescue}} {{activities}} that occur in a mountainous environment, although the term is sometimes also used to apply to search and rescue in other wilderness environments. This tends to include mountains with technical <b>rope</b> <b>access</b> issues, snow, avalanches, ice, crevasses, glaciers, alpine environments and high altitudes. The difficult and remote nature of the terrain in which mountain rescue often occurs {{has resulted in the}} development of a number of specific pieces of equipment and techniques.

40|$|The need {{to draw up}} {{detailed}} {{preliminary studies}} of a building before beginning the restoration project is often hindered {{by the fact that}} it is impossible to have first-hand knowledge of the problem due to a lack of funds to built scaffolding for the duration of the works. Preliminary studies drawn up with the aid of information provided by <b>rope</b> <b>access</b> professionals is a magnificent technical solution at a reasonable price before starting the actual restoration works.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades the {{buildings}} with crystal façades have been increasing {{and therefore the}} need to clean them. In addition there are more towers or more places {{that need to be}} <b>accessed</b> by <b>ropes</b> such as eolic parks that have to be inspected. To deal with all this demands traditional <b>rope</b> <b>access</b> is used. By means of ropes and ascenders the workers can climb or descend and perform the desired <b>work.</b> <b>Rope</b> <b>access</b> has some inconvenients. It requires strong users and for some applications where speed is critical it becomes a slow method. In order to increase the age span of the workers and to increase the speed of work the motorized solutions were invented. Among the different motorized solutions, the power ascenders offer a compact lightweight solution that is not dependent to the building and is not subject to a specific space on the ground to place an aerial work platform. On a power ascender powered by a battery, the power flows through the motor controller to the motor that will produce the torque needed to go up or will regenerate current when going down. Apart from that, there are electronic systems that handle the state machine and there is a friendly user interface that even if the user has not read the manual he/she will be able to operate the machine. Also included on the project there are some tests that have been considered relevant when validating the systems. Finally a brief economic study of the prototyping of the product has been included as well as an environmental impact...|$|R
