5000|$|A highly {{successful}} experiment was made yesterday by the Mutual Store Company, {{under the direction}} of Messrs. Stevens and Kelt, with one of the recently constructed refrigerating railway cars. The company has lately undertaken to supply several of the lines of mail steamers with fresh meat and poultry, and in order to deliver the articles in the best possible condition has arranged with the Railway Commissioners for the use of refrigerating cars, from which the meat can be readily passed into the steamers' refrigerating chambers. Accordingly, yesterday morning, at the Spencer street station, 6 tons (...) of beef, mutton, pork, lamb, veal, poultry, and game were loaded into one of the large trucks, which has a carrying capacity of 20 tons (...) [...] This consignment was intended for provisioning the P. and O. mail steamer Valetta, now lying at Williamstown, preparing for the homeward voyage. The meat had previously been kept in a temperature of 34 deg (...) , freezing point not being desirable for ships' stores, although necessary for cargo. The cooling of the car had been commenced on the previous day, when, in one hour, it was reduced by 14 deg (...) , and in another five hours, by 4.30 p m , the temperature was lessened to 45 deg (...) [...] At 8 o'clock yesterday morning, the thermometer showed 40 deg (...) [...] This was the temperature of not only the inside air, but of the walls of the car. A ton and a quarter (...) of ice was used, and it will probably last a week. Mr. R. H. Francis, traffic manager, paid several visits while the loading was in progress, and afforded every facility. The car was attached to the 10.40 a.m. goods train, and ranged up alongside the Valetta at the Williamstown railway pier by 11 o'clock, when transfer of the contents into the ships <b>refrigerating</b> <b>room</b> was commenced. Mr. Stevens, who has had a long and varied experience of the chilled meat trade, made a careful examination when the car was opened, and found everything satisfactory, the low temperature having been retained, and even during the operation of removal, with the double doors of the truck wide open, there was a fall of only 6 deg (...)

40|$|Examination {{was made}} of the {{survival}} period of Toxoplasma gondii in the low temperature rooms of a slaughterhouse. Materials for the examination were the mouse bodies themselves and the organs, such as the liver and brain, of mice infected with the RH or Beverley strain. These materials were stored in both of the refrigerating and the cold-storage rooms, then taken out of the rooms one after another at a short interval and examined on the existence of live Toxoplasma in them with the intraperitoneal inoculation into healthy mice. In the first experiment, it was revealed that the survival of the proliferative form of Toxoplasma in an infected mouse body was 8 days in the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>room</b> and 4 days in the cold-storage room, but a putrefactive sign was manifesting slowly in the mice stored more than 13 days in the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>room</b> and 6 days in the other. In the following experiment, the livers excised from RH-infected mice and the brains from Beverley-infected ones were stored only in the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>room.</b> It was recognized as the result that cysts were capable of survival for as long as 67 days and proliferative forms could survive for 11 days in the room. A control experiment was attempted on the resistance of T. gondii to - 14 ℃ in a freezer and it was shown that both forms of this protozoa in the infected mouse organs could remain alive more than an hour but did not for 3 hours in a freezer of - 14 ℃. Temperatures in both rooms were continuously measured by auto-recording thermometers. In the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>room,</b> it was 0. 47 ℃ in average and the cold-storage room always had 3 to 4 ℃ higher temperature than the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>room.</b> Toxoplasma gondiiの低温に対する抵抗性についての報告は少なくない。しかし、これらの研究では、実験室内の冷蔵庫またはフリーザーなどの精確に調節された温度条件下に実施されたものである。屠畜肉やその内臓中に潜在する本原虫が、もっとも重要な感染源と見なされている現在では、屠場の低温室中で畜肉中の本原虫が、どれ程の期間生存しつづけるかが疫学上重要な意味を持つことはいうまでもない。事実、屠場の冷却室あるいは冷蔵室の温度は、頻回の扉の開閉や大量の温かい大動物肉塊の搬入などのため、相当な変動を受けることが予測され、実験室の冷蔵庫内温度条件とはかなり異なるものであると考えられた。　本研究は、以上の趣旨に沿って長崎市営屠場内の低温室を利用し、T. gondiiの増殖型および？子の生存期間を検討した。被検材料は、大動物肉塊や内臓を用いることができなかったので、RHおよびBeverley株感染マウスおよびその臓器を使用した。　第 1 実験では、PH株感染マウス自体を冷却室および冷蔵室に保存した。以後、毎日または隔日に保存マウス体を取り出し、その肝および脾乳剤を健常マウス腹膣内接種し、そのマウスからの原虫検出を試みた。接種ご 30 日以内に死亡したマウスは即時に、それ以上生存したものは屠殺して、その腹膣液および脳中の原虫の有無を顕微鏡下に検討した。その成績では、マウス体内のRH株増殖型は冷却室中で 8 日間、冷蔵室中で 4 日間生存することを認めた。しかし、保存マウスの腹膣内臓器の腐敗が冷却室では 13 日め以降から、また冷蔵室では 6 日めから認められたことから、その成績にはマウスの腐敗が影響を及ぼしていることが想像された。実験中の室温は、冷却室では平均 0. 9 ℃、最高 2. 5 ℃、最低- 1. 1 ℃、冷蔵室では平均 4. 2 ℃、最高低巾は 5. 1 ～ 3. 2 ℃であった。　第 2 実験では、RH株感染マウス肝とBeverley株感染マウス脳を冷却室中に保存し、一定期間毎に取り出し、乳剤として健常マウスに接種した。本実験によりマウス肝中のRH株増殖型は 11 日間、マウスの脳中のBeverley株囊子は実に 67 日間冷却室で生存することが判明した。実験期間中の冷却室温度は平均 0. 47 ℃、最高低巾は 3. 2 ～- 3. 5 ℃におよんだ。対照実験として、- 14 ℃のフリーザーの中で第 2 実験と同一材料を用いて検査したが、その結果、囊子、増殖型とも、 1 時間保存材料中に生存することを認めたが、 3 時間材料からは証明できなかった。　以上の実験で、屠場冷却室中で囊子は 67 日間、増殖型は 11 日間生存し、かつ、感染力を保有していることが判明したが、大動物肉塊や臓器中では、より長時間生存することが想定された...|$|E

The study {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the loss that the fruit suffer during the storage period in both traditional and refrigerating storage, at the Fruit Research Station Cluj-Napoca, Romania. There were gathered biochemical data for four winter maturation apple varieties: Jonathan, Golden Delicious, Starkrimson and Wagener Premiat, during the months of October (at storage), December and March. The determined biochemical aspects were water, total sugar, and ascorbic acid. The refrigerating storage was better in comparison with the traditional storage, confirmed by biochemical composition. The lowest dehydration was for the apples stored in the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>room.</b> By storage method and apples varieties comparison, the lowest water loss was shown by Wagener Premiat varieties and the highest by Jonathan in refrigerating storage in comparison with traditional storage.

40|$|Not a few unknown {{problems}} are still left undissolved about the biological characters, life cycle and infection route of Toxoplasma gondii, although numbers of papers {{relating to the}} parasites have been published. It is really important to devote attention to the study on the survival ability of T. gondii under various physico-chemical circumstances {{for the purpose of}} clarifying the infection route of this parasites. Jacobs et al. (1960) reported that the cyst of Beverley strain survived as long as 68 days at 4 ℃ but lost viability by heating to 50 ℃ for 30 minutes or 56 ℃ for 15 minutes. They stated that freezing or desiccation rendered the cysts non-infective. Similar results were reported by Fukazawa et al. (1964). In this experiment, both of RH and Beverley strains of T. gondii were tested on their resistance to osmotic pressure, pH, temperature, desiccation and UV irradiation. Mice used for the inoculation test were of dd weighing 18 to 20 g. RH proliferative forms were collected from the infected mice by aspirating the intraperitoneal exsudates with syringes. The pooled exudate was centrifuged at 100 G for 5 minutes to remove the gross particles and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 1500 G for 15 minutes to precipitate the parasites which were subsequently resuspended in saline. The infected mouse brain emulsions were used as the cyst material. Both materials, the saline suspension of RH proliferative forms and the brain emulsion containing the Beverley cysts, were applied to an examination on the survival of T. gondii under some physico-chemical conditions. The presence of live Toxoplasma in the materials was examined by the intraperitoneal inoculation into healthy mice. When proliferative forms or cysts were detected in the peritoneal exudate or the brain of inoculated mice, it was concluded that the parasites inoculated had been still alive in the materials. Hemagglutination test was performed for inquiring whether the infection with the parasites inoculated was in progress. Results obtained were concluded as follows: 1) The proliferative form could survive only within 1 minutes in distilled water. The cyst could survive for 9 days when it was suspended in distilled water together with mouse brain tissue. While, the cysts which were accumulated from the infected mouse brains were destroyed by incubating in distilled water for 16 hours. 2) Both the proliferative form and the cyst could survive for 15 hours in 6 % NaCl solution but could not for 15 hours in 15 % NaCl solution. 3) At pH 1. 2, the proliferative form lost infectivity within 1 hour but the cyst kept it for 22 hours. 4) Both forms lost their viability by heating to 56 ℃ for 10 minutes. The Beverley cyst survived for 67 days at 2 ℃ in the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>room</b> of a slaughterhouse but the RH proliferative form did for 11 days. Cysts in the mouse brains and proliferative forms in the mouse livers were destroyed by freezing in a deep freezer of - 14 ℃ for 3 hours. 5) Both forms lost their infectivity to mice by desiccation within 48 hours or by irradiation of UV rays for 5 minutes...|$|E

Methods: Original vials of vincristine injection (5 mg/ 5 mL, Teva) were stored under different conditions and subjected to re-piercing at intervals over 28 days. Samples taken at each interval were subjected to a stability-indicating LC assay for vincristine. In separate studies, the stability of vincristine infusions (50 mL) in polyolefin bags (0. 01 and 0. 05 mg/mL) and in polypropylene syringes (0. 5 mg in 20 mL and 2 mg in 20 mL), was determined under <b>refrigerated</b> and <b>room</b> temperature conditions. Results: Vincristine injection (5 mg/ 5 mL) in original vials was chemically stable (> 95 % of initial concentration remaining) when stored at <b>refrigerated</b> or <b>room</b> temperature, with and without light protection, and subjected to six piercings of the vial over 28 days. The very dilute 0. 01 mg/mL vincristine infusions in polyolefin containers exhibited unpredictable chemical stability, although no infusion fell below 90 % of initial concentration remaining over 84 days.

Dry aging is the process where beef carcasses or primal cuts are hanged and aged for 28 to 55 d under controlling environment conditions in a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>room</b> with 0 ° to 4  °C and with relative humidity of 75 to 80  %. However there are various opinions on dry aging procedures and purveyors of such products are passionate about their programs. Recently, {{there has been an}} increased interest in dry aging process by a wider array of purveyors and retailers in the many countries. Dry aging process is very costly because of high aging shrinkage (6 to 15 %), trims loss (3 to 24  %), risk of contamination and the requirement of highest grades meat with. The packaging in highly moisture-permeable bag may positively impact on safety, quality and shelf stability of dry aged beef. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration of the flavor that {{can only be described as}} “dry-aged beef”. But the contribution of flavor compounds of proteolysis and lipolysis to the cooked dry aged beef flavor is not fully known. Also there are limited scientific studies of aging parameters on the quality and palatability of dry aged beef...|$|R
40|$|The quail raising in Brazil has {{increased}} {{through the last}} years and the incubation procedures are important to maintenance and improvement of quail egg production. To obtain {{a sufficient number of}} eggs to fill an incubator, eggs are usually accumulated in storage over a period from 1 day up to 3 weeks before incubation. The objective of this research was to verify the effect of egg storage on hatchability and egg weight loss for two lineages of Japanese quails. Sixty four Japanese quails were divided in two groups: G 1 (n= 32) for meat production and G 2 (n= 32) for egg production. They were used for serial egg collections that were performed every day, during 15 consecutively days, totaling 600 eggs. After collection they were placed in <b>refrigerated</b> <b>room</b> (20 °C and 60 % of relative humidity) and submitted to different periods of storage, from 0 day until 14 days, according to their collection day. The incubation occurred at 37. 6 °C and 60 % RH. The weight measurements were done during storage, incubation and hatching. The results showed that for Meat type and Egg type quails, the egg hatchability was around 84 % until 10 days of storage, and then this rate decreased significantly. Both types of quail eggs presented similar weight loss during storage and incubation. The research showed that quail eggs present great hatchability until 10 days of storage and that eggs submitted to storage present a reduced weight loss during incubation...|$|R

40|$|Modern food production-distribution {{processes}} {{represent a}} critical stressor {{for the environment}} and for natural ecosystems. The rising flows of food across growing and consumption areas couple with the higher expectations of consumers {{for the quality of}} products and compel the intensive use of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>rooms</b> and transport means throughout the food supply chain. In order to aid the design of sustainable cold chains that incorporate such aspects, this paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to minimize the total energy consumption associated with the cold operations experienced by perishable products. This model is intended for food traders, logistics practitioners, retail managers, and importers collaboratively called to design and plan a cost and environmentally effective supply strategy, physical channels, and infrastructures for cold chains. The proposed model is validated with a case study inspired by the distribution of two example food products, namely fresh apples and ice cream, along the New Silk Road connecting Europe and China. The illustrated analysis investigates the effect of alternative routes and transport modes on the sustainability of the cold chain. It is found that the most energy-efficient route for ice cream is via rail over a northern route and, for apples, is via a southern maritime route, and, for these two routes, the ratios of the total energy consumed to the energy content of the food are 760 and 913, respectively. By incorporating the energy lost due to the food quality decay, the model identifies the optimal route to adopt in accordance with the shelf life and the conservation temperature of each product...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{expression}} {{studies can}} be used to help identify disease-associated genes by comparing the levels of expressed transcripts between cases and controls, and to identify functional genetic variants (expression quantitative loci or eQTLs) by comparing expression levels between individuals with different genotypes. While many of these studies are performed in blood or lymphoblastoid cell lines due to tissue accessibility, the relevance of expression differences in tissues that are not the primary site of disease is unclear. Further, many eQTLs are tissue specific. Thus, there is a clear and compelling need to conduct gene expression studies in tissues that are specifically relevant to the disease of interest. One major technical concern about using autopsy-derived tissue is how representative it is of physiologic conditions, given the effect of postmortem interval on tissue degradation. Results In this study, we monitored the gene expression of 13 tissue samples harvested from a rapid autopsy heart (non-failed heart) and 7 from a cardiac explant (failed heart) through 24 hours of autolysis. The 24 hour autopsy simulation was designed to reflect a typical autopsy scenario where a body may begin cooling to ambient temperature for ~ 12 hours, before transportation and storage in a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>room</b> in a morgue. In addition, we also simulated a scenario wherein the body was left at room temperature for up to 24 hours before being found. A small fraction (LUM), natriuretic peptide A (NPPA) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which allows for the clear separation between failing and non-failing heart based on gene expression profiles. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that RNA from autopsy-derived tissue, even up to 24 hours of autolysis, {{can be used}} to identify biologically relevant expression pattern differences, thus serving as a practical source for gene expression experiments. </p...|$|R
