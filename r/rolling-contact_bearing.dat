40|$|The paper {{considers}} a method and {{an instrument for}} measuring amplitudes and  periods of physical pendulum oscillations with <b>rolling-contact</b> <b>bearing</b> in the regime of micro-swings when the oscillation amplitude is significantly less of an elastic contact angle. It has been established that the main factors limiting a measuring accuracy are noises of the measuring circuit, base vibration and analog-digital conversion. A new measuring methodology based on original algorithms of data processing and application of the well-known methods for statistic processing of a measuring signal is  proposed in the paper. The paper contains error estimations for measuring oscillation amplitudes justified by discreteness of a signal conversion in a photoelectric receptor and also by the influence of measuring circuit noise. The paper reveals that the applied methodologies {{make it possible to}} ensure measuring of amplitudes with an error of 0. 2 second of arc and measuring of a period with an error of 10 – 4 s. The original measuring instrument including mechanical and optical devices and also an electric circuit of optical-to-electrical measuring signal conversion is described in the paper.   </p...|$|E
50|$|Foil {{bearings}} {{were first}} {{developed in the}} late 1950s by AiResearch Mfg. Co. of the Garrett Corporation using independent R&D funds to serve military and space applications. They were first tested for commercial use in United Airlines Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 cooling turbines in the early- and mid-1960s. Garrett AiResearch air cycle machine foil bearings were first installed as original equipment in 1969 in the DC-10's environmental control systems. Garrett AiResearch foil bearings were installed on all US military aircraft to replace existing oil-lubricated <b>rolling-contact</b> <b>bearings.</b> The ability to operate at cryogenic gas temperatures {{as well as at}} very high temperatures gave foil bearings many other potential applications.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is {{necessary}} to use quite a big gear ratio (from 150 to 300) to ensure an accurate control of the angular motions of passive optoelectronic rangefinder (POERF). Used zero-backlash gearings together with the features of <b>rolling-contact</b> <b>bearings</b> generate relatively high nonlinearities which make the achievement of demanded control accuracy of POERF complicated or even totally precluded. Experimental (Test) device for the described drives was constructed in OPROX company. The device was set into function by the composite authors of this article and at the moment, relevant measurements are being made. The aim {{is to use the}} testing measurements made on the device in order to design and verify a method and SW for initial and continuous identifications of the parameters of POERF nonlinear model of servo-drive. In this article we will provide basic information on mechanical design of the experimental device construction, control and power parts of servo-drive and on communication protocol including the measurement protocol (output data) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose is}} the {{development}} of methods of individual parts choice based on the construction of a probabilistic mathematical model in the process of completing; the above methods provide in each specific case a well-grounded choice of a rational completing scheme, as well as an estimation of the basic technological parameters of automatic completing machines designed. A theoretical probabilistic model of the process of completing <b>rolling-contact</b> <b>bearings</b> has been suggested, with its possible implementation systems taken into account. Probabilistic laws describing the distribution of the ring sizes have been established; rational conditions of completing the bearings have been refined; the accuracy of predicting the results of completing {{on the basis of the}} use of a mathematical model has been determined. The results obtained make it possible to predict a probable efficiency of the bearing completing process and use a well-grounded rational completing scheme for specific conditionsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of wear and friction properties {{of a number}} of materials sliding against SAE 52100 steel was conducted. These materials included brass, bronze, beryllium copper, monel, nichrome v, 24 s-t aluminum, nodular iron, and gray cast iron. The metals investigated may be useful as possible cage (separator or retainer) materials for <b>rolling-contact</b> <b>bearings</b> of high-speed turbine engines. The ability of materials to form surface films that prevent welding is a most important factor in both dry friction and boundary lubrication. On the basis of wear and resistance to welding only, the cast irons were the most promising materials investigated; they showed the least wear and the least tendency to surface failure when run dry, and when boundary lubricated they showed the highest load capacity. On the basis of mechanical properties, nodular iron is superior to gray cast iron. Bronze had the lowest friction coefficient under dry sliding conditions. The results with brass, beryllium copper, and aluminum were poor and these materials do not appear, with regard to friction and wear, to be suitable for cages...|$|R
