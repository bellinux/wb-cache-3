5000|$|If the {{simulation}} is started at this point, the character will start {{walking across the}} playfield to the right until it reaches the first rock.

The actions in this case would be two steps, the first showing the character moving up and to the right, the next down and to the right. When {{the simulation}} is re-run, the character will walk to the right, and then [...] "jump" [...] over the rocks. In this case the character will now stop moving when it reaches the side of the screen, and a new rule could be added at that point to [...] "wrap around" [...] to the left side again.|$|E

40|$|Real world {{optimisation}} {{problems are}} usually highly constrained and complex {{due to the}} number and variety of constraints. Often these constraints are human preference rules and thus are subject to revisions and updates. The paper analyses requirements on knowledge representation formalisms imposed by a practical constrained optimisation problem and addresses the problem of validation and refinement of constraints {{in the context of}} dynamic knowledge-based scheduling. The CSIRO Division of Information Technology in collaboration with The Preston Group (TPG) has developed a prototype <b>Rule</b> <b>Editor</b> and dynamic Rule Processing system for integration with the TPG Manpower Planning and Scheduling System (MPSS). The <b>Rule</b> <b>Editor</b> allows end-users to specify and validate constraints upon schedules using easy-to-use structured menu functions. All constraints are expressed in terms used by airport staff, and {{there is no need for}} users to learn any formal constraint or programming language. All rules defined using the <b>Rule</b> <b>Editor</b> are automatically entered into a knowledge base for processing by MPSS. MPSS verifies, interprets and processes the rules using the CSIRO prototype Rule Processing System (RPS). The developed knowledge representation formalism is sufficiently general and allows to cover majority of MPSS constraints. It is possible to load the rule base at any time, resulting in a completely dynamic Rule Processing system. The paper details the analysis and design of the proposed knowledge representation formalism, and implementation of the Rule Processing System...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{decision}} support (CDS) implemented {{as part of}} an electronic medical record (EMR) has a well-documented history of improving patient safety and quality of care; however, the difficulties of keeping CDS up to date have also been documented. At Partners HealthCare, we initially implemented CDS reminders in our ‘homegrown’ EMR system as ‘hardcoded’ rules. The challenges of updating existing rules and implementing new rules in the hard-coded state, however, soon made this model unsustainable. After evaluating our needs and requirements for rule creation and maintenance, we designed and created a browser-based <b>rule</b> <b>editor</b> that would decrease turnaround time for logic changes, allowing us to respond to CDS requests more efficiently. We have been able to maintain the older reminder rules with the <b>rule</b> <b>editor,</b> and have added a number of new reminders.

ICT-enabled tools supporting urban planning are considered key to successful and sustainable urban management. Based on previous work in the areas of web-based participation tools for urban planning, rule-based geospatial processing as well as 3 D virtual reality applications we present a tool that supports experts from municipalities in planning and decision making but also provides a way for the public to engage in urban planning processes. The main contribution of this work is in the combination of 3 D visualization and interaction components with a new ontology-driven <b>rule</b> <b>editor</b> based on domain-specific languages. The 3 D visualization, on the one hand, enables stakeholders to present and discuss urban plans. On the other hand, the <b>rule</b> <b>editor</b> particularly targets expert users who need to perform spatial analyses on urban data or want to configure the 3 D scene according to custom rules. Compared to previous approaches we propose a portable and interactive solution. Our tool is web-based and uses HTML 5 technology making it accessible by a broad audience...|$|E

40|$|Caring {{for people}} with {{dementia}} in their home environment is a challenging task for family carers. Through web-based services family carers can be supported in fulfilling this task also helping to avoid feelings of being overburdened. Therefore a RFID-based service called Action Planner was developed {{as part of an}} AAL-assistant system to provide context-aware assistance {{for people with}} dementia and their family carers. The Action Planner allows family carers to describe rules that offer support either for the elderly person who is e. g. reminded to drink or the family carer who receives for example a text message in case a predefined event applies. The service operates context-aware which can be considered as its distinct feature. It is customizable by time- and localization-based rules. F or instance, it is possible to configure the service {{in such a way that}} a text message is sent when constant wandering between bedroom and corridor is detected at night. The Action Planner relies on a custom indoor localization system that uses active RFID technology. The type of action and the time- and localization-based rules that need to be true in order to initiate an action can be specified using a <b>rule</b> <b>editor.</b> A first prototype of the Action Planner was evaluated in a lab test. Based on the results of the technical tests and the user study investigating usability issues of the <b>rule</b> <b>editor,</b> a second prototype is currently under development. The second prototype will enhance the Action Planer by algorithms for pattern recognition to improve reliability of identified movement patterns in the home environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. E-commerce and {{m-commerce}} {{have dramatically}} boosted {{the demand for}} services which enable ubiquitous access. Ubiquity with its anytime/anywhere/anymedia nature requiring context-aware computing calls for new engineering techniques supporting these kind of services. In this paper, we propose the notion of customisation as the uniform mechanism to deliver ubiquitous web applications providing adaptability {{with respect to a}} certain context. As a prerequisite for supporting customisation design, a set of generic models is introduced comprising a context model, a profile model, and a rule model. At the application's side, customisation hooks are provided representing the major hot spots of adaptation. A customisation toolkit in terms of a customisation <b>rule</b> <b>editor</b> and browser supports an integrated modelling process and facilitates reusability {{on the basis of a}} repository of customisation rules and patterns. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Access control {{rules are}} {{currently}} administered by highly qualified personnel. Thus, the technical barrier that specialized access control languages represent naturally prevents the prime decision maker to effectively control such access. The usability {{is even worse}} {{in the case of}} access control applications targeting an average consumer, where customers who are casual users are expected to administer their own rules, e. g. in case of financial services. XACML {{is one of the most}} powerful access control languages because it allows the definition of complex conditions. In order to make XACML usable in such applications, there is a need for fully non-technical <b>rule</b> <b>editors.</b> We propose a notation for XACML rules containing conditions that is a combination of the usual tree properties of logical expressions but with an accessible natural language like format. Our early experience indicates that such rules can be grasped by non-technical users wishing to develop and control rules for accessing their own resources...|$|R
