5|$|After {{making peace}} with his family, Takanohana regained {{some of his}} {{consistency}} in 2000, although he was temporarily sidelined by an elbow injury suffered in the July tournament. His brother had retired in March, and several {{other members of his}} stable were now past their best. With Akebono dominant once more his best <b>results</b> <b>that</b> year were two runner-up performances.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce <b>results</b> <b>that</b> favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up <b>results</b> <b>that</b> companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of several Spec Ops games in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the series met with low sales and poor reviews, causing {{a halt to the}} {{production}} of successive games. In 2003, Take-Two mentioned in their financial <b>results</b> <b>that</b> Rockstar Games was working on the franchise, but in 2004 the project was cancelled. It was later revealed that Rockstar Vancouver would have developed the canned project, with Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme working on the soundtrack for the game.|$|E
30|$|As {{a simple}} {{consequence}} of Proposition  6.1, we obtain a <b>result</b> <b>that</b> {{can be viewed}} as an abstract version of the existence result shown in [12], Proposition  4.1; see [18], Theorem  1, for a similar <b>result</b> <b>that</b> requires stronger assumptions.|$|R

5|$|In {{the case}} of {{molecular}} studies, the preservation of a specimen that can vouch {{for the source of}} the tissue sample used to gather genetic data has been recommended, as genetic analysis often yields surprising <b>results</b> <b>that</b> make reexamination of the original specimen crucial.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} leg Celtic went a goal down through an own goal from Joos Valgaeren on 48 minutes. Larsson {{equalised}} seconds later, but then missed a penalty kick on 75 minutes. Despite {{a couple of good}} chances {{near the end of the}} game, Celtic were unable to score a winning goal. The 1–1 draw, watched by around 60,000 fans, was Martin O'Neill's 50th unbeaten match at Celtic Park, a record of <b>results</b> <b>that</b> stretched back to their last home defeat which was against Ajax in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{also try}} to {{generate}} or modify models {{to take into account}} new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces <b>results</b> <b>that</b> fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.|$|E
25|$|Many other results {{concerning}} {{the convergence of}} Fourier series are known, ranging from the moderately simple <b>result</b> <b>that</b> the series converges at x if f is differentiable at x, to Lennart Carleson's much more sophisticated <b>result</b> <b>that</b> the Fourier series of an L2 function actually converges almost everywhere.|$|R

5|$|Wrexham exited 18-months of {{administration}} {{at the start}} of 2006–07, and started the season with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 4–1 win over Championship club Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup. However, a 5–0 defeat at Accrington Stanley triggered a run of bad <b>results</b> <b>that</b> Smith was unable to turn around. With Wrexham hovering above the relegation zone in 18th place, Smith was dismissed on 11 January 2007. He is one of only 24 people to have managed over 1,000 professional matches in English football.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with <b>results</b> <b>that</b> shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, Segrè began {{studying}} the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the diffraction grating he required to continue {{was not available}} in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected {{to use it to}} study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced <b>results</b> <b>that</b> apparently did not agree with the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the nuclear spin of potassium was +1/2.|$|E
5|$|Sarcosphaera is {{classified}} in the family Pezizaceae of the order Pezizales. Phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences suggests that Sarcosphaera forms a clade with the genera Boudiera and Iodophanus, and that the three taxa are a sister group to Ascobolus and Saccobolus (both in the family Ascobolaceae). Species in the families Pezizaceae and Ascobolaceae are distinct from other Pezizalean taxa in the positive iodine reaction of the ascus wall. In a more recent (2005) phylogenetic analysis combining the data derived from three genes (the large subunit ribosomal rRNA (LSU), RNA polymerase II (RPB2), and beta-tubulin), Sarcosphaera was shown to be {{closely related to the}} truffle genus Hydnotryopsis, corroborating earlier <b>results</b> <b>that</b> used only the LSU rDNA sequences.|$|E
5|$|The WIYN Observatory's 3.5m {{telescope}} {{was used for}} speckle imaging on June 18, 2010; in addition, the PHARO camera on the Palomar Observatory's 5m {{telescope was}} used for its adaptive optics capabilities. These observations, combined with observations of Kepler-10's spectrum taken from the W.M. Keck Observatory, ruled {{out the possibility that}} a nearby star's light was corrupting the observed spectrum of Kepler-10 and creating the <b>results</b> <b>that</b> had led astronomers to believe that a second planet existed in Kepler-10's orbit. All of these possibilities, with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; even with this, the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E
