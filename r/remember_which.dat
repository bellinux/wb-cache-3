25|$|One more {{issue is}} that some complex {{instructions}} are difficult to restart, e.g. following a page fault. In some cases, restarting from the beginning will work (although wasteful), {{but in many cases}} this would give incorrect results. Therefore, the machine needs to have some hidden state to <b>remember</b> <b>which</b> parts went through and what remains to be done. With a load/store machine, the program counter is sufficient to describe the state of the machine.|$|E

500|$|Age of Empires allows {{players to}} choose to play either along specialized, story-backed {{conditions}} or as individual battles against the AI (and other players). Choosing to battle against the AI – rather than following the storyline – allows the AI to adapt to players' strategies and even <b>remember</b> <b>which</b> games it won and lost. The AI eventually overcomes players' strategies and easily destroys their villages after several games. For instance, in Age of Empires III, this {{is referred to as}} playing a [...] "Skirmish." [...] However Age of Empires III allows players to refine their strategies further against the AI by [...] "Building a Deck," [...] which allows players to replace [...] "Home City" [...] shipments with improved alternatives.|$|E
500|$|As for Richard's {{physical}} appearance, {{most contemporary}} descriptions bear out {{the evidence that}} aside from having one shoulder higher than the other (with chronichler Rous not able to correctly <b>remember</b> <b>which</b> one, as slight as the difference was), Richard had no other noticeable bodily deformity. John Stow talked to old men who, remembering him, said [...] "that he was of bodily shape comely enough, only of low stature" [...] and a German traveller, Nicolas von Poppelau, who spent ten days in Richard's household in May 1484, describes him as [...] "three fingers taller than himself...much more lean, with delicate {{arms and legs and}} also a great heart." [...] Six years after Richard's death, in 1491, a schoolmaster named William Burton, on hearing a defence of Richard, launched into a diatribe, accusing the dead King of being 'a hypocrite and a crookback...who was deservedly buried in a ditch like a dog.' ...|$|E

500|$|Carter later {{explained}} that humorous episodes {{were important to}} the show, especially during the [...] "pitch-black" [...] ninth season.

Carter felt that he needed to kill the character [...] "all out of fondness." [...] Before casting Ellen Greene, Carter had first spotted her on the movie, The Little Shop of Horrors both in [...] "New York and Los Angeles." [...] The first scene shot for Greene's character took a [...] "long day". Carter called her a [...] "trouper" [...] and said she was open to the direction he gave her. She had a lot of information to <b>remember,</b> <b>which</b> made the scene even more difficult. The set for that scene was created by Tim Stepeck who was the set decorator during the ninth season. Annabeth Gish later revealed that her lines were difficult to remember. She explained, [...] "I remember learning my lines and thinking, 'Oh my God. I've got to memorize this. It's scary.

2500|$|Studies of the {{mammalian}} brain {{have discovered}} that the excess of cerebral neurons is a phenomenon of mainly animals which had to seek and capture food. [...] These neurons have become {{a large part of}} the olfactory system throughout evolution to allow higher mammals such as primates to have a better chance for survival through more advanced methods of hunting and finding food. For example, the vulture has a large part of its brain committed to olfactory senses. This allows for it to be able to detect food at long ranges without being able to see it. Having memory for various types of food aids in survival by allowing the animals to <b>remember</b> <b>which</b> scent is edible and which is not.|$|E
2500|$|District Attorney Katzmann {{pointed out}} that Vanzetti had lied {{at the time of}} his arrest, when making {{statements}} about the [...]38 revolver found in his possession.

Vanzetti also told police that he had purchased only one box of cartridges for the gun, all of the same make, yet his revolver was loaded with five [...]38 cartridges of varying brands. At the time of his arrest, Vanzetti also claimed that he had bought the gun at a store (but could not <b>remember</b> <b>which</b> one), and that it cost $18 or $19 (three times its actual market value). He lied about where he had obtained the [...]38 cartridges found in the revolver.|$|E

The only partners we found to help us bring our concerns to the Japanese public were people from Soka University under the leadership of Daisaku Ikeda.

2500|$|Ephron first {{conceived}} {{of this story}} in 1999 as an HBO movie.

Ephron, who had been a New York Post reporter, had previously written about her own career in journalism in the novel I Remember Nothing. She once wrote, [...] "I can’t <b>remember</b> <b>which</b> came first—wanting to be a journalist or wanting to date a journalist"; she had a thing for journalists like McAlary. Since McAlary lost his battle with cancer, Ephron had spent her six years battling cancer by directing a film and writing two as well as writing two plays; Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune speculates that Ephron chose this subject because she shared a bond with a journalist who [...] "also did some of his best writing while battling cancer".|$|E
