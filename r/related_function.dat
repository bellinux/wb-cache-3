2500|$|There are {{exceptions}} to the general rule that proteins sharing significant sequence identity will share a fold. For example, a judiciously chosen set of mutations of less than 50% of a protein can cause the protein to adopt a completely different fold. However, such a massive structural rearrangement is unlikely to occur in evolution, especially since the protein is usually under the constraint that it must fold properly and carry out its function in the cell. [...] Consequently, the roughly folded structure of a protein (its [...] "topology") is conserved longer than its amino-acid sequence and much longer than the corresponding DNA sequence; in other words, two proteins may share a similar fold even if their evolutionary relationship is so distant that it cannot be discerned reliably. [...] For comparison, [...] the function of a protein is conserved {{much less than the}} protein sequence, since relatively few changes in amino-acid sequence are required to take on a <b>related</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective – This study {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of the <b>related</b> search <b>functions</b> in Web of Science and Scopus. Web of Science has one <b>related</b> search <b>function</b> (searching by references) whereas Scopus has three <b>related</b> search <b>functions</b> (searching by references, authors, or keywords). Methods – Thirty queries were searched in both Web of Science and Scopus. For each query, the most relevant document was retrieved and its first thirty related documents were assessed for relevancy to the original query. Results for both databases were compared using the median values of precision. For Scopus the three different methods of relevance were compared using median precision values. Results – The median precision value for the related documents retrieved from Web of Science was 0. 63, while the median for those retrieved from Scopus using the <b>related</b> by references <b>function</b> was 0. 62. A Wilcoxon test showed {{no significant difference in the}} two medians. In the comparison of the three <b>related</b> <b>functions</b> in Scopus, the median precision values were 0. 62, 0. 42, and 0. 43 for the <b>related</b> search <b>functions</b> by references, authors, and keywords respectively. A Friedman’s test showed that the median precision value for relatedness by references was significantly higher than the median vales for the other two <b>related</b> <b>functions.</b> In Scopus, {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>related</b> search <b>function</b> using all keywords was not as effective when compared to the effectiveness using select keywords. The median precision value with select keywords was 0. 17. Conclusions – The <b>related</b> search <b>functions</b> by references for both Web of Science and Scopus were moderately effective in retrieving additional relevant documents on a given topic, and there was no significant difference in their performance. When comparing the three methods available in Scopus, the <b>related</b> search <b>function</b> by references was found to be more effective than the system’s <b>related</b> <b>functions</b> by authors and keywords...|$|R
