50|$|On February 27, 2004, in {{the context}} of the {{sponsorship}} scandal that came to light soon after Prime Minister Jean Chrétien left office, Bédard asserted that she had been forced to resign from her marketing department job at Via Rail in 2002 shortly after raising concerns about the company's dealings with advertiser Groupaction. Responses to her allegations led to the firings a few days later of Via <b>Rail</b> <b>chair</b> Jean Pelletier and president Marc LeFrançois.|$|E
50|$|His notable designs {{range from}} {{silverware}} for Georg Jensen to fixtures for the Copenhangen University's Life Sciences department and for Rødovre Library {{as well as}} the Tip-Top and VIP lamp series. His simple but refined furniture, mostly in natural materials and stainless steel, includes a folding stool for Design Forum, a crest <b>rail</b> <b>chair</b> and steel tube chair for Collection Schiang and the EJ20 sofa for Erik Jørgensen. Both his Crestrail chairs, with their semicircular back, and the Skagen Chair, developed with Børge Schiang in the early 1980s are still in production.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} <b>rail</b> <b>chairs,</b> made of {{cast iron}} and introduced around 1800, were used to fix and support cast-iron rails at their ends; they were also used to join adjacent rails.|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{completed}} in December 1858 and load tested with two engines, each hauling six wagons loaded with iron <b>rail</b> <b>chairs,</b> on 7 January 1859, six days before the official line opening.|$|R
50|$|The walls have marble reredos, made by Leake and Greene of Pittsburgh, with {{bands of}} mosaic in the chancel. In the nave, {{the walls are}} random width beaded board wainscoting with <b>chair</b> <b>rail.</b> Above the <b>chair</b> <b>rail,</b> pink plaster rises up to the heavily molded wood cornice. The wood-truss system is exposed to the ceiling.|$|R
50|$|Hudson {{supplied}} a {{vast array}} of track components, from the rail in all of its multitude of sections and weights per yard, through to individual bolts, nuts and washers. The smallest rail section is usually found around 12 lb/yard, while the heaviest rail shown in the 1957 catalogue is 60 lbs/yard. With the rail, Hudson supplied fishplates and bolts to suit, spikes for wooden <b>rails,</b> <b>chairs</b> and screws for wooden rails, metal sleepers of various sections, including clips and bolts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second floor}} is less elaborately {{detailed}} than the first. The wood trim {{is simple and}} is not moulded, though the <b>chair</b> <b>rails</b> are original. Mantels are of wood and are simply detailed with pilasters and shelves. The {{north end of the}} hall has been enclosed to accommodate two bathrooms. A ladder propped-up to a small door in the ceiling provides access to the attic. The southeast chamber has no <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> and a simple mantel flanked on the left by a closet and on the right by book shelves. The northeast chamber has a heavy moulded <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> and closet. The most elaborate mantel on the second floor is found in the southwest room which is connected to the northwest chamber by a closet passage with shelving. The northwest room has a simple beaded <b>chair</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{costs of}} {{developing}} the line were approximately: £106,000 for land purchase and compensation; £142,000 to contractors {{for the construction of}} the line and buildings; £42,000 on <b>rails,</b> <b>chairs</b> etc. and £35,000 on sleepers etc.; £5,000 on fencing etc.; around £4,700 was spent on rolling stock including engines; over £31,000 was expended on legal, engineering, surveying and management fees, plus general expenses relating to the promotion of the line through parliament, office costs, and employees salaries. Another £3,800 of expense was incurred on interest on loans, giving a total of just under £370,000 (as of 29 February 1840).|$|R
2500|$|The W {{obtained}} materials {{by tender}} and suppliers were from {{many parts of}} the country; the <b>rails,</b> <b>chairs</b> and pins (which were in short supply partly due to heavy demand) were obtained from well-known suppliers including Bradley & Foster's Stourbridge Ironworks, the Capponfield Ironworks near Birmingham, the Nantyglo Ironworks, Monmouthshire and the Bedlington Ironworks in Northumberland. Supplies largely travelled by water. [...] The surviving W minute books in the National Archives show that supplies from the Midlands travelled by narrow boat to Gainsborough, where they were transshipped to coasters for forwarding to Whitby, others travelled by boat to Malton on the Derwent Navigation and were forwarded to Pickering by ox-cart.|$|R
60|$|Edith and Cecil Sykes come {{in through}} the tower. She has her hat on. Leo follows. They have evidently been out together. Sykes, with an unnatural air, half foolish, half rakish, {{as if he had}} lost all his self-respect and were {{determined}} not to let it prey on his spirits, throws himself into a chair {{at the end of the}} table near the hearth and thrusts his hands into his pockets, like Hogarth's Rake, without waiting for Edith to sit down. She sits in the <b>railed</b> <b>chair.</b> Leo takes the chair nearest the tower on the long side of the table, brooding, with closed lips.|$|R
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the <b>chair</b> <b>rail,</b> forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the <b>chair</b> <b>rail.</b> The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded <b>chair</b> <b>rails</b> and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|R
5000|$|The {{track was}} T-section <b>rail</b> in <b>chairs</b> fixed to stone blocks. It was laid to [...] {{standard}} gauge, [...] Speed {{was limited to}} 12 mph, half that over level crossings. It was graded at about 1 in 60 (1.7%) {{for most of its}} length.|$|R

He {{has worked}} as a Weber State University Trustee, the Wasatch Integrated Energy Chair, doing Military Installation, and as the UTA <b>Rail</b> Committee <b>Chair.</b> His primary profession is as a private business owner. Stevenson is married and has children and grandchildren.|$|R
500|$|The present {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Watkin George. George had been trained as a carpenter, but in 1792 became the chief engineer of the ironworks and {{a partner in the}} business. The bridge is composed of two cast iron A-frame trusses supporting a rectangular 2-foot by 6-foot-2-inch cast iron trough. This lower trough carried the Taff Fechan leat and acts as a girder supporting the plates acting as the railway sleepers, into which the <b>rail</b> <b>chairs</b> are integrally cast. [...] Wooden uprights were attached to the iron risers that passed through the apex of each of the A-frames and these supported the upper trough carrying the Taff Fawr leat. Reflecting its designer's roots in carpentry, the members composing the trusses are joined by dovetail and mortise and tenon joints commonly used in wooden structures.|$|R

50|$|Also in the 18th century, {{the style}} of {{panelling}} changed from a floor-to-ceiling covering to one in which only {{the lower part of}} the wall was covered. Hence wainscot or wainscoting became a panelling style applied to the lower 90 to 150 cm of an interior wall, below the dado <b>rail</b> or <b>chair</b> <b>rail,</b> and above the baseboard or skirting board. It is traditionally constructed from tongue-and-groove boards, though bead-board or decorative panels, such as a wooden door might have, are also common. New manufacturing techniques are capable of milling large panels from one sheet, reducing seams, caulking, and expansion/contraction cracks that have plagued traditional construction. Wainscoting may also refer to other materials used in a similar fashion.|$|R
60|$|The pouch {{fell from}} the table and his pipe went down. His head leaned to one side and found the <b>chair</b> <b>rail,</b> and he knew nothing more.|$|R
50|$|By now {{relatively}} long (perhaps 20 ft) {{wrought iron}} <b>rails</b> supported in <b>chairs</b> on timber cross-sleepers, were in use - a track form recognisable today in older track.|$|R
50|$|Pilasters also {{frame the}} windows within the auditorium, with picture panels between them. A molded cornice {{is at the}} ceiling line. The stage also has wainscoting and a molded <b>chair</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|R
50|$|After earlier {{experiences}} with vertical boilered De Winton locomotives the Dinorwic Slate Quarry {{concluded that the}} future lay in heavier, double headed <b>rail</b> in <b>chaired</b> track on its more intensively worked quarry galleries. In order to improve transport of cut slate to the mills & waste to the slag tips a standard design of locomotive which was powerful, light weight & with a short wheelbase was required.|$|R
50|$|The track {{consisted}} of wrought iron fish-bellied rails in 15 ft lengths with five 'bellies' to each length, at 40 lb. to the yard. Cast iron <b>chairs</b> supported the <b>rail</b> between each 'belly', special double chairs supported the joints between lengths of <b>rail.</b> The <b>chairs</b> were fastened to locally quarried stone blocks using iron pins. A length of original track is displayed at Pickering Station.|$|R
60|$|From {{there he}} could just {{distinguish}} the road bed as something solid through the whirling haze, and he felt they were following a bend of it when Grant stopped and a clinking sound {{came out of the}} obscurity above them. It might have been made by somebody knocking out key wedges or spikes with a big hammer and in his haste striking the <b>rail</b> or <b>chair.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{bathroom}} has the baseboard molding. The {{lower section}} of its two-over-two sash {{is larger than}} the upper. The wall separating it and a hallway closet curves, and there is a <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> around the room.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} is {{accessed}} by a timber L-shaped staircase with carved balustrade. The risers are carpeted and the treads {{are lined with}} a dark rubberised material. A <b>rail</b> for a <b>chair</b> lift is fitted to the stairs along the wall.|$|R
50|$|Grainger and Miller {{were now}} {{instructed}} {{to carry out}} a detailed survey of the route so as to present a Parliamentary Bill. Hostility was encountered from the owner of Guthrie Castle, and from the turnpike trustees, and considerable revision to the initial route was incorporated. As the planning progressed, there was also a large increase in the price of materials, particularly iron for <b>rails</b> and <b>chairs,</b> and Grainger and Miller increased their estimate of cost to £70,000.|$|R
50|$|Motor functioning: In a 2002 {{study by}} Min Soo Kang, it was {{reported}} that of the elder population in America, 18% will have a disability. This calculates to 51 million Americans who have difficulties in functioning every day. 32% over age 65 will have difficulty walking, which may require use of walkers, wheelchairs and canes. To make life easier for the elder, some modifications that can aid them are wider entrances, grab <b>rails,</b> elevator <b>chairs</b> on stairs, etc.|$|R
5000|$|The {{northeast}} room on {{the first}} floor functions as the parlor. This room has a dentilled cornice and <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> added by the current owners. A Federal wood mantel is not original to the house. A door {{to the left of the}} fireplace leads to the library situated at the southeast corner of the first floor. The finishes in this room are similar, with added cornice and <b>chair</b> <b>rail</b> and bookcases on the east and west walls. The mantel is green and black Vermont slate and is original to the house. It is likely that the original parlor mantel was similar. A closet,is located to the left of the fireplace is an original feature of the room.|$|R
60|$|RICHARD. How do {{you know}} it's your house until the will is read? (They {{look at one another}} for a moment with intense hatred; and then she sinks, checkmated, into her chair. Richard goes boldly up past Anderson to the window, where he takes the <b>railed</b> <b>chair</b> in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen: as the eldest son of my late father, and the unworthy head of this household, I bid you welcome. By your leave, Minister Anderson: by your leave, Lawyer Hawkins. The head of the table for the head of the family. (He places the chair at the table between the {{minister}} and the attorney; sits down between them; and addresses the assembly with a presidential air.) We meet on a melancholy occasion: a father dead! an uncle actually hanged, and probably damned. (He shakes his head deploringly. The relatives freeze with horror.) That's right: pull your longest faces (his voice suddenly sweetens gravely as his glance lights on Essie) provided only there is hope {{in the eyes of the}} child. (Briskly.) Now then, Lawyer Hawkins: business, business. Get on with the will, man.|$|R
6000|$|After {{waiting for}} some {{answering}} remark, and getting none, Tom wearily relapsed into the present time, and twined himself yawning round and about the <b>rails</b> of his <b>chair,</b> and rumpled his head more and more, until he suddenly looked up, and asked: ...|$|R
