40|$|The {{design of}} large-scale, distributed, performance-sensitive systems {{presents}} numerous challenges {{due to their}} network-centric nature and stringent quality of service (QoS) require-ments. Standardized middleware implementations provide the key building blocks necessary to address these require-ments of the distributed systems. However, middleware {{are designed to be}} applicable {{for a wide range of}} domains and applications, which results in system developers requiring to choose the <b>right</b> set <b>of</b> building <b>blocks</b> to design their system. To reduce the impact on development costs and time-to-market, decisions on the <b>right</b> set <b>of</b> building <b>blocks</b> to use in systems design must be made as early as possible in system design. This paper addresses this concern by describ-ing a model-driven systems simulation approach to analyze, catch and rectify incorrect system design decisions at design-time. In this paper we focus on model-driven OMNeT++ simulation of the Reactor pattern, which provides event de-multiplexing and handling capability.

30|$|The {{classification}} algorithm mainly aims at categorizing {{the whole}} image blocks (i.e., range and domain blocks) into three discrete classes. From the spatial domain, a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> image could be transformed {{to the frequency}} domain by means of DCT transformation. Within the frequency domain, the DCT coefficient that is situated in the upper left <b>of</b> the image <b>block</b> signifies the image block's low-frequency information and its rough contour, whereas the DCT coefficient that is situated in the lower <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the image <b>block</b> signifies the image block's high-frequency information and its fine texture.
