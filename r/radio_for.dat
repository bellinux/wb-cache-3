The same two companies negotiated a six-year, $6million contract to broadcast the Series on television in 1950. Again, Chandler directed the proceeds into the pension fund.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by <b>radio,</b> <b>for</b> various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E

50|$|Radio Gelderland is a {{regional}} public <b>radio</b> station <b>for</b> the Dutch province of Gelderland. Its history started in 1965 when Gelderland joined the RONO (Radio Omroep Noord en Oost). The RONO was already broadcasting {{for the north}} and east of the Netherlands. In 1977 RONO split into <b>Radio</b> Noord <b>for</b> Groningen and Drenthe, <b>Radio</b> Fryslân <b>for</b> Friesland and <b>Radio</b> Oost <b>for</b> Overijssel and Gelderland. Since 1985 Radio Gelderland is an independent broadcaster.|$|R
5|$|Commercial and {{recreational}} use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed, wave periodicity and heights, tides, and precipitation. These factors can each influence {{the safety of}} marine transit. Consequently, a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via <b>radio,</b> <b>for</b> example the MAFOR (marine forecast). Typical weather forecasts can be received at sea {{through the use of}} RTTY, Navtex and Radiofax.|$|E
5|$|Ernst Stavro Blofeld's name {{partially}} {{comes from}} Tom Blofeld, a Norfolk farmer {{and a fellow}} member of Fleming's club Boodle's, who was a contemporary of Fleming's at Eton. Tom Blofeld's son is Henry Blofeld, a sports journalist, {{best known as a}} cricket commentator for Test Match Special on BBC <b>Radio.</b> <b>For</b> Blofeld's pseudonym in the novel, Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, Fleming uses the name of an old café he had seen in Hamburg in 1959 ("Old Shatterhand", a fictional character penned in a series of Western stories along with Winnetou by German writer Karl May) The characterisation of him dressed as a Samurai was taken from the sketch Fleming had come up with thirty five years earlier for a character called Graf Schlick.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the women's rights {{movement}} won {{passage of a}} constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage. The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of <b>radio</b> <b>for</b> mass communication and the invention of early television. The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and {{the onset of the}} Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system. The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s; whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.|$|E

5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the <b>radio</b> <b>for</b> negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies' postseason radio duties {{were split}} between the TV crew and the regular radio crew, while the {{television}} broadcasts on TBS were covered by Brian Anderson, Joe Simpson, and David Aldridge for the Division Series, and Chip Caray, Ron Darling, and Buck Martinez for the League Championship Series. The World Series broadcasters were Joe Buck and Tim McCarver on the Fox telecasts, and Joe Morgan and Jon Miller on ESPN <b>Radio</b> <b>for</b> the national broadcast.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS <b>radio</b> <b>for</b> use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E

5|$|By 27 April, Berlin was cut {{off from}} the rest of Germany. Secure radio {{communications}} with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders and on public <b>radio</b> <b>for</b> news and information. On 28 April, a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up; a copy of the message was given to Hitler. The report stated that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies; the offer had been declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender; Hitler considered this treason. During the afternoon his anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin) shot.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, Cameron was {{focusing}} to {{a greater}} extent on her family life, particularly in looking after her grandchildren, who were known to go joyriding in her jeep. Neighbors recall her playing a Celtic harp in her garden and slowly walking her dog around the block while smoking a joint of marijuana. At one point, she was arrested for cultivating cannabis in her home. Cameron became a regular practitioner of Tai chi, took part in group sessions in Bronson Park under the tutelage of Marshall Ho'o, and earned a teaching certificate in the subject. She became very interested in José Argüelles' The Mayan Factor and Charles Musès' The Lion Path, and undertook the Neo-shamanic practices endorsed in the latter. She was also influenced by claims made in the writings of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas about a prehistoric matriarchal society devoted to a goddess. Cameron was very interested in A. S. Raleigh's Woman and Superwoman, taped her own reading of it, and sent copies to her friends and local public <b>radio</b> <b>for</b> broadcast. Throughout all of these disparate spiritual interests, she retained faith in the Thelemic ideas of Crowley.|$|E
5|$|Janek (Idris Elba) is {{captain of}} the Prometheus. Following Holloway's suggestion, he lands the ship near the {{structure}} containing the Juggernaut. During the expedition Janek remains on the Prometheus, observing the schematics which Fifield's spectagraphs develop. He seduces Meredith Vickers while Sean Fifield and Rafe Milburn <b>radio</b> <b>for</b> direction. Vickers and Janek recognize the Juggernaut as an Engineer ship. While Shaw prepares to join Weyland on the expedition to awaken the Engineer, Janek says that the Engineers had nefarious intentions with the biological weapons and he will {{do whatever is necessary}} to protect Earth's interests. When Vickers orders Janek to bring the Prometheus home, Shaw tells him that the Engineer ship is headed to Earth to release the black liquid and annihilate the human race. Janek decides to steer the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, and orders everyone to leave. Assistant pilots Chance and Ravel refuse and help Janek run the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, crippling it, sacrificing themselves, and saving the human race.|$|E
