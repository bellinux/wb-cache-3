5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} only at the fringes of jackal territory. Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets, with the jackal being three times bigger than the <b>red</b> <b>fox.</b> The <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> will avoid close {{proximity}} with jackals, and fox populations decrease where jackals are abundant. Striped hyenas prey on golden jackals, and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|E
5|$|The <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> {{originated}} from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North America {{shortly after the}} Wisconsin glaciation. Among the true foxes, the <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> represents a more progressive form {{in the direction of}} carnivory. Apart from its large size, the <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Despite its name, the species often produces individuals with other colourings, including albinos and melanists. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised, which are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes, and the small, basal southern foxes of Asia and North Africa.|$|E

40|$|To further {{determine}} {{the distribution and}} prevalence of Echinococcus multilocularis in the central United States, 245 wild canids (125 <b>red</b> <b>foxes,</b> 120 coyotes) and 33 bobcats were collected from Nebraska, Kansas, and Wyoming and examined for this parasite. Animals examined included 11 <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> from the western panhandle of Nebraska; 5 <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> and 30 coyotes from southern Nebraska; 56 <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> and 1 coyote from northeastern Nebraska; 20 <b>red</b> <b>foxes,</b> 63 coyotes, and 13 bobcats from northern Kansas; 2 <b>red</b> <b>foxes,</b> 26 coyotes, and 20 bobcats from southern Kansas; and 31 <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> from eastcentral Wyoming. Of these, 27 of 72 (37. 5 %) <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> from Nebraska were positive, including 2 of 11 (18. 2 %) from the western panhandle and 25 of 56 (44. 6 %) from the northeastern part of the state. Mean intensity of infection was 282 worms (range, 1 – 5, 150). New distribution records were established for E. multilocularis in western Nebraska {{as well as for}} several northeastern counties. These findings support previous estimates that the southernmost front of the parasite’s range extends along the southern border of Wyoming, eastward through central Nebraska and central Illinois into Indiana and Ohio...|$|R
5|$|In Eurasia, <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws {{give them an}} {{advantage}} over foxes, especially when {{the depth of the}} snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> than wolves do. North American felid predators of <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.|$|R

On the other hand, infection with echinococcosis mediated by its body surface and faeces of Ezo <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> are also considered a problem, and in Hokkaido it is calls not to act in its habitat {{that there is a}} fear of infection in the habitat so as not to interfere with Ezo <b>red</b> <b>foxes.</b> In these cases, contagion of other diseases from domestic animals to Ezo <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> are also concerned to pets, etc. brought in by travelling.|$|R
5|$|Although European foxes were {{introduced}} to portions of the United States in the 1900s recent genetic investigation indicates an absence of European fox haplotypes in any North American populations. Also, introduced eastern red foxes have colonized southern California, the San Joaquin Valley, and San Francisco Bay Area, but appear to have mixed with the Sacramento Valley <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> V.v.patwin only in a narrow hybrid zone. In addition, no evidence is seen of interbreeding of eastern red foxes in California with the montane Sierra Nevada <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> V.v.necator or other populations in the Intermountain West (between the Rocky Mountains {{to the east and}} the Cascade and Sierra Nevada ranges to the west.|$|E

40|$|Carcasses of <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> (n= 256) and raccoon dogs (n= 253) were {{collected}} throughout Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania (north-east Germany) between August 2004 and January 2007. Frequency of occurrence (FO) and biomass share (BS) were estimated for fifteen and seven food categories, respectively. Diet analyses indicate that both canids are omnivorous and pursue opportunistic feeding strategies. Small mammals (BS= 31. 2, FO= 38. 7) and vegetable matter (BS= 51. 3, FO= 63. 1) {{were the most}} important food resources for <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> and raccoon dogs, respectively. Interspecies differences were recorded for vegetable matter, small mammals and insects. While <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> mostly feed on voles, raccoon dogs consumed mice and shrews as often as voles. However, unlike <b>red</b> <b>foxes,</b> raccoon dogs did not use small mammals intensively all year round. Only raccoon dogs preyed on amphibians. There were no differences in carrion consumption between <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> (BS= 21. 2) and raccoon dogs (BS= 18. 2). Both <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> (FO= 8. 4) and raccoon dogs (FO= 8. 0) scavenged on wild boar. Moreover, there was evidence that two <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> foraged on raccoon dogs and vice versa. Mean annual interspecies diet overlap indices were high. We found clear competition for carrion year-round. The diets determined for raccoon dogs and <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> were quite similar and a similar food niche breadth was recorded. However, only minor competition is assumed to take place since differences in feeding habits do exist. Download the complete issue...|$|R
40|$|Variation in the {{distribution}} and abundance of animals {{in space and time}} are key concepts of population ecology. We studied these variations in a population of <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> (Vulpes vulpes) in the tundra and taiga of northern Sweden. We analysed 12 years (1974 – 1985) of snow tracking data from a large area of 65, 375 km 2. Specifically, we evaluated to what extent {{the distribution}} of <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> was explained by the presence of prey and how this interacted with snow depth and altitude. We also tested for temporal linear trends {{in the distribution}} and abundance of <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> during the study period. The distribution of <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> was explained by the presence of rodents, hares, tetraonid species, and ungulates (i. e. carcasses). Snow depth had a negative effect on the impact of small prey on the distribution of the <b>red</b> <b>foxes,</b> whereas it had a positive effect on the impact of ungulates. The influence of hares increased with altitude. Neither distribution nor abundance of <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> showed a positive or negative linear trend, suggesting a stable population in northern Sweden during our study. This study showed that the distribution of <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> was not only influenced by the presence of their main prey (rodents), but also by interactions between alternative prey, altitude, and snow depth. This study also emphasizes the importance of ungulate carcasses for <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> and for wildlife management...|$|R

5|$|The {{species is}} Eurasian in origin, {{and may have}} evolved from either Vulpes alopecoides or the related Chinese V.chikushanensis, both of which lived during the Middle Villafranchian. The {{earliest}} fossil specimens of V.vulpes were uncovered in Baranya, Hungary dating from 3.4-1.8million years ago. The ancestral species was likely smaller than the current one, as the earliest <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> fossils are smaller than modern populations. The earliest fossil remains of the modern species {{date back to the}} mid-Pleistocene in association with the refuse of early human settlements. This has led to the theory that the <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> was hunted by primitive humans as both a source of food and pelts.|$|E
50|$|The {{familiarisation}} of Ezo <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> {{by feeding}} brings changes to its behaviour.

5|$|Red foxes colonised the North American {{continent}} in two waves: {{during or}} before the Illinoian glaciation, {{and during the}} Wisconsinan glaciation. Gene mapping demonstrates that red foxes in North America have been isolated from their Old World counterparts for over 400,000 years, thus raising the possibility that speciation has occurred, and that the previous binomial name of Vulpes fulva may be valid. In the far north, <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> fossils {{have been found in}} Sangamonian deposits in the Fairbanks District and Medicine Hat. Fossils dating from the Wisconsian are present in 25 sites in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming. Although they ranged far south during the Wisconsinan, the onset of warm conditions shrank their range toward the north, and have only recently reclaimed their former American ranges because of human-induced environmental changes. Genetic testing indicates two distinct <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> refugia exist in North America, which have been separated since the Wisconsinan. The northern (or boreal) refugium occurs in Alaska and western Canada, and consists of the large subspecies V.v.alascensis, V.v.abietorum, V.v.regalis, and V.v.rubricosa. The southern (or montane) refugium occurs in the subalpine parklands and alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, the Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada. It encompasses the subspecies V.v.macroura, V.v.cascadensis, and V.v.necator. The latter clade has been separated from all other <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> populations since the last glacial maximum, and may possess unique ecological or physiological adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes {{dominate}} raccoon dogs, sometimes {{killing their}} kits or biting adults to death. Cases are known of foxes killing raccoon dogs entering their dens. Both species compete for mouse-like prey. This competition reaches a peak during early spring, when food is scarce. In Tartaria, <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> predation accounted for 11.1% of deaths among 54 raccoon dogs, and amounted to 14.3% of 186 raccoon dog deaths in north-western Russia.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} done {{in an attempt to}} {{investigate}} the epidemiological status of Echinococcus multilocularis in <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> and raccoon dogs in Otaru city from June to September 1999. Sixty-seven <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> (Vulpes vulpes schrencki) and 13 raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides albus) were captured, and postmortem examinations were conducted with them. Thirty-eight <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> (56. 7 %) and 3 raccoon dogs (23. 1 %) were found to be infected with E. multilocularis. The total biomass of E. multilocularis in all infected <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> and raccoon dogs were 2, 817, 000 and 1, 515 worms, respectively. Nine of the infected <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> harboring more than 100, 000 worms accounted for 90. 6 % of the total biomass. No significant differences in the prevalence were observed between male and female, and juvenile and adult. However, the worm burden was higher in juvenile than in adult foxes. In one of the infected raccoon dogs, mature worms and eggs of E. multilocularis were found in the intestine and fecal sample, respectively. This result suggested that the raccoon dogs are probably playing a small role in the egg contamination of the environment.

5|$|The <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> is {{considered}} a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, corsac and Bengal foxes {{in the direction of}} size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is more developed.

5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by {{mammalian}} predators, {{such as the}} <b>red</b> <b>fox</b> (Vulpes vulpes) or the feral cat (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas. Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (even by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests are hidden {{close to the ground}} and therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Raccoon {{dogs and}} <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> are well-adapted hosts for Trichinella spp. The aims {{of this study}} were to {{estimate}} Trichinella infection prevalence and biomass and to investigate which Trichinella species circulated in these indicator hosts in Estonia. Methods From material collected for evaluating the effectiveness of oral vaccination program for rabies eradication in wildlife, samples from 113 raccoon dogs and 87 <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> were included in this study. From each animal, 20  g of masseter muscle tissue was tested for the presence of Trichinella larvae using an artificial digestion method. The Trichinella larvae were identified to species level by multiplex polymerase chain reaction method. Results The majority of tested animals were infected with Trichinella spp. The parasite species identified were T. nativa and T. britovi. The apparent infection prevalence was 57. 5 % in raccoon dogs and 69. 0 % in <b>red</b> <b>foxes,</b> which were higher than previous estimates. In addition, the larval burden had also increased in both hosts. We estimated that in 2011 – 2012, the Trichinella spp. biomass was more than 15 times higher in raccoon dogs and almost two times higher in <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> than in 1992 – 2000 (based on mean larval burden), and almost 20 times higher in raccoon dogs and almost five times higher in <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> than in 2000 – 2002 (based on median larval burden). Conclusions Raccoon dogs and <b>red</b> <b>foxes</b> are relevant reservoirs for Trichinella spp. in Estonia. The biomass of Trichinella circulating in sylvatic cycles was substantial and had increased: there is substantial infection pressure in the sylvatic cycle...|$|R
