5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a <b>resistor</b> <b>network,</b> but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} an inversion algorithm for {{electrical impedance}} tomography (EIT) with partial boundary measurements, in two dimensions. It gives stable and fast reconstructions using sparse parameterizations {{of the unknown}} conductivity on optimal grids that are computed {{as part of the}} inversion. We follow the approach in [8, 27] that connects inverse discrete problems for <b>resistor</b> <b>networks</b> to continuum EIT problems, using optimal grids. The algorithm in [8, 27] is based on circular <b>resistor</b> <b>networks,</b> and solves the EIT problem with full boundary measurements. It is extended in [11] to EIT with partial boundary measurements, using extremal quasiconformal mappings that transform the problem to one with full boundary measurements. Here we introduce a different class of optimal grids, based on <b>resistor</b> <b>networks</b> with pyramidal topology, that is better suited for the partial measurements setup. We prove the unique solvability of the discrete inverse problem for these networks, and develop an algorithm for finding them from the measurements of the DtN map.

40|$|There are two {{commonly}} discrete approximations for {{the inverse}} conductivity problem. Finite element models are heavily used in electrical impedance tomography research {{as they are}} easily adapted to bodies of irregular shapes. The other approximation is to use electrical <b>resistor</b> <b>networks</b> for which several uniqueness results and reconstruction algorithms are known for the inverse problem. In this thesis the link between finite element models and <b>resistor</b> <b>networks</b> is established. For the planar case we show how <b>resistor</b> <b>networks</b> associated with a triangular mesh have an isotropic embedding and we give conditions for {{the uniqueness of the}} embedding. Moreover, a layered finite element model parameterized by thevalues of conductivity on the interior nodes is constructed. Construction of the finite element mesh leads to a study of the triangulation survey problem. A constructive algorithm is given to determine the position of the nodes in the triangulation with a knowledge of one edge and the angles of the finite element mesh. Also we show that we need to satisfy the sine rule as aconsistency condition for every closed basic cycle that enclosing interior nodes and this is a complete set of independent constraints.
