50|$|On Christmas Day, 1932 the British Broadcasting Corporation {{first used}} a steel tape {{recorder}} for their broadcasts. The device used was a Marconi-Stille recorder, {{a huge and}} dangerous machine which used steel tape that had sharp edges. The tape was 0.1 in wide and 0.003 in thick running at 5 ft/s past the <b>recording</b> and <b>reproducing</b> <b>heads.</b> This meant that the length of tape required for a half-hour programme was nearly 1.8 mi and a full reel weighed 55 lb.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} of the <b>recording</b> and <b>reproducing</b> <b>heads,</b> mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted so that several recordings could be cut on the same wax-coated strip. Although the machine was never developed commercially, it is interesting as a predecessor to the later magnetic tape recorder, which it resembles in general design. The tapes, when later examined {{at one of the}} Smithsonian Institution's depositories, had become brittle, the heavy paper reels had warped, and the machine's playback head was missing. Otherwise, with some reconditioning the machine could be put back into working order.|$|R

40|$|Two end-item tape {{recorders}} lost 4 : 1 mode data recording mode capability {{at less than}} half of their 1 6, 000 -cycle, 4 -year operating life. Subsequent life tests on two spare recorders also experienced 4 : 1 mode data loss at 8, 000 and 11, 700 cycles. Tear down inspection after completion of the life tests showed that the tape had worn through the alfesil <b>record</b> and <b>reproduce</b> <b>heads.</b> An investigation was initiated to understand the cause of excessive tape head wear and the reasons why the 4 : 1 mode data rate, low-speed mode is more damaging than the 1 : 1 mode data rate, high-speed recording mode. The objective was to establish how operating conditions (tape speed, humidity, temperature, stop/start cycles) affects head life with the goal of extending head life on the remaining in-service {{tape recorders}}. Another interest was to explain why an earlier vendor life test showed capability beyond 16, 000 cycles...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 27 - 29, 1971 / Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington, D. C. This paper {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} with several new techniques which {{are being used to}} extend the frequency bandwidth limits and the signal to noise ratios of instrumentation magnetic tape record/ reproduce systems. During the past decade, wideband magnetic tape information recording densities have advanced in several stages to the currently used 60 to 80 micro inch wavelengths. The new techniques described in this paper now make it practical to <b>record</b> and <b>reproduce</b> wavelengths in the order of 30 to 40 micro inches. This results in a frequency bandwidth of 1. 0 MHz at a tape speed of 30 inches per second. In comparison with present wideband systems this means an improvement of 2 X in bandwidth, or a reduction of tape speed by one half is now possible while maintaining approximately 20 dB broadband signal to noise ratio with a track width of. 025 inches. This width provides 28 tracks per inch of tape width. This improved performance has been obtained by combining recent improvements in "High Energy" tape, narrow gap ferrite <b>record</b> <b>heads</b> and ferrite <b>reproduce</b> <b>heads.</b> Using a systems approach, electronic signal processing circuits have been developed which coordinate these improvements in tape and heads, resulting in optimized "high performance" record/ reproduce systems...|$|R

50|$|Several inventors devised {{machines}} to record sound prior to Thomas Edison's phonograph, Edison {{being the first}} to invent a device that could both <b>record</b> and <b>reproduce</b> sound.

Recordings made with the phonautograph were intended to be visual representations of the sound and {{were not to be}} reproduced as sound until 2008.
