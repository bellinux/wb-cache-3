5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis,</b> use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis,</b> or rain water.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, eight {{diesel engines}} and {{electricity}} generators, four for each ship, were ordered from Wärtsilä. On 4 March 2008, contracts for {{the supply of}} 80,000tonnes of steel were awarded to Corus Group, with an estimated value of £65million. Other contracts included £3million for fibre optic cable, over £1million for <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> equipment to provide over 500tonnes of fresh water daily, and £4million for aviation fuel systems. On 3 April 2008, a contract for the manufacture of aircraft lifts (worth £13m) was awarded to MacTaggart Scott of Loanhead, Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> {{may not be}} viable for brine treatment, due to the {{potential}} for fouling caused by hardness salts or organic contaminants, or damage to the <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> membranes from hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|Desalination of {{seawater}} by distillation or <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern {{technologies}} such as <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> and ultraviolet disinfection are commonly used when reclaimed water will be mixed with the drinking water supply.|$|E
25|$|A minimum energy {{consumption}} for seawater desalination of around 1 kWh/m3 has been determined, excluding prefiltering and intake/outfall pumping. Under 2 kWh/m3 {{has been achieved}} with <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> membrane technology, leaving limited scope for further energy reductions.|$|E
25|$|For {{many types}} of reuse {{applications}} wastewater must pass through numerous sewage treatment process steps {{before it can be}} used. Steps might include screening, primary settling, biological treatment, tertiary treatment (for example <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis),</b> and disinfection.|$|E
25|$|Other popular {{methods for}} purifying water, {{especially}} for local private supplies are listed below. In some countries {{some of these}} methods are also used for large scale municipal supplies. Particularly important are distillation (de-salination of seawater) and <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dow Water and Process Solutions (DW) is a {{business}} unit which manufactures Filmtec <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> membranes which are used to purify water for human use in the Middle East. The technology was used during the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|The current {{trend in}} dual-purpose {{facilities}} is hybrid configurations, {{in which the}} permeate from <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> desalination is mixed with distillate from thermal desalination. Basically, two or more desalination processes are combined along with power production. Such facilities have been implemented in Saudi Arabia at Jeddah and Yanbu.|$|E
25|$|When the {{transmission}} of generated wind power to nearby land is not economical, the power {{can be used in}} power to gas applications to produce hydrogen gas, ammonia / urea, <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> water desalination, natural gas, LPG, alkylate / gasoline, etc. on floating platforms which can be easily transported to nearby consuming centres.|$|E
25|$|New technologies, like <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> {{can create}} {{unlimited}} amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, {{and even from}} humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into potable water and brine. Atmospheric water generators extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.|$|E
25|$|Reverse osmosis: Mechanical {{pressure}} {{is applied to}} an impure solution to force pure water through a semi-permeable membrane. <b>Reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> is theoretically the most thorough method of large scale water purification available, although perfect semi-permeable membranes are difficult to create. Unless membranes are well-maintained, algae and other life forms can colonize the membranes.|$|E
25|$|The Ashkelon {{seawater}} <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> (SWRO) {{desalination plant}} {{was the largest}} in the world when it was commissioned. The project was developed as a BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) by a consortium of three international companies: Veolia water, IDE Technologies and Elran. In March 2006, it was voted 'Desalination Plant of the Year' in the Global Water Awards.|$|E
25|$|Brine {{treatment}} is commonly encountered when treating cooling tower blowdown, produced water from steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), produced water from natural gas extraction such as coal seam gas, frac flowback water, acid mine or acid rock drainage, <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> reject, chlor-alkali wastewater, {{pulp and paper}} mill effluent, and waste streams from food and beverage processing.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} {{used to treat}} wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards {{and make sure that}} the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies: Ozonation, ultrafiltration, aerobic treatment (membrane bioreactor), forward osmosis, <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis,</b> advanced oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Some wine journalists {{contend that}} chaptalization allows wine makers to {{sacrifice}} quality {{in favor of}} quantity by letting vines overproduce high yields of grapes that have not fully ripened. Also, winemakers have been using technological advances, such as <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> to remove water from the unfermented grape juice, thereby increasing its sugar concentration, but decreasing the volume of wine produced.|$|E
25|$|Having {{negligible}} {{natural resources}} and few natural freshwater resources, limited to natural wells in the north, until recently Gibraltar used large concrete and/or natural rock water catchments to collect rainwater. Fresh water from the boreholes is supplemented by two desalination plants: a <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> plant, constructed in a tunnel within the rock, and a multi-stage flash distillation plant at North Mole.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} during the twentieth century, {{the water supply}} was {{rainwater}} harvested from several large bitumen sealed catchment areas behind Longreach Bay. In the 1970s fresh water was found underground and was used to supplement the rainfall supply. In 1995 the supply was further supplemented with desalinated groundwater, using a <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> plant producing up to 500 kL per day.|$|E
25|$|Desalination removes iodine {{from water}} and could {{increase}} the risk of iodine deficiency disorders. Israeli researchers claimed a possible link between seawater desalination and iodine deficiency, finding deficits among euthyroid adults exposed to iodine-poor water concurrently with an increasing proportion of their area's drinking water from seawater <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> (SWRO). They later found probable iodine deficiency disorders in a population reliant on desalinated seawater.|$|E
25|$|ELGA {{produces}} {{water purification}} systems which provide purified water and ultrapure water for applications {{in research and}} analytical laboratories, medical and clinical facilities. It incorporates in its water purifiers a combination of purification technologies, e.g. <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis,</b> electronics-grade ion-exchange resins, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, degassing, ultraviolet photooxidation and electrodeionization. Products are designed to minimize {{impact on the environment}} at all stages - manufacture, in-service and at end of life.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the Israeli {{facilities}} of Hadera, Palmahim, Ashkelon, and Sorek were desalinizing {{water for}} less than US$0.40 per cubic meter. As of 2006, Singapore was desalinating water for US$0.49 per cubic meter. The city of Perth began operating a <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> seawater desalination plant in 2006. A desalination plant now operates in Sydney, and the Wonthaggi desalination plant was under construction in Wonthaggi, Victoria.|$|E
25|$|The Acelhuate River is an {{important}} drainage system for El Salvador's capital, San Salvador, and is severely contaminated with heavy metals along with domestic and industrial waste. This water is considered a biohazard, and the contamination is so severe that it is rendered untreatable by treatment methods such as <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis.</b> Contaminated water from the Acelhuate River flows directly into the Cerron Grande reservoir.|$|E
25|$|A process {{employing}} electrokinetic shocks waves {{can be used}} {{to accomplish}} membraneless desalination at ambient temperature and pressure. In this process, anions and cations in salt water are exchanged for carbonate anions and calcium cations, respectively using electrokinetic shockwaves. Calcium and carbonate ions react to form calcium carbonate, which precipitates, leaving fresh water. The theoretical energy efficiency of this method is on par with electrodialysis and <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|NEWater is {{the brand}} name given to ultra-pure water that is {{produced}} from reclaimed water. Wastewater, which is called used water in Singapore, is treated in conventional advanced wastewater treatment plants that are called reclamation plants in Singapore. The effluent from the reclamation plants is either discharged into the sea or it is further treated in NEWater plants using dual-membrane (via microfiltration and <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis)</b> and ultraviolet technologies.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014 the {{national}} utility ONEE signed a Build-Operate-Transfer contract for a 100,000 m3/day <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> seawater desalination plant in Agadir with a consortium between the Spanish firm Abengoa Water and the investment fund InfraMaroc. The project {{had been under}} preparation for seven years. The payment is in local currency and the Abengoa-led consortium {{was the only one}} that submitted a bid for the project that other firms considered to be too risky.|$|E
25|$|Biofouling is {{also found}} in almost all {{circumstances}} where water-based liquids are in contact with other materials. Industrially important impacts are on the maintenance of mariculture, membrane systems (e.g., membrane bioreactors and <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> spiral wound membranes) and cooling water cycles of large industrial equipment and power stations. Biofouling can occur in oil pipelines carrying oils with entrained water, especially those carrying used oils, cutting oils, oils rendered water-soluble through emulsification, and hydraulic oils.|$|E
25|$|Liveris {{supports}} the vertically integrated approach used at Dow, which produces everything from basic chemical feedstocks to high value {{products such as}} pesticides and <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> membranes. These value-adding product chains, along with Dow's wide product range, help the company to weather the storms of the global economy. Despite this, high energy and feedstock costs may begin to take their toll, particularly if global demand begins to fall just as supply is rising.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>Reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> and {{electrodialysis}} (also called electrodialysis reversal) {{can remove}} arsenic {{with a net}} ionic charge. (Note that arsenic oxide, As2O3, is a common form of arsenic in groundwater that is soluble, but has no net charge.) Some utilities presently use one of these methods to reduce total dissolved solids and therefore improve taste. A problem with both methods is the production of high-salinity waste water, called brine, or concentrate, which then must be disposed of.|$|E
25|$|Some {{problems}} {{that are expected to}} be an issue in this century, such as fresh water shortages, can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply. For example, in desalination stations, seawater can be purified through distillation or <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis.</b> Nonetheless, these processes are energy intensive. Even if the first fusion stations are not competitive with alternative sources, fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide.|$|E
25|$|Sarracenia require {{constantly}} moist-wet, nutrient free acidic soil. This is {{most often}} achieved with a potting mix consisting of peat moss mixed with sand or perlite. As their roots are sensitive to nutrients and minerals, only pure water, such as distilled, rain, or <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> water, {{can be used to}} water them. Sarracenia prefer sunny conditions during their growing season but require a dormancy period, with decreased light and temperatures, of a few months in the winter.|$|E
25|$|In early 2002, {{under the}} impact of drought, the {{government}} approved the construction of large seawater desalination plants along the Mediterranean coast. These installations would supply 500 million m3/yr by 2015. The government's goal is to reach a capacity of 750 million m3/year by 2020. All projects were to be executed by the private sector, through international tenders. At the end of 2013 four plants, with a total capacity of almost 500 million m3/year per year, were operational. All plants use <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis,</b> utilizing self-generated power.|$|E
25|$|Some aquarists modify water's alkalinity, hardness, or {{dissolved}} {{content of}} organics and gases, before adding {{it to their}} aquaria. This {{can be accomplished by}} additives, such as sodium bicarbonate, to raise pH. Some aquarists filter or purify their water through deionization or <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> prior to using it. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) to reduce the level of treatment. Some hobbyists use an algae scrubber to filter the water naturally.|$|E
