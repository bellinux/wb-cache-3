40|$|A {{hoisting}} {{rail system}} has been designed for lifting loads from the north sidewalk of the D 0 collision hall into the collision hall pit. This engineering note documents the design. The hoisting system was conceived primarily to aid in getting heavy loads into the pit during short (less than a few days) accesses. The typical use for the hoist will be to lift a BLS power supply (120 lbs) and carrier (16 lbs) from a roll around cart {{on the sidewalk and}} onto a similar cart in the collision hall pit. The hoist system will alleviate the need for two persons to carry this heavy load up and down a narrow (24 -inch) staircase. The hoisting system has a designed lift rating of 150 lbs. All members and components are well within a conservative safety factor when subjected to this loading at it's worst possible configuration, that is with it's boom cantilevered out 8 feet from the base rail. See the hoisting <b>rail</b> <b>assembly</b> sketch (in the hand calculations section) and the picture inserted below to get an orientation of the device. The hoisting system is designed using BLine 'unistrut' system components. The hoist consists of a 'base' rail that is fastened to either the northeast or northwest air handler platforms. This fixed base rail has (2) two sided trolley assemblies inserted into it's lower unistrut member. One assembly is locked in place on the base rail. Another is locked in place on the lower 'boom' rail. The trolley assemblies are free wheeling which allows boom movement in the north-south direction about 7 1 / 2 feet within the fixed base rail. An electric hoist hangs from the 'boom' rail on a single trolley. The hoisting system meets Fermilab Environment and Safety Manual chapter 5021 entitled 'Overhead cranes hoists and rigging'. Inclusive in that requirement is that it meets the applicable Fermilab 'work smart standards' of ANSI B 30. 11 - 1998 'Monorails and underhung cranes', and ANSI B 30. 16 - 1998 'Overhead hoists (underhung) '. The design criteria for the structural members per these standards is that static stresses shall not exceed 0. 2 times the average ultimate material strength. The unistrut members are fabricated from hot rolled carbon steel. The B-Line catalog states that the minimum yield strength of the virgin material is 33, 000 psi and the cold worked average yield stress is 42, 000 psi. The ultimate strength of the material is not given in the catalog, but based on the description of the material and values listed in the Ryerson steel catalog, I will use a value 58, 000 psi for the ultimate strength. A minimum safety factor of 5 must be achieved based on ultimate strength...|$|E
40|$|America {{has begun}} the {{development}} of a new heavy lift rocket which will enable humans to return to the moon and reach even farther destinations. Five decades ago, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration designed a system (called Saturn/Apollo) to carry men to the moon and back; the rocket which boosted them to the moon was the Saturn V. Saturn V was huge relative to contemporary rockets and is still the largest rocket ever launched. The new moon rocket is called Ares V. It will insert 40 % more payload into low earth orbit than Saturn V; and after docking with the crew spacecraft, it will insert 50 % more payload onto the translunar trajectory than Saturn V. The current design of Ares V calls for two liquid-fueled stages and 2 "strap-on" solid rockets. The solid rockets are extended-length versions of the solid rockets used on the Shuttle. The diameter of the liquid stages is at least as large as the first stage of the Saturn V; the height of the lower liquid stage (called the core stage) is longer than the external tank of the Shuttle. Huge rockets require huge infrastructure and, during the Saturn/Apollo era, America invested significantly in manufacturing, assembly and launch facilities which are still in use today. Since the Saturn/Apollo era, America has invested in additional infrastructure for the Shuttle program. Ares V must utilize this existing infrastructure, with reasonable modifications. Building a rocket with 50 % more capability in the same buildings, testing it in the same test stands, shipping on the same canals under the same bridges, assembling it in the same building, rolling it to the pad on the same crawler, and launching it from the same launch pad is an engineering and logistics challenge which goes hand-in-hand with designing the structure, tanks, turbines, engines, software, etc. necessary to carry such a large payload to earth orbit and to the moon. This paper quantitatively discusses the significant "tight fits" that are constraining Ares V. The engineers designing and building the infrastructure for the Saturn/Apollo program usually added margins and growth capability; sometimes the size of existing facilities (such as the width of a draw bridge) was not a constraint. Ares V may utilize the "extra" space in the existing facilities and expand other tight fits. Some of the tight fits cannot be overcome without great expense; raising the roof on the Vertical Assembly Building for example. Other tight fits are easily overcome; the transporter at the manufacturing facility for the core stage can pass under low ceilings and later over a dike (without dragging the middle) by retracting or extending the struts which support the stage. Tight fits discussed in this paper include manufacturing (jigs, widths, heights, and local transportation), testing (test stand sizes and crane capability), transportation to the test stands and the launch site (barge, waterway, and <b>rail),</b> <b>assembly</b> (VAB internal dimensions and door size), roll-out limits, and launch pad size...|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{variation}} {{results in}} {{uncertainty in the}} functionality and performance of mechanical assemblies. Management of this uncertainty {{is of paramount importance}} for manufacturing efficiency. Methods focused on the management of uncertainty and variation in the design of mechanical assemblies, such as tolerance analysis and synthesis, have been subject to extensive research and development to date. However, due to the challenges involved, limitations in the capability of these methods remain. These limitations are associated with the following problems: The identification of Key Product Characteristics (KPCs) in mechanical assemblies (which are required for measuring functional performance) without imposing significant modelling demands.  Accommodation of the high computational cost of traditional statistical tolerance analysis in early design where analysis budgets are limited. Efficient identification of feasible regions and optimum performance within the large design spaces associated with early design stages.  The ability to comprehensively accommodate tolerance analysis problems in which assembly functionality is dependent on the effects of loading (such as compliance or multi‐body dynamics). Current Computer Aided Tolerancing (CAT) is limited by: the ability to accommodate only specific loading effects; reliance on custom simulation codes with limited practical implementation in accessible software tools; and, the need for additional expertise in formulating specific assembly tolerance models and interpreting results. Accommodation of the often impractically high computational cost of tolerance synthesis involving demanding assembly models (particularly assemblies under loading). The high computational cost is associated with traditional statistical tolerancing Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods reliant on low‐efficiency Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. This research is focused on addressing these limitations, by developing novel methods for enhancing the engineering design of mechanical assemblies involving uncertainty or variation in design parameters. This is achieved by utilising the emerging design analysis and refinement capabilities of Process Integration and Design Optimization (PIDO) tools. ii The main contributions of this research are in three main themes:  Design analysis and refinement accommodating uncertainty in early design;  Tolerancing of assemblies subject to loading; and, efficient Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in tolerance analysis and synthesis. The research outcomes present a number of contributions within each research theme, as outlined below. Design analysis and refinement accommodating uncertainty in early design: A PIDO tool based visualization method to aid designers in identifying assembly KPCs in early design stages. The developed method integrates CAD software functionally with the process integration, UQ, data logging and statistical analysis capabilities of PIDO tools, to simulate manufacturing variation in an assembly and visualise assembly clearances, contacts or interferences. The visualization capability subsequently assists the designer in specifying critical assembly dimensions as KPCs.  Computationally efficient method for manufacturing sensitivity analysis of assemblies with linear‐compliant elements. Reduction in computational cost are achieved by utilising linear‐compliant assembly stiffness measures, reuse of CAD models created in early design stages, and PIDO tool based tolerance analysis. The associated increase in computational efficiency, allows an estimate of sensitivity to manufacturing variation to be made earlier in the design process with low effort.  Refinement of concept design embodiments through PIDO based DOE analysis and optimization. PIDO tools are utilised to allow CAE tool integration, and efficient reuse of models created in early design stages, to rapidly identify feasible and optimal regions in the design space. A case study focused on the conceptual design of automotive seat kinematics is presented, in which an optimal design is identified and subsequently selected for commercialisation in the Tesla Motors Model S full‐sized electric sedan. These contributions can be directly applied to improve the design of mechanical assemblies involving uncertainty or variation in design parameters {{in the early stages of}} design. The use of native CAD/E models developed as part of an established design modelling procedure imposes low additional modelling effort. Tolerancing of assemblies subject to loading:  A novel tolerance analysis platform is developed which integrates CAD/E and statistical analysis tools using PIDO tool capabilities to facilitate tolerance analysis of assemblies subject to loading. The proposed platform extends the capabilities of traditional CAT tools and methods by enabling tolerance analysis of assemblies which are dependent on iii the effects of loads. The ability to accommodate the effects of loading in tolerance analysis allows for an increased level of capability in estimating the effects of variation on functionality.  The interdisciplinary integration capabilities of the PIDO based platform allow for CAD/E models created as part of the standard design process to be used for tolerance analysis. The need for additional modelling tools and expertise is subsequently reduced.  Application of the developed platform resulted in effective solutions to practical, industry based tolerance analysis problems, including: an automotive actuator mechanism assembly consisting of rigid and compliant components subject to external forces; and a rotary switch and spring loaded radial detent assembly in which functionality is defined by external forces and internal multi‐body dynamics. In both case studies the tolerance analysis platform was applied to specify nominal dimensions and required tolerances to achieve the desired assembly yield. The computational platform offers an accessible tolerance analysis approach for accommodating assemblies subject to loading with low implementation demands. Efficient Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in tolerance analysis and synthesis:  A novel approach is developed for addressing the high computational cost of Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in statistical tolerance analysis and synthesis, with Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) uncertainty quantification. Compared to MC sampling, PCE offers significantly higher efficiency. The feasibility of PCE based UQ in tolerance synthesis is established through: theoretical analysis of the PCE method identifying working principles, implementation requirements, advantages and limitations; identification of a preferred method for determining PCE expansion coefficients in tolerance analysis; and, formulation of an approach for the validation of PCE statistical moment estimates.  PCE based UQ is subsequently implemented in a PIDO based tolerance synthesis platform for assemblies subject to loading. The resultant PIDO based tolerance synthesis platform integrates: highly efficient sparse grid based PCE UQ, parametric CAD/E models accommodating the effects of loading, cost‐tolerance modelling, yield quantification with Process Capability Indices (PCI), optimization of tolerance cost and yield with multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (GA).  To demonstrate the capabilities of the developed platform, two industry based case studies are used for validation, including: an automotive seat <b>rail</b> <b>assembly</b> consisting of compliant components subject to loading; and an automotive switch in assembly in which functionality is defined by external forces and multi‐body dynamics.  In both case studies optimal tolerances were identified which satisfied desired yield and tolerance cost objectives. The addition of PCE to the tolerance synthesis platform resulted in large computational cost reductions without compromising accuracy compared to traditional MC methods. With traditional MC sampling UQ the required computational expense is impractically high. The resulting tolerance synthesis platform can be applied to tolerance analysis and synthesis with significantly reduced computation time while maintaining accurac...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFrom 2012 to 2016, the Tore Supra tokamak was {{upgraded}} in an x-point divertor device {{within the}} frame of the WEST project. A huge design activity was made to modify the whole configuration of Tore Supra including the in-vessel components. Some of the most noticeable changes are the addition of inner divertor coils inside the vacuum vessel and the replacement of all plasma facing components. Fitting all the new components in a previously existing environment {{was probably one of the}} major challenges of the project. To improve the assembly plan and the design of toolings, Virtual Reality (VR) was introduced in the design process. For complex assembly operations, simulations were developed for VR headsets from CAD models. From the requirements expressed by the design team, the VR engineers developed dedicated tools to address the specific issues. Engineers, designers and operators were then able to experience the assembly conditions in a 3 D 360 ° real size immersive environment and interact with the models thanks to a large set of dedicated tools which are developed in the VR lab. This approach showed impressive results for issues such as accessibility, complex kinematics of large components and design of handling tools. It allowed reducing the number of mock-ups and helped the WEST assembly team to reduce the number of unforeseen assembly issues. It was for example used to simulate the assembly of the divertor: insertion through the ports, toroidal displacement on <b>rails,</b> and <b>assembly</b> with gaps lower than 1 mm. Virtual Reality will also provide innovative solutions to help designers in the anticipation of challenges linked to operation of a nuclear facility: operator's training for nuclear maintenance, virtual mock-ups for qualification of maintenance, maintenance scenario optimization with real time simulations [...] . A first module plotting the dose rate is currently being tested. On the one hand, it would for example allow designers to improve the design by adapting maintenance operations to any complex 3 D map of dose rate, and on the other hand, it would permit workers to train for operations in radioactive environments (showing no go areas, hot spots…) ...|$|R

Foreword Modern manufacturing technology is developing towards high speed, precision and modularization. In microelectronics field, the traditional feed system is mainly "rotating servo motor + ball screw" drive mode, which can achieve the highest feed speed of 90 - 120 m/min, with the maximum acceleration only of 1. 5 g. [1] Along with progress of science and technology, linear motion unit of modular design has emerged. Linear motion unit is widely used in modern industry. This is {{a new type of}} mechanical part. It integrated the traditional mechanical drive mechanism and guide mechanism in one and reserves the interface of drive device. This enables the whole mechanical mechanism to be more compact, the drive to be more smoothly and the movement precision to be higher. [2] Structure and working principle of linear motion unit 1. 1 The belt driving, built-in slide rail type unit. As shown in figure 1 : Fig 1 : Belt driving, built-in slide <b>rail</b> type unit’s <b>assembly</b> diagram This is a type of commonly used linear motion unit form. Synchronous belt is driven by the servo motor (in the end of the linear motion unit); then synchronous belt drives sliding table for transmission (the slider on the platform can bear load), and slippery course guides to finish linear transfer. It is suitable for high velocity, high acceleration and low maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} herein {{to determine the}} adequacy with respect to shielding regulations of reference designs for a truck cask containing 2 PWR or 5 BWR assemblies of standard burnup (45 GWd/MTU for PWR, 40 GWd/MTU for BWR) and 1 PWR assembly with extended burnup (55 GWd/MTU). The study also includes reference and modified rail cask designs with projected payloads of 8, 10, or 12 PWR assemblies. The burnup/age trends are analyzed in one dimension for both Pb and depleted uranium (DU) gamma-ray shields. The results of the two-dimensional shielding analysis uphold the one-dimensional results as being an appropriate means of studying the burnup/age trends for the truck cask. These {{results show that the}} reference design for the Pb-shield truck cask is inadequate for all cases considered, while the DU-shield truck cask is capable of carrying the desired payloads. The one-dimensional shielding analysis results for the reference Pb and DU rail casks indicate substantial margins exist in the side doses for reasonable burnup/age combinations. For a Pb-cask configuration, margins exist primarily for long-cooled (15 years) fuel. For the modified Pb and DU rail casks, the 2 -m dose rates offer substantial margins below the regulatory limits for all burnup values considered provided the spent fuel has cooled for {>=} 10 years. The modified Pb and DU casks yield essentially identical results and, hence, could be considered equivalent from a shielding perspective. The criticality analyses that were performed indicate that a truck basket can be designed to provide an adequate subcritical margin for 2 PWR assemblies enriched to 5 wt%. While the 10 - and 12 - <b>assembly</b> <b>rail</b> cask designs are very close to the regulatory limit of 0. 95 for k{sub eff}, after accounting for a 0. 01 {Delta}k bias and 2 standard deviations, the limit is exceeded by about 3 %. It is believed that a combination of decreased enrichments and/or increased water gaps should allow these baskets to be acceptable...|$|R
40|$|The rocket {{launching}} {{facilities were}} inaugurated in 1969 and completed in 1971 at Syowa Station (60 ° 002 ̆ 7 S, 39 ° 352 ̆ 7 E: geomagnetic lat. 69. 6 °S, long. 77. 1 °E). In the rocket range, about 500 m south-west {{of the main}} base: of Syowa, there are three buildings, namely a propellant magazine (10. 4 × 6. Om), a radar-telemeter hut (14. 4 × 6 m) and an assembly shop (12 × 7. 6 m) connected with a turntable. A turntable (8 m in diameter) {{in the center of}} the launching platform is at the same level as the floor of the assembly shop. A rocket carriage can be moved on <b>rails</b> from the <b>assembly</b> shop onto the launching turntable. Rotation of the turntable and movement of the launcher are remote-controlled. An iron-grating box covered with a vinyl sheet is attached to the launcher for keeping the rocket warm. The box is air-conditioned. The rocket is assembled and tested in the assembly shop and transferred to the turntable. The whole launching system is capable of firing a rocket with a diameter up to 350 mm. A radar-telemeter system and the igniter and timer controlers are installed in the radar-telemeter hut. A radar-tracking system with a power of 10 kW is used to measure the azimuth angle, the elevation angle, and the direct range, as well as to record telemeter signals in two channels transmitted by PPM modulation. The receiving frequency of the telemeter system is 290 MHz and the data in 12 channels is recorded. The control system consists of an ignition controller, a timer controller, and a probe controller. These control systems were designed to be operated by a limited number of technicians. There are two types of single-stage sounding rockets, S- 160 JA and S- 210 JA. Their specifications are as follows: [table] Butadiene solid propellant is used from the viewpoint of low temperaturecharacteristics. There is another type of rocket which will be used in the future; S- 310 JA type (payload 40 kg, peak altitude 220 km). These rockets were developed by the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science, University of Tokyo. In order to fire the rockets at the moment when auroral activities begin to show a drastic increase at the onset of an auroral substorm, some considerations were needed in the procedure of the firings in the Antarctic severe natural environment. As a result of many considerations and trainings, the rocket could be fired within one minute after the receiving of the introduction in the rocket launching. The ground-based observations were consolidated at Syowa Station, assisting the direct measurements of physical quantities in auroras by means of the sounding rockets. The instruments to be used in the auroral observations are: all-sky camera (35 mm, every 10 s), auroral zenith photometer (4278 A), multicolour geomagnetic meridian scanning photometers (4278, 5577, 6300 A, H_β), high sensitive TV camera and VHP auroral radar. It was 10 th February 1970 when the first launching of the sounding rocket was carried out at Syowa. Since then, four S- 160 JA type and nineteen S- 210 JA type rockets were flown during the period of the research program in 1970 - 1973. Objects of measurements were electron and ion densities, electric and magnetic fields, infrared and ultra-violet emissions, energetic paticles, X-rays and radiowave in aurora. Through the successful rocket flights, the significant information to reveal the physical nature of auroras was obtained. The present paper mainly reports on the progress of the research program by means of sounding rockets at Syowa Station in 1970 - 1973 concerning the transportation, the construction and maintenance of the launching facilities, arrangements of the rocket firing and tracking and the obtained results of the rocket flights. During the period of International Magnetospheric Study (IMS, 1976 - 1979), the rocket facilities will be reopened and more than twenty sounding rockets (S- 310 JA and S- 210 JA) are scheduled to be launched from Syowa Station...|$|R
