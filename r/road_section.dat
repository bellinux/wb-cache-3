5|$|From 1930 to , the River <b>Road</b> <b>section</b> of NY251 {{overlapped}} with NY35, which initially entered Monroe County on {{the former}} routing of legislative Route15 and continued north to Rochester on current NY383. The southwestern end of NY35 was moved to Mumford , shifting {{the location of the}} overlap to Main Street in Scottsville. The concurrency was replaced with one with NY383 when it supplanted most of NY35 in the early 1940s. On July 1, 1977, NY251 was truncated to begin at the eastern end of its overlap with NY383 in Scottsville. The former routing of NY251 from the west end of the concurrency in Scottsville to Gates became an extension of NY386, which was a simple connector in northern Gates and southern Greece prior to the change.|$|E
5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this <b>road</b> <b>section</b> may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E
5|$|NY35 {{was split}} up into two routes {{in the early}} 1940s. The portion of old NY35 west of Ontario Center Road became NY383 while the Ontario Center <b>Road</b> <b>section</b> became part of an {{extended}} NY350. The extension created an overlap between NY350 and NY33B from Cator Corners to NY33. NY33 was truncated on its east end to downtown Rochester on January1, 1949. As a result, NY33B was redesignated as NY31F. The easternmost leg of the route still overlapped NY350; however, it now followed NY350 south to NY31 in Macedon. NY350 was extended a short distance northward in the mid-1940s to meet the new super two highway carrying US104 between Union Hill and Sodus.|$|E

40|$|For the {{assessment}} of traffic-originated pollutants input into the environmentand their impact on biocenosis, the passive bioindication was used at eight selected <b>road</b> <b>sections,</b> where mapping of epiphytic lichen flora was implemented according to a German (VDI) method.

5|$|The A1 is {{the most}} recent {{in a series of}} routes north out of London to York and beyond. It was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme, comprising existing roads and streets, mostly historic, and later using stretches of purpose-built new roads in what is now the outer London borough of Barnet. The Archway <b>Road</b> <b>section</b> was built by Thomas Telford using Roman cement and gravel, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building. The route closely follows the historic route of the Great North Road, though from 1954 it has diverted round the congested suburbs of Finchley and High Barnet along modern roads constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The A1 route was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. Through the inner boroughs of the City, Islington, and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets; {{when it reaches}} {{what is now the}} outer London borough of Barnet, some stretches of purpose-built new roads were built, and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways. In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with wear and tear on the Archway <b>Road</b> <b>section</b> of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the A1 in London {{originally}} started at Aldersgate Bars, which marked the boundary of the City of London, and followed the Great North Road mail coach route through Barnet; the route was re-designated in 1954 to follow the East Finchley and Barnet by-passes built in the 1920s and 1930s, so within London the coaching route is now mainly only followed when passing through the borough of Islington. During the early 1970s plans to widen the A1 along the Archway <b>Road</b> <b>section</b> were abandoned after considerable opposition and four public inquiries during which road protesters disrupted proceedings. The scheme was finally dropped in 1990.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOvertaking {{accidents}} {{have one}} of the most serious consequences of accidents on German rural roads. The aim of this paper is to determine the infrastructural and traffic related variables which influence the occurrence and consequences of overtaking accidents as well as the overtaking behavior of drivers in order to derive appropriate measures to avoid these serious accidents. In a comprehensive network analysis in five German federal states the most accident-prone <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> with relations to overtaking process were determined. The result was a ranking of 500 rural <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> with the highest accident cost density. On these 500 <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> the configuration of traffic regulation (signs and/or markings) were collected on 2. 235 kilometers of roads and a total of 1, 557 overtaking accidents are directly assigned to the individual road characteristics. Subsequently the road layout of the first 100 accident-prone <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> was reproduced and analyses of the influence of road design parameters (curve radius, sight distance, signs, markings) on overtaking accidents have been carried out. Finally 50 <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> have been selected, on which microscopic accident analyses and analyses of overtaking behavior were carried out. Diverse correlations between operational and infrastructural road characteristics and overtaking accidents and driver behavior were found out. The main deficiencies were established in <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> with insufficient sight distance for overtaking. For the accident-prone <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> a catalogue of measures had been developed. The given recommendations will have beneficial influences on overtaking behavior and their practice will lead to an increase in safety on two-lane rural roads...|$|R

40|$|A SWOV {{database}} of road characteristics; State of affairs and further development. This projects aims {{to develop a}} database to support research into the relation between road safety and infrastructural and traffic characteristics of <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> and intersections. These relations can be described by crash models (Accident Prediction Models, APMs) and also by effect studies. SWOV has made an inventory {{of the characteristics of}} the 80 km/h distributor roads in the Dutch provinces of Gelderland and Drenthe. Such an inventory of the entire Dutch road network was not possible within the given time frame and financial resources. Separate from the SWOV inventory, some provincial road authorities (Limburg, Friesland) and the government have conducted their own inventories and compiled a {{database of}} these. SWOV checked thecompatibility and reliability of these files. Unfortunately differences in how the road characteristics were defined made it impossible to combine these files with the SWOV files. The SWOV road characteristics database now contains road characteristics of intersections and <b>road</b> <b>sections,</b> traffic volumes on <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> and crashes on <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> and intersections of practically all regional 80 km/h roads in the provinces of Drenthe and Gelderland. The characteristics have been examined in their entirety and the database can now be used to carry out analyses. It should be noted here that there are many <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> with relatively few crashes or no crashes at all. This problem becomes larger as disaggregation increases. This can partly be remedied by including more roads in the database, by increasing the length of the <b>road</b> <b>sections</b> or using a different definition of <b>road</b> <b>sections,</b> and/or by carrying out the analysis over multiple years...|$|R

5|$|What is now MD222 was {{originally}} designated MD268. MD 268 {{was replaced by}} a southern extension of US 222 from US 1 at Conowingo to US 40 (now MD 7) in Perryville in 1938. The Susquehanna River <b>Road</b> <b>section</b> of US 222 was transferred from state to county maintenance through a May 8, 1958, road transfer agreement. However, that section was returned to state control through an August 23, 1961, agreement after Cecil County requested it be returned to the state. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved rolling back {{the southern end of the}} US 222 designation from US 40 to US 1 at their April 1995 spring meeting. The Maryland State Highway Administration proposed and AASHTO approved the redesignation of US 222 to MD 222 from US 40 to US 1 in February 1996; however, the new designation had already been enacted officially and marked publicly in 1995. The redesignation did not apply to Aiken Avenue; indeed, Aiken Avenue's designation was changed from US 222 to MD 222 in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Route 124 {{crosses the}} Passaic River and {{runs along the}} border of Millburn, Essex County {{to the north and}} Summit, Union County, coming to a large {{interchange}} with the Route 24 freeway and CR649 (John F. Kennedy Parkway). Here, the route becomes a frontage road for the Route 24 freeway that has two lanes in each direction. The road passes to the south of The Mall at Short Hills before running through the Canoe Brook Country Club. It heads southeast into wooded residential neighborhoods and intersects Union CR657, where the Route 124 frontage road has ramps to Route 24. A short distance later, the route passes an overpass to nowhere that crosses over Route 24 at Brantwood Drive which was closed and walled off. The Route 124 frontage road has since eliminated the intersection at Brantwood Drive. In 2013, City of Summit vacated the 50-foot public right of way of the old <b>road</b> <b>section</b> from Route 124 into the current Brantwood Drive. In a short distance, Route 124 intersects Essex CR608, at which point the route has an eastbound ramp to eastbound Route 24 and a westbound ramp from westbound Route 24. Past this intersection, the Route 124 frontage road along Route 24 ends and the route becomes a two-lane undivided road called South Service Road that closely parallels the north side of Route 24, passing under the Morristown Line. The route heads past businesses and forms the border of Millburn to the north and Springfield Township, Union County to the south, coming to an intersection with CR512 near an interchange with Route 24. There is a direct ramp from westbound Route 124 to Route 24 a short distance to the northwest of this intersection.|$|E
