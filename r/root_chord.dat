25|$|The circle can {{be easily}} used {{to find out the}} common chord {{progression}} for basic keys. The circle of fifths shows every major key with its corresponding minor key (of the Aeolian mode). This can be used as the vi chord in a progression. The V and IV chord can be found by moving clockwise and counterclockwise from the <b>root</b> <b>chord</b> respectively. The corresponding minor keys of the V and IV are the iii and ii respectively.|$|E
500|$|In an October 1974 radio {{interview}} with Alan Freeman, Harrison recalled writing [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] while preparing {{to go to}} bed, and mentioned it as a composition that had come easily to him. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison states that his inspiration for the song was [...] "Japa Yoga meditation", whereby mantras are sung and counted out on prayer beads. Musically, the composition has elements of gospel and rock music; Leng describes it as [...] "gospel-drenched" [...] and cites Harrison's production of [...] "Sing One for the Lord", which Preston recorded with the Edwin Hawkins Singers in early 1970, as a [...] "catalyst" [...] for the new composition. The song opens with a descending guitar riff, later repeated after each chorus, which ends on the melody's <b>root</b> <b>chord</b> of B major.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} musical structure, Simon Leng, Harrison's musical biographer, {{identifies}} [...] "Learning How to Love You" [...] as marking [...] "a new peak of sophistication" [...] in its composer's ballad writing. Continuing {{in the model}} Harrison established with [...] "Something" [...] in 1969, and similar to his melody for early-1970s compositions such as [...] "The Light That Has Lighted the World", the song's verse-choruses feature a chord pattern that descends one semitone on each bar within the <b>root</b> <b>chord</b> of F# major; but, Leng writes, the melody in [...] "Learning How to Love You" [...] is [...] "longer and subtler" [...] than that in [...] "Something". The middle eight further reflects Harrison's [...] "musical erudition", according to Leng, with its [...] "subtle musical colours invoked by chic major ninth chords" [...] common to jazz.|$|E
50|$|Longitudinal {{dihedral}} {{can also}} mean the angle between the zero lift {{axis of the}} wing and tail instead of between the <b>root</b> <b>chords</b> of the two surfaces.

2500|$|The {{wings of}} the two {{aircraft}} are similar in design and construction. [...] Both have spans of 18.0m (59ft1in) and are straight tapered with rounded wing tips, although the Air's taper ratio (wing <b>root</b> <b>chord</b> to tip chord) is higher, resulting a slightly greater aspect ratio. Some later Air 100s have squared-off tips terminated in streamlined [...] "salmons". Both wings use the Göttingen 549 airfoil inboard of the tips, though the Air's roots have a thickened version. [...] They are wooden single spar structures, plywood covered ahead of the spar and fabric covered behind. The Air 100 has slotted ailerons to improve roll rates and, inboard, has Schempp-Hirth parallel-rule airbrakes mounted immediately aft of the main spar; the Weihe's DFS style brakes had never been very effective, largely because their design placed them further aft on the wing where space did {{not allow them to}} open fully.|$|E
2500|$|The {{weight of}} the X-114 was {{more than twice that}} of the X-112, the next {{heaviest}} of the series, but all three shared the same control systems. [...] At each wing tip there was a long, flat bottomed float reaching forward about [...] beyond the wing leading edge, [...] with short, outward leaning winglets in line with that edge and fitted with ailerons. [...] At the rear the fuselage swept upwards to a conventional fin and T-tail, the latter carrying elevators. [...] On the water surface the floats stabilised the X-114 and, in combination with [...] the strong anhedral held the fuselage well clear of the water. X-114 had a pod type fuselage, projecting forward as far as the floats. [...] Seating, in rows of two, accommodated six or seven under multi-section glazing. [...] The pod extended rearwards to about one quarter <b>root</b> <b>chord,</b> its rearmost part unglazed and forming a streamlined pylon for the separately podded, [...] Lycoming O-360 flat four engine. [...] A drive shaft ran rearwards from the engine within a conical fairing to a shrouded, five bladed pusher configuration propeller mounted near mid-chord.|$|E
2500|$|The Feiro Dongó was {{the second}} design of Lajos Rotter in his {{collaboration}} with the brothers Gyula and László Feigl. Rotter aimed to produce a training aircraft of high aerodynamic refinement with a high lift to drag ratio (L/D) which was also stable but responsive to the controls, structurally strong, easy to land and with a good all-round view from the cockpit. An innovative wing design was a key feature. [...] The Dongó was a biplane with wings of very high aspect ratio and modified elliptical plan, thus minimising induced drag. The upper wing had an aspect ratio of 16.9, very high at the time, and both wings had a <b>root</b> <b>chord</b> of only , though the lower was [...] shorter. Both had thick airfoils. [...] The very narrow wings were claimed to provide longitudinal stability, as the centre of pressure could not move far, and further pitch stability was provided by heavy stagger, with the lower wing [...] behind the upper. The two wings were set at different angles of attack, 0° on the lower and 2° on the upper, again {{with the intention of}} improving longitudinal stability [...] To provide roll stability the upper wing had dihedral beyond a short centre section. The latter was supported by a steel tube cabane which had pairs of vertical, kinked struts, faired in the upper part, and a forward, transverse inverted-V, all joined to the upper fuselage. This structure made it possible to vary the upper wing's angle of incidence and the stagger. [...] The wings were 3-ply covered, two spar structures. [...] High aspect ratio, metal covered ailerons were mounted on the lower wings.|$|E
