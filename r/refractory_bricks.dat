25|$|Industrial {{chimneys}} {{are commonly}} referred to as flue gas stacks and are generally external structures, as opposed to those built into the wall of a building. They are generally located adjacent to a steam-generating boiler or industrial furnace and the gases are carried to them with ductwork. Today the use of reinforced concrete has almost entirely replaced brick as a structural component in the construction of industrial chimneys. <b>Refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> are often used as a lining, particularly if the type of fuel being burned generates flue gases containing acids. Modern industrial chimneys sometimes consist of a concrete windshield with a number of flues on the inside.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{trenches}} at launch pad 39A that channels flames {{away from the}} shuttle during lift-off was significantly damaged. The subsequent mishap investigation found that the damage {{was the result of}} carbonation of epoxy and corrosion of steel anchors which held the <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> in place. These had been exacerbated by the fact that hydrochloric acid is an exhaust by-product of the solid rocket boosters. Repairs to the trench were completed before the STS-125 mission's then scheduled launch attempt on 8 October 2008. In fact STS-125 finally launched in May 2009, and in the meantime STS-126 (November 2008) and STS-119 (March 2009) had both been successfully launched from pad 39A.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1840s Sharpe was invited by John Fletcher, his future brother-in-law, {{to build a}} church near Fletcher's home in Little Bolton. [...] Fletcher {{was the owner of}} a coal mine at Ladyshore, Little Lever, {{overlooking}} the River Irwell and the Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal. [...] He had been using the clay which came up with the coal to make <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> for furnaces, and suggested its use for building the church, as it was much cheaper than stone. Sharpe then designed the first church in England to be built, in whole or in part, from this material (terracotta), StStephen and All Martyrs, Lever Bridge (1842–44). [...] As terracotta is commonly used to make plant pots and the like, Sharpe himself called this church, and its two successors, [...] "the pot churches", a nickname that has stuck. [...] The advantages of terracotta were its cheapness, its sturdiness as a building material, {{and the fact that it}} could be moulded into almost any shape. [...] It could therefore be used for walls, towers, arches, and arcades in a church, for the detailed decoration of capitals and pinnacles, and also, as at StStephen's, for the furnishings, such as the altar, pulpit, font, organ case, and the pew ends. [...] Apart from the foundations and the rubble within the walls, StStephen and All Martyrs was constructed entirely from terracotta. [...] The following year, a second church was built using the same material, Trinity Church, Rusholme, south of Manchester (1845–46), built and paid for by Thomas Carill-Worsley, who lived at nearby Platt Hall. [...] In this case, although the exterior is in terracotta, the interior is of plastered brick. [...] The church was consecrated in June 1846, although at the time work on the spire had not yet started and several other features were incomplete, including the heating, seating, and floor tiling.|$|E
2500|$|The chamber {{where the}} body is placed is called a retort and is lined with {{heat-resistant}} <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks.</b> <b>Refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> are designed in several layers. The outermost layer is usually simply an insulation material, e.g., mineral wool. Inside is typically a layer of insulation brick, mostly calcium silicate in nature. Heavy duty cremators are usually designed with two layers of fire bricks inside the insulation layer. The layer of fire bricks {{in contact with the}} combustion process protects the outer layer and must be replaced from time to time. [...] The coffin or container is inserted (charged) into the retort as quickly as possible to avoid heat loss through the top door. The container may be mounted on a charger (motorised trolley) that can quickly insert it, or on a fixed or movable hopper that allows the container to slide into the cremator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Chromite {{is one of}} the {{principal}} ore of chromium in which the metal exists as a complex oxide (FeO. Cr 2 O 3). The prepared chromite can be widely used as refractory in high temperature applications. This study describes the use of local chromite ore as refractory material. To study the feasibility of local chromite, chemical analysis and refractoriness are firstly measured. To produce chromite <b>refractory</b> <b>brick,</b> it is pressed under a press of 400 tons, dried and fired at 1580 ˚C for fifty two hours. Then, the standard properties such as cold crushing strength, apparent porosity, apparent specific gravity, bulk density and water absorption that the chromite brick should possess were measured. According to the results obtained, the brick made by local chromite ore was suitable for use as <b>refractory</b> <b>brick.</b> Keywords—chemical analysis, chromite ore, chromite <b>refractory</b> <b>brick,</b> refractoriness.

5000|$|A fire <b>brick,</b> firebrick, or <b>{{refractory}}</b> <b>brick</b> is a {{block of}} refractory ceramic material used in lining furnaces, kilns, fireboxes, and fireplaces. A <b>refractory</b> <b>brick</b> is built primarily to withstand high temperature, but will also usually have a low thermal conductivity for greater energy efficiency. Usually dense firebricks are used in applications with extreme mechanical, chemical, or thermal stresses, such as {{the inside of a}} wood-fired kiln or a furnace, which is subject to abrasion from wood, fluxing from ash or slag, and high temperatures. In other, less harsh situations, such as in an electric or natural gas fired kiln, more porous bricks, commonly known as [...] "kiln bricks" [...] are a better choice. They are weaker, but they are much lighter, easier to form, and insulate far better than dense bricks.

The calculated values were plotted in the triangle of thermal conductivities of graphite-alumina-pores systems as functions of alumina content and porosity. The thermal conductivity of reflactory brick along perpendicular direction to c-axis of graphite decreases at higher fractions of alumina grains and pores. This calculated result is explained by the decrease of volume fraction of graphite with a higher thermal conductivity.

40|$|In this paper, the {{corrosion}} behaviour of aluminosilicate type refractories in frit melts is {{studied in}} an isothermal corrosion test setup. A <b>refractory</b> <b>brick</b> of largely andalusite and sillimanite composition {{was compared to}} another <b>refractory</b> <b>brick</b> of mullite and sillimanite composition, {{both of which were}} made by different manufacturers for use in different frit furnaces. The industrial frit used for corrosion tests was a commercial product used in a wall tile glaze formulation. Corrosion tests conducted under isothermal conditions provide quantitative and reproducible data about the corrosion performance of refractories. In this study, tests were performed by partially immersing a 15 mm × 15 mm × 115 mm refractory specimen into a frit melt at temperatures between 1404 and 1504 °C. The effects of temperature, duration of exposure and the <b>refractory</b> <b>brick</b> type were investigated using a statistically designed set of experiments. The ANOVA (analysis of variance) table indicated that temperature and test duration were the most important factor effects, as expected. Increasing both temperature and exposure duration led to an increased amount of corrosion as measured by the cross-sectional area loss of the corroded refractory specimen. Postmortem microstructural analysis was also done on the specimens, with extensive amount of ZnO·Al 2 O 3 precipitation observed along the frit-refractory interface, where crystals of mullite and alumina were also found to precipitate. Increasing the amount of exposure time and temperature produced more ZnO·Al 2 O 3 precipitation. As identified by SEM-EDS analysis, mullite crystals were in the needle-like morphology, while alumina crystals were generally cubic. Additional experiments were conducted by rotating the specimens in the melt at 50 rpm of rotational speed. Due to the reduction of boundary layer thickness, more dissolution was observed from the rotated specimens. In all specimens, corrosion was more pronounced in the bond phase than through the large filler grains of mullite and andalusite. TÜBİTAK project number 104 M 40...|$|R
