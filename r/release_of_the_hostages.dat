5|$|The scandal {{began as}} an {{operation}} to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised {{to do everything in}} their power to achieve the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages.</b> Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista, or Contras, in Nicaragua.|$|E

25|$|As {{the crisis}} unfolded, {{attempts}} were made to negotiate the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages.</b> According to declassified diplomatic documents, the Egyptian government under Sadat tried to negotiate with both the PLO and the Ugandan government. PLO chairman Yasser Arafat sent his political aide Hani al-Hassan to Uganda as a special envoy to negotiate with the hostage takers and with Amin. However, the PFLP-EO hijackers refused to see him.|$|E

When Wong confronts Kwon about his treachery, the reporter is tortured with his hands burned with a poker. After Ti Shen arrives, the pilot radios Peking that he will leave at dawn with Michael, but Kwon shoots and kills the pilot, reneging on the deal.|$|R
25|$|After {{repelling}} the Ethiopian attack, the British force moved onto Magdala {{the following}} day. As the British approached, Tewodros released two hostages on parole to offer terms. Napier insisted on <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages</b> and an unconditional surrender. Tewodros refused to unconditionally surrender, but released the European hostages {{over the next}} two days, while the native hostages had their hands and feet amputated before being thrown {{over the edge of the}} precipice surrounding the plateau.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his conflicts with rebels and rivals, Tewodros encountered difficulties with the European powers. Seeking aid from the British government (he proposed a joint expedition to conquer Jerusalem), he became unhappy with {{the behavior of those}} Britons whom he had counted on to advance his request, and he took them hostage and chained them. In 1868, as a British expeditionary force sent from India to secure <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages</b> stormed his stronghold, Tewodros committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{hostage crisis}} of the US embassy in Tehran in November 1979 precipitated a wave of anti-Iranian {{sentiment}} in the United States, against the new Islamic regime and Iranian nationals and immigrants. Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages</b> {{at the start of}} 1981. In response, some Iranian immigrants to the US have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily {{on the basis of their}} ethnic or religious affiliations.|$|E

25|$|From Senafe, Merewether {{sent out}} two letters from Lieutenant-General Napier: one to Emperor Tewodros, {{demanding}} the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages</b> (which Rassam intercepted and destroyed, afraid this ultimatum might enrage Tewodros against the prisoners); {{the other to}} the people of Ethiopia, proclaiming that he was there purely to free the captives and that he had hostile intentions only towards those who sought to oppose him. Napier arrived at Zula on 2 January 1868, and put the finishing touches on his plan of advance before leaving on 25 January for Senafe.|$|E
25|$|On November 4, 1979, a {{group of}} Muslim {{students}} seized the United States Embassy and took the embassy with 52 personnel and citizens hostage, after the United States refused to return Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to Iran to face trial {{in the court of}} the new regime and all but certain execution. Attempts by the Jimmy Carter administration to negotiate for the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages,</b> and a failed rescue attempt, helped force Carter out of office and brought Ronald Reagan to power. On Jimmy Carter's final day in office, the last hostages were finally set free {{as a result of the}} Algiers Accords.|$|E
25|$|On 4 November 1979, Islamist {{students}} {{supporting the}} Iranian Revolution stormed the Embassy of the United States in Tehran and took 53 hostages, including the Marine Security Guards.

An unexpected sandstorm grounded several RH-53 helicopters, as well as scattering the rest, and ultimately killing several when one struck an EC-130 Hercules staged to refuel them. The mission was aborted, and the Algiers Accords negotiated the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages</b> on 20 January 1981.

25|$|In Middle East affairs, Brown {{supported}} President Carter's {{efforts as}} an intermediary in the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations {{leading to the}} Camp David Accords of September 1978 and the signing by the two nations of a peace treaty in March 1979. Elsewhere, {{the fall of the}} Shah from power in Iran in January 1979 eliminated a major U.S. ally and triggered a chain of events that played havoc with American policy in the region. In November 1979, Iranian revolutionaries occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took more than 50 hostages. Brown participated closely in planning for a rescue operation that ended in failure and the loss of eight U.S. servicemen on 2425 April 1980. Not until the last day of his administration, on 20 January 1981, could President Carter make final arrangements for the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages.</b>|$|E
500|$|On January 7, 1986, John Poindexter {{proposed}} {{to the president}} a modification of the approved plan: instead of negotiating with the [...] "moderate" [...] Iranian political group, the United States would negotiate with [...] "moderate" [...] members of the Iranian government. Poindexter told Reagan that Ghorbanifar had important connections within the Iranian government, so {{with the hope of}} the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages,</b> Reagan approved this plan as well. Throughout February 1986, weapons were shipped directly to Iran by the United States (as part of Oliver North's plan, without the knowledge of President Reagan) and none of the hostages were released. Retired National Security Advisor McFarlane conducted another international voyage, this one to Tehran; bringing with him a gift of a bible having a handwritten inscription by Ronald Reagan; and, according to George Cave a cake baked {{in the shape of a}} key. Howard Teicher described the cake as a joke between North and Ghorbanifar. He met directly with Iranian officials associated with Rafsanjani that sought to establish U.S.-Iranian relations in an attempt to free the four remaining hostages. [...] The American delegation comprised McFarlane, North, Cave (a retired CIA agent who worked in Iran in the 1960s–70s), Teicher, an Israeli diplomat Amiram Nir and a CIA translator [...] arrived in Tehran in an Israeli plane carrying forged Irish passports on 25 May 1986. This meeting also failed. Much to McFarlane's disgust, he did not meet ministers, and instead met in his words [...] "third and fourth level officials". At one point, an angry McFarlane shouted: [...] "As I am a Minister, I expect to meet with decision-makers. Otherwise, you can work with my staff". The Iranians requested concessions such as Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which the United States rejected. More importantly, McFarlane refused to ship spare parts for the Hawk missiles until the Iranians had Hezbollah release the American hostages whereas the Iranians wanted to reverse that sequence with the spare parts being shipped first before the hostages were freed. The differing negotiating positions led to McFarlane mission going home after four days. After the failure of the secret visit to Tehran, McFarlane advised Reagan not to talk to the Iranians anymore, advice that was disregarded.|$|E

At the request of the cabinet, he spoke with Amin on the phone many times, trying to gain the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages,</b> without success.

2500|$|One of {{the leading}} {{national}} issues during that year was the release of 52 Americans being held hostage in Iran since November 4, 1979. Reagan won the election.

2500|$|In late 1979 {{a number}} of U.S. hostages were {{captured}} in Iran during the Iranian Revolution.

Carter's rescue attempt was first written about in a Jack Anderson article in The Washington Post in the autumn of 1980. After the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostages</b> on 20 January 1981, mere minutes after Republican challenger Ronald Reagan's inauguration, some charged that the Reagan campaign had made a secret deal with the Iranian government whereby the Iranians would hold the hostages until after Reagan was elected and inaugurated.|$|E
