5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for <b>rail</b> <b>carriages</b> with the grain harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E
25|$|The first {{demonstration}} {{of an electric}} tram in Saint Petersburg occurred on August 22, 1880. Fyodor Pirotsky, an engineer who demonstrated the tram to the public, hoped that the Horsecar Stock Company, which possessed a monopoly on all rail transportation in the city, would consider replacing traditional horse-drawn <b>rail</b> <b>carriages</b> with electric-powered ones. Despite {{the fact that all}} tests were successful, Pirotsky's proposal was dismissed on the grounds that equipping existing tram tracks for electric traction and purchasing or building compatible tram vehicles would be too expensive.|$|E

25|$|Saint Petersburg saw {{the arrival}} of street rail {{transport}} during the 1860s in form of horse-drawn <b>rail</b> <b>carriages.</b> The first, freight-only street railway track was opened in 1854 to serve one of the industrial city suburbs. In 1863, three passenger lines in the city centre came into operation. Several private companies were formed, and the horsecar network eventually expanded to 25 routes covering over 100 kilometres of track. Carrying over two million passengers a year, the street rail network in Saint Petersburg proved a successful commercial venture.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, {{overcrowding}} on Wellington trains {{resulted in}} the recommendation by the Greater Wellington Regional Council to re-introduce two DM/D units, one former Tranz Metro unit stored at Hutt Workshops {{as a source of}} spare parts and another from the Ferrymead Railway. These units entered service from October 2008. With no further DM/D sets available, the two overhauled sets were joined as a short-term measure by six ex-British <b>Rail</b> <b>carriages</b> rebuilt at Hillside Workshops as the SE class and worked in push-pull service by two Toshiba EO class locomotives.|$|E
25|$|From January 1945, Aleksenko {{fought in}} the East Prussian Offensive. By this time, he was a {{squadron}} commander in the regiment. In February, he became the regimental deputy commander.

On 27 April, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for reportedly making 230 successful assault sorties against German troop and equipment concentrations. Aleksenko became the regimental commander. On 29 June, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union again for reportedly making 292 sorties against German fortifications, airfields and troop concentrations. He reportedly destroyed numerous aircraft on the ground, 33 tanks, 118 vehicles, 53 rail cars, 85 <b>rail</b> <b>carriages,</b> 54 anti-aircraft guns, 10 warehouses with ammunition, 27 artillery guns, 12 mortars.

60|$|June 29th.--Yesterday, 28th, I left Liverpool {{from the}} Lime Street station; an {{exceedingly}} hot day for England, insomuch that the <b>rail</b> <b>carriages</b> were really uncomfortable. I have now {{passed over the}} London and Northwestern Railway so often that {{the northern part of}} it is very wearisome, especially as it has few features of interest even to a new observer. At Stafford--no, at Wolverhampton--we diverged to a track which I have passed over only once before. We stopped an hour and a quarter at Wolverhampton, and I walked up into the town, which is large and old,--old, at least, in its plan, or lack of plan,--the streets being irregular, and straggling over an uneven surface. Like many of the English towns, it reminds me of Boston, though dingier. The sun was so hot that I actually sought the shady sides of the streets; and this, of itself, is one long step towards establishing a resemblance between an English town and an American one.|$|E
60|$|Wordsworth is in London, {{having been}} {{commanded}} {{up to the}} Queen's ball. He went in Rogers's court dress, or did I tell you so the other day? And I hear that the fair Majesty of England was quite 'fluttered' at seeing him. 'She had not a word to say,' said Mrs. Jameson, who {{came to see me}} the other day and complained of the omission as 'unqueenly;' but I disagreed with her and thought the being 'fluttered' far the highest compliment. But she told me that a short time ago the Queen confessed she never had read Wordsworth, on which a maid of honour observed, 'That is a pity, he would do your Majesty a great deal of good.' Mrs. Jameson declared that Miss Murray, a maid of honour, very deeply attached to the Queen, assured her (Mrs. J.) of the answer being quite as abrupt as that; as direct, and to the purpose; and no offence intended or received. I like Mrs. Jameson better the more I see her, and with grateful reason, she is so kind. Now do write directly, and let me hear of you [in d]etail. And tell Mr. Martin to make a point of coming home to us, with no grievances but political ones. The Bazaar is to be something sublime in its degree, and I shall have a sackcloth feeling all next week. All the <b>rail</b> <b>carriages</b> will be wound up to radiate into it, I hear, and the whole country is to be shot into the heart of London.|$|E
