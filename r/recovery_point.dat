25|$|In the Creature Stage, {{the player}} has a home nest where {{members of their}} own species are located. The nest is where the player respawns {{following}} death, and acts as a <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> for lost HP. Other species' nests are spread throughout the continent. While interacting with them, the player can choose to be social or aggressive; how the player interacts with other creatures will affect their opinion of the player's species. For instance, by mimicking their social behaviors (singing, dancing etc.), NPC creatures will eventually consider the player an ally, but if the player harms members of their species, they will flee or become aggressive upon sighting them. Epic creatures, which are rare, aggressive creatures more than twenty times the player's height, feature prominently in the Creature Stage. There are also Rogue creatures which may be befriended or attacked. Additionally, spaceships may appear in this stage and abduct a creature.|$|E

500|$|Over the 64 years {{following}} the disappearance of M-24 after the attacks, more than 50 people approached the Royal Australian Navy claiming to have found the submarine. All of these claims {{were found to be}} false. One early theory about the midget's fate was that it was damaged or destroyed, along with M-21, in or around Taylors Bay, which would account for reports from Steady Hour and Yarroma of multiple submarines during their three-hour attack against M-21. [...] A second theory was that the midget attempted to return to the mother submarines but exhausted its battery power before reaching the Port Hacking <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> and would therefore be outside and to the south of Sydney Heads. The third theory was that the midget's crew decided to avoid endangering the five larger submarines during the recovery process, and either ran straight out to sea or headed north.|$|E

500|$|NASA {{announced}} {{the first two}} orbital missions {{at the end of}} November 1961, shortly after the Mercury-Atlas 5 (MA-5) test flight, which had carried a chimpanzee and twice orbited the Earth. MA-6 was planned as the first orbital flight, with John Glenn as the primary crew and Scott Carpenter as his backup. The follow-up mission, MA-7 was to be crewed by Deke Slayton, with Wally Schirra as his backup. In February 1962, the first draft planning began for MA-8, the third orbital mission, with a goal of [...] "six or seven" [...] orbits, as an intermediate step towards a day-long 18-orbit flight. The decision to move to six orbits rather than seven was driven by the mission rules on contingency recovery operations; a seventh orbit would have required significant additional recovery forces to be able to reach the capsule anywhere on its trajectory within eighteen hours. The six-orbit profile had other effects on the recovery plans; the optimum <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> was moved to the Pacific Ocean, rather than the Atlantic.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the repeatability of fusional vergence rangesmeasured using the rotary prisms in the phoropter and in free space using the prism bar. The level of agreement between the two methods was also investigated [...] Methods: In two separate sessions, negative and positive fusional vergence ranges (NFV and PFV, respectively) were measured at distance and near in 61 young adults (mean age 19. 74, S. D. 2. 5 years) who were unfamiliar with the methods used. Base-in and base-out blur, break and <b>recovery</b> <b>points</b> were sequentially determined. Both sets of measurements were obtained by the same examiner. At each distance, NFV was determined first and then PFV. The repeatability of the tests and agreement between measurements made with the phoropter rotary prisms and the prism bar were estimated by the Bland and Altman method. Results: For both the phoropter rotary prisms and prism bar, NFV measurements showed better repeatability than PFV at both near and distance. Mean differences recorded for the NFV break and <b>recovery</b> <b>points</b> were non-significant (under 0. 5 D), while those observed for PFV were generally greater than 2 D. When agreement between the two tests was assessed, it was found that break points were higher when determined using the phoropter rotary prisms, while <b>recovery</b> <b>points</b> were generally higher for the prism bar method. In clinical terms, according to the expected values of the NFV and PFV, agreement between the two techniques can be described as fair, because although mean differences were never greater than 5. 5 D, 95...|$|R

This paper describes impact-factors of timing-jitter in an AWGN channel and discovers that input noise have great influence on it, proposed an improved timing recovery method for adding a loop gain to reduce it. Simulations demonstrate that a timing recovery with loop gain can have performance superior to that of without it, and got the conclusion that add loop gain at the range of 0. 1 to 0. 3 both timing jitter and timing <b>recovery</b> <b>points</b> can reach minimum values. Better yet, when choose a loop gain at 0. 1, timing jitter decrease from ± 0. 2 to ± 0. 08, and system’s error rates also have obverse decrease...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for {{the approximate}} {{calculation of the}} effects caused by a voltage sag in the induction machine supply system. The algorithm computes the current and torque peaks, and the mechanical speed loss for an extensive range of voltage sags. It has a high calculation speed because it makes two simplifications. The first supposes that speed varies insignificantly during the first cycles after the voltage drop and <b>recovery</b> <b>points</b> to solve analytically the electrical transients in these cycles. The second neglects the electrical transient during the sag duration for a quickly evaluation of the speed loss. Machine sensitivity to voltage sags is graphically shown.

The proposal {{is described in}} reference to a specific system. i. e., the MuTEAM prototype developed in Pisa: our requirements was that no erroneous output be generated by the system under a single fault hypothesis. The fault-handling model adopted is based on backward error recovery: the set of all the application processes is partitioned into disjoint subsets (called families), which represent the atomic unit of <b>recovery.</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>points</b> are established on communications among families. A single consistent recovery line is maintained, thereby avoiding the domino effect. The model does not rely on the usage of mass storage devices: rather, the recovery information pertinent to all the processes is kept in the distributed main memory of the system...|$|R

Aerosol exposure of rats to cristobalite for 8 days results in early and sustained alveolar type II cell hyperplasia {{in areas of}} inflammation characterized {{by the presence of}} macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Irregular interstitial fibrosis and coalescence of alveoli are apparent by day 120. The inflammatory response is characterized by increased lavage cell recoveries, principally macrophages and neutrophils. Lavage recoveries of protein, nonpolar lipid, phospholipid, and saturated phosphatidylcholine also are increased. The recovery ratio for two important surfactant phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, is decreased at all points following exposure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{leaching}} of {{a mineral}} {{from the ground}} is considered using injection and recovery holes drilled into the rock. In this simplified analysis, the holes are arranged vertically, and an appropriate caustic leaching fluid is introduced into the uppermost hole. The leaching liquor percolates down through the rock, dissolving the mineral of interest, and is pumped out when it arrives at the second hole. Water is introduced at the bottom hole {{in an attempt to}} increase the feasible recovery fraction of mineral-bearing liquor. The model problem is solved numerically using a boundary-integral formulation. Maximum feasible recovery fractions for the leaching fluid are obtained and their dependence upon the separation distance between the injection and <b>recovery</b> <b>points</b> and upon the pumping rate for water at the bottom hole are studied.
