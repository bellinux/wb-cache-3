40|$|ABSTRACT: Fly ash filled {{vinylester}} resin matrix composites {{were prepared}} with a filler loading of 40 and 50 wt%. The friction and wear behavior of neat resin and fly ash filled composites were studied {{with the help}} of a pin-on-disc wear tester with the composite pin sliding over an abrasive sheet under three different normal loads. Wear behavior was quantified in terms of weight loss, <b>linear</b> <b>wear,</b> and coefficient of friction of the test samples; these were much higher in neat resin compared to composites. Among the composites, a better wear resistance was shown by the 40 % filled composites with a lower <b>wear</b> loss, lesser <b>linear</b> <b>wear,</b> and a minimum value of the coefficient of friction. It was evident that the <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> increased steadily in the case of vinylester resin with increase in sliding distance, whereas <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> was much less and was almost constant in the composites with the increase in sliding distance under all three different normal loads. It was also observed that the difference between the coefficients of friction of the 40 % and 50 % filled composites decreased with the increase in the normal load. The fly ash filled vinylester resin matrix composites were thus found to be much more wear resistant than for neat resin and this behavior can be exploited for various newer applications.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and assess a novel Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) -based method for the measurement of <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> suitable for UKR. Model-based RSA was used to estimate the <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> of polyethylene bearings in UKR. A phantom was used to validate the method using in vitro measured bearing thicknesses and the <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> of ten control bearings was estimated in vivo. Computer aided design (CAD) models for the UKRs were used in the model-based RSA system. There was no statistically significant difference between the estimated and measured bearing thicknesses using the CAD models (p = 0. 386). The precision of the <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> measurement, expressed as the standard deviation of the difference between the estimated and measured bearing thickness was 0. 163 mm. The bias (mean difference) was 0. 030 mm. The use of RSA to measure in vivo wear in a UKR has been shown to be accurate in a phantom, and has been verified with in vivo measured controls.

The Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty employs a spherical femoral component and a fully congruous meniscal bearing to increase contact area and theoretically reduce the potential for polyethylene wear. This study measures the in vivo ten-year <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> of the device, using a roentgenstereophotogrammetric technique. In this in vivo study, seven medial Oxford unicompartmental prostheses, which had been implanted ten years previously were studied. Stereo pairs of radiographs were acquired for each patient and the films were analysed using a roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis calibration and a computer-aided design model silhouette-fitting technique. Penetration of the femoral component into the original volume of the bearing was our estimate of <b>linear</b> <b>wear.</b> In addition, eight control patients were examined {{less than three weeks}} post-insertion of an Oxford prosthesis, where no wear would be expected. The control group showed no measured wear and suggested a system accuracy of 0. 1 mm. At ten years, the mean <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> rate was 0. 02 mm/year.

40|$|The {{conformance}} {{between the}} liner and rings {{of an internal}} combustion engine depends mainly on their <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> (dimensional loss) during running-in. Running-in wear studies, using the factorial design of experiments, on a compression ignition engine show that at certain dead centre locations of piston rings the <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> of the cylinder liner increases with increase in the initial surface roughness of the liner. Rough surfaces wear rapidly without seizure during running-in to promote quick conformance, so an initial surface finish of the liner of 0. 8 μm c. l. a. is recommended. The <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> of the cast iron liner and rings decreases with increasing load but the mass wear increases with increasing load. This discrepancy is due to phase changes in the cast iron accompanied by dimensional growth at higher thermal loads. During running-in the growth of cast iron should be minimised by running the engine at an initial load for which the exhaust gas temperature is approximately 180 °C...|$|R

For this purpose, an adapted ball-on-prism test configuration is used. With the proposed test setup, {{the evolution of}} the coefficient of friction and the surface temperature, as well as, the <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> rate and the weight loss are obtained.

The wear mechanism of casing under impact-sliding work conditions {{has been investigated}} and many experiments have been completed with a newly developed full-scale casing wear test machine. Test results present that adhesion wear, contact fatigue, and grinding abrasion are the main wear mechanisms under impact-sliding test conditions. The friction coefficient and <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> rate of the casing rise obviously {{with an increase in}} impact load. And the larger the impact load, the rougher the worn surface of the casing. The <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> rate decreased slightly but the average friction coefficient increased slightly with an increase in impact frequency under an impact load of 2, 500 N. Both the <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> rate of the casing and the average friction coefficient increased substantially with an increase in impact frequency under an impact load of 4, 000 N. Under lower impact load conditions, grinding abrasion and contact fatigue are the main mechanisms of casing wear; under higher impact load conditions, adhesion wear and contact fatigue are the main mechanisms of casing wear.|$|R

In {{the late}} 1970 s, based on good {{clinical}} results in total hip prostheses, {{the use of}} a combination of alumina ceramics and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) was begun for total knee prostheses (TKPs) in order to reduce UHMWPE wear. In this study, to examine the in vivo efficacy of the alumina ceramic bearing surfaces of TKPs, we compared retrieved alumina ceramic TKPs with cobalt-chrome (Co-Cr) alloy TKPs by surface observations and <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> measurements. In scanning electron microscopic observations, many scratches due to clinical use were observed only on the retrieved Co-Cr alloy femoral components. The damage in the form of scratches on the articulating surface was linear and was produced by rubbing against the Co-Cr alloy surface. The <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> rate of the retrieved Co-Cr alloy TKPs was 0. 027 – 0. 358 mm/year. In contrast, the wear of the retrieved alumina ceramic TKPs was stably low and linear; the <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> rate was estimated to be 0. 026 mm/year. The lower wear rate and milder nature of wear observed in the TKPs with the combination of UHMWPE inserts and alumina ceramic femoral components suggest the possibility of the retention of high performance even during prolonged clinical use...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper details an experimental-numerical approach for the quantitative correlation between wear and end-point deflection in a slide rail. Focusing the attention on slide rail utilized in white-goods applications, the aim is to evaluate the number of cycles the slide rail can operate, under different load conditions, before it should be replaced due to unacceptable end-point deflection. In this paper, two formulations are utilized to describe the wear: Archard model for the <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> and Lemaitre damage model for the non- <b>linear</b> <b>wear.</b> The <b>linear</b> <b>wear</b> gradually reduces the surface of the slide rail whereas the non- linear one accounts for the surface element deletion (i. e. due to pitting). To determine the constants to use in the wear models, simple tension test and sliding wear test, by utilizing a designed and developed experiment machine, have been carried out. A full slide rail model simulation has been implemented in ABAQUS including both <b>linear</b> and non-linear <b>wear</b> models and the results have been compared with those of the real rails under different load condition, provided by the rail manufacturer. The comparison between numerically estimated and real rail results proved the reliability of the developed numerical model, limiting the error in a ± 10 % range. The proposed approach allows predicting the displacement vs cycle curves, parametrized for different loads and, based on a chosen failure criterion, to predict the lifetime of the rail...|$|R
