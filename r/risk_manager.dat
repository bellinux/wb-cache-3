Using a unique data {{set on the}} German terrorist insurance market, the paper tests whether corporate <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> have {{a clear understanding of}} the probability distribution of highly dynamic risks or if <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> learn from severe losses and base their decisions upon day-to-day experience.

For this purpose, we apply Viscusi's prospective reference theory to a corporate context. We find that firms learn from single events when making their risk management decisions, and that <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> become more confident with their risk management decisions over time. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{exploratory}} study into {{the activities of}} corporate <b>Risk</b> <b>Managers</b> in thirty different organisations. The Study identifies {{a wide range of}} activities undertaken by these <b>Risk</b> <b>Managers,</b> although the scope of individual <b>Risk</b> <b>Manager's</b> work can vary significantly. This work often goes beyond insurance management, but is usually concerned with identification of "pure" risks which can adversely affect organisational performance. Objectives associated with the work of <b>Risk</b> <b>Managers</b> are less varied, but the scope of risk management implied by these objectives and their inter-relationships is often not fully operationalised. Other findings from the study suggest that the direction and extent of risk managers' work are dependent on a variety of contextual factors, associated with top management influence, external influences, the nature of the business, corporate developments, and characteristics of the risk management department. These factors need to be considered in any attempts to extend or develop the existing roles of <b>risk</b> <b>managers.</b> Other findings from the Study suggest that the direction and extent of Risk Managers' work are dependent on a variety of contextual factors associated with top management influence, external influences, nature of the business, corporate developments, and characteristics of the risk management department.

During the late 1990 s, negative events related to biotechnology were reported in the UK media. According to the trust asymmetry hypothesis, such events should cause public trust in biotechnology <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> to decline rapidly and rebound slowly. Using Eurobarometer data we show that public trust in <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> declined from 1996 to 1999 but rebounded sharply between 1999 and 2002. Using canonical discriminant analysis we find that trust is correlated with knowledge of science, as well as perceptions of benefits and risks. We also identify distinct categories of people who do not trust—people who distrust <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> but trust other sources of biotechnology information, people who trust nobody, and people who are uncertain about their trust of <b>risk</b> <b>managers.</b> We argue that attention should be placed not only on understanding how to improve trust but also on the nature and characteristics of people who distrust <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> of biotechnology.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} optimal, dynamic {{portfolio and}} wealth/consumption policies of utility maximizing investors who must also manage market-risk exposure using a given risk-management model. We {{focus on the}} industry standard, the Value-at-Risk (VaR) based risk management, and find that VaR <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> often optimally choose a larger exposure to risky assets than non <b>risk</b> <b>managers,</b> and consequently incur larger losses, when losses occur. We suggest an alternative risk management model, based on the expectation of a loss, to remedy the shortcomings of VaR.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{discover}} strengths and limitations of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a risk prioritisation tool for risk management. The study developed a risk management problem and used AHP to organise and structure risks and sub-risks of the problem. It used formative evaluation method with open-ended questionnaires to obtain feedbacks from <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> on AHP. The study documented the following strengths of AHP: it is easy to use and understand, improves understanding of a problem and improve risk assessment. AHP improves risk assessment in the following ways: it provides a systematic risk assessment process, a clear and transparent risk assessment, facilitates debate and discussion of the risk ranking, and assists <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> to make explicit trade-off between the risks and sub-risks. AHP is useful for problems with intangible elements, scarce data or requiring subjective judgements. AHP limitations are: too many pairwise comparisons decreasing <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> concentration and the repetitiveness of the pairwise comparisons resulting in decision fatigue. The consequence, <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> did not answer all questions or just answer the questions randomly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Operational risk {{management}} {{is the process}} of monitoring, evaluating, and changing courses of actions with potential detrimental consequences in real time. In this paper, we extend the decision models proposed in the literature for individual <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> to account for situations where multiple <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> are involved. For this purpose, two dynamic and adaptive preference aggregation models for cardinal and ordinal assessments are proposed and discussed. The mechanical aspects of the models are then validated using field data collected from experienced operational <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> in an individual-expert setting. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the models have enough flexibility to be adapted to account for behavioral considerations. The paper closes with a research agenda.

40|$|Constructive {{critical}} {{discussion of}} risk issues between risk stakeholders should {{improve the quality}} of business decisions. This {{is one of the reasons}} why most financial organisations employ <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> to assist business in such decisions. Role differences between <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> and business decision makers in the decision making processes can be expected to attract people with role-compatible characteristics and personality types. Related personality-based differences in approach to risk-related questions should add to the quality of business decisions. This exploratory study investigated whether the typical personality traits and risk decision making propensity of <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> and business decision makers differ in the personal wealth management division of a large financial services organisation. A three-phased mixed-method exploratory research approach was used to investigate this question. The first phase consisted of 10 semi-structured one-on-one interviews with risk stakeholders at management level in the organisation. The aim of the interviews was to gain an understanding of conflict situations that arose due to risk decision taken. In the second phase, this information was used to design and develop seven scenario-based risk decision making vignettes. In the third phase, a. sample of 138 <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> and decision makers completed the HEXACO PI-R 60 -item personality inventory and the risk decision making vignettes. The application of scenario-based risk decision making vignettes to study risk stakeholder decisions is new to the financial sector. Despite our initial expectations, the personality traits and risk decision making propensity did not significantly differ between the risk and decision making groups. This result indicates that unfounded expectations of difference in approach between risk role-players may give management a false sense of comfort that <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> are effectively challenging risk decisions taken by business decision makers. The research findings have implications for risk management and recruitment practices for organisations that rely on <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> making a valuable contribution to business decisions.

40|$|Abstract: During {{the late}} 1990 s {{a series of}} {{negative}} events occurred in the United Kingdom (UK) related to biotechnology. These events signaled potential risks associated with biotech foods and crops and were highly reported. According to the trust asymmetry hypothesis, such events ought to cause public trust in <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> of biotechnology to decline rapidly and rebound more slowly. We find, based on data taken from the Eurobarometer surveys conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2002, that public trust in <b>risk</b> <b>managers</b> did decline from 1996 to 1999. However, the level of trust rebounded sharply between 1999 and 2002. Canonical discriminant analysis of public trust is used to reveal possible explanatory factors in this response.
