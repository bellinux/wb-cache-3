Our research question was as follows: How do (1) work hours, (2) rumination and (3) affective well-being unfold for compulsive workers compared with non-compulsive workers across long vacations? In a longitudinal field study, work hours, rumination and affective well-being were assessed in 54 employees 2 weeks before, during and in the first, second and fourth week after a long summer vacation. Working compulsively was assessed 3 weeks before vacation. Work hours decreased during and increased after vacation. Levels of rumination dropped during vacation and remained below baseline until 2 weeks after vacation. Initial differences in rumination between obsessive and non-obsessive workers disappeared during and directly after vacation. Affective well-being rose during vacation and returned to baseline directly after vacation. Increases in affective well-being during vacation as well as decreases after vacation were greater in obsessive workers than in non-obsessive workers. Vacations seem to temporarily offset characteristic differences between obsessive and non-obsessive workers, decrease rumination and improve affective well-being...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} white collar employees' temporary relief strategies to workplace boredom. Building on self-regulation theory we define two responses: engaging in distraction and work indifference. We also investigate whether some individuals are more likely to engage in these strategies than others by considering two employee competencies: time management skills and proactiveness skills. Better understanding <b>employee</b> <b>relief</b> strategies and skills may help managers to remedy boredom problems before serious costs are incurred. We collected data from 166 Dutch white collar employees and analysed their survey responses using SPSS and Partial Least Squares (PLS) modelling. Findings indicate that workplace boredom is associated with engaging in distraction. Less consistent results were obtained with regard to work indifference. We find compelling results on the effectiveness of two moderating conditions; proactiveness skills affect the relationship between boredom and work indifference, and time management skills weaken the association between workplace boredom and engaging in distractive behaviour. We consequently conclude that organizations may benefit most from employees with high time management skills, as these employees are less prone to engaging in distraction as a result of workplace boredom.

The aim of this work is to model the real impact of legislative changes in the Czech Republic on the actual tax burden of employees with different incomes and propose optimal solution of tax calculation. The modelling is based on data containing gross salary, applicable tax allowances and tax <b>reliefs</b> for each <b>employee</b> of concrete production company in 2012. For the other years, the data are modelled from the given set using inflation. For comparison of the actual tax burden I use the effective tax rate, implicit tax rate and net implicit tax rate. The results of the calculations show that the tax deductions and the minimum and maximum base for social and health security contributions have the biggest effect on the tax rate. In the absence of tax deductions, the real tax burden for most employees according to the effective tax rate would have been almost constant over time. In fact, {{in terms of the}} effective tax rate the tax burden has declined slightly thanks to an increase in tax deductions. The results also show that the biggest differences in tax burden among employees are due to the (non) application of tax deductions...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the process of automation and rationalization processes of the recent years in libraries on human resources management and personnel situation. The focus of the study is on the RFID technology, because she contains a great potential for rationalization and her effects are still underexplored. More and more libraries look on the assignment of new and especially IT/based technology as a chance to improve and expand their services. Especially in connection with actions of consolidation and the associated need for budget cuts of states, municipals and funding bodies, many libraries view automation and assignment of repetitive tasks on the users as an opportunity to satisfy the growing user demand and borrowing figures with a stagnating or even shrinking workforce. The basis for this analysis provided as well evaluations of reviews and publications about the topic as interviews of some selected innovative scientific and public libraries from the german speaking regions. All interviewed libraries showed a high degree of automation and already used one or more modules of RFID technology. Therefore the author, because of the limited timeframe of the project, only could interview a few chosen libraries, the overall results of the survey cannot be seen as representative and can in individual cases, dependent on type of libraries, size of libraries, funding bodies and region. In the present project report will basic conditions, causes and motives for the automation of workflows be explained and some essential types of rationalization of the last years recorded. Also will be work areas listed, in which the rationalization process takes place. Based on the factual material advantages and disadvantages of the process of automation will be analyzed. While improvement and expansion of librarian services and <b>relief</b> of the <b>employees</b> from routine works constitute an added value of the process of automation, are job reductions rather part of the negative effects. At the same time the demand for highly qualified personnel growths, because many procedures grow in complexity. In further course the study investigate the changed demand to human resources management in the context with the processes of automation and rationalization processes. Some important management tasks are treated separately, like employee’s motivation and development planning. Under examination will be also some staff police aspects in connection with the RFID/technology, like methods and examples of savings calculations, possibilities and perspectives of the redistribution of freed resources and regrouping of employees. In total is the subject still little researched and needs further studies. In conclusion the authoress attempts to present the thesis, that the rationalizing effect of new technologies and the process of automation should not exclusively used for personnel reduction, but to further develop the librarian services. ...|$|R
40|$| {{stimulation}} of the capital goods industries by orders for construction materials leading to business spending and increased employment. By employing people directly, public works put purchasing power {{into the hands of}} those who will spend money and stimulate business. A third way is by reducing the cost of living and making money buy more, a fourth way is by offsetting the lack of purchasing power caused by over-saving. The fifth way lies in the curtailment of public construction in time of boom so that the height of the boom will be lowered and the amount of adjustment needed in the ensuing depression lessened. Before public works can effectively bring recovery certain conditions are necessary: Projects must consist of regular public work and not "made" or "relief" work. Heavy construction is generally recommended although some lighter construction work and non- construction work is permitted. Financing of the public works programs must be of borrowing or a reserve fund, and Federal aid to cities and states is necessary; self-liquidating projects are to be avoided. Conditions of employment must be favorable. Wages must be standard; hours sufficient to enable workers to earn almost as much as in normal private employment, workers should be hired through public employment exchanges, work should be adapted to the aptitudes of previous training of tax seekers of employment. Efficiency of the workers is necessary. The proper timing of the expansion or curtailment of public works is essential. The proper time to begin construction seems to be just after a certain amount of liquidation has occurred and before the cumulative forces of depression have grown {{to such an extent that}} there is widespread unemployment. Contraction of public construction should come when prices have risen too high in comparison with other years, credit conditions are stringent, overtime prevails in industry, and costs are high. To be able to effect proper timing there must be advance planning of public works programs, the coordination of public construction agencies, a single public works agency, and international cooperation. The main criticisms of the theory relate to the diversion of money from private business, increased taxes, waste in public work, and the question of occupational shifts. Such criticisms have been answered by public works theorists. Public works expansion in time of depression is desirable for reasons not related to the recovery of business. Idle men, machinery, plants, and money mean waste if not utilized. Savings in construction costs arise from lower prices of materials, lower borrowing charges, lower contractors' bids, and tne greater efficiency of workers. Moreover, public work is preferable to the dole. The New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt gave the theory of public works as a recovery measure a real chance to operate. In the Public Works Administration program the theory was almost embodied in its entirety. In the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Civil Works Administration, the Emergency Work Relief program and the Works Progress Administration programs some of the conditions considered essential to the successful working of the theory were present but several were absent. The FERA improved the public works programs of the cities and states and rendered financial assistance. The program as a whole, however, aimed too much at "relief". Projects were sometimes of questionable value. Earnings of workers were inadequate. The decentralized administrative organization was weak in many respects. The EWR improved the nature of the early FERA. The CWA was a better program than the FERA and EWR. Projects were of a more permanent and useful nature and were more diversified. Earnings at first were higher. The centralized administrative organization worked well, A great number of the unemployed were absorbed and business was stimulated to a noticeable degree. The program was less of the "relief" type as employees did not need to have relief status, and it aimed decidedly at stimulating business as well as relieving distress from unemployment. The WPA was in general a better program than the CWA. It profited from the mistakes of the latter, the FERA, and the EWR, The projects were planned better and more permanent as well as greatly diversified. Earnings, however, were inadequate, and this fact, along with the requirement of <b>relief</b> status for <b>employees,</b> placed the program in the glorified "relief" class. The PWA stood in marked contrast to the other New Deal public works programs. In it was embodied the closest approximation to the ideal public works program advocated by public works theorists that this country ever witnessed. The goal of the program was the recovery of business through the {{stimulation of}} the capital goods industries. The projects were of the heavy construction type which involved a lot of indirect employment - for every two men employed at the construction site five were employed providing materials and transporting them. Moreover, these projects were permanent and useful. The loans and grants met a great need of cities and states. The conditions of employment were excellent. Public employment exchanges were utilized, wages were standard. Hours were almost those prevailing in private industry. Workers were efficient and there was no relief status requirement. The administrative organization, at first too centralized, later represented a good balance between extreme centralization and extreme decentralization. If the PWA had only been put into operation on a larger scale, the recovery of business might have come sooner than it did. It is difficult to state with any great accuracy the relation of government spending to the recovery and recession of business 1933 - 1937. Studies by the economist Arthur D. Gayer have led to the conclusion that the rise in national income 1934 - 1937 could be imputed almost entirely to government spending. This conclusion has been reached by the economist Joseph Schumpeter and also by the seven Harvard and Tufts economists. It does not seem illogical to connect the increase in national income with the recovery of business. The increase in business deposits has been taken by Dr. Lauchlin Currie as indication of the importance of government spending in the recovery of business. Dr. Currie saw that the income of business from the sale of its products exceeded the outgo in the form of wages, dividends, and other payments to factors of production, and concluded that the source must have been the net-income-increasing expenditures of the government. The seven Harvard and Tufts economists stressed a valuable contribution of government spending to recovery. They said that such spending stimulated expenditures by manufacturing and mining concerns. The recession of the fall of 1937 was caused immediately by the curtailment of government spending early in 1937, The basic cause, however, was the failure of business spending to occur in a sufficient enough degree to offset the drop in government spending. The causes for the failure of business to spend have been attributed by eminent economists to the undermining of business confidence oy the Federal Government, and the lack of outlet for investment funds. Facts have pointed to an excess of savings so that the income of business does not equal the outgo. This recession brought a change in the theory of public works as a recovery measure. If it is a fact that private business spending is necessary for the maintenance of the economic good health of the United States and forces prevail which deter such spending, the Federal Government with the aid of the city and state governments must spend. The role of public works changes from an intermittent one to a permanent one. If, however, private business spending again occurs so as to make unnecessary permanent government spending, the role of public works can again be as it was when Shillady, Hard, Mallery and other public works theorists of the 20 's wrote - an instrument in stimulating recovery from depressions. Our present economic system seems to be inherently unstable and private business is subject to periodic depressions from the morass of waich government spending must rescue it. [URL]...|$|R
