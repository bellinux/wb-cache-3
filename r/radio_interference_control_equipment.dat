40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} an {{interference}} model for cognitive radio (CR) networks employing power control or contention control scheme. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the interference received at a primary receiver from a CR network are derived for two cases. For the first case, a power control scheme is proposed {{to govern the}} transmission power of a CR node. For the second one, a cognitive media access control (MAC) employs {{carrier sense multiple access}} with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) based contention control to coordinate the operation of CR nodes with transmission requests. These two control schemes are compared in terms of their resulting interference distributions. It is demonstrated that both power and contention controls are effective approaches to alleviate the interference caused by CR networks. Some in-depth analysis for the impact of key parameters on the interference of CR networks is given via numerical studies as well.

40|$|Abstract—Radio {{interference}} {{should be}} taken into account to assign time slots to links in time division multiple access (TDMA) -based wireless mesh networks. In many graph theory-based time slot assignment algorithms, the protocol interference model is widely used to obtain <b>radio</b> <b>interference</b> information, although this model is considered to be inaccurate when compared with actual <b>radio</b> <b>interference.</b> On the other hand, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio model (SINR model) is a well-known and accurate model of <b>radio</b> <b>interference.</b> However, the SINR model requires time slot information to obtain <b>radio</b> <b>interference</b> relationship, and thus it is difficult to apply the SINR model to graph theory-based time slot assignment algorithms. In this paper, we extend the protocol interference model to represent <b>radio</b> <b>interference</b> more accu-rately for wireless mesh networks. To do this, we adjust the interference ratio parameter of the protocol interference model by considering SINR. We propose three methods for adjusting this parameter. Through simulation, it is shown that higher accuracy of the protocol interference model can be achieved by adjusting the interference ratio parameter for each node.

40|$|Abstract: Ad hoc {{wireless}} {{networks have}} enormous commercial and military potential {{because of their}} self-organizing capacity and mobility support. However, some specificities of these net-works such as <b>radio</b> <b>interferences</b> and limited resources make more complex the quality of service (QoS) support. Indeed, on the one hand, the bandwidth offered to users is strongly affected by <b>radio</b> <b>interferences.</b> On the other hand, flooding information in such a network must be optimized {{in order to save}} resources. Therefore, we propose in this paper, a solution taking into account <b>radio</b> <b>interferences</b> in mobile ad hoc network routing and optimizing flooding. This solution is based on {{a modified version of the}} OLSR routing protocol that considers bandwidth requests and <b>radio</b> <b>interferences</b> in the route selection process while providing a very efficient flooding. A comparative performance evaluation based on NS simulations shows that despite the overhead due to QoS management, this solution outperforms classical OLSR in terms of QoS perceived by the users (e. g. bandwidth amount granted to a flow and delivery rate). The efficiency of the optimized flooding is equal to that provided by the native version of OLSR...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{sense of}} {{presence}} {{is an important}} aspect of interaction with virtual reality applications. Earlier we suggested that presence can depend on cognitive control. The latter is a set of meta-cognitive processes which are responsible for configuring the cognitive system for the accomplishment of specific tasks with respect to a given context. In particular, cognitive control helps in preventing interference from the task-irrelevant variables. Objective. is study aimed at investigation of the possible relationship between <b>interference</b> <b>control</b> and aspects of presence. Design. Thirty-nine subjects (32 female and 7 male, aged 18 to 27 years) participated in the study. The subjects were assessed via a battery of <b>interference</b> <b>control</b> tasks (Flanker Task, Go/No Go task, antisaccade task) and performed a virtual scenario (navigating within an array of randomly placed virtual digits in correct numerical order) in high-immersion (CAVE) and low-immersion (standard computer display) virtual environments. Afterwards, the subjects completed a Russian version of the ITC-Sense of Presence inventory. Results. We found that <b>interference</b> <b>control</b> is generally related to the sense of presence, especially in the CAVE (high-immersion) environment. Sensory <b>interference</b> <b>control</b> was most strongly associated with various aspects of presence (overall presence score, spatial presence, and emotional involvement). Motor <b>interference</b> <b>control</b> was associated with spatial presence and emotional involvement, but this relationship was weaker than was the case with sensory <b>interference</b> <b>control.</b> Low-immersion virtual environments attenuate some of these links between <b>interference</b> <b>control</b> and presence so that only sensory <b>interference</b> <b>control</b> remains a notable predictor of presence. Conclusion. <b>Interference</b> <b>control</b> is positively associated with presence in virtual environments with varying immersion levels. is may reflect a more general cause-and-effect relationship between cognitive control and the feeling of presence in virtual reality...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} <b>interference</b> <b>control</b> in adolescents with Mild to Borderline Intellectual Disability (MBID) by addressing two key questions.

Four groups of adolescents with and without MBID and/or BD performed the Eriksen flanker task, requiring participants to respond to a central target while ignoring interfering flanking stimuli.

We found pronounced effects of MBID but not BD on flanker <b>interference</b> <b>control.</b> In contrast, we observed pronounced effects of BD, but not MBID, on the BRIEF. In addition, flanker interference scores and BRIEF scores did not correlate.

In contrast, adolescents with BD are not characterized by deficits in <b>interference</b> <b>control</b> but do show elevated ratings of deficits in everyday executive function...|$|R
