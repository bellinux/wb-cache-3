25|$|Restriction endonucleases, {{also known}} as {{restriction}} enzymes are enzymes that cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA at specific nucleotides sequences that are usually four to six nucleotides long. Studies performed by Horton and colleagues {{have shown that the}} mechanism by which these enzymes cleave the DNA involves base flipping as well as bending the DNA and the expansion of the minor groove. In 2006, Horton and colleagues, x-ray crystallography evidence was presented showing that the <b>restriction</b> <b>endonuclease</b> HinP1I utilizes base flipping in order to recognize its target sequence. This enzyme is known to cleave the DNA at the palindromic tetranucleotide sequence G↓CGC.|$|E
500|$|After {{the stages}} of resection, strand {{invasion}} and DNA synthesis, the DSBR and SDSA pathways become distinct. [...] The DSBR pathway is unique in that the second 3' overhang (which {{was not involved in}} strand invasion) also forms a Holliday junction with the homologous chromosome. [...] The double Holliday junctions are then converted into recombination products by nicking endonucleases, a type of <b>restriction</b> <b>endonuclease</b> which cuts only one DNA strand. The DSBR pathway commonly results in crossover, though it can sometimes result in non-crossover products; the ability of a broken DNA molecule to collect sequences from separated donor loci was shown in mitotic budding yeast using plasmids or endonuclease induction of chromosomal events. Because of this tendency for chromosomal crossover, the DSBR pathway is a likely model of how crossover homologous recombination occurs during meiosis.|$|E

40|$|Orthodox Type IIP <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases,</b> {{which are}} {{commonly}} used in molecular biological work, recognize a single palindromic DNA recognition sequence and cleave within or near this sequence. Several new studies have reported on structural and biochemical peculiarities of restriction endo-nucleases that differ from the orthodox in that they require two copies of a particular DNA recognition sequence to cleave the DNA. These two sites requir-ing <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases</b> belong to different subtypes of Type II <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases,</b> namely Types IIE, IIF and IIS.

2500|$|The {{cloning vector}} is {{treated with a}} <b>{{restriction}}</b> <b>endonuclease</b> to cleave the DNA at the site where foreign DNA will be inserted. The restriction enzyme is chosen to generate a configuration at the cleavage site that {{is compatible with the}} ends of the foreign DNA (see DNA end). Typically, this is done by cleaving the vector DNA and foreign DNA with the same restriction enzyme, for example EcoRI. Most modern vectors contain a variety of convenient cleavage sites that are unique within the vector molecule (so that the vector can only be cleaved at a single site) and are located within a gene (frequently beta-galactosidase) whose inactivation can be used to distinguish recombinant from non-recombinant organisms at a later step in the process. To improve the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant organisms, the cleaved vector may be treated with an enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) that dephosphorylates the vector ends. [...] Vector molecules with dephosphorylated ends are unable to replicate, and replication can only be restored if foreign DNA is integrated into the cleavage site.|$|E

50|$|Restriction endonucleases come {{in several}} types. A <b>restriction</b> <b>endonuclease</b> {{typically}} requires a recognition site and a cleavage pattern (typically of nucleotide bases: A, C, G, T). If the recognition site {{is outside the}} region of the cleavage pattern, then the <b>restriction</b> <b>endonuclease</b> is referred to as Type I. If the recognition sequence overlaps with the cleavage sequence, then the <b>restriction</b> <b>endonuclease</b> restriction enzyme is Type II.|$|E
50|$|Type IIB {{restriction}} enzymes (e.g., BcgI and BplI) are multimers, containing {{more than}} one subunit. They cleave DNA {{on both sides of}} their recognition to cut out the recognition site. They require both AdoMet and Mg2+ cofactors. Type IIE <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases</b> (e.g., NaeI) cleave DNA following interaction with two copies of their recognition sequence. One recognition site acts as the target for cleavage, while the other acts as an allosteric effector that speeds up or improves the efficiency of enzyme cleavage. Similar to type IIE enzymes, type IIF <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases</b> (e.g. NgoMIV) interact with two copies of their recognition sequence but cleave both sequences at the same time. Type IIG <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases</b> (e.g., Eco57I) do have a single subunit, like classical Type II restriction enzymes, but require the cofactor AdoMet to be active. Type IIM <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases,</b> such as DpnI, are able to recognize and cut methylated DNA. Type IIS <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases</b> (e.g., FokI) cleave DNA at a defined distance from their non-palindromic asymmetric recognition sites; this characteristic is widely used to perform in-vitro cloning techniques such as Golden Gate cloning. These enzymes may function as dimers. Similarly, Type IIT restriction enzymes (e.g., Bpu10I and BslI) are composed of two different subunits. Some recognize palindromic sequences while others have asymmetric recognition sites.|$|R

40|$|The {{utility of}} <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases</b> {{as a tool}} in {{molecular}} biology is in large {{part due to the}} high degree of specificity with which they cleave well-characterized DNA recognition sequences. The specificity of <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases</b> is not absolute, yet many commonly used assays of biological phenomena and contemporary molecular biology techniques rely on the premise that restriction enzymes will cleave only perfect cognate recognition sites. In vitro, mispaired heteroduplex DNAs are commonly formed, especially subsequent to polymerase chain reaction amplification. We investigated a panel of <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases</b> to determine their ability to cleave mispaired heteroduplex DNA substrates. Two straightforward, non-radioactive assays are used to evaluate mispaired heteroduplex DNA cleavage: a PCR amplification method and an oligonucleotide-based assay. These assays demonstrated that most <b>restriction</b> <b>endonucleases</b> are capable of site-specific double-strand cleavage with heteroduplex mispaired DNA substrates, however, certain mispaired substrates do effectively abrogate cleavage to undetectable levels.
