25|$|Most jurisdictions permit rear {{fog lamps}} to be {{installed}} either singly or in pairs. If a single rear fog is fitted, most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side {{in the country in}} which the vehicle is registered. This is to maximize the sight line of following drivers to the <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp.</b> In many cases, a single reversing lamp is mounted on the passenger side of the vehicle, positionally symmetrical with the rear fog. If two {{rear fog lamps}} are fitted, they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle's centreline.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe {{and other}} {{countries}} adhering to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be equipped {{with one or two}} bright red [...] "rear fog lamps", which serve as high-intensity rear position lamps to be turned on by the driver in conditions of poor visibility to make the vehicle more visible from the rear. The allowable range of intensity for a <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> is 150 to 300 candela, which is within the range of a U.S. stop lamp (brake light). Rear fog lamps are not required equipment in the U.S., but they are permitted, and are found almost exclusively on European-brand vehicles in North America. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, MINI, Land Rover, Porsche, Saab and Volvo provide functional rear fog lights on their North American models. Some vehicles from non-European brands which are adaptions of European-market offerings, such as the first generation Ford Transit Connect, come standard with rear fog lights, or vehicles with European market counterparts, such as the second generation Chrysler 300, have an option for them. The final generation Oldsmobile Aurora also had dual rear fog lights installed in the rear bumper as standard equipment.|$|E

L200 Miras produced for Japan had no rear fog lamps, when sold in the United Kingdom (where Japan spec Miras were also available) they had a <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> mounted on the right hand side. Despite the Mira badge mostly being available in Right Hand Drive markets, left hand drive Mira-badged L201's were sold in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, Federal {{lighting}} regulations required headlamps of {{sealed beam}} construction and standard {{size and shape}} on all vehicles, so Accords in North America were equipped with four rectangular headlamp units rather than the aerodynamic composite replaceable-bulb units used on Accords sold outside North America (note European specification imagery). Other Automotive lighting variations included amber front and red rear side marker lights and reflectors in North America, and headlamp washers and a red <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> for European markets. Japanese-market Accords were unique from all other markets in that they included adjustable ride height control and side view mirrors installed on the mid-forward fenders.|$|E

50|$|The E Grade is a medium-class variant {{up a notch}} {{from the}} J Grade but is {{positioned}} lower than the G Grade. In comparison to the J Grade, the E Grade features a keyless entry with TDS, an option between dark grey or ivory-coloured seat fabrics, optional driver and front passenger SRS airbags, front and <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> 15-inch sports alloy rims and side moulding.|$|R
5000|$|The European model Corolla four-door sedan, three- and five-door hatchbacks, and {{the regular}} wagon {{basically}} has {{the front end}} of the Japan-spec Corolla FX, except for the all white clearance lights and the [...] "TOYOTA" [...] or the ellipse emblem instead of the [...] "FX" [...] or [...] "GT" [...] of the Japanese models. It has the standard side marker lights and the tail light with the integrated <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> (except for the wagon, which has the <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> on the tailgate.) European market Corollas also have headlight washers on the XL and the XLi models. The five-door liftback used the Japanese market Sprinter Cielo body in its entirety, although in Europe it was available with the little 1.3 liter engine as well. The second generation Sprinter Carib was also sold as a Corolla in Europe, where it replaced the Tercel Wagon. This little four-wheel drive station wagon received the [...] "Touring" [...] suffix in most European markets. The hatchback, representing the most popular and most closely contested market segment in Europe, suffered from being somewhat of a design afterthought. As opposed to its European competitors, where hatchbacks received a tacked-on trunk to become sedans (à la Ford's Orion, the Volkswagen Jetta, or the Opel Kadett sedan), the Japanese hatchback was derived from the sedan. As a result, the design was a bit truncated and trunk space was minimal at 281 L. This was only a fraction more than the much smaller Citroën AX, and considerably less than for competitors such as the Kadett and Fiat Tipo (390 and 345 L).|$|E
50|$|Other safety {{features}} include an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) to avoid skidding {{in the event}} of sudden emergency braking and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) to ensure that the correct amount of braking power is sent to the correct wheels according to the current weight distribution of the car. Two front airbags and pre-tensioner seat belts are installed for the front passengers. However, Exora models sold in Australia come with four airbags and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) in addition to the above. In the end of January 2015, the facelifted Exora Bold known as Exora Bold MC2 in Malaysia finally getting standard ESC, 4 airbags, reverse camera, <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp,</b> plus DRL for the top variant just like the Australian version.|$|E
50|$|On the outside, the SE30 {{differed}} from other Diablo models with a revised front fascia featuring straked brake cooling ducts and a deeper spoiler, while the rear cooling ducts were {{changed to a}} vertical body-colored design. The raging bull emblem was moved {{from the front of}} the luggage lid to the nose panel of the car between the front indicators. The engine lid had slats covering the narrow rear window, while a larger spoiler was installed as standard equipment. The single <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> and rear backup lamp, which had been on either side of the rear grille, were moved into the bumper; this change would be applied to all Diablo models across the lineup. Completing the exterior variations were special magnesium alloy wheels, SE30 badging, and a new metallic purple paint color (this could be changed upon request).|$|E

50|$|The Suprima is {{the second}} Malaysian-made car to be factory-fitted with LED {{position}} lamps {{and the first to}} be offered with LED Daytime running lights (DRL). The LEDs built into the projector headlights on the Suprima Executive trim are identical to those of the Prevé, whereas those on the Suprima Premium variant are true LED DRLs. The LED DRLs may improve the visual appeal of the Suprima, but more importantly help in improving road safety by increasing the conspicuity of the car during daylight conditions. The inclusion of daytime running lights on passenger cars are not compulsory in Malaysia, but they are mandatory equipment for all passenger cars marketed in European Union member states as of 7 February 2011 under the EU Directive 2008/89/EC. The Suprima also features a <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> which is mounted centrally on the rear diffuser, bringing the car up to ECE R38 compliance. Additionally, the rear lights on the Suprima feature guide lights, another first for Proton. The side view mirrors which sport built-in LED turn signal lights have remained physically unchanged over the Prevé's. However, both mirrors now fold and unfold automatically in the Premium trim, whereas in the Executive line, manual user input is required, though both mirrors are still fully electric in nature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In dense fog, the {{visibility}} of a vehicle's rear lamps is of fundamental importance. However, few studies have addressed {{the visibility}} of rear fog lamps in daytime fog. The present study evaluates the contrasts of tail lamps, brake lamps and rear fog lamps. An experiment was performed in 2001 at a parking lot on Mt. Fuji Parkway in Japan. A vehicle equipped with a data-recording system {{was used as the}} data measurement station. Luminance, illuminance and transmissivity in fog were simultaneously recorded at intervals of 2 minutes. Three types of tail lamp, three types of brake lamp and two types of <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> were used, with an observation distance of 50. 0 m. The recorded data showed the background luminance in fog to be affected by illuminance and transmissivity in the daytime. A multiple regression model was applied to determine the background luminance. Contrasts were calculated using this model. Tail lamp visibility was low in deep fog in daytime. Under the same conditions, the rear fog lamps had higher visibility than both the tail lamps and the brake lamps. It was found that the rear fog lamps could provide sufficient visibility in daytime fog...|$|E

25|$|The only {{significant}} export {{market for the}} Falcon outside of Oceania has been South Africa, but was dropped in the early 2000s. (In the early 1970s, the Falcon XY had been assembled in South Africa as the Fairmont, before being fully imported.) Some limousines and hearses (inc. LPG-only powered Utes) were exported to the UK by Coleman Milne, who used to convert European-made Granadas and Scorpios for the same purposes. Earlier, some XA and XB Fairmonts were shipped to the UK as was the contemporary LTD which was modified with Ford Europe tail lights to add the mandatory <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> and also had to have new screenwash nozzles as the protruding original items did not meet EU safety rules.|$|R
40|$|The {{weather has}} an {{influence}} on road safety. Weather conditions partly determine the road conditions and the driver's behaviour. Most studies into the relation between weather and road safety are about the situation during rainfall. However, many other weather conditions are serious influences: fog, snow and black ice, low sun, hard wind, and high temperatures. Studies, mainly abroad, have produced data about the influence of these weather conditions on the crash risk. Various measures have been taken to increase road safety, such as compulsory <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> porous asphalt, and the introduction of slipperiness warning systems. However, the studies which were carried out do not make it possible to infer the effectiveness of these measures. Nor is it certain whether the results of these studies can also be applied to the Netherlands...|$|R

On the middle console there are a few switches for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> the <b>rear</b> window defroster and rear window wiper. Next to this is an analog clock by Jaeger instruments; until 1983, after which it was replaced with a digital one. Underneath are the ventilation control levers, one for hot, a second one for cold air intake, and a third to distribute flow to upper or lower vents. The rear cargo area has a capacity of 425 litres (15 cubic feet), largely due to the high-profile at the rear, and it has a leather cover to conceal items from view.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} reviews {{various sources}} {{of evidence in}} an effort to evaluate the safety potential of current and improved front <b>fog</b> <b>lamps.</b> Crash data are reviewed to identify the specific safety consequences of fog, and studies of the visual effects of front <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> are reviewed. Finally, there is a discussion of the likely effects of current and improved front <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> on driver behavior and on overall safety. The conclusions are that there is very little evidence for a safety benefit from current front <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> relative to low beams, that there is little reason to expect {{that there would be a}} safety benefit even from improved lamps, and that, in terms of vehicle lighting, the most promising approach to improving safety in fog would be the use of <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps.</b> In spite of a lack of evidence for safety benefits in <b>fog,</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> are a popular optional form of forward lighting that many drivers apparently value. It may be that their main value is more as supplements to low-beam lighting for all conditions, rather than specifically in fog. Given the uncertainties in our present knowledge about how current <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> and potential new <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> affect vision and safety, it would be beneficial to learn more about those issues before adopting new standards for <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> or retiring the current standards. One approach that seems particularly important would be studies that examine the possibly complex reactions of drivers to <b>fog</b> and <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> in terms of steering behavior, speed control, and decisions about where and when to risk driving in fog. A second area would be to do a more complete analysis than has yet been done of the crash data concerning fog, perhaps focusing specifically on the issue of how fog affects road-departure crashes...|$|R
