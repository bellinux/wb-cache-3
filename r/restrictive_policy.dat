25|$|A person {{holding a}} {{high-ranking}} office within {{one of the}} highest classes of rank automatically received ennoblement for himself, for his wife, and for his legitimate children, and for decades this status was normally hereditable for his patrilineal and legitimate descendants. However, basically all such ennoblements were annulled when King Christian VI, tired of his father's generosity, acceded to the throne in 1730, and only those who received a special recognition after making an application retained their noble status. The office nobility as such was not abolished. Subsequent royal decrees introduced a more <b>restrictive</b> <b>policy,</b> under which noble status dependent on offices was limited to the person concerned, to his wife, and to his legitimate children.|$|E

Also, Swedish immigration policy during the 1930s was, which the responsible politicians admitted, very restrictive against admitting Jewish refugees trying to escape the Nazi terror and mass murder into Sweden, before the deportations of Norwegian Jews began in 1942. Jewish refugees were systematically discriminated against by the immigration authorities compared to other refugees. At {{the end of the}} war and in the post-Holocaust debate Swedish politicians and officials tried excusing their previous <b>restrictive</b> <b>policy</b> toward Jewish immigration by using the Jewish minority in the country as a scape-goat, claiming that the Stockholm Jewish Community or [...] "certain Jewish circles" [...] had been even more restrictive than the Swedish state.|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} whether the implementation of alcohol control policies was associated with changes {{in the incidence of}} road traffic deaths. Design: Ecologic study conducted using an interrupted time series analysis. Full restrictive polices banned alcohol between 6 p. m. and 6 a. m. Most restrictive polices prohibited alcohol between 1 a. m. and 10 a. m. <b>Restrictive</b> <b>policies</b> prohibited alcohol between 2 a. m. and 10 a. m. Moderately <b>restrictive</b> <b>policies</b> banned alcohol between 3 a. m. and 10 a. m. Lax policies prohibited alcohol between 4 a. m. and 10 a. m. Setting: We used data of road traffic mortality in the population of Cali, Colombia from 1998 to 2008. Participants: The population of Cali in 2008 was 2, 184, 753 inhabitants; 47 % were male. Measures: Aggregated daily counts of road traffic deaths. <b>Restrictive</b> <b>policies</b> were compared with lax policies to estimate the effect of reducing hours of alcohol availability using multiple negative binomial regressions. Findings: There was a decreased risk of road traffic mortality in periods when moderately <b>restrictive</b> <b>policies</b> were in effect (IRR = 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 72 – 0. 97, p = 0. 019). There was an even lower risk of road traffic deaths in periods when most <b>restrictive</b> <b>policies</b> were in effect (IRR = 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 58 – 0. 85, p < 0. 001). In motorcyclists, most restrictive (IRR 0. 55, 95 % CI 0. 38 – 0. 81, p = 0. 002) and full <b>restrictive</b> <b>policies</b> (IRR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 29 – 0. 94, p = 0. 032) were associated with decreased risk o...|$|R

Larger clubs can have elaborate staging layouts with multiple stage areas distributed around a club and multiple dancers rotating between them per song. [...] Some strip clubs consider ad-hoc performances on satellite stages, paid for by a customer on a per song basis, a form of private dance. [...] Rules at the satellite stages {{on the main floor}} tend to be the same as the main stage. [...] In some cases, the layout is significantly different allowing more or less access to the customer. [...] If a satellite stage is located in a premium access zone, access to the dancer could be considerably greater since the higher level of service can include a less <b>restrictive</b> <b>policy</b> than enforced on the main floor. Lap dance, peep show, and lingerie modeling clubs might only have satellite stages with pay to play entertainment options on their premises.|$|E

In 1986, credit card company American Express—rival to official sponsor Visa Inc., began a marketing campaign in Asia promoting merchandise from a fictitious [...] "Olympic Heritage Committee," [...] supposedly based in Switzerland. American Express halted the campaign following complaints by the International Olympic Committee, who threatened to denounce the company's actions with ads and media events in which sports ministers and Olympic athletes from the countries involved in the campaign would cut American Express credit cards into pieces, if they did not withdraw the ads. In a follow-up, American Express released ads featuring a photo from the opening ceremony of the 1986 Asian Games held in the same city, captioned [...] "Amex welcomes you to Seoul," [...] which implied that it was a photo of the Olympics' opening ceremony.|$|E

Forced to decide, he decided on the side of expediency, and signed a decree for the departure of Orpheus and Eurydice.

Thus, on the third day of the Infernal Marriage, Pluto found that he had quarrelled with all his family, and that his ancient administration was broken up.

60|$|In {{the absence}} of the direct, we may next try, as in other cases, the {{supplementary}} resource, called in a former place the Indirect Method of Difference; which, instead of two instances differing in nothing but {{the presence or absence of}} a given circumstance, compares two classes of instances respectively agreeing in nothing but the presence of a circumstance on the one side and its absence on the other. To choose the most advantageous case conceivable (a case far too advantageous to be ever obtained), suppose that we compare one nation which has a <b>restrictive</b> <b>policy</b> with two or more nations agreeing in nothing but in permitting free trade. We need not now suppose that either of these nations agrees with the first in all its circumstances; one may agree with it in some of its circumstances, and another in the remainder. And it may be argued, that if these nations remain poorer than the restrictive nation, it can not be for want either of the first or of the second set of circumstances, but it must be for want of the protective system. If (we might say) the restrictive nation had prospered from the one set of causes, the first of the free-trade nations would have prospered equally; if by reason of the other, the second would; but neither has; therefore the prosperity was owing to the restrictions. This will be allowed to be a very favorable specimen of an argument from specific experience in politics, and if this be inconclusive, it would not be easy to find another preferable to it.|$|E
6000|$|But {{during the}} happier years of Mr Pitt, the {{influence}} of the mind of Shelburne may be traced throughout his policy. It was Lansdowne House that made Pitt acquainted with Dr Price, a dissenting minister, whom Lord Shelburne when at the head of affairs courageously offered to make his private secretary, and who furnished Mr Pitt, among many other important suggestions, with his original plan of the sinking fund. The commercial treaties of '87 were struck in the same mint, and are notable as the first effort made by the English government to emancipate the country from the <b>restrictive</b> <b>policy</b> which had been introduced by the [...] "glorious revolution;" [...] memorable epoch, that presented England at the same time with a corn law and a public debt.. But on no subject was the magnetic influence of the descendant of Sir William Petty more decided, than in the resolution of his pupil to curb the power of the patrician party by an infusion from the middle classes into the government of the country. Hence the origin of Mr Pitt's famous and long-misconceived plans of parliamentary reform. Was he sincere, is often asked by those who neither seek to discover the causes nor are capable of calculating the effects of public transactions. Sincere! Why, he was struggling for his existence! And when baffled, first by the Venetian party, and afterwards by the panic of Jacobinism, he was forced to forego his direct purpose, he still endeavoured partially to effect it by a circuitous process. He created a plebeian aristocracy and blended it with the patrician oligarchy. He made peers of second-rate squires and fat graziers. He caught them in the alleys of Lombard Street, and clutched them from the counting-houses of Cornhill. When Mr Pitt in an age of bank restriction declared that every man with an estate of ten thousand a-year had a right to be a peer, he sounded the knell of [...] "the cause for which Hampden had died on the field, and Sydney on the scaffold." ...|$|E
60|$|Suppose {{that the}} {{observer}} makes the luckiest hit {{which could be}} given by any conceivable combination of chances; that he finds two nations which agree in no circumstance whatever, except in having a restrictive system, and in being prosperous; or a number of nations, all prosperous, which have no antecedent circumstances common to them all but that of having a <b>restrictive</b> <b>policy.</b> It is unnecessary {{to go into the}} consideration of the impossibility of ascertaining from history, or even from contemporary observation, that such is really the fact; that the nations agree in no other circumstance capable of influencing the case. Let us suppose this impossibility vanquished, and the fact ascertained that they agree only in a restrictive system as an antecedent, and industrial prosperity as a consequent. What degree of presumption does this raise that the restrictive system caused the prosperity? One so trifling as to be equivalent to none at all. That some one antecedent is the cause of a given effect, because all other antecedents have been found capable of being eliminated, is a just inference, only if the effect can have but one cause. If it admits of several, nothing is more natural than that each of these should separately admit of being eliminated. Now, in the case of political phenomena, the supposition of unity of cause is not only wide of the truth, but at an immeasurable distance from it. The causes of every social phenomenon which we are particularly interested about, security, wealth, freedom, good government, public virtue, general intelligence, or their opposites, are infinitely numerous, especially the external or remote causes, which alone are, for the most part, accessible to direct observation. No one cause suffices of itself to produce any of these phenomena; while there are countless causes which have some influence over them, and may co-operate either in their production or in their prevention. From the mere fact, therefore, of our having been able to eliminate some circumstance, we can by no means infer that this circumstance was not instrumental to the effect in some of the very instances from which we have eliminated it. We can conclude that the effect is sometimes produced without it; but not that, when present, it does not contribute its share.|$|E
