500|$|Rousseau's unknown fate in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{was heavily}} {{discussed}} among critics. [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{felt that the}} relationship between Rousseau and Alex after their reunion remained unexplored, which made Rousseau's death a wasted opportunity for a powerful death scene. BuddyTV's Don Williams believed that Rousseau would survive, mainly because he had been waiting to see her flashback for four seasons, and thought her death would ensure it would not happen. Dan Compora from SyFy Portal was disappointed in her death scene, noting, [...] "I wasn't shocked to see Danielle get killed, but the scene felt like it was tossed in just in case this had to serve as the season finale." [...] Compora felt that Rousseau deserved more screen time in the episode leading up to her death. [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman described it as [...] "a rude and lazy {{way to get rid of}} Rousseau". John Kubicek, also of BuddyTV, found her death scene unsatisfactory, commenting, [...] "Then we have that entirely tacked on scene at the end which felt so artificial, like I accidentally flipped over to a different show. While I agree Danielle Rousseau being shot with an arrow is shocking, is this <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> show has come to? Arbitrarily putting a recurring character's life in peril to pose as a cliffhanger?" ...|$|E
500|$|The entry {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics; {{the main reason}} for criticism was that, instead of creating a conclusion, the episode raised new questions for the audience. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it one star out of five. The two, despite calling the opening [...] "promising", derided the episode's ending—especially the revelation of alien colonization of December22, 2012—writing, [...] "is this <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> series was about?" [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson concluded that the problem with the episode was that the show, which he called [...] "brilliant—frequently, truly brilliant" [...] decided [...] "to define itself in the summing up" [...] with the episode, which did not answer very many questions. UGO named the episode the fourteenth [...] "Worst Series Finale" [...] and wrote that the episode—and the show's eighth and ninth seasons by extension—were negatively affected by the series' lack of a defining plot line. The article noted that, while the episode claimed to wrap up the story arcs for the series, [...] "the trial of Mulder ultimately resulted in very little satisfying payoff to the series' overarching mysteries". Joyce Millman, writing for The New York Times, after the premiere of [...] "The Truth", said of the show: [...] "The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, was critical of the episode's trial sequences. While he stated that these scenes [...] "do a good job of bringing together the many disparate threads of this arc", he felt that they were [...] "interminably dull".|$|E

Web 2.0, for some people, it means moving some of the thinking [...] client side, so making it more immediate, but the idea of the Web as interaction between people is <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Web is. That was what it was designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact." [...] Other critics labeled Web 2.0 [...] "a second bubble" [...] (referring to the Dot-com bubble of 1997–2000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of business models. For example, The Economist has dubbed the mid- to late-2000s focus on Web companies as [...] "Bubble 2.0".|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Don Snowden awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "There's nothing to fault with the performances, and {{obviously}} Zorn wanted the music released, but <b>really,</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> point? Is anyone seriously into Zorn and/or Masada going to knowingly choose an 18-minute disc {{with so many}} full-length volumes out there?..

60|$|But if it be <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> title imports, Mr. Wood hath {{treated the}} Committee with great rudeness, by {{publishing}} {{an act of}} theirs in so unbecoming a manner, without their leave, and before it was communicated {{to the government and}} Privy-council of Ireland, to whom the Committee advised that it should be transmitted. But with all deference be it spoken, I do not conceive that a Report of a Committee of the Council in England is hitherto a law in either kingdom; and until any point is determined to be a law, it remains disputable by every subject.|$|E
60|$|This is {{the decisive}} {{reason why the}} {{argument}} does not hold, {{from the use of}} the ballot in clubs and private societies to its adoption in parliamentary elections. A member of a club is <b>really,</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> elector falsely believes himself to be, under no obligation to consider the wishes or interests of any one else. He declares nothing by his vote but that he is or is not willing to associate, in a manner more or less close, with a particular person. This is a matter on which, by universal admission, his own pleasure or inclination is entitled to decide; and that he should be able so to decide it without risking a quarrel is best for every body, the rejected person included. An additional reason rendering the ballot unobjectionable in these cases {{is that it does not}} necessarily or naturally lead to lying. The persons concerned are of the same class or rank, and it would be considered improper in one of them to press another with questions as to how he had voted. It is far otherwise in Parliamentary elections, and is likely to remain so as long as the social relations exist which produce the demand for the ballot--as long as one person is sufficiently the superior of another to think himself entitled to dictate his vote. And while this is the case, silence or an evasive answer is certain to be construed as proof that the vote given has not been that which was desired.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She was the Visigoth,--five hundred tons, or it {{may have}} been six,--in the {{coasting}} trade; one of the best steamers and best found on the Kutch-Kasauli line. She wasn't six years old when the thing happened: on just such a night as this, with an oily smooth sea, under brilliant starlight, about a hundred miles from land. To this day no one knows <b>really</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> matter was. She was so small that she could not have struck even a log in the water without every soul on board feeling the jar; and even if she had struck something, it wouldn't have made her go down as she did. I was fourth officer then; we had about seven saloon passengers, including the Captain's wife and another woman, and perhaps five hundred deck-passengers going up the coast to a shrine, on just such a night as this, when she was ripping through the level sea at a level nine knots an hour. The man on the bridge, whoever it was, saw that she was sinking at the head. Sinking by the head as she went along. That was the only warning we got. She began to sink as she went along. Of course the Captain was told, and he sent me to wake up the saloon passengers and tell them to come on deck. 'Sounds a curious sort of message that to deliver on a dead still night. The people tumbled up in their dressing-gowns and pyjamas, and wouldn't believe me. We were just sinking as fast as we could, and I had to tell 'em that. Then the deck-passengers got wind of it, and all Hell woke up along the decks.|$|E

5000|$|The Dormouse is {{referenced}} {{in popular}} culture by two American rock bands: Firstly by Jefferson Airplane in the song [...] "White Rabbit", in which {{the last line of}} the song, repeated twice and building through a crescendo is [...] "Remember what the dormouse said: feed your head, feed your head". From this lyric, John Markoff derived the title of his 2005 book, What the Dormouse Said: How the 60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.

The idea was that if we have Gwen Stacy brought back as a clone, how can I up the stakes when I get rid of her? When I write her out of the book, what can I do to make that really effective and to punctuate it, to bring it to the next level? And I thought, if we can clone Gwen, we can certainly clone Peter. I was also at that time enamored with titles that played off of old, melodramatic Stan Lee titles of the past. ... I came up with the title, [...] "If I Kill Me, Will I Die?"
