60|$|Carefully and slowly, with {{trembling}} fingers, Deacon {{counted the}} cards he had taken. There were twenty-five. He <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the corner of}} the table, took up the rules Grief had written, folded them, and put them in his pocket. Then he emptied his glass, and stood up. Captain Donovan looked at his watch, yawned, and also arose.|$|E

50|$|One study {{reported}} mothers getting more sleep and breast-feeding by co-sleeping than other arrangements. Parents also experience less exhaustion with such ease in feeding and comforting their child by simply <b>reaching</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the child. As a result, co-sleeping also increases the responsiveness of parents to their child's needs.|$|R
50|$|G4 aired a {{small series}} of MacGyver parodies {{about a young}} {{corporate}} cubicle worker known as MacGunner. He would construct ridiculous items out of cubicle materials, such as several dozen markers hooked end to end in order <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his arch-enemy's cubicle and type a scathing email to the boss.|$|R
60|$|He <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her {{and felt}} her arm at the biceps. The {{pressure}} of the encircling fingers was firm and honest, and Saxon thrilled to it. There was magic in this man-boy. She would have known only irritation had Bert or any other man felt her arm. But this man! IS HE THE MAN? she was questioning, when he voiced his conclusion.|$|E
60|$|But alas! {{there was}} little more of the Dismal Swamp left, and when I <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the {{opposite}} end of the kid, I received a rap on the knuckles from a spoon, and was told that I must help myself from my own side, for that was the rule. But my side was scraped clean, so I got no burgoo that morning.|$|E
60|$|Dale nudged Helen, {{and then}} <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> give Bo a tap. He was peering keenly ahead and his {{strained}} intensity could be felt. Helen looked {{with all her}} might and she saw the shadowy gray forms of the coyotes skulk away, out of the moonlight into the gloom of the woods, where they disappeared. Not only Dale's intensity, but the very silence, the wildness of the moment and place, seemed fraught with wonderful potency. Bo must have felt it, too, for she was trembling all over, and holding tightly to Helen, and breathing quick and fast.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do I {{mean in the}} face!' sneered Sampson Brass, <b>reaching</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> take up the bill-book, and {{fluttering}} {{its leaves}} rapidly. 'Look here--Daniel Quilp, Esquire--Daniel Quilp, Esquire--Daniel Quilp, Esquire--all through. Whether should I take a clerk that he recommends, and says, [...] "this is the man for you," [...] or lose all this, eh?' ...|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, Kirsten crashes her {{car while}} driving drunk. She {{is in the middle of}} an {{emotional}} conversation with Sandy, who tells her <b>to</b> pull <b>over,</b> when she drops her phone on the center console. Kirsten <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> pick up her phone but doesn't see that she is approaching an intersection. A truck runs over her car.|$|R
60|$|The {{infatuated}} man {{hesitated a}} moment, and then, <b>reaching</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the cruet, {{took out the}} spoon, and with a pale, determined face, indignantly daubed the classic features of the provision dealer. His indignation was not lessened by the behaviour of the temptress, who, instead of fawning upon him for his bravery, crammed her handkerchief to her mouth and giggled foolishly.|$|R
50|$|On June 29, 2011, Jorge Posada of the New York Yankees hit a {{fly ball}} to right field. The ball {{bounced off the}} wall and a fan <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> grab it. Originally ruled a base hit, instant replay showed that the fan touched the ball as it bounced back onto the field. After the review, the umpires called it a home run.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{records of}} Lynch's death {{said it was}} caused by an electrical accident. The incident supposedly happened when Lynch <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> shut off a reading lamp attached to his metal headboard and accidentally touched a steam radiator at the same time. Winona County coroner P.A. Mattison determined that the lamp {{was the source of}} the current that sent the fatal surge of electricity coursing through Father Lynch's body.|$|E
5000|$|... "Finally I {{thought of}} something: I offered {{to him to}} {{exchange}} his old gun for a new one. But he refused, saying that the berdanka was dear to him because of {{the memory of his}} father, that he was used to it and that it shoots very well. He <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the tree, took up his gun and began to stroke on the stock with his hand." [...] "Dersu Uzala", --V. K. Arsenyev.|$|E

Avinash <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> hug him sensually, {{alarming}} Dev. Dev loses his temper and begins to beat Avinash up. Avinash leaves Dev, and goes back home. The beating he received from Dev triggers memories of his own father beating him up upon discovering his sexuality.|$|R

5000|$|Actress Arus Voskanyan {{told about}} her last visit to Charents: [...] "He looked fragile but noble. He took some {{morphine}} and then read some Komitas. When I <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> kiss his hand he was startled". He became a morphine addict {{under the pressure}} of the campaign against him and because he was suffering from colic, caused by a kidney stone. The hypodermic needle Charents used for his habit is on exhibit in his museum in Yerevan.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{return of}} the items, Herrmann poured the rice into the vase and placed the lid on it. He went into the audience, walked over to a bearded gentleman and {{borrowed}} his hat. He <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the gentleman's beard and produced an orange from it—"Thank you. Just what I needed for this trick"—eliciting a chuckle from the audience. He returned to the stage and placed the hat on a chair and the orange {{on one of the}} tables.|$|E
5000|$|Anthony Jackson played bass guitar on the song. One {{day during}} fall 1973, producer/keyboardist Leon Huff {{was leading the}} members of the MFSB rhythm section and Jackson through a rehearsal. Sigma Sound Studios owner/engineer Joe Tarsia noticed that Jackson had a wah-wah pedal {{attached}} to his Fender Precision Bass. Tarsia decided to run Jackson's bassline through a phaser, giving it a swishing sound and later mixed in echo. During the final mixing of the track, Kenny Gamble impulsively <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the echo button and added echo to Jackson's opening riffs.|$|E
50|$|Nine-year-old Nicki Johnson {{attends a}} funfair with her parents. Her father (David Lodge) takes {{her on a}} merry-go-round ride, where Nicki becomes frightened. Attempting <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> comfort her, her father instead falls from the ride and is crushed to death in its machinery.

50|$|Cantlie, {{knowing that}} Gian {{was at least}} {{theoretically}} faster than Ptarmigan made several challenges to Armstrong to race. There {{is a story that}} one day in late August 1906 Cantlie was out in his launch in the river {{at the same time as}} Ptarmigan. Cantle seized the moment and sped past Ptarmigan with his bagpiper blasting out airs as Gian sped past. This was too much for Captain Armstrong, a master steamboat man and veteran of the Klondike Gold Rush. Armstrong ordered full steam ahead, and when Ptarmigan caught up to Gian, two or three roustabouts <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Gian, seized the still-playing piper, and lifted him unharmed over to the foredeck of Ptarmigan while the piper reportedly never missed a note. Ptarmigan passed Gian and thereafter Cantlie steered clear of the big steamer.|$|E
50|$|The {{program has}} {{received}} extremely large audiences, which have grown significantly over the years. The CCTV New Year's Gala {{is currently the}} most watched annual Arts and Performance event anywhere in the world, and as such, its importance has <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> political, economic, and ethical territory. As the Chinese New Year's Eve is a time where the family gathers, the typical situation involves a large 3-generation family gathered {{in front of their}} TV set while making dumplings for the first New Year's meal. The Gala adds a mood of celebration in the house as people laugh, discuss and enjoy the performance. It has become an ingrained tradition on Mainland China to watch the New Year's Gala on New Year's Eve, and the estimated audience numbers over 700 million people.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, {{the title}} of the series was [...] "Smoke Rings", and the Singing Detective noir thriller was to be dropped after the first episode; Potter felt it would not hold the audience's attention. The title may have {{referred}} to a particular monologue Marlow has in the first episode, referring to the fact that, despite everything else, the one thing he really wants is a cigarette. Marlow's medical and mental progress is subtly gauged by his ability <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his dresser and get his cigarettes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{upgrade to}} Breeze also {{resulted}} in a complete replacement of all fare gates and token-based system. The previous system was subject to entrance without payment, as a low turnstile permitted [...] "turnstile jumping" [...] and a handicapped gate could easily be opened by <b>reaching</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> push the exit bar. Moreover, there were instances where the turnstile mechanisms would be deteriorated such that some people could forcefully advance the turnstiles with their bodies. The new system offers taller gates and cannot be opened from the outside without first paying.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{hearing that}} Freyja {{was on her}} way, Þrymr ordered a grand feast in her honor. Seeing his bride consume large servings of food after food, Thrym was astounded by the fact. Loki {{reasoned}} [...] "she" [...] had not eaten or drunk for eight days due to her anxiety in meeting him. Elated, Thrym <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> kiss his bride, but seeing the glaring eyes of Thor through the thin veil, he withdrew in disappointment. Loki explained that [...] "Freyja" [...] had not slept for eight nights in her excitement to come to Jötunheim. Wanting the marriage to be done quickly, Thrym ordered for Mjölnir {{to be brought to}} his bride. Once Mjölnir was placed on his lap, Thor grabbed the hammer by its short handle and slew every jötunn in sight.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 2004, philosopher Martha C. Nussbaum describes Owen as a serial sexual harasser and an alcoholic, who harassed many women. This lengthy account is somewhat misleadingly summarized by Rachel Aviv {{as if it were a}} personal interview. Aviv does not mention the important fact, emphasized in the article, that Owen harassed many women and that his pattern was the same with all. Aviv writes:: Nussbaum entered the graduate program in classics at Harvard in 1969 [...] "When her thesis adviser, G.E. L. Owen, invited her to his office, served sherry, spoke about his life's sadness, and <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> touch her breasts, Nussbaum says, she gently pushed him away, careful not to embarrass him.... 'I managed to keep my control with Owen, and I never said a hostile word.'" [...] The real source for this material is not a personal interview, but the article by Nussbaum, [...] "Don't Smile Too Much: Philosophy and Women in the '70's," [...] published in Linda Martin Alcoff, ed., SINGING IN THE FIRE: STORIES OF WOMEN IN PHILOSOPHY, Routledge.|$|E
5000|$|The Young Bosnia {{organization}} {{carried out}} the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Nedeljko Čabrinović {{was the first to}} dare to act, and threw a bomb at the car the Archduke was in. Unfortunately, the Archduke noticed the bomb and <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> cover his wife. The driver saw his action and accelerated. Čabrinović had forgotten about the ten second delay on the bomb, so as the car accelerated the bomb bounced off the back bumper of the Archduke's car and exploded underneath the car behind, wounding the passengers. Without looking at the result of his bomb, Čabrinović swallowed a cyanide pill and, to make sure he died (like Gavrilo Princip, he had turburculosis and was willing to give his life for the cause) jumped into the nearby river. Unfortunately, the cyanide pill didn't work and only made him sick, and the river was only a few inches deep, so he was dragged out and arrested. After his failure, the rest of the group, including 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, were too shocked to act and allowed the car to reach its destination.|$|E
