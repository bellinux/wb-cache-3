She held the position until 2003. Isenhour assisted with Bob Casey, Jr.'s successful 2006 campaign against Republican incumbent <b>Rick</b> <b>Santorum,</b> served as political adviser to state House Democratic Leader Frank Dermody, and ran Governor Ed Rendell's successful 2006 re-election campaign against challenger Lynn Swann, after which she helped plan Rendell's 2007 inauguration.

50|$|In 2007, {{according}} to the Washington Post, Jasser received a $100,000 donation from Christian conservative financier Foster Friess, who has bankrolled the super-PAC supporting <b>Rick</b> <b>Santorum’s</b> presidential bid.|$|R

5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and <b>Rick</b> <b>Santorum,</b> and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E
5|$|While {{the bill}} had been {{proposed}} by Republican Senators <b>Rick</b> <b>Santorum</b> and Mel Martinez, {{it also had}} the support of Democratic Senator Tom Harkin due to disability rights concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left; however, in the Schiavo case they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise. According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Specter faced a {{challenge}} in the Republican primary election from conservative Congressman Pat Toomey, whose campaign theme was that Specter was not fiscally conservative enough. The match-up was closely watched nationally, being seen as a symbolic clash between the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party. However, {{most of the state}} and national Republican establishment, including the state's other senator at the time, <b>Rick</b> <b>Santorum,</b> closed ranks behind Specter. Specter was supported by President George W. Bush. Specter narrowly avoided a major upset with 51% of the primary vote. Once Specter defeated the challenge from the right, he was able to enjoy great support from independents and some Democrats in his race against Hoeffel. Hoeffel trailed Specter in name recognition, campaign funds and poll results. Although the two minor candidates were seen as more conservative than Specter, they were only able to take 4% of the vote and Specter was easily reelected.|$|E

The ads were widely parodied, including by the Utah Democratic Party and <b>Rick</b> <b>Santorum's</b> campaign.|$|R
40|$|Argumentation should {{encourage}} autonomous decision-making. <b>Rick</b> <b>Santorum’s</b> political campaign ad Welcome to Obamaville violates this requirement by deploying {{a flood of}} subliminal images. Santorum’s ad involves a fallacy by virtue of clear intent to manipulate. Arguers {{are responsible for the}} foreseeable consequences of their action.
