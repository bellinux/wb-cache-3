40|$|Background: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) is an IFNc-release assay {{used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. The risk of TB progression increases with {{the magnitude of the}} MTB-specific IFNc-response. QFT reversion, also associated with low Tuberculin Skin Test responses, may therefore represent a transient immune response with control of M. tuberculosis infection. However, studies at the single cell level have suggested that the quality (polyfunctionality) of the T-cell response {{is more important than the}} quantity of cytokines produced. Objective: To explore the quality and/or magnitude of mycobacteria-specific T-cell responses associated with QFT reversion and persistent QFT-positivity. Methods: Multi-color flowcytometry on prospectively collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells was applied to assess mycobacteria-specific T-cell responses in 42 QFT positive Indian adolescents of whom 21 became QFT negative (<b>reverters)</b> within one year. Ten QFT consistent negatives were also included as controls. Results: There was no difference in the qualitative PPD-specific CD 4 + T-cell response between QFT consistent positives and <b>reverters.</b> However, compared with QFT consistent positives, <b>reverters</b> displayed lower absolute frequencies of polyfunctional (IFNc+IL 2 +TNFa+) CD 4 + T-cells at baseline, which were further reduced to the point where they were no...|$|R

5000|$|A {{fee simple}} determinable is an estate that will end {{automatically}} when the stated event or condition occurs. The interest will revert to the grantor or the heirs of the grantor.

40|$|SUMMARY A 1 -year {{double-blind}} placebo-controlled {{study on}} the effects of diuretic withdrawal was conducted on a group of 62 previously well-controlled, mildly hypertensive patients. Data were collected on blood pressure (BP), biochemical laboratory values, and subjective reports of side-effects. Twenty-six percent of placebo subjects and 3 % of the active treatment subjects reached preset criteria for the return of hypertension (<b>reverters).</b> The average systolic and diastolic pressures of all placebo-treated patients who did not revert showed statistically significant increases. BP control was quickly reestablished in <b>reverters</b> by restarting diuretic therapy. No substantial differences in side-effects were reported between the groups, and laboratory changes were those consistent with known metabol-ic effects of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. This study showed a much lower reversion rate after treatment withdrawal than previously reported by other investigators. It also showed significant increases in BP of placebo patients who did not revert. Long-term diuretic therapy retains its effectiveness in responsive mild hypertensive patients, potentially offering protection against the increased risks of mortality and morbidity associated with even slight elevations of BP. Withdrawal of diuretics cannot be recommended for patients with mild hypertension without use of other equally effective interventions to maintain optimum BP control.

40|$|Background Cerebral microbleeds may {{contribute}} to cognitive deficits in stroke. Cognitive impairment that {{does not meet the}} criteria for dementia (cognitive impairment no dementia) is common in stroke, and patients with such impairment can revert to normal cognition. Aims and hypothesis This study examined the association between cerebral microbleeds and the reversion of cognitive impairment no dementia. Method A total of 328 Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to the acute stroke unit of a university-affiliated regional hospital in Hong Kong participated in the study. All subjects were assessed for cognitive impairment no dementia with a neuropsychological test battery at three- and 15 months following the index stroke. Of the 180 patients with cognitive impairment no dementia at three-months poststroke, 143 (79 · 4 %) attended the 15 -month follow-up. Twenty-nine subjects had reverted from cognitive impairment no dementia to normal cognitive status (<b>reverters),</b> 98 were nonreverters and 16 had progressed to dementia. Results In univariate analysis, the <b>reverters</b> were found to be younger, less likely to have hypertension and cerebral microbleeds, and to have smaller white matter hyperintensity volumes. In multivariate analysis, the absence of cerebral microbleeds remained an independent predictor of reversion with an odds ratio of 4 · 3. Absence of deep cerebral microbleeds predicted the reversion of the language domain, whereas the absence of lobar cerebral microbleeds predicted the reversion of the visuomotor speed domain. Conclusions The results suggest that the absence of cerebral microbleeds may be associated with a higher likelihood of a reversible cognitive impairment in stroke patients. The mechanism of how this occurs is not well understood...|$|R

40|$|Life-course diet {{patterns}} may {{impact risk}} of disease, but {{little is known}} about dietary trends with aging. In a retrospective longitudinal analysis we estimated lifetime intake of animal products and adherence to vegetarian dietary patterns among 51, 082 Adventist Health Study- 2 (AHS- 2) subjects using data from a reliable life-course dietary (meats, dairy, eggs) questionnaire. Results showed a marked tendency to consume fewer animal products (in total) in older years and to reduce consumption of meat, poultry and fish, but not eggs or dairy. Among the 29 % of elderly subjects who during their lifetime kept the same dietary pattern (LTS) were: LTS-vegans (1. 1 %), LTS-lacto-ovo vegetarians (31. 2 %), LTS-pesco vegetarians (0. 49 %), LTS-semi vegetarians (3. 7 %), and LTS-non-vegetarians (63. 5 %). Among the 71 % of switchers were “Converters” (59. 7 %) who moved towards and “Reverters” (9. 1 %) who moved away from vegetarian diets, and Multiverters (31. 2 %), who had moved in both directions. LTS-non-vegetarians, and also <b>reverters,</b> were more overweight and showed a less healthy lifestyle than others. We conclude that the dietary patterns are dynamic with strong trends to reduce animal foods and to adopt more vegetarian patterns with aging.

We studied the decay kinetics of TB-specific antigen T-cell responses measured with an in-house ELISPOT assay {{during the course of}} therapy. Methods: Newly diagnosed sputum smear positive TB cases with typical TB chest radiographs were recruited. All patients were given standard anti-TB treatment. Each subject was followed up for 6 months and treatment outcomes were documented. Blood samples were obtained for the ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 (EC) ELISPOT at diagnosis, 1 -, 2 -, 4 - and 6 -months. Qualitative {{and quantitative}} reversion of the ELISPOT results were assessed with McNemar test, conditional logistic regression and mixed-effects hierarchical Poisson models. Results: A total of 116 cases were recruited and EC ELISPOT was positive for 87 % (95 of 109) at recruitment. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of EC ELISPOT positive cases over the treatment period (p, 0. 001). Most of the reversion occurred between the start and first month of treatment and at completion at 6 months. ESAT- 6 had higher median counts compared to CFP- 10 at all time points. Counts for each antigen declined significantly with therapy (p, 0. 001). <b>Reverters</b> had lower median SFUs at the start of treatment compared to non-Reverters for both antigens.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to predicting disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) - multivariate ordinal regression - which inherently models the ordered nature of brain atrophy spanning normal aging (CTL) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Ordinal regression provides probabilistic class predictions {{as well as a}} continuous index of disease progression - the ORCHID (Ordinal Regression Characteristic Index of Dementia) score. We applied ordinal regression to 1023 baseline structural MRI scans from two studies: the US-based Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the European based AddNeuroMed program. Here, the acquired AddNeuroMed dataset was used as a completely independent test set for the ordinal regression model trained on the ADNI cohort providing an optimal assessment of model generalizability. Distinguishing CTL-like (CTL and stable MCI) from AD-like (MCI converters and AD) resulted in balanced accuracies of 82 % (cross-validation) for ADNI and 79 % (independent test set) for AddNeuroMed. For prediction of conversion from MCI to AD, balanced accuracies of 70 % (AUC of 0. 75) and 75 % (AUC of 0. 81) were achieved. The ORCHID score was computed for all subjects. We showed that this measure significantly correlated with MMSE at 12 months (rho = - 0. 64, ADNI and rho = - 0. 59, AddNeuroMed). Additionally, the ORCHID score can help fractionate subjects with unstable diagnoses (e. g. <b>reverters</b> and healthy controls who later progressed to MCI), moderately late converters (12 - 24 months) and late converters (24 - 36 months). A comparison with results in the literature and direct comparison with a binary classifier suggests that the performance of this framework is highly competitive...|$|R
40|$|Mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) {{is associated with}} an increased risk of developing dementia. However, many individuals diagnosed with MCI are found to have reverted to normal cognition on follow-up. This study investigated factors predicting or associated with reversion from MCI to normal cognition. Our analyses considered 223 participants (48. 9 % male) aged 71 - 89 years, drawn from the prospective, population-based Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. All were diagnosed with MCI at baseline and subsequently classified with either normal cognition or repeat diagnosis of MCI after two years (a further 11 participants who progressed from MCI to dementia were excluded). Associations with reversion were investigated for (1) baseline factors that included diagnostic features, personality, neuroimaging, sociodemographics, lifestyle, and physical and mental health; (2) longitudinal change in potentially modifiable factors. There were 66 <b>reverters</b> to normal cognition and 157 non-reverters (stable MCI). Regression analyses identified diagnostic features as most predictive of prognosis, with reversion less likely in participants with multiple-domain MCI (p =  0. 011), a moderately or severely impaired cognitive domain (p =  0. 002 and p =  0. 006), or an informant-based memory complaint (p =  0. 031). Reversion was also less likely for participants with arthritis (p =  0. 037), but more likely for participants with higher complex mental activity (p =  0. 003), greater openness to experience (p =  0. 041), better vision (p =  0. 014), better smelling ability (p =  0. 040), or larger combined volume of the left hippocampus and left amygdala (p< 0. 040). Reversion was also associated with a larger drop in diastolic blood pressure between baseline and follow-up (p =  0. 026). Numerous factors are associated with reversion from MCI to normal cognition. Assessing these factors could facilitate more accurate prognosis of individuals with MCI. Participation in cognitively enriching activities and efforts to lower blood pressure might promote reversion...|$|R
