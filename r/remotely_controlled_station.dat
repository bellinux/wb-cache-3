50|$|An {{auxiliary}} station, {{most often}} used for repeater control or link purposes or to <b>remotely</b> <b>control</b> another <b>station,</b> is limited in the United States to operation on frequencies above 144.5 MHz excluding 144.0-144.5 MHz, 145.8-146.0 MHz, 219-220 MHz, 222.00-222.15 MHz, 431-433 MHz, and 435-438 MHz. Operation of such control links in the crowded 2-meter band is problematic and on many frequencies in that band expressly prohibited, leaving 1.25-meter band frequencies as the lowest available for remote control of repeaters and unattended stations.|$|R

The Østfold Line was electrified during the late 1930s and early 1940s. The section between Sarpsborg and Halden, and thus the Sarp Bridge, was powered up on 11 November 1940.|$|R
50|$|The Leopard 2A7+ is {{designed}} to operate both in low intensity and high intensity conflicts. The tank's protection has been increased by modular armour; the frontal protection has been improved with a dual-kit on the turret and hull front, while 360° protection against RPGs and mine protection increase the survivability of the tank in urban operations. The modular armour's system components were first used by Canada in Afghanistan. It can fire programmable HE munitions and the turret mounted MG3 has been replaced with a stabilized FLW 200 <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> weapon <b>station.</b> The mobility, sustainability and situational awareness have also been improved.|$|R

It can also support a two-man turret, armed with a 30 mm cannon and coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun. It can also feature a manned weapon station with a 40 mm grenade launcher and 7.62 mm machine gun. In Korean service, the K806/K808 will be outfitted with a one-person protected weapon station armed with an M2HB machine gun rather than an RWS to reduce acquisition costs, although the company could supply such systems if requested.|$|R

40|$|During shutdowns, {{maintenance}} {{crews are}} expected to work in 24 / 6 shifts to perform critical remote handling maintenance tasks on the ITER system. In this article, we investigate the possibility to safely perform these haptic maintenance tasks <b>remotely</b> from <b>control</b> <b>stations</b> located anywhere around the world. To guarantee stability in time delayed bilateral teleoperation, the symmetric position tracking controller using wave variables is selected. This algorithm guarantees robustness against communication delays, can eliminate wave reflections and provide position synchronization of the master and slave devices. Experiments have been conducted under realistic local network bandwidth, latency and jitter constraints. They show sufficient transparency even for substantial communication delays...|$|R
50|$|The LAV III is {{fitted with}} a two-man turret, armed with the M242 Bushmaster 25 mm caliber chain gun and a coaxial 7.62-mm machine gun.

The LAV III also has eight 76-mm grenade launchers in two clusters of four launchers positioned {{on each side of the}} turret. The grenade launchers are intended for smoke grenades. In 2009, a number of LAV III's were modified with a Nanuk <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> weapon <b>station</b> (RCWS) to provide better protection and to increase the chances of survival of the crew against improvised explosive devices and anti-tank mine threats on the battlefield.|$|R

Once the railway bridge was completed, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the former bridge and rebuilt it wider and stronger. The entire superstructure and steel parts of the pillars were demolished. The brick gates were widened. The auxiliary road past Tarris was placed on a viaduct leading to the bridge. To avoid hindering traffic on the river, construction was prolonged. A temporary wooden bridge was erected in 1936 and remained for two years, until the new road bridge opened in 1938.|$|R
