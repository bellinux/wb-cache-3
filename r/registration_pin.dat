50|$|A <b>registration</b> <b>pin</b> is {{a device}} {{intended}} {{to hold a}} piece of film, paper or other material in place during photographic exposure, copying or drawing.|$|E
5000|$|This {{system is}} {{employed}} primarily in high-end [...] "professional" [...] {{cameras in the}} West. In the East (the former Soviet Union and its former Satellites), a single <b>registration</b> <b>pin,</b> corresponding to the [...] "big pin", is employed along with side pressure.|$|E
50|$|Bolex {{did have}} a foray into purely {{professional}} cameras with the Bolex Pro 16. Again, they decided against a <b>registration</b> <b>pin</b> for mechanical simplicity, to keep the camera as quiet as possible for sync-sound filming. This camera was only offered with 400 ft magazine capacity.|$|E
50|$|In traditional, {{hand-drawn}} animation, the <b>registration</b> <b>pins</b> {{are often}} called pegs, and {{are attached to}} a peg bar.|$|R
50|$|<b>Registration</b> <b>pins</b> {{are used}} in offset {{printing}} and cartography, in order to accurately position the different films or plates for multi-color work.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Registration</b> <b>pins</b> - {{number of}} pins which engage the film {{perforations}} during exposure {{in order to}} ensure consistent image stability from frame to frame.|$|R
50|$|Cinematography uses a {{rotary disc}} shutter in movie cameras, a {{continuously}} spinning disc which conceals the image with a reflex mirror during the intermittent motion between frame exposure. The disc then spins {{to an open}} section that exposes the next frame of film while it is held by the <b>registration</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The camera has {{a single}} {{pulldown}} claw and no <b>registration</b> <b>pin.</b> At 24 frame/s, the Krasnogorsk-3 will run for about 25 seconds on a full wind. Film speed is adjustable from 8 frame/s to 48 frame/s, however, many cameras are capable of functioning at higher frame rates (upwards of 60 fps) if the adjusting dial is turned beyond the 48 fps indicating mark. A single-frame release {{at the back of}} the Krasnogorsk-3 allows for animation and other single-frame applications.|$|E
50|$|IMAX {{projectors}} {{use what}} is known as the rolling loop method, in which each frame is sucked into the gate by a vacuum, and positioned by <b>registration</b> <b>pins</b> in the perforations corresponding to that frame.|$|R
5000|$|One {{aspect of}} this {{particular}} adoption was that it effectively prevented amateur camera films from being [...] "diverted" [...] to professional uses, as KS-perforated camera film will indeed pass undamaged through a Western Bloc professional camera, but it cannot maintain the required registration accuracy as the KS perforation is too tall relative to the professional camera's BH-sized <b>registration</b> <b>pin(s).</b>|$|R
5000|$|All 16 mm {{perforations}} are rectangles with {{rounded corners}} and are 0.0500" [...] (1.27mm) high by 0.078" [...] (1.9812mm) wide. The tolerance for these perforation dimensions {{was reduced to}} 0.01 mm in 1989, which allowed 16 mm camera manufacturers to slightly enlarge their <b>registration</b> <b>pins</b> and thus improve image registration and steadiness tolerances to less than 1/750th of the image height of the 16 mm frame.|$|R
5000|$|The {{intermittent}} mechanism must {{be employed}} in concert with a rotating shutter which blocks light transmittance during {{the motion of the}} film and allows light through while the film is held in place usually by one or more <b>registration</b> <b>pins.</b> The intermittent mechanism can be accomplished in many ways, but most often, it is done with sprocket wheels, claws, or pins coupled to the camera or projector drive mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Turning {{the camera}} {{upside down and}} running it {{forwards}} as normal, so that the film spools from bottom to top has several disadvantages. First, it places the soundtrack on the wrong side. Second, the film is required to be perforated on both sides, otherwise the negative cannot be cut {{into the rest of}} the film. Third, it requires that the camera be lined up for shooting in the opposite way, with the guidelines in the viewfinder that indicate the Academy area needing to be reversed. Fourth, it can cause subsequent processing difficulties for the negative, because the <b>registration</b> <b>pins</b> will be engaging the film perforations on their opposite sides to normal.|$|R
5000|$|Platinum (1986): The Panaflex Platinum is a sync-sound 35 mm {{motion picture}} camera, {{intended}} as the {{replacement for the}} Gold and Gold II series of cameras. It is capable of 4-36 fps forward and reverse in [...] frame increments, and is crystal-controlled at all speeds. It has a focal-plane shutter which can be adjusted from 50-200° while the camera is running, either by an external control unit or by manually turning a knob. While the movement remains {{essentially the same as}} the original Panaflex movement introduced in 1972, the Platinum's dual <b>registration</b> <b>pins</b> are [...] "full-fitting" [...] according to Panavision, implying a more precise grip on the film during exposure and thus greater sharpness.|$|R
5000|$|Drawing {{the large}} film through the {{projector}} presented challenges {{for both the}} camera and the projector. Conventional 70 mm systems were not steady enough for the 586× magnification. On the projector side, William Shaw adapted an Australian patent for film transport called the [...] "rolling loop" [...] by adding a compressed air [...] "puffer" [...] to accelerate the film, and put a cylindrical lens in the projector's [...] "aperture block". The projector uses a vacuum to pull the film into contact with this lens. Thus the [...] "field flattener" [...] flattens the image field. The lens is twice {{the height of the}} film and connects to a pneumatic piston so it can be moved up or down while the projector is running. This way, if a piece of dust comes off the film and sticks to the lens, the projectionist can switch to the clean side of the lens at the push of a button. The lens also has [...] "wiper bars" [...] made of a felt or brush-like material which can wipe dust off the lens as it moves up or down. IMAX projectors are pin stabilized, meaning four <b>registration</b> <b>pins</b> engage the perforations at the corners of the projected frame to ensure perfect alignment. Shaw added cam-controlled arms to decelerate each frame to eliminate the microscopic shaking as the frame [...] "settled" [...] onto the <b>registration</b> <b>pins.</b> The projector's shutter is open around 20% longer than in conventional equipment and the light source is brighter. The xenon short-arc lamps are made of a thin layer of fused quartz and contain xenon gas at a pressure of about 25 atmospheres (367 PSI); because of this, projectionists are required to wear protective body armor when changing or handling these in case the lamp breaks (e.g., due to a drop to the floor) because of the danger from flying quartz shards when propelled by the high pressure of the xenon gas within. An IMAX projector weighs up to 1.8 tonne (2 short tons) and is over 178 cm tall and 195 cm long.|$|R
5000|$|Panaflex Gold II (1987): The Panaflex Gold II is a sync-sound 35 mm {{motion picture}} camera. It {{is capable of}} crystal sync at 24 and 25 or 29.97 frame/s, and the non-sync speed is {{variable}} from 4-34 fps (frames per second) according to Panavision; the Gold II can safely run up to 40 fps, crystal controlled with a special board which can be fitted on request. It has a focal-plane shutter which can be adjusted from 50-200° while the camera is running, either by an external control unit or by manually turning a knob. Improvements over the Panavision Gold include a brighter viewfinder. While the movement remains {{essentially the same as}} the original Panaflex movement introduced in 1972, the Gold II's dual <b>registration</b> <b>pins</b> are [...] "full-fitting" [...] according to Panavision, implying a more precise grip on the film during exposure and thus greater sharpness. This camera is still available through Panavision.|$|R
5000|$|The {{drawing board}} is an {{essential}} tool. Paper will be attached and kept straight and still, so that the drawing {{can be done with}} accuracy. Generally, different kind of assistance rulers are used in drawing. The drawing board is usually mounted to a floor pedestal in which the board turns to a different position, and also its height can be adjustable. Smaller drawing boards are produced for table-top use. In the 18th and 19th centuries, drawing paper was dampened and then its edges glued to the drawing board. After drying the paper would be flat and smooth. The completed drawing was then cut free. Paper could also be secured to the drawing board with drawing pins [...] or even C-clamps. More recent practice is to use self-adhesive tape to secure paper to the board, including the sophisticated use of individualized adhesive dots from a dispensing roll. Some drawing boards are magnetized, allowing paper to be held down by long steel strips. Boards used for overlay drafting or animation may include <b>registration</b> <b>pins</b> or peg bars to ensure alignment of multiple layers of drawing media.|$|R
50|$|The Rimlock (B8A) base is an 8-pin {{design with}} a pin circle {{diameter}} close to noval, {{and uses a}} nub {{on the side of}} the envelope to engage with a guide and retaining spring in the socket wall. This provides <b>pin</b> <b>registration</b> (since the <b>pins</b> are equi-spaced) and also a fair degree of retention. Early tubes with this base type typically had a metal skirt around the lower ~15mm of the envelope to match the socket wall, and this offered a degree of built-in screening, but these were fairly soon replaced by 'skirtless' versions which had a characteristic widening in the glass to compensate physically for the absence of the skirt. In the European naming scheme, rimlock tubes are numbered in the ranges 40-49, 110-119 (with exceptions), and 400-499, e.g. EF40. Although virtually unknown elsewhere, this was a very common base type in European radios of the late 1940s through the 1950s, but was eventually displaced by the ubiquitous B7G and noval (B9A) base types.|$|R
5000|$|The River and Harbor Convention was an {{enormous}} occasion, especially for Chicago. The {{first day of the}} convention began with a 12-block parade including floats, bands, military units, and fire companies. It led to a large tent pavilion, located in front of City Hall, which could seat between 4,000 and 5,000 people. One contemporary reports on the convention claimed that the attendance was upwards of 10,000 or even 20,000, but delegate <b>registration</b> lists <b>pin</b> the actual number closer to 2,500. Nevertheless, the size was unprecedented for political conventions of that era. One attendee called it [...] "undoubtedly the largest deliberative body that ever assembled." [...] The three-day event was reported in Washington, D.C., New York, and even London.|$|R
50|$|Film perforations, {{also known}} as perfs, are the holes placed in the film stock during {{manufacturing}} and used for transporting (by sprockets and claws) and steadying (by <b>pin</b> <b>registration)</b> the film. Films may have different types of perforations depending on film gauge, film format, and intended usage. Perforations are also used as a standard measuring reference within certain camera systems {{to refer to the}} size of the frame.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether cross-sectional areal properties, calculated from densitometry, correlate to the true flexural properties. Right and left male embalmed tibiae were used in the study. Prior to scanning, the proximal end of each tibia was potted in a fixture with <b>registration</b> <b>pins,</b> flushed thoroughly with water under pressure to remove trapped air, and then placed in a constant thickness water bath attached to a precision indexer. Two sets of three scans of the entire tibia were taken with an Hologic QDR 1000 /W densitometer at rotations of 0, 45, and 90 degrees about the tibia long axis. An aluminum step phantom and a bone step phantom, machined from bovine cortical bone, were also in the bath and scanned separately. Pixel attenuation data from the two sets of scans were averaged to reduce noise. Pixel data from the high energy beam were then converted to equivalent thicknesses using calibration equations. Cross-sectional areal properties (centroid, principal area moments and principal angle) along the length were computed from the three registered scans using methods developed in our laboratory. Flexural rigidities. Four strain gages were bonded around the circumference of each of 5 cross-sections encompassing the entire diaphysis. A known transverse load was then applied to the distal end and the bone was rotated 360 degrees in eight increments of 45 degrees each. Strains from the eight orientations were analyzed along with the known applied bending moments at each section to compute section centroids, curvatures, principal flexural rigidities and principal angle. Reference axes between the two methods were maintained within +/- 0. 5 degrees using an electronic inclinometer. Principal angles (flexural - areal) differed by - 2. 0 +/- 4. 0 degrees, and 1. 0 +/- 2. 5 degrees for the right and left tibia, respectively. Section principal flexural rigidities were highly correlated to principal areal moments (right: r(sup 2) = 0. 997; left: r(sup 2) = 0. 978) indicating a nearly constant effective flexural modulus. Right and left tibia exhibited a very high degree of symmetry when comparing either flexural or areal properties. To our knowledge this is the first study to validate the use of densitometry (DXA) to predict three dimensional structural properties of long bones. Our initial results support the conclusion that bone mineral and its distribution are the primary determinants of flexural modulus and rigidity...|$|R
40|$|Remote DMA (RDMA) enables high {{performance}} networks to reduce data copying between an application and {{the operating system}} (OS). However RDMA operations in some {{high performance}} networks require communication memory explicitly registered with the network adapter and pinned by the OS. Memory <b>registration</b> and <b>pinning</b> limits {{the flexibility of the}} memory system and reduces the amount of memory that user processes can allocate. These issues become more significant on multicore platforms, since registered memory demand grows linearly with the number of processor cores. In this paper we propose a new memory registration/deregistration strategy to reduce registered memory on multicore architectures for HPC applications. We hide the cost of dynamic memory management by offloading all dynamic memory registration and deregistration requests to a dedicated memory management helper thread. We investigate design policies and performance implications of the helper thread approach. We evaluate our framework with the NAS parallel benchmarks, for which our registration scheme significantly reduces the registered memory (23. 62 % on average and up to 49. 39 %) and avoids memory registration/deregistration costs for reused communication memory. We show that our system enables the execution of problem sizes that could not complete under existing memory registration strategies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} improve a memory {{registration}} strategy for Remote DMA operations over pinningbased {{networks in the}} context of Clusters of Multiprocessors (CLUMPS). Although existing approaches focus primarily on bandwidth as a metric for evaluating the cost of DMA page <b>registration</b> (or <b>pinning),</b> there are many levels of host synchronization that hide the true cost of registration and prevent efficient use of one-sided RDMA communications and seriously impacts the cost for small messages. Furthermore, existing approaches do not tailor their implementations for Multiprocessors that share a single network endpoint, and as such ignore to exploit the spatial and temporal locality in the remote memory pages referenced by running many SPMD parallel programs over a single network endpoint. The proposed solution extends the idea of the Firehose algorithm and proposes a new Firehose API and library for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor variants. The SMP-aware version of Firehose pursues the same design goals of minimizing host-level synchronization [...] or more specifically, allowing operations to complete one-sided in the common case and reverting to rendezvouslike synchronization between endpoints when operations in the uncommon case. We motivate the need for special attention for CLUMPS and supplement a complete Firehose-SMP implementation with an evaluation of its design and some of the initial performance results are promising...|$|R
5000|$|The IMAX {{format is}} generically called [...] "15/70" [...] film, the name {{referring}} to the 15 sprocket holes or perforations per frame. The film's bulk requires horizontal platters, rather than conventional film reels. IMAX platters range from 1.2 to 1.83 m diameter to accommodate 1 to 2.75 hours of film. Platters with a 2.5 hour feature film weigh 250 kg. IMAX uses ESTAR-based print film in their 15/70 rolling-loop film projection systems. ESTAR-based print film provides greater precision. The chemical development process {{does not change the}} size or shape of ESTAR print film, and IMAX's <b>pin</b> <b>registration</b> system (especially the camera mechanism) does not tolerate either sprocket-hole or film-thickness variations. On September 1, 2016, it announced plans to include Virtual Reality into the IMAX theater experience with the opening of a new VR center in Los Angeles using a new StarVR headset created by Acer.|$|R
