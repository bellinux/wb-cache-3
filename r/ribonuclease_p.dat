Here we report the results of footprinting studies performed on purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase MRP and RNase P holoenzymes.

40|$|Nuclear <b>Ribonuclease</b> (RNase) <b>P</b> is a {{universal}} essential RNA-based enzyme made of a catalytic RNA component and a protein part; eukaryotic RNase P {{is closely related to}} {{a universal}} eukaryotic ribonucleoprotein RNase MRP. The protein part of the eukaryotic RNases P/MRP is dramatically more complex than that in bacterial and archaeal RNases P. The increase in the complexity of the protein part in eukaryotic RNases P/MRP was accompanied by the appearance of a novel structural element in the RNA component: an essential and phylogenetically conserved helix-loop-helix P 3 RNA domain. The crystal structure of the P 3 RNA domain in a complex with protein components Pop 6 and Pop 7 has been recently solved. Here we discuss the most salient structural features of the P 3 domain as well as its possible role in the evolutionary transition to the protein-rich eukaryotic RNases P/MRP...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear <b>ribonuclease</b> (RNase) <b>P</b> is a {{ubiquitous}} essential ribonucleoprotein complex, one of {{only two}} known RNA-based enzymes found in all three domains of life. The RNA component is the catalytic moiety of RNases P across all phylogenetic domains; it contains a well-conserved core, whereas peripheral structural elements are diverse. RNA components of eukaryotic RNases P tend to be less complex than their bacterial counterparts, a simplification that is accompanied by a dramatic reduction of their catalytic ability in the absence of protein. The size and complexity of the protein moieties increase dramatically from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic enzymes, apparently reflecting the delegation of some structural functions from RNA to proteins and, perhaps, in response to the increased complexity of the cellular environment in the more evolutionarily advanced organisms; the reasons for the increased dependence on proteins are not clear. We review current information on RNase P and the closely related universal eukaryotic enzyme RNase MRP, focusing on their functions and structural organization...|$|R

[...] This structure was followed by Jennifer Doudna's publication {{of the structure of the}} P4-P6 domains of the Tetrahymena group I intron, a fragment of the ribozyme originally made famous by Cech. The second clause in the title of this publication - Principles of RNA Packing - concisely evinces the value of these two structures: for the first time, comparisons could be made between well described tRNA structures and those of globular RNAs outside the transfer family. [...] This allowed the framework of categorization to be built for RNA tertiary structure. [...] It was now possible to propose the conservation of motifs, folds, and various local stabilizing interactions.

40|$|<b>Ribonuclease</b> (RNase) <b>P</b> is a {{site-specific}} endoribonuclease {{found in}} all kingdoms of life. Typical RNase P consists of a catalytic RNA component and a protein moiety. In the eukaryotes, the RNase P lineage has split into two, giving rise to a closely related enzyme, RNase MRP, which has similar components but has evolved to have different specificities. The eukaryotic RNases P/MRP have acquired an essential helix-loop-helix protein-binding RNA domain P 3 that has an important function in eukaryotic enzymes and distinguishes them from bacterial and archaeal RNases P. Here, we present a crystal structure of the P 3 RNA domain from Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase MRP in a complex with RNase P/MRP proteins Pop 6 and Pop 7 solved to 2. 7 Å. The structure suggests similar structural organization of the P 3 RNA domains in RNases P/MRP and possible functions of the P 3 domains and proteins bound {{to them in the}} stabilization of the holoenzymes' structures as well as in interactions with substrates.

40|$|The {{increased}} protein {{proportion of}} archaeal and eukaryal <b>ribonuclease</b> (RNase) <b>P</b> holoenzymes parallels a vast {{decrease in the}} catalytic activity of their RNA subunits (P RNAs) alone. We show that a few mutations toward the bacterial P RNA consensus substantially activate the catalytic (C-) domain of archaeal P RNA from Methanothermobacter, in the absence and presence of the bacterial RNase P protein. Large increases in ribozyme activity required the cooperative effect {{of at least two}} structural alterations. The P 1 helix of P RNA from Methanothermobacter was found to be extended, which increases ribozyme activity (ca 200 -fold) and stabilizes the tertiary structure. Activity increases of mutated archaeal C-domain variants were more pronounced in the context of chimeric P RNAs carrying the bacterial specificity (S-) domain of Escherichia coli instead of the archaeal S-domain. This could be explained by the loss of the archaeal S-domain's capacity to support tight and productive substrate binding in the absence of protein cofactors. Our results demonstrate that the catalytic capacity of archaeal P RNAs is close to that of their bacterial counterparts, but is masked by minor changes in the C-domain and, particularly, by poor function of the archaeal S-domain in the absence of archaeal protein cofactors...|$|R

In this report, we {{describe}} properties of p 40 in the human teratocarcinoma cell lines NTera 2 D 1 and 2102 Ep. The results indicate that: (i) most of p 40 occurs in large multimeric cytoplasmic complexes, (ii) L 1 Hs RNA is associated with the p 40 complexes, (iii) the complexes are dissociated by <b>ribonuclease</b> and (iv) <b>p</b> 40 is a novel RNA-binding protein. Cross-linking experiments with full-length and truncated p 40 produced in Escherichia coli also showed that: (i) p 40 itself can form a multimeric complex larger than 250 kDa, (ii) the leucine zipper motif and the region conserved among the predicted ORF 1 polypeptides of mammalian LINE- 1 s participate in complex formation and (iii) the amino terminal region is important for the stability of complex formation. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of p 40 suggests that long segments of the molecule can assume an alpha-helical configuration including the leucine zipper and the conserved region.

Further, RNase P is one of two known multiple turnover ribozymes in nature (the other being the ribosome), the discovery of which earned Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1989: in the 1970s, Altman discovered the existence of precursor tRNA with flanking sequences and was the first to characterize RNase P and its activity in processing of the 5' leader sequence of precursor tRNA. Recent findings also reveal that RNase P has a new function. It has been shown that human nuclear RNase P is required for the normal and efficient transcription of various small noncoding RNAs, such as tRNA, 5S rRNA, SRP RNA and U6 snRNA genes, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, one of three major nuclear RNA polymerases in human cells.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent to Tom Cech's {{publication}} implicating the Tetrahymena group I intron as an autocatalytic ribozyme, and Sidney Altman's {{report of}} catalysis by <b>ribonuclease</b> <b>P</b> RNA, several other catalytic RNAs {{were identified in}} the late 1980s, including the hammerhead ribozyme. In 1994, McKay et al. published {{the structure of a}} 'hammerhead RNA-DNA ribozyme-inhibitor complex' at 2.6 Ångström resolution, in which the autocatalytic activity of the ribozyme was disrupted via binding to a DNA substrate. The conformation of the ribozyme published in this paper was eventually shown to be one of several possible states, and although this particular sample was catalytically inactive, subsequent structures have revealed its active-state architecture. This structure was followed by Jennifer Doudna's publication {{of the structure of the}} P4-P6 domains of the Tetrahymena group I intron, a fragment of the ribozyme originally made famous by Cech. The second clause in the title of this publication - Principles of RNA Packing - concisely evinces the value of these two structures: for the first time, comparisons could be made between well described tRNA structures and those of globular RNAs outside the transfer family. This allowed the framework of categorization to be built for RNA tertiary structure. It was now possible to propose the conservation of motifs, folds, and various local stabilizing interactions. For an early review of these structures and their implications, see RNA FOLDS: Insights from recent crystal structures, by Doudna and Ferre-D'Amare.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The crystal {{structure}} of <b>ribonuclease</b> <b>P</b> protein aRpp 29 from the sulfate-reducing hyperther-mophile Archaeoglobus fulgidus was determined at 1. 7 Å resolution using X-ray diffraction methods. The central {{feature of this}} archaeal protein is a sheet of six antiparallel â-strands twisted around a conserved hydrophobic core. Residues near the N- and C-termini form helical structures that are oriented in an antiparallel manner. A comparison of conserved amino acids indicates that archaeal aRpp 29 is homologous to human <b>ribonuclease</b> <b>P</b> protein Rpp 29. The aRpp 29 protein is structurally similar to bacterial transcription factors Hfq and NusG, {{as well as the}} Sm and Sm-like RNA-associated proteins from eukarya. The {{crystal structure}} of A. fulgidus aRpp 29 differs from the previously reported solution structure, where NMR data did not detect the helices and indicated that 40 % of the residues are relatively flexible or disordered. Circular dichroism data indicate that the protein has less helical content than the amount observed in the crystal, suggesting that in solution the helical regions are unfolded or in equilibrium between folded and unfolded forms; this hypothesis is consistent with amide proton exchange rate data. Surface residues that are conserved from archaea to humans and are likely to interact with the <b>ribonuclease</b> <b>P</b> RNA or other protein subunits are identified in the structure. The model of the aRpp 29 protein defined by this work provides an essential step toward eventually understanding the overall architecture of <b>ribonuclease</b> <b>P...</b>|$|E

40|$|The protein {{component}} of <b>ribonuclease</b> <b>P</b> (RNase P) binds to the RNA subunit, forming a functional ribonucleoprotein complex in vivo and enhancing the affinity of the precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) substrate. Photocrosslinking experiments with pre-tRNA bound to RNase P reconstituted with the protein {{component of}} Bacillus subtilis <b>ribonuclease</b> <b>P</b> (P protein) site specifically modified with a crosslinking reagent indicate that: (i) the central cleft of P protein directly {{interacts with the}} single-stranded 5 ′ leader sequence of pre-tRNA, and (ii) the orientation and register of the pre-tRNA leader sequence in the central cleft places the protein component {{in close proximity to}} the active site. This unique mode of interaction suggests that the catalytic active site in RNase P occurs near the interface of RNA and protein.

It represents an important macromolecular complex and model system that is universally distributed in life. Its putative origins have inspired fundamental hypotheses, including the proposal of an ancient RNA world. Results: To study the evolution of this complex, we constructed rooted phylogenetic trees of RPR molecules and substructures and estimated RPP age using a cladistic method that embeds structure directly into phylogenetic analysis. The general approach was used previously to study the evolution of tRNA, SINE RNA and 5 S rRNA, the origins of metabolism, and the evolution and complexity of the protein world, and revealed here remarkable evolutionary patterns. Trees of molecules uncovered the tripartite nature of life and the early origin of archaeal RPRs. Trees of substructures showed molecules originated in stem P 12 and were accessorized with a catalytic P 1 -P 4 core structure before the first substructure was lost in Archaea. This core currently interacts with RPPs and ancien...|$|E
