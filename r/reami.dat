In 1987 Sermonti was one of the founding members of the Osaka [...] "Group for the Study of Dynamic Structure" [...] which holds the view of process structuralism, a view which is not widely held.|$|E

Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ACS, with data on BTs, were selected from the BleeMACS registry. The primary end point was the incidence of myocardial infarction during hospitalization (<b>reAMI),</b> the secondary end-points were 30 -day mortality and the combined end-point of 30 -day mortality and <b>reAMI.</b> Sensitivity analyses were performed according to clinical presentation (STEMI vs. NSTE-ACS). Overall, 13, 975 patients were included: mean age was 64. 1 years, 10, 651 (76. 2 %) were male and 7711 (55. 2 %) had STEMI. BTs were administered during hospitalization to 465 (3. 3 %) patients, who were older and presented a more relevant burden of risk factors. The primary end-point of <b>reAMI</b> occurred in 197 (1. 4 %) patients, of whom 102 (1. 1 %) with STEMI. After controlling for confounding variables, BTs independently predicted the primary end-point <b>reAMI</b> in patients admitted for STEMI (OR 4. 059, 95 % CI 2244 - 7. 344) and not in those admitted for NSTE-ACS. Moreover, BTs independently related to 30 -day mortality in STEMI and NSTE-ACS patients and to the composite of 30 -day mortality and <b>reAMI</b> in STEMI patients. In patients undergoing PCI for ACS, BTs {{increase the risk of}} <b>reAMI</b> only in those admitted for STEMI, and not in those with NSTE-ACS. These results may help physicians to choose appropriate BT administration according to the admission diagnosi...|$|E

Section 2 (The hell) : The fundaments of Science Section 3 (The Purgatory) : The discordances in Science Section 4 (The Paradise) : A new model This model hypothesizes that the {{universe}} was originated from a very large spectrum of waves F and evolves through the action of waves Fi belonging to F. The book follows {{the evolution of the}} universe: a) 0. 01 sec. after the big bang radiative forces transformed themselves in electrons, protons and neutrons; 900 millions later appeared the electromagnetic waves and the light, 3. 8 billions of years ago, an electromagnetic wave excited the organic matter down the ocean generating the life. In this realm a radiation combine two molecules of Hydrogen and one of Oxygen generating water; some radiations belonging to the spectrum of visible caused the most important natural phenomenon: the photosynthesis and thence the appearance of Oxygen. This gas will filter the extreme u. v. radiations allowing the growth of the realm of animals. 2. 400 millions years ago, a radiation caused the mutation of the gene MHY 16 of a hominid generating the man. From what above the birth and the evolution of the universe would had been determined and governed by radiating forces. b) In extreme conditions, black holes become elementary particles and viceversa (Palumbo 2005). c) The Fi waves generated the heavy particles appeared with the Big Bang, which sudden decayed into light particles. d) The Fi transmit musical messages, i. e. electric charges of the particles. e) The activity of the brain may be excited by resonant interactions among external waves Fi and internal electromagnetic waves. f) The identification of the body is asserted by the interaction between the nervous and the immunitary systems. g) F = where F denotes the universal original waves that originated the Big Bang and all the partial Fi waves, belonging to F, which originated, successively, the inert matter and the realms of Life and of Thought. The major discoveries of the 20 ° Century came from the nuclear physics: i. e. from the studies of the smallest particles and the greatest energies. The worth of the energy of Fi is related to the smallness of the masses and of the wave length Dalla Fisica alla Metafisica Il libro è diviso in quattro capitoli. Il primo (Il limbo) riporta una breve sintesi della storia della Conoscenza, il secondo (l’inferno) i fondamenti del pensiero scientifico e filosofico, il terzo (il purgatorio) le discrepanze insite negli approcci della cultura, il quarto (il paradiso) un nuovo modello interpretativo della realtà comprensiva dei <b>reami</b> dell’inerte, del vivente e del pensante. Il modello è sintetizzato nella precedente versione inglese di questo sommario...|$|E
