50|$|Full Body Spinner - Taking {{the concept}} of the spinner to the extreme, a full body spinner (AKA shell spinner or tuna can spinner) rotates the entire outer shell of the robot as a stored energy weapon. Other robot {{components}} (batteries, weapon motor casing) may be attached to the shell to increase the spinning mass while keeping the mass of the drive train to a minimum. Full body spinners require time to spin the weapon up to speed, typically cannot self-right, and can be unstable (BattleBots competitor Mauler being an infamous example). The 1995 US Robot Wars heavyweight co-champion Blendo was the first effective full body spinner. A variant, the <b>ring</b> <b>spinner,</b> features a narrower spinning ring surrounding the robot; these designs have the advantage of being invertible. BattleBots 2016 competitor The Ringmaster {{is an example of a}} <b>ring</b> <b>spinner.</b>|$|E
50|$|Murphy {{was born}} April 13, 1894 {{probably}} in Warren, Rhode Island, though some sources indicate {{that she was}} born in Canada. Her parents were Mary (née Garan) and John Murphy; her father was a mill hand and also a semi-pro baseball player. Lizzie was athletic and was a runner, skater, and swimmer, besides playing baseball. By age 12, she had quit school and gone to work at the Parker Woolen Mill as a <b>ring</b> <b>spinner.</b> In her spare time, she played baseball with the Warren Silk Hats and the Warren Baseball Club. By age 15, she was playing on the local men's business amateur league teams, such as the Warren Shoe Company.|$|E

50|$|Less {{skilled workers}} in the cotton {{industry}} were generally not allowed to join the Amalgamation, instead forming their own unions. Female <b>ring</b> <b>spinners</b> were represented by the expansionist Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing and Ring Room Operatives while the powerloom weavers were represented by the Amalgamated Weavers Association which had 114000 members.|$|R
50|$|Barnard Mills is an {{historic}} mill at 641-657 Quarry Street in Fall River, Massachusetts. Developed beginning in 1874, {{it was the}} first mill to use <b>ring</b> <b>spinners</b> instead of mule spinners, and was a major local employer until its closure in 1939. The complex has been redeveloped as a commercial retail space called Tower Mill. The mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|R
50|$|The union {{represented}} {{a wide range}} of workers in the textile industry, and did not discriminate on the basis of occupation or skill. The core of the union's membership were the strippers and grinders, skilled adult male mechanics, who maintained the carding engines. Almost all strippers and grinders were union members. The CWA also organised less skilled female <b>ring</b> <b>spinners</b> and other mill operatives. From 1904 onwards the only members required to have completed an apprenticeship were the strippers-and-grinders.|$|R
40|$|The bobbin change appts., {{particularly}} for condenser bobbins in a carded yarn double-sided <b>ring</b> <b>spinner,</b> has a feed pivoting on a generally horizontal axis on {{a frame of}} the spinner, with a holder for the condenser bobbin to be filled. A removal and advance mechanism moves in a generally vertical direction within the frame to engage the bobbin holder. The feed pref. has two symmetric swing clips at a gap from each other, each with a holder for the bobbin at the opposite ends to the swing axis, displaced by about {{the width of the}} condenser bobbin. Each holder is a shaped section, with a recess at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the clip, above a hook, so that the recess runs conically towards the hook. ADVANTAGE - The appts. gives an automated bobbin exchange action...|$|E
40|$|New data on {{individual}} worker’s outputs show that New England <b>ring</b> <b>spinners</b> exhibited substantial {{on the job}} learning c. 1905. Despite this, variable capital-labour ratios meant high labour turnover reduced aggregate labour productivity only fractionally. The combination of variable capital-labour ratios and piece rates meant low average experience levels did not raise unit costs. This made firms willing to hire all comers, so immigrants readily found work. Equally firms were indifferent to labour turnover, so female workers could move between home and market work. As such piece rates were as an appropriate and successful labour market institution for this period...|$|R
50|$|Nathaniel Ffarington Eckersley (1857-1935) {{built the}} Western Mills at the Eckersley Mills complex. He {{realised}} {{the potential of}} ring spinning {{and became one of}} the biggest <b>ring</b> <b>spinners</b> in Lancashire. He served as mayor of Wigan, and as captain in the Boer War. He amalgamated his mill interests with his grandfather's ocompany to form Eckersley's Ltd. He settled at Wem, Shropshire. In 1927 he gave the Leyland Free Library & Museum a memorial case, collected by his brother James Carlton. One year later, he opened the Eckersley Gardens at Poolstock, a memorial seat was placed in memory of his father. He was appointed High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1919.|$|R
50|$|A spinner {{is a large}} {{circle that}} takes {{up most of the}} play field when it appears. A ring like the {{approach}} circle of hit circles and sliders will also appear and begin to close on the spinner's center. Players must hold down the hit button and spin their cursor around the center of the spinner. As players continue to spin, the spinner gauge at either side of the screen begins to fill, and once it has been filled, the player will be notified that the spinner has been cleared. Continued spins after this and until the <b>ring</b> reaches the <b>spinner's</b> center will award bonus points.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{built with}} {{anywhere}} {{between 3 and 7}} spokes, torch wick fans {{are a common}} choice for fan spinners of all levels. They are commonly built of aluminum or steel, each with their own pros and cons. Fans are most often built with at least one ring {{at the base of the}} fan, though some fans have multiple rings, or none at all. Rings can differ greatly in size from fan to fan (Diameter: 3-10 cm), and it's not uncommon to see a fan with multiple rings of different sizes. There are also cultural differences. North American tech fan spinners tend to use a small one-finger <b>spinner</b> <b>ring,</b> while Russian tech spinners tend to use a ring large enough to pass the entire hand through.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the rings}} were multifunctional, having a feature beyond just being jewelry. All were [...] "one size fits all". Quite a few had [...] "secret compartments," [...] and others had {{built-in}} siren whistles. Some rings were composed {{in whole or in}} part of luminous materials. A premium from Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy program, offered in 1940, was a ring called the Dragon's Eye Ring, with images of crocodiles supporting a greenish [...] "stone" [...] made of Tenite. The molds for the ring were later used for two other premiums, one for Buck Rogers in the Twenty-Fifth Century, issued in 1947. The new ring was called the Buck Rogers Ring of Saturn, and had a red [...] "stone" [...] rather than the green one in the original. About the same time, a third ring, but with a black stone, was issued by Carey Salt for their sponsorship of The Shadow. (another sponsor, Blue Coal, offered an entirely different luminous-plastic ring.) Some rings had a hidden mirror for a [...] "look behind" [...] feature. Programs that offered such Look-Around rings included Tom Mix Ralston Straight Shooters, Captain Midnight, and The Lone Ranger. Other <b>rings</b> had <b>spinners,</b> photo viewers, ballpoint pens, magnifiers, signal blinkers, flashlights, etc.|$|R
40|$|Using {{accounting}} records and financial data, a business {{history of the}} Lancashire textile industry from 1870 to 1914 is presented. Issues of technology and industry structure, which have attracted {{a great deal of}} comment are first re-addressed. The discussion is then widened to include other aspects of the industry which have previously been neglected, namely the social processes of capital accumulation with reference to those evolving relationships between managers and shareholders which, in the context of broader economic change, helped forge the special characteristics of Lancashire capitalism. The industry is found to be generally healthy and competitive, although its fortunes were dangerously dependent on the overseas value of the pound. Whilst the original technologies of the industrial revolution were maturing, the alternative twentieth century means of automated throughput had still not been developed. External economies and flexibility associated with vertical specialisation thus continued to outweigh those of integrated throughput production. Meanwhile a transformation of the industry occurred in terms of its ownership, as the previously influential small shareholder was forced to surrender influence to a rising class of promotional and financial capitalists, a trend accentuated by, inter alia, a very serious stock exchange crash in the 1890 s which forced many to sell their holdings. A shift of industry value added from labour to capital and record profits after 1900 are identified. These attracted capital into cotton and reinforced the position of the newer owners of the industry. Important features of their behaviour are examined, primarily their ability to construct impressive business empires through personal shareholdings and interference in day to day management, and their corresponding reluctance to establish professional management hierarchies, which, although increasingly common in other industries, were compromised by preference for individual, and not corporate, accumulation. Characterised as they were by their easy access to financial resources, these new capitalists might well have made sweeping changes to industry structure and technology had they chosen to do so. However, although ring spinning was found to be in general more profitable, the basis of that superiority was an extension of the process of increased specialisation. All specialised companies, whether <b>ring</b> <b>spinners,</b> mule spinners, or weavers, tended to do much better than their vertically integrated counterparts in the period after 1900. Evidence from this period has implications for our understanding of subsequent developments. If the industry could have been restructured before 1914, then so it could have been after the First World War when it arguably became more necessary. Pre 1914 technical constraints are identified and it is also noted that it was in the inter-war period that the means to remove them were fully developed. However, considering technical issues in conjunction with characteristics of capital ownership, it is concluded that, as the industry failed to attract investment when profit signals turned negative, for example in the 1890 s, and attracted a lot of capital in the booms of the early 1900 s, any constraint did exist to prevent restructuring it was financial rather than organisational. The process and character of capital accumulation is therefore advanced as a crucial ingredient of our understanding of business history. In short, the established financial, technical, and organisational structure, when combined with buoyant overseas monetary and trading conditions, is found to have created the synthesis of a profitable industry; when external conditions changed, financial, technical, and organisational constraints became important but in that strict and steeply descending order. Lancashire was highly vulnerable to the world market; that vulnerability was accentuated by the way in which capital was created. It was the social process of capital accumulation which was the principal determinant of the development, and perhaps therefore ultimately the decline, of a once great industry...|$|R
