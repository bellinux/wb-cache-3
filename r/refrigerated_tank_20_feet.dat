For the purpose of this presentation, low head will be construed as less than 8 inches (20 cm) total head for the system. Total head can be defined as the sum of the head required by each component in the recycle path. A low head recirculating aquaculture system has been designed, constructed, and is being tested at the Vriginia Tech Aquaculture Lab. Each recirculating system contains two grow-out tanks; a filtration vessel containing a microscreen drum filter; and four rotating biological contactor (RBC) biofilters; sixteen airlift pumps (eight per tank); a regenerative blower with air lines, vacuum lines, and air distribution manifold; a discharge pipe; and a fresh water supply. Each grow-out <b>tank</b> (<b>20</b> <b>feet</b> [6. 1 m] long, 5 feet [1. 5 m] wide, and 3. 3 feet [1 m] deep) holds 2468 gallons (9342 liters). The filtratio...|$|R

50|$|The {{house is}} set in {{established}} gardens with mature trees and still features {{some of the early}} outdoor structures and landscapes. The circular driveway {{at the front of the}} house is marked by the raised circular lawn with lantana hedge. Evidence of the former sweep of the driveway can be seen in the slight depression of the grounds to the north-west of the house. A landscaped garden on the northern side of the house consists of geometric garden beds set in concrete with concrete paths dating from about 1915. This area is lined by mature palms along its rear edge. A shed stands a short distance to the rear of this garden and includes some 19th century decoration, namely cast iron brackets. This was once the glass house and now stands as a timber framed structure with weatherboard cladding and a corrugated iron roof. There is also an underground brick water <b>tank,</b> <b>20</b> <b>feet</b> deep, the top of which is visible on the back lawn. This water tank is fed by another tank in the centre of the roof of the house not visible from the ground. This roof tank catches the rain water which is then diverted into the underground tank. Similar tank constructions can be seen at nearby Baddow House and they date from the time of construction.|$|R
