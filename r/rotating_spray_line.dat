40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study evaporation and drift losses (EDLs) with two types of sprinklers: <b>rotating</b> <b>spray</b> plate sprinklers (RSPS) and fixed spray plate sprinklers (FSPS), both installed at two different heights (1 and 2. 5 m above the ground). A field test was carried out during three seasons at an irrigated plot with a centre pivot, in Albacete (Spain). The results show that EDLs were significantly higher with the FSPS placed 2. 5 m above the ground (FSPS 2. 5) than with the RSPS placed 1 m above the ground (RSPS 1). The EDLs obtained for the FSPS 2. 5 combination were 8 % for night irrigation events and 13. 7 % for daytime irrigation events. The lowest EDL values were registered with RSPS 1, ranging from 3. 3 to 8. 2 % under night and day operation conditions, respectively. These results were obtained for an average wind speed of 1. 3 m/s at night and 3. 5 m/s during the day, and were normally below 5 m/s. <b>Rotating</b> <b>spray</b> plate sprinklers Fixed spray plate sprinklers Sprinkler irrigation Drop diameter...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} efficient means of conditioning Ponderosa Pine to relieve c a se hardening stresses. Comparative tests revealed that conditioning time could be reduced from 24 hours to 4 hours by cooling lumber prior to conditioning, by injecting water into the steam <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> and by increasing the quantity of steam. Cooling lumber and injecting water are two effective means of achieving saturated conditions at high t e m p era t u r e s during conditioning.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{cleaning}} and verifying the cleanliness {{of the interior}} surfaces of hollow items, such as small bottles, tanks, pipes and tubes, employs a <b>rotating</b> <b>spray</b> head for supplying a gas-liquid cleaning mixture to the item's surface at a supersonic velocity. The spray head incorporates a plurality of nozzles having diverging cross sections so that the incoming gas-liquid mixture is first converged within the spray head and then diverged through the nozzles, thereby accelerating the mixture to a supersonic velocity. In the preferred embodiment, three nozzles are employed; one forwardly facing nozzle {{at the end of}} the spray head and two oppositely facing angled nozzles exiting on opposite sides of the spray head which balance each other, and therefore impart no net side load on the spray head. A drive mechanism is provided to <b>rotate</b> the <b>spray</b> head and at the same time move the head back and forth within the item to be cleaned. The drive mechanism acts on a long metal tube to which the spray head is fixed, and thus no moving parts are exposed to the interior surfaces of the items to be cleaned, thereby reducing the risk of contamination...|$|R

30|$|In {{bridging}} transfer, {{the molten}} metal grows until it touches the weld pool. A short circuit occurs and current rises; thus, the constriction and the breaking detach the droplet. In flight transfer, no contact {{exists between the}} electrode wire and the weld pool (Li and Zhang 2007). If the size of drops detached from the electrode to the molten weld pool is smaller than {{the diameter of the}} electrode wire, the arc mode is projected spray. If the molten metal from the electrode rotates, it is called <b>rotating</b> <b>spray</b> arc. Projected spray is mostly called spray arc to simplify the terminology (Robert and Messler 2004). Characteristics that are generally typical of a projected spray arc are steady detachment, low spatter, constant size of the droplet, and direct droplet transfer. Therefore, this mode of arc is preferred in conventional GMAW (Li and Zhang 2007).|$|R
30|$|Following {{the first}} {{classification}} of arc types in 1976 (Lancaster 1984), several further classifications have been proposed. Short arc, globular arc, and spray arc {{are the three}} major classifications of arc types by the American Welding Society (AWS) (Iordachescu and Quintino 2008). The International Institute of Welding (IIW), in 1984, divided spray arc types into the three categories: (i) drop spray or projected <b>spray,</b> (ii) <b>rotating</b> <b>spray,</b> and (iii) streaming spray (Iordachescu and Quintino 2008; Lancaster 1986). Norrish (2003) and then Ponomarev et al. (2003) modified this categorization. Utilization of digital control of power sources has led to many improvements in arc control, especially in welding with short and pulsed arcs. Digital control increases the reaction speed of the power source inverter {{and the use of}} sophisticated software makes it possible to directly influence the arc (Weman 2003; Iordachescu and Quintino 2008).|$|R

The results of the evaluation suggest that the treatment is very effective in removing above surface paint and rubber deposits {{to the point that}} pavement skid resistance is restored to trafficked but uncontaminated runway surface skid resistance levels. Aircraft operating problems created by runway slipperiness are reviewed along with an assessment of the contributions that pavement surface treatments, surface weathering, traffic polishing, and rubber deposits make in creating or alleviating runway slipperiness. The results suggest that conventional surface treatments for both portland cement and asphaltic concrete runways are extremely vulnerable to rubber deposit accretions which can produce runway slipperiness conditions for aircraft operations as or more slippery than many snow and ice-covered runway conditions. Pavement grooving surface treatments are shown to be the least vulnerable to rubber deposits accretion and traffic polishing of the surface treatments examined...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{sprinklers}} used in lawn irrigation, pop-up spray heads and rotors. Spray heads have a fixed spray pattern, while rotors have one or more streams that <b>rotate.</b> <b>Spray</b> heads are used to cover smaller areas, while rotors are used for larger areas. Golf course rotors are sometimes so large that a single sprinkler is combined with a valve and called a 'valve in head'. When used in a turf area, the sprinklers are installed with {{the top of the}} head flush with the ground surface. When the system is pressurized, the head will pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and shuts off that zone. Once there is no more pressure in the lateral line, the sprinkler head will retract back into the ground. In flower beds or shrub areas, sprinklers may be mounted on above ground risers or even taller pop-up sprinklers may be used and installed flush as in a lawn area.|$|R

Once the hydrocarbon content reaches 5% (lower flammability range of methane) the inert gas is redirected to shore via a pipeline and manifold connection by the HD (high duty) compressors.

The water distribution, wind drift, and evaporation losses during the evaluations were measured under low, medium, and high wind speed conditions with three nozzle diameters and two nozzle heights above the soil surface. Individual spray sprinkler water distributions were mathematically overlapped to simulate the water distribution resulting from sprinkler machines. The water distribution of the RSPS had a conical shape, whereas the FSPS concentrated the water application in a circular crown. The uniformity coefficient of the simulated water application in sprinkler machines fitted with RSPSs or FSPSs was > 93 % in all cases. However, the RSPS could attain a higher uniformity coefficient at higher spacing along the lateral. For the nozzle diameters of 6. 7 and 7. 9 mm, the wetted width produced by the RSPS was larger {{than that of the}} FSPS. Also, the peak instantaneous precipitation rate of the RSPS was smaller than that of the FSPS.

40|$|To {{predict the}} effect of the liquid rocket engine {{combustion}} chamber conditions on the impingement spray, the conventional uncoupled spray model for impinging injectors is extended by considering the coupling of the jet impingement process and the ambient gas field. The new coupled model consists of the plain-orifice sub-model, the jet-jet impingement sub-model and the droplet collision sub-model. The parameters of the child droplet are determined with the jet-jet impingement sub-model using correlations about the liquid jet parameters and the chamber conditions. The overall model is benchmarked under various impingement angles, jet momentum and off-center ratios. Agreement with the published experimental data validates the ability of the model to predict the key spray characteristics, such as the mass flux and mixture ratio distributions in quiescent air. Besides, impinging sprays under changing ambient pressure and non-uniform gas flow are investigated to explore {{the effect of}} liquid rocket engine chamber conditions. First, a transient impingement spray during engine start-up phase is simulated with prescribed pressure profile. The minimum average droplet diameter is achieved when the orifices work in cavitation state, and is about 30 % smaller than the steady single phase state. Second, the effect of non-uniform gas flow produces off-center impingement and the <b>rotated</b> <b>spray</b> fan by 38 °. The proposed model suggests more reasonable impingement spray characteristics than the uncoupled one and can be used as {{the first step in the}} complex simulation of coupling impingement spray and combustion in liquid rocket engines...|$|R

In seed processing, seeds are commonly coated with a protective coating layer consisting of fertilisers and crop protection products. Rotary drum batch coaters are typically used for this purpose. The coater consists of a cylindrical vessel with a <b>rotating</b> <b>spray</b> disk in the centre, onto which the coating liquid is fed. The seeds are driven around the vessel by its rotating base, and are mixed by two baffles; one {{on either side of}} the vessel. In the present study, DEM simulations are used to analyse the seed coating process. Corn seed is used as a model material and its shape is captured using X-Ray micro-tomography (XRT). The shape is incorporated into the simulations by the clumping multiple spheres to form a particle assembly. The coating uniformity of the seeds is predicted by implementing a coating model, whereby the coating mechanism is represented in the DEM by considering that once a droplet contacts a corn seed, it is removed from the simulation and its mass is attributed to the coating mass of the corn seed. The distribution of mass of sprayed spheres on the corn seeds and the coefficient of variation are evaluated for a range of process conditions, such as spinning disk rotational speed, droplets size and baffle arrangement and designs. In addition to evaluation of coating uniformity of particles, the scale-up rules for rotary drum batch coaters are investigated and reported. The outcome provides guidelines on scale-up rules and improvement of coating uniformity for rotary batch seed coaters...|$|R
40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{landfill}} leachate {{must be removed}} and treated to maintain landfill cover integrity and to prevent contamination of surface and ground waters. From 2003 to 2007, we studied an onsite disposal system in Ottawa County, Michigan, where leachate was spray irrigated on the vegetated landfill cover. We established six 20 -m-diameter circular experimental plots on the landfill; three were spray irrigated {{as part of the}} operational system, and three remained as untreated control plots. We quantified the effects of leachate application on soil properties, soil solution chemistry, vegetative growth, and estimated solute leaching. The leachate had high mean levels of electrical conductivity (0. 6 – 0. 7 S m– 1), Cl (760 – 900 mg L– 1), and NH 4 –N (290 – 390 mg L– 1) but was low in metals and volatile organic compounds. High rates of leachate application in 2003 (32 cm) increased soil electrical conductivity and NO 3 –N leaching, so a sequential rotation of spray areas was implemented to limit total leachate application to 3 ̆c 9. 6 cm yr– 1 per spray area. Concentrations of NO 3 –N and leaching losses remained higher on irrigated plots in subsequent years but were substantially reduced by spray area rotation. Leachate irrigation increased plant biomass but did not significantly affect soil metal concentrations, and plant metal concentrations remained within normal ranges. <b>Rotating</b> <b>spray</b> areas and timing irrigation to conform to seasonal capacities for evapotranspiration reduced the localized impacts of leachate application observed in 2003.

We explored the use of cold aerosol foggers and misting machines for area-wide applications of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (VectoBac WDG) as a larvicide targeting Aedes albopictus. During 2010 – 2013 we performed initially open field trials and then 19 operational area-wide applications in urban and suburban residential areas in northeastern USA to test three truck-mounted sprayers at two application rates. Area-wide applications of WDG in open field conditions at 400 and 800 g/ha killed on average 87 % of tested larvae.

40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} how a separate conditioning chamber can make progressive kilns more efficient. The 2 - zone progressive kilns have a decreasing {{wet bulb depression}} in the second zone, which leads to low moisture spread even without conditioning chamber. With a separate conditioning chamber the capacity can, however, be increased by shortening the drying time. This is possible since the conditioning phase {{can be adapted to}} get a good drying quality without tensions in the cross section of the board. If needed the conditioning chamber can also be used as to extend the drying time which is useful especially when the board dimensions in the kiln is changed. The conditioning face also reduces the moisture spread with 50 % compared to batches from chamber kilns with target moisture content is around 18 %. When the drying is performed in a level of wet bulb temperatures over 60 °C there is less problems with cracks on thicker boards because of the plastic behavior on the wood surface. Progressive kilns with conditioning face can therefore produce greater volumes then from separate chamber kilns with equal quality concerning slicing test gap and even moisture spread. The technical performance of the conditioning chamber was very god on the pilot kiln. The conditioning chamber opens one door on each side when the loading starts, which influence the climate. It was, however, not any problem to get a stable climate after loading/unloading a tray in the conditioning chamber throughout the experiments, but the <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> must be in perfect condition to reach the wet bulb temperature fast enough.
