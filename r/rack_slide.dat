5000|$|Rack slides are {{specifically}} intended for mounting equipment into 19-inch racks or 23-inch racks. These can be friction bearing, ball bearing, or roller bearing. They are sized {{to fit into}} racks with mounting flanges on the ends to mate to the mounting holes in racks. In some cases, one mounting flange is formed into the <b>rack</b> <b>slide</b> with an adapter bracket attached {{to the other end}} to accommodate different depths of the rack. The outer fixed member is attached to the rack and the inner moving member is generally screwed {{to the side of the}} mounted equipment. Rack slides are typically compound or 3-part slides allowing full extension of the mounted equipment and generally include provision for sliding the inner member completely free to allow removal of the equipment from the rack. They can also include stops to prevent accidentally pulling the equipment out of the rack without releasing the stop mechanism.|$|E

50|$|A {{stowable}} {{rack mount}} monitor is 1U, 2U or 3U high and {{is mounted on}} <b>rack</b> <b>slides</b> allowing the display to be folded down and the unit slid into the rack for storage. The display is visible only when the display is {{pulled out of the}} rack and deployed. These units may include only a display or may be equipped with a keyboard creating a KVM (Keyboard Video Monitor). Most common are systems with a single LCD but there are systems providing two or three displays in a single rack mount system.|$|R
50|$|Slides can be {{constructed}} with two sections or multiple sections. A slide with two sections can only extend approximately 3/4 of the total compressed slide length. A compound slide typically has three sections: fixed, floating intermediate member, and the section attached to the equipment. A compound slide can extend {{at least as far}} as the compressed slide length and typically a bit more. In the case of <b>rack</b> <b>slides,</b> this allows the equipment to extend completely out of the rack allowing access for service or connection of cables and such to the back of the equipment.|$|R

50|$|The pistol {{also has}} {{a new set of}} sights. Springfield {{upgraded}} the front sight to a red fiber optic. The rear sight is still a two dot, though its profile has been lowered, and is still constructed of steel to facilitate its use in <b>racking</b> the <b>slide.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{statements}} to Braintree police that day, both Amy Bishop and her mother, Judy Bishop, described the shooting as accidental. Police found the shotgun {{to have a}} live round in the chamber. This would have required Bishop to <b>rack</b> the <b>slide</b> of the weapon after shooting her brother to simultaneously eject the spent shell and reload the chamber.|$|R
5000|$|Heavy {{equipment}} or equipment which is commonly accessed for servicing, for which attaching or detaching at all four corners simultaneously would pose a problem, {{is often not}} mounted directly onto the rack but instead is mounted via rails (or slides). A pair of rails is mounted directly onto the rack, and the equipment then <b>slides</b> into the <b>rack</b> along the rails, which support it. When in place, the equipment may also then be bolted to the rack. The rails may {{also be able to}} fully support the equipment in a position where it has been slid clear of the rack; this is useful for inspection or maintenance of equipment which will then be slid back into the rack. [...] Some <b>rack</b> <b>slides</b> even include a tilt mechanism allowing easy access to the top or bottom of rack mounted equipment when it is fully extended from the rack.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of U-matic VCRs were large devices, approximately 30 in wide, 24 in deep, and 12 in high, requiring special shelving, and had mechanical controls limited to Record, Play, Rewind, Fast-Forward, Stop and Pause (with muted video on early models). Later models sported improvements such as chassis sized for EIA 19-inch <b>rack</b> mounting, with <b>sliding</b> <b>rack</b> rails for compressed storage in broadcast environments, solenoid control mechanics, jog-shuttle knob, remote controls, Vertical Interval Time Code (VITC), longitudinal time code, internal cuts-only editing controls, [...] "Slo-Mo" [...] slow-motion playback, and Dolby audio noise reduction.|$|R
50|$|The various terms {{relate to}} the two {{functions}} of the component: while it automatically catches the slide (locking it back) after the magazine's last round has been fired, thereby allowing the user to easily release the slide by pulling down on the switch, it also allows the user to purposefully stop or lock the slide back by pressing up on the switch while <b>racking</b> the <b>slide.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tip-up barrel is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} semi-automatic pistols in which the first round in the chamber is not fed from a magazine, but is inserted directly into the chamber via a barrel which swings upwards to admit it. The particular advantage of the tip-up barrel {{is that it allows}} users to chamber a round who may lack sufficient hand/arm strength to <b>rack</b> the <b>slide</b> on a conventional semi-automatic pistol.|$|R
50|$|A {{new feature}} is HK's {{patented}} charging supports. They are simple components that are mounted {{on each side}} of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for <b>racking</b> the <b>slide</b> rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols use the same steel magazines as the Heckler & Koch P30 in both the 15 and 10-round capacity configurations.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the first}} round is {{manually}} loaded into the chamber by pulling back and releasing the slide mechanism. This is called <b>racking</b> the <b>slide</b> or <b>racking</b> the gun. After the trigger is pulled and the round is fired, the recoil operation of the handgun automatically extracts and ejects the shell casing and reloads the chamber. This mode of operation generally allows for faster reloading and storing {{a larger number of}} cartridges than a revolver.|$|R
50|$|The PM has a DA/SA trigger mechanism. Engaging {{the manual}} safety {{simultaneously}} decocks the hammer if cocked, and prevents movement of slide, trigger and hammer. Both carrying with safety engaged, or with safety disengaged and hammer uncocked are considered safe. The DA trigger pull is heavy, requiring a strong squeeze, trading first shot accuracy for safety. <b>Racking</b> the <b>slide,</b> manually cocking the hammer or firing a cartridge all cock the hammer, setting the trigger {{for the next}} shot to single action. The PM is a semi-automatic firearm, therefore its rate of fire depends on how rapidly the shooter squeezes the trigger. Spent cartridges are ejected some 5.5-6 meters away to the shooter's right and rear. After firing the last round, the slide is held back by the slide stop lever/ejector. Magazines can {{be removed from the}} gun via the heel release, located {{on the bottom of the}} grip. After loading a fresh magazine, the slide can be released by pressing the lever on the left side of the frame or by <b>racking</b> the <b>slide</b> and releasing it; either action loads a cartridge into the chamber and readies the pistol to fire again.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Now most of {{the living}} garbage is transported to landfill. After soaking, waste water come from garbage will flow to the ponds, rivers and farmland. So living garbage {{is one of the}} main reasons of {{agricultural}} pollution. To solve this problem, a new type machine for compressing and packing garbage was designed, which is composed with brace, steering wheel, hopper, transmission, compression, banding, etc. The machine disposed garbage dispersedly. When the operator stamps the pedal, the gear will roll, and the <b>rack,</b> and <b>slide</b> piston will be moved. So the garbage will be compressed, packed, stacked, and can be air-dried. So the water and soil could not be polluted. This treatment of garbage can effectively reduce soil and water pollutio...|$|R

50|$|<b>Sliding</b> <b>racks</b> are {{typically}} {{used for the}} storage of framed works of art, where works are hung {{on a wire rack}} connected to tracks that are suspended from channels on the floor and ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying. This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized {{to make the most of}} the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage. These types of <b>sliding</b> <b>rack</b> systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack. Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames. Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.|$|R
50|$|Single-action handguns have {{a trigger}} whose sole {{function}} is to drop a pre-cocked hammer to discharge a cartridge. For revolvers, the popular Colt Peacemaker of Old West fame is typically thought of. Its hammer must be manually cocked for each shot. For auto-loading pistols the Colt 1911 or Browning Hi-Power are typical examples. They must be cocked for the first shot, but subsequent shots are cocked automatically due to the <b>racking</b> of the <b>slide.</b> These types of guns typically have a very light and crisp trigger pull, making for more accurate target shooting.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{sampling}} services are disposed in a <b>rack</b> which <b>slides</b> into a housing. In {{response to a}} signal from an antenna, the circutry elements are activated which provide power individually, collectively, or selectively to a servomechanism thereby moving an actuator arm and the attached jawed bracket supporting an evaculated tube towards a stationary needle. One open end of the needle extends through the side wall of a conduit to the interior and the other open end is maintained within the protective sleeve, supported by a bifurcated bracket. A septum in punctured {{by the end of}} the needle within the sleeve and a sample of the fluid medium in the conduit flows through the needle and is transferred to a tube. The signal to the servo is then reversed and the actuator arm moves the tube back to its original position permitting the septum to expand and seal the hole made by the needle. The jawed bracket is attached by pivot to the actuator to facilitate tube replacement...|$|R
50|$|The club's current {{boathouse}} {{was built}} in 1953, and by 2009 was in a poor state of repair. Additionally, {{the growth of the}} club since 2005 meant that storage space was at a premium and expansion of existing boat racking was essential. In late-2009 the decision was taken by the University to commit £500,000 to a complete refurbishment of the building. When completed, the new facility will have brand new changing/showering facilities, warm-up/stretching area, kitchen and video analysis/meeting room. The existing boat storage area will be refitted with new <b>sliding</b> <b>racks</b> and a dedicated maintenance bay will be created.

50|$|The WIST-94 is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol chambered for 9mm Parabellum round. It {{uses the}} Browning cam-lug system of operation. The polygonal-rifled barrel is locked to the slide by three locking lugs machined {{into the upper}} part of the barrel. The frame is made from polymer plastic while the slide is constructed from steel. The trigger mechanism is similar to the one used in Glock pistols: striker-fired double-action-only (DAO). After <b>racking</b> the <b>slide</b> back and after each shot fired the striker is held semi-cocked allowing for lighter trigger pull than conventional double-action. The only safety used is an internal automatic firing pin safety that unlocks the firing pin only in the final stages of the trigger pull. The WIST-94 is fed by a 16-round magazine. The magazine release catch is reversible for use by left-handed shooter. The slide release lever is located at the left side of the gun. The sights are fixed and are have self-luminous tritium inserts for low-light situations. The WIST-94L is also equipped with a laser sight mounted in {{the upper part of}} trigger guard. The name of the hand gun sounds, in Polish, very similar to Vis.|$|R
50|$|Wet is {{an action}} game that {{combines}} shooting and swordplay with acrobatics and gore. The main character, Rubi, carries twin pistols and a sword (she can also carry dual shotguns, submachine guns, or crossbows), and can fire while jumping, sliding on her knees, and running on walls. During these acrobatic actions, the game enters slow motion, {{and she will}} automatically aim at a second enemy, allowing the player to shoot at two enemies at once. She can also combine her attacks, such as wall running off a person or performing a sword uppercut while <b>sliding.</b> <b>Racking</b> up kills and collecting multiplier icons gains multipliers, which increase score and {{the rate at which}} Rubi regenerates health. Rubi can also regain health by finding bottles of whiskey.|$|R
25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is to <b>rack</b> the <b>slide,</b> clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to pull the trigger a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Time Ball {{consists}} of a cast iron cylinder, piston, rack and pinion lifting mechanism, safety lock, electric motor and ball. The cylinder is 30cm diameter and 3 m long. Approximately 7 litres of soapy water fills {{the bottom of the}} cylinder to act as a buffer for the piston. The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a bleeder valve to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the <b>rack</b> by a <b>slide</b> gear, which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large hand wheel is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached {{to the top of the}} rack and is raised 2.7 metres.|$|R
5000|$|Similar to the Thunder 380 and Thunder 22, the Thunder 32 has a light {{aluminum}} alloy frame that reduces weight for easier carry, yet the pistol still retains enough mass (weight) to help tame recoil, although recoil is very light using the [...]32 ACP cartridge. Due {{to the small}} frame, the pistol is very well suited for female firers, and males with smaller hands. However, due to its blowback design the recoil spring {{is designed to be}} stronger than usual, which may make it difficult to <b>rack</b> the <b>slide.</b> The magazines, however are designed with an extra section of grip, so that all fingers of the firing hand are accommodated. The blowback, fixed-barrel design theoretically aids accuracy. The nearly straight-in alignment of the chamber and the topmost cartridge in the magazine seems to be responsible for the pistol's reliable chambering and cycling. The frame features a long rearward tang over the grips, which effectively protects the shooter's thumb web from hammer-bite or slide-bite. There are several safety features built into the Thunder 32: a slide mounted manual safety and decocker that blocks the hammer, a magazine disconnect safety that prevents firing if a magazine is not inserted, a long double-action (DA) first trigger pull, an inertial firing pin, and (in some models) an integral key-operated trigger lock. Some versions also feature an automatic firing pin block. The pistol has a rear sight windage adjustment.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{optimization}} of PKMs specifically developed for applications in the MEMS area. Specifically, the mechanism here considered was at first studied {{in collaboration with the}} S. A. M. M. Lab (Space Automation and Manufacturing Mechanisms Laboratory) of the University of Florida and consists of a mobile platform supported by 3 legs, symmetrically positioned around it. Each kinematic chain is P-R-S: the platform is connected to the legs by spherical joints; each leg is then linked to a <b>rack,</b> which <b>slides</b> on a prismatic guide fixed at the base plate, by revolute joints. For the rack actuation the use of the motion devices prototyped and designed by SNL (Sandia National Lab) was adopted. The mechanism is conceived in poly-Si, using surface micromachining techniques and can be competitively applied in the optical transmission field, thanks to the better performance and the positioning accuracy achievable through the sophisticated motion device and the PK architecture. The structure has been analyzed at kinematic and dynamic levels, and then its structural behavior was considered too. In particular, a kinematics optimization was performed, in order to obtain an optimal design in terms of number of DoFs, positioning accuracy and footprint. Analyses results highlighted the advantages of using a simpler variant and the initial architecture configuration has been modified substituting the S-joints with universal joints. Specifically, linking together two couples of revolute joints with orthogonal axes by a L-shape plate, a new configuration of μ−universal joint was designed. The legs have been then rearranged in order to optimise the mobility of the mechanism with respect to its stiffness. Simulations were also performed in the combined multi-body and FEM environments to evaluate stresses in the links and to minimize structural compliances. After a brief introduction to the technological area of MEMS, the potentialities of PKMs applications in the micro world are presented. Successively, the main mechanical design limitations due to manufacturing constraints are discussed and the minimal set of requirements for the feasibility of complex μ-devices is identified. In Sect. 4, the μ−PKM under consideration is described and the variant of the initial architecture proposed, while Sect. 5 provides with the FEM design of critical components. Finally, conclusions are drawn. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{feature of the}} Model 1900 was the sight safety, which while a good idea in theory, did not work out well in execution, and proved to be unpopular. When pushed down the safety blocked the firing pin, when pushed up it performed as the rear sight. This gave an immediate visual indicator of whether the safety was on or off when one went to aim the pistol, without resorting to feeling for the safety lever. The first 1900s were equipped with rear milled slide grooves {{but when it was}} found that this could interfere with the sight safety (one could inadvertently flip the safety on or off while manipulating the slide) the milled slide grooves were moved to the front. This safety was used in about the first 3,000 production pistols. Colt then installed a conventional rear sight and eliminated the sight safety although the cut in the slide remained but was plugged. The grooves, remained {{in the front of the}} slide. There are earlier sight safety M1900s that were factory retrofitted with the new fixed sight. Although Colt considered a new firing pin safety mounted on the left side of the slide with one prototype, it did not produce such a model. This was possibly a mistake as the lack of safety features probably affected sales - the recommended way to carry a safety-less Colt automatic was with an empty chamber, requiring the user the <b>rack</b> the <b>slide</b> to chamber a round before firing - which made it slower to get in action and required two hands, as well as making it impossible to render the weapon safe after firing a partial magazine, without dropping the magazine and extracting the chambered round, itself a dangerous operation in a gun without a safety. This was a major complaint of the military when they tested it, something Colt was for some reason loath to fix in the 1900-1902-1903 series of pistols. The only exception was the new small-sized Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless, a completely new design with a grip and frame thumb safety at the start of production in 1904. It is possible that Colt found it cheaper to introduce the features into a new model, and the sales of the 1903 Pocket Hammerless were spectacular in comparison to the 1900/1902/1903 large frame automatics. By contrast, Mauser C96's and Lugers had manual thumb safeties from the outset.|$|R
40|$|The Pollen Reference Collection of the Laboratory of Palynology and Palaeobotany (LPP) of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia {{is titled}} to Daria Bertolani Marchetti {{who carried out}} to Modena the first slides in 1989. The Reference Collection is {{organized}} in the following sections: 1) Envelopes, with pollen from plant material collected in the field or from herbarium sheets, are 3098, and refer to about 1100 different species. 2) Microtubes, contain acetolysed pollen preserved in glycerol jelly, and are about 1440. 3) Slides are mounted with acetolysed and fresh pollen.

The slides, put into boxes <b>slide</b> <b>rack,</b> are classified according to the morphological criterion (NPC = Number - Position - Character of the apertures - Erdtman, 1969). Their number is about 2000. In the Reference Collection there are three sections: Reference Collection, containing the reference material, described above; Research Collection, relating to materials and sites studied in the laboratory (ca. 22, 000 slides); Educational Collection, containing two types of reference slides: slides with the pollen of a single species and “mixed slides” with more species with the same aperture type, number and position, set up to facilitate the distinction of similar pollen. The Educational Collection includes selected slides with material from research work, e. g. archaeological sites, lake/fluvial sediments, forensic cases, honeys, plant systematics. The use of the collection has been recently improved by a database designated by F. Torri and P. Torri, to search the reference material by taxonomic criteria and/or morphological characteristics. Users can search the database according to a single criterion or a combination of morphological characteristics commonly used to visually identify pollen: aperture, exine ornamentation, size range.

40|$|Author: Matt Lewis ### Notes Alpha {{satellite}} sequences, whilst highly repetitive, {{are specific}} to each individual chromosome. These sequences flank the centromeres and can present a target measured in megabases. In this protocol a biotin or digoxigenin labelled DNA probe is detected using HRP-conjugated antibodies. The signal is visualised with diaminobenzidine (DAB). Normal, healthy nuclei show two spots. Aneusomic nuclei show 1, 3, 4 or more spots. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. A 6 mm section of a paraffin embedded raft culture hybridised to a chromosome 17 specific alpha satellite probe. We buy our probes from Appligene/Oncor although they are very expensive and the telesales staff are rude. ### Starting material We have two types of starting material; (i) tissue culture cells attached to glass slides, (ii) sections taken from paraffin embedded tissue. 1. Tissue culture cells. We use multispot slides with 4 wells separated by PTFE coating. The slides are treated with APES prior to use (see below). The cells are trypsinised and resuspended as usual then one or two drops are placed onto the end well of a labelled slide. The cells are allowed to attach overnight in a humid chamber in the CO 2 incubator. Next day the slides are immersed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin. After 2 days fixation the slides are rinsed in H 2 O and allowed to air dry. Store dry, dust-free. - Paraffin sections. Take 6 mm sections onto APES treated slides (see below) and bake overnight at 60 C. Dewax in Xylene, 2 x 5 minutes. Then immerse as follows; 100 % ethanol 2 x 5 minutes, 90 % Ethanol 5 minutes, 75 % ethanol 5 minutes, H 2 O 2 x 5 minutes and allow to dry. Store dry, dust-free. ### Typical Protocol 1. Immerse the slides in 1 M sodium thiocyanate at 80 C for 10 minutes. Rinse in H 2 O and allow to dry. - *This treatment strips away the histones*. - *If using cheap glass coplin jars, allow to heat up slowly with the water bath, otherwise they crack*. - Treat the slides with 4 mg/ml pepsin at 37 C for 30 minutes. Rinse in H 2 O, 2 x 5 minutes, and allow to dry. - *This opens up the fixed (crosslinked) cytoplasm to allow probe access. Make up 0. 2 M HCl [50 mls H 2 O + 800 ml conc. HCl], weigh out a little pepsin (Sigma P 7012) into a universal and add the 0. 2 M HCl to make 4 mg/ml. Place the slides flat in a humid chamber (eg a large square plastic petri dish) and drop the pepsin gently onto the slide. Then place in the 37 C incubator*. - *This pepsin digestion is the most crucial step. Too little digestion and the probe {{will not be able}} to access the chromosomes. Too much and the morphology will all be chewed up*. - Prepare the hybridisation solution. - *One well of a multispot slide needs 6 ml of hyb with a 13 mm circular coverslip*. - *A square 22 mm coverslip uses 10 - 12 ml*. - *For larger than this you can put two slides face to face (acting as each other's coverslip) with 30 ml of hyb solution*. ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 4. Apply an appropriate amount of hybridisation solution onto the slide and cover with a coverslip. 5. Incubate at 80 C for 10 minutes. This denatures the DNA 6. Transfer to a humid chamber and incubate overnight at 37 C 7. Dip the slides into a coplin jar containing wash solution, allow the coverslips to slide off. Immerse the slides in formamide wash solution for 20 minutes at 42 C. - *We wash in formamide wash solution at 42 C. The wash can be done without formamide at higher temperature (try 0. 25 x SSC at 72 C for 5 minutes) Formamide wash solution: 60 ml formamide TOXIC (Sigma F 7503), 30 ml H 2 O, 10 ml 20 x SSC, 80 ml conc. HCl (to bring the pH to 7) * - *Do not allow the slides to dry at any stage until after DAB detection*. 8. Immerse briefly in PBS to wash, then incubate with blocking solution for 20 minutes at room temperature. - *Lay the slides flat in a humid chamber and drop the solution onto them* - *Do not allow the slides to dry* - *Blocking solution: 100 ml PBS, 2 g BSA (Sigma A 3059), 50 ml Tween 20 *. - *I carefully dry around the tissue (or round the edge of the slide if I cannot see the tissue) with a paper towel to define a wet area for the various washes*. 9. Drain off the blocking solution and replace with mouse anti-biotin antibody diluted 1 : 100 in blocking solution for 40 minutes at 37 C. - *We currently use DAKO antibody #M 0743, 100 - 200 ml per slide*. 10. Wash with blocking solution for 10 minutes 11. Incubate with rabbit anti-mouse HRP antibody diluted 1 : 80 for 40 minutes at 37 C - We use DAKO P 0260 12. Wash with blocking solution for 10 minutes 13. Incubate with swine anti-rabbit HRP antibody diluted 1 : 100 for 40 minutes at 37 C - *We use DAKO P 0217 * 14. Wash in PBS for 5 minutes 15. Detect the signal using Diaminobenzidine (DAB) - *I use DAB tablets (Sigma D 4293) to make 5 ml of DAB solution and then carefuuly drop the DAB onto the slides. DAB is carcinogenic so take care. The signal takes about 10 minutes to develop. If you're lucky you may be able to see tiny spots at low power under the microscope (take care not to dip the lens in the DAB solution) * - *Follow these URLs to learn about safe disposal of DAB:* [[URL] [[URL] 16. Rinse in tap water, stain the nuclei using haematoxylin, de-hydrate through the ethanol series and mount in DPX. - *The length of the haematoxylin stain depends on the kind of haemaotoxylin and how much it has been used. Try 30 secs at first. Check under the low power microscope*. **APES treatment of slides** *This is an alternative to poly-L-lysine treatment.

40|$|The {{application}} of rubber based resistance (RBR) to traditional isoinertial resistance exercises {{as a method}} of manipulating exercise kinematics and kinetics has gained popularity within the strength and conditioning fraternity. However, the tensile properties of RBR have not been thoroughly quantified and practitioners cannot prescribe loading parameters with absolute certainty given the inconsistencies in research methodologies. It was the purpose of this research to a) report the tension-deformation (T-D) characteristics for several sizes of RBR bands and b) determine whether differences exist between free weight (FW) and RBR bench press repetition, set and total set kinematics and kinetics. The T-D and fatigue characteristics of six sets of RBR bands were determined by measuring pre- and post-intervention mean vertical ground reaction forces. Force platform data was sampled at 200 Hz for 5 seconds over a range of ascending and descending displacements. Subsequent to the establishment of the T-D relationship, fourteen well-trained male rugby players performed three sets of six bench press repetitions under three conditions, in a randomised crossover manner. A 50 % 1 RM load was equated between conditions at the apex of the concentric phase. RBR resistance contributed to either 0 % (FW), 20 % (RBR 20) or 40 % (RBR 40) of the total apex resistance. A customised bench, force platform and linear position transducer were used in conjunction with a power <b>rack</b> fitted with <b>sliding</b> safety bars. A pair of RBR bands were attached to either end of a barbell and anchored by the safety bars, accounting for the anthropometrical differences between participants. The force- and displacement-time data were sampled at 200 Hz by a computer based data acquisition and analysis programme. Descriptive data were presented as means ± SD, and the magnitudes of the observed differences, 90 % confidence limits and clinical inferences were interpreted qualitatively. Results showed the T-D relationships exhibited curvilinear properties most appropriately fitted by second-order polynomial functions (R 2 > 0. 99). Analysis of repetition kinematics and kinetics revealed greater force values for both RBR conditions during the middle stages (30 - 70 %) of the concentric phase compared to FW. Total set peak force was greater for RBR 20 than for FW (110 ± 90 % confidence limits, 71 N). However, mean force was greater for FW than for RBR 40 (57 ± 30 N). Repetition power was greater for RBR 40 than for FW and RBR 20 from 10 - 50 % and from 90 - 100 % of the relative concentric displacement. Total set peak power was greater for RBR 40 than for FW (42 ± 58 W) but mean power was greater for FW than RBR 40 (34 ± 39 W). The magnitudes of these effects were considered to be likely (≥ 92. 4 %) meaningful. This investigation indicates that the {{application of}} RBR to an isoinertial bench press leads to decreased concentric force and increased power values during the middle stages and increased force values at the end stages of a repetition. Over multiple sets, RBR increased peak power outputs but decreased mean force and mean power outputs. RBR training may be most appropriate for athletes required to produce power characterised by high velocities such as shot putters compared to those required to produce power characterised by high force outputs such as rugby props. RBR training may be an appropriate periodisation tool to increase power outputs as athletes approach competition...|$|R
40|$|Watergate {{made me a}} lawyer. On August 8, 1974, Richard Nixon {{resigned}} {{the office}} of President of the United States. 1 Three weeks later, I returned to college to begin my junior year. I was a pre-med biochemistry major scheduled {{to spend most of}} the fall semester surrounded by beakers, spectrophotometers, test tube <b>racks,</b> glass <b>slides,</b> and fumes of formaldehyde and acetone. During the summer, as the evidence against the President mounted and impeachment moved from the realm of the fantastic to virtual certainty, the prospect of a life among the petri dishes grew less and less alluring. I will confess that some of this disenchantment undoubtedly arose from a persistent inability, demonstrated in two passes through organic chemistry, to grasp the molecular configurations made possible by the hexagonal geometry of the carbon atom. Nonetheless, the most powerful source of my disquiet was the realization, growing for a year and more as I watched the televised hearings before Senator Sam Ervin 2 ̆ 7 s Watergate Committee, and then the proceedings of the House Judiciary Committee as it agonized toward a vote on articles of impeachment, that I was far more interested in what these men and women were doing than in all the cytosis, osmosis, and symbiosis of all the microorganisms ever spawned. 2 * 6 It was not merely the theater of Watergate that drew me in, though the drama of the thing was undeniable. After all, one can be mesmerized by the grisly spectacle of a train wreck without feeling any urge to become an engineer. What captivated me was the people of Watergate, principally the legislators on the Senate and House committees, but also members of the Watergate Special Prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s Office, and even members of the Nixon administration itself [...] elected or appointed officials, partisan politicians mostly, and certainly no saints [...] who, on balance, acted with firmness, integrity, and restraint. As a Democrat and no special fan of Richard Nixon, 3 my particular heroes were the obvious ones: Archibald Cox, Sam Ervin, Peter Rodino, Barbara Jordan. But I think even then I admired them as much for their caution and their obvious and unfeigned sense of the gravity of the task they had undertaken as for their investigative prowess, their rhetoric, their wit, or their ultimate success in forcing a flawed and corrupt president from office. And even back then, despite my instinctive rooting interest in the Democrats, I came away from Watergate with a deep respect for those Republicans in and out of Congress who [...] despite the personal and political cost [...] insisted on finding the truth, refused to blink at what they found, and finally, sadly, repudiated their own leader. 4 I wanted to be like these people, wanted a part, however small, in the high drama of American public life. The immediately obvious point was that nearly all of the players in Watergate (both the heroes and the villains) were lawyers. And so, in the fall of 1974, I abandoned the study of the natural world, took up the study of history and politics, and resolved to go to law school. Twenty-five years later, after law school, two decades of practice as a trial lawyer, and {{at the beginning of a}} second career as a legal academic, to my immense surprise, I found myself playing a (very) small part in the second presidential impeachment of my lifetime as the co-author of the official statement of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to the House Judiciary Committee on the meaning of “high Crimes and Misdemeanors. ” * 7 5 Of course, we know how that came out. President Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate. 6 By the time this Article reaches print, he will have completed his term. Irremediably stained, but defiant. Disgraced and diminished, but persistently, almost perversely popular. The fall of Richard Nixon was tragedy in the classic sense. A commanding personality clawed to the heights of power and was then brought low when crippling flaws in his character led him into conduct that was a serious affront to democratic government. The Clinton impeachment was vulgar farce. 7 A surpassingly agile politician with an adolescent sex drive and an urge for self-preservation that far outstripped any sense of personal honor was attacked by opponents who missed their quarry and destroyed or diminished themselves by trying to elevate a squalid extramarital sexual encounter into an affair of state. For me at least, the effect of watching Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s descent was all that the ancient Greek commentators on the drama could have wished for in the spectator of a tragedy: pity, terror, catharsis, enlightenment, an aspiration to nobler things. By contrast, the dominant emotion inspired by Bill Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s escape from early retirement was * 8 the urge to bathe with strong disinfectant soap [...] and then to retreat into the countryside to take up beekeeping, or some other occupation as removed as possible from the contemplation of American law and politics. This radical contrast in my reactions to the impeachment controversies that stand at either end of my life in the law so far has led me to ask three questions. First, were the Nixon and Clinton affairs truly as different as my memory makes them? Were the villains of Watergate as villainous and the heroes as heroic as I remember them? Were nearly all the players on both sides of l 2 ̆ 7 affaire Lewinsky as shallow and fatuous as they seemed? Or to put the question in broader historical context, was the impeachment of Bill Clinton truly distinct, not only from Watergate, but from all of the other (fortunately few) occasions on which a president was seriously threatened with removal from office? Second, if the Clinton impeachment really was as bizarre, unprecedented, and unsettling an event as it seemed, how could such a thing have happened? Finally, what are the implications for the future of the presidency, and more generally, for the project of governance in America, of the incredible but incontrovertible fact that a president of the United States was impeached and nearly stripped of his office for lying about sexual infidelity...|$|R
