25|$|After the war a {{substantial}} amount of residential housing, particularly to the east of modern Stoke Newington, in Hackney borough at the time, had been either destroyed or left in such a bad state that it was seen by the urban planners of that era as better to demolish it. Postwar redevelopment has replaced many of these areas with large estates, some more successful than others. Much of this <b>residential</b> <b>redevelopment</b> was planned by Frederick Gibberd, the designer of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|New {{apartment}} buildings and condominium residential development in older commercial and office buildings in, for example, the Scarth Street Mall and the Motherwell Building, show promise of revitalising the city core; the Cornwall Centre, an impressive inner city shopping mall originally with Eaton's and Hudson's Bay Company department stores as its anchors together with large cinemas, {{has not yet}} thrived but growing posh <b>residential</b> <b>redevelopment</b> could spur new vitality if urban crime spilling over from North Central can be stemmed. Former commercial and office facilities along Scarth Street are now strata title apartments.Historic entertainment venues and churches have largely lapsed but the Globe Theatre has relocated from the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts to the Old Post Office on 11th Avenue; {{the conversion of the}} Union Station to a casino and the construction of several new hotels are bringing new night life vitality to the Central Business District, albeit with the urgent caveat that urban crime spilling over from the North Central remains a serious issue.|$|E

2500|$|Worksop - Formerly {{known as}} [...] "Bairnswear" [...] The 36000m2 205.72m X 175m factory first {{opened its doors}} in 1953 as Bairnswear knitwear. The site was a {{relativity}} modern mid 20th century mill which was located on Raymoth Lane and it employed over 1000 employees (1950s-1970s). In the early 1960s it was rebranded as Courtaulds when Bairnswear hit financial difficulty. In 1989 Princess Diana visited the site, {{at the same time}} as she visited to open the new Bassetlaw hospital. Rumours of the site's closure circulated throughout the 1980s and 1990s and this happened in 2000. A small factory shop stayed open for another year selling all its goods off cheaply. During the early 2000s after the mill had ceased production the factory was still in good condition and a buyer was sought. The site deteriorated for three years until Westbury Homes bought it for <b>residential</b> <b>redevelopment</b> in July 2003. In spite of local objections including the MP John Mann to keep the 9 acre site to form another industry, planning permission was granted, asbestos was stripped and the factory demolished in September 2003 - January 2004, and the site has since been redeveloped into residential housing.|$|E

50|$|As Alderman, Bauer was {{a proponent}} of efforts to bring <b>residential</b> and {{commercial}} <b>redevelopment</b> to the neighborhoods in his ward. The community he represented was traditionally working class, and the housing mostly consisted of modest bungalows. However, the neighborhood's central location and proximity to Forest Park began attracting more middle and upper class residents. Developers began demolishing {{some of the older}} single family homes and building attached luxury townhouses. Bauer consistently supported this type of development, although it generated some controversy.|$|R
