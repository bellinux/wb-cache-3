In {{order to reduce the}} cost of wages industrial companies are now considering moving the manufacturing to low-cost countries. To keep up with the competition in the market without moving the manu- facturing abroad, Lean Automation was developed. The concept of Lean Automation is to reduce the perceived complexity with automa- tion and make automation available for new users and in new applica- tions. Haldex Brake Products are situated in Sweden and want to maintain the manufacturing of the automatic brake adjusters in the country. It is a product well-known and highly exposed to the competition in the mar- ket. Due to this situation Haldex are collaborating with Mälardalen University to develop a <b>robotic</b> <b>cell</b> based on the concept of Lean Au- tomation. It will be installed on their assembly line in 2012. The goal with this master thesis is to create a development process for automation, which can enable the company to be more competitive in the market and this by using their own knowledge to develop automat- ed solutions for higher efficiency in the production line. In addition to the development process for automation, programming of the Lean Au- tomation <b>robotic</b> <b>cell</b> is to be conducted. The conducted work in the master thesis was the programming of the <b>robotic</b> <b>cell</b> and the development process for automation.

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 20068 Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 84 - 87. This {{thesis is}} focused on scheduling problems in <b>robotic</b> <b>cells</b> consisting {{of a number of}} CNC machines producing identical parts. We consider two different cell layouts which are in-line <b>robotic</b> <b>cells</b> and robot centered cells. The problem is to find the robot move sequence and processing times on machines minimizing the total manufacturing cost and cycle time simultaneously. The automation in manufacturing industry increased the flexibility, however it is not widely studied in the literature. The flexibility of machines enables us to process all the required operations for a part on the same machine. Furthermore, the processing times on CNC machines can be increased or decreased by changing the feed rate and cutting speed. Hence, we assume that a part is processed on one of the machines and the processing times are assumed to be controllable. The flexibility of machines results in a new class of cycles named pure cycles. We determined efficient pure cycles and corresponding processing times dominating the rest of pure cycles in the specified cycle time regions.
