40|$|Abstract: Micromilling {{of metal}} {{structures}} with ‘thin ’ features represents {{a major challenge}} towards broadening {{the use of this}} technology in a range of microengineering applications, for example in producing multi-channel microstructures, housing for mechanical microdevices, and surgical instruments. The most common thin features seen in microengineering products are <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> <b>webs.</b> This research identifies the main factors affecting the reliability of micromilling technology when employed for the machining of microcomponents incorporating thin features. The general principles that should be followed in designing machining strategies for such features are discussed in this article. Taking these general principles into account, new strategies are proposed to reduce the negative effects of identified factors on part quality and, at the same time, to overcome some of the problems {{associated with the use of}} conventional machining strategies for micromilling of <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> <b>webs.</b> To implement and verify them, initially the milling operations were programmed manually, and then a special CAM module was developed for their automatic generation. Finally, this article reports the validation of the proposed strategies for machining thin features, which was carried out on a specially designed test part...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of fatigue cracks have been {{reported}} at the connection between longitudinal closed <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> cross-beam <b>webs</b> in orthotropic steel decks because of high stress concentrations due to complicated local deformations of the <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> the <b>web.</b> In this study, the local stress behaviors around the weld end adjacent to the cross-beam cutout were analytically investigated. Finite element analyses were conducted by using a full scale model of an actual bridge, where plenty of cracks were detected around the cross-beam cutout, to investigate the deformation modes causing the cracks. Then, the effective cutout configurations to reduce the crack-inducing local stresses were investigated by comparing the local stress in different cutout types...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic forming (EMF), a {{technology}} with advantages of contact-free force and high energy density, generally aims at forming parts {{by using a}} fixed coil and one-time discharge. In this study, multi-stage EMF is introduced to form a panel with stiffened grid ribs. The forming rules of the stiffened panel is revealed via analyzing the distribution and evolution of the simulated stress and strain in the <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> <b>web,</b> where the grid-rib panels were decomposed as the flat panel and two panels with uni-directional ribs (ribs only in X direction or Y direction). It is shown that the forming depth is mainly attributed to the forces on the web, although electromagnetic force is applied on both the <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> the <b>web,</b> especially, large force on the ribs. The ribs are subjected to uniaxial stress parallel to their directions, <b>and</b> the <b>web</b> is subjected to plane stress in the deformation region. Furthermore, the change of the uniaxial stress characteristic in the X-direction ribs {{is influenced by the}} electromagnetic force, reverse bend and inertial effect. The plastic deformation mainly occurs in the Y-direction ribs of the deformation region under a three-direction strain state...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During forging of as-cast for {{fractured}} connecting rod, {{the key is}} {{to determine}} heating temperature and to control cooling speed after forging. They two points are correlated with each other. To assure metal fluidity in the course of striking and forging, fillet should be enlarged at transit between <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> <b>web.</b> Wrought parts shall be subject to normalizing by residual heat from forging process. Its metallographic structure consists of pearlite and ferrite. Content of ferrite should not exceed 35 %. In addition, it should be such that the fraction for volume of ferrite get bigger and grain should be greater and evenly distributed...|$|R
40|$|The 316 C (600 F) {{buckling}} {{behavior of}} superplastically formed/weld-brazed titanium compression panels having advanced shaped stiffeners was investigated. Fabrication {{of the advanced}} shaped stiffeners {{was made possible by}} the increased formability afforded by the superplasticity characteristics of the titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Stiffeners having the configurations of a conventional hat, a beaded web, a modified beaded <b>web,</b> a <b>ribbed</b> <b>web,</b> <b>and</b> a stepped <b>web</b> were investigated. The data from the panel tests include load-shortening curves, local buckling strengths, and failure loads. The superplastic formed/weld-brazed panels with the <b>ribbed</b> <b>web</b> <b>and</b> stepped <b>web</b> stiffeners developed 25 and 27 percent higher buckling strengths at 316 C (600 F) than panels with conventionally shaped stiffeners. The buckling load reductions for panels tested at 316 C (600 F), compared with panels tested at room temperature, were in agreement with predictions based on titanium material property data. The advantage that higher buckling loads can be readily achieved by superplastically forming of advanced stiffener shapes was demonstrated. Application of these advanced stiffener shapes offers the potential to achieve substantial weight savings in aerospace vehicles...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of {{the introduction of the}} intermediate rib is found in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, and there the ridge rib is not carried to the wall rib. It was soon found, however, that the construction of the web was much facilitated by additional <b>ribs,</b> <b>and</b> consequently there was a tendency to increase their number, so that in the nave of Exeter Cathedral three intermediate ribs were provided between the wall <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> the diagonal <b>rib.</b> In order to mask the junction of the various ribs, their intersections were ornamented with richly carved bosses, and this practice increased on the introduction of another short rib, known as the lierne, a term in France given to the ridge rib. Lierne ribs are short ribs crossing between the main <b>ribs,</b> <b>and</b> were employed chiefly as decorative features, as, for instance, in the Liebfrauenkirche (1482) of Mühlacker, Germany. One of the best examples of Lierne ribs exists in the vault of the oriel window of Crosby Hall, London. The tendency {{to increase the number of}} ribs led to singular results in some cases, as in the choir of Gloucester Cathedral, where the ordinary diagonal ribs become mere ornamental mouldings on the surface of an intersected pointed barrel vault, and again in the cloisters, where the introduction of the fan vault, forming a concave-sided conoid, returned to the principles of the Roman geometrical vault. This is further shown in the construction of these fan vaults, for although in {{the earliest}} examples each of the ribs above the tas-de-charge was an independent feature, eventually it was found easier to carve them <b>and</b> the <b>web</b> out of the solid stone, so that the <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> <b>web</b> were purely decorative and had no constructional or independent functions.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{design and}} analysis of composite rudder for DO 228 aircraft. Stress analysis is carried out by employing finite element general purpose software ASKA. Automatic mesh generation and post-processing are carried out by using FEMGEN and FEMVIEW. Stress analysis of existing metallic rudder is carried out to determine permissible deformations in composite rudder. Initial design is based on preliminary design studies carried out earlier. Choice of elements from ASKA library is made from certain test examples. Convergence in maximum displacement is established by considering three different grids. Design variables considered are: geometrical parameters -widths and thicknesses of flanges of spar <b>and</b> <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> thicknesses of <b>webs</b> of spar <b>and</b> <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> lamination parametrs-fibre orientation and stacking sequence in spar, <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> leading edge.

40|$|The {{empennage}} component {{selected for}} this program is the vertical fin box of the L- 1011 aircraft. The box structure extends from the fuselage production joint to the tip <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> includes {{the front and rear}} spars. Various design options were evaluated to arrive at a configuration which would offer the highest potential for satisfying program objectives. The preferred configuration selected consists of a hat-stiffened cover with molded integrally stiffened spars, aluminum trussed composite <b>ribs,</b> <b>and</b> composite miniwich <b>web</b> <b>ribs</b> with integrally molded caps. Material screening tests were performed to select an advanced composite material system for the Advanced Composite Vertical Fin (ACFV) that would meet the program requirements from the standpoint of quality, reproducibility, and cost. Preliminary weight and cost analysis were made, targets established, and tracking plans developed. These include FAA certification, ancillary test program, quality control, and structural integrity control plans...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic forming (EMF), as a {{high-speed}} forming technology {{by applying the}} electromagnetic forces to manufacture sheet or tube metal parts, has many potential advantages, such as contact-free and resistance to buckling and springback. In this study, EMF is applied to form several panels with stiffened <b>ribs.</b> The distributions <b>and</b> variations of the electromagnetic force, the velocity and the forming height during the EMF process of the bi-directional panel with gird ribs are obtained by numerical simulations, and are analyzed via the comparison to those with the flat panel (non-stiffened) and two uni-directional panels (only with X-direction or Y-direction ribs). It is found that the electromagnetic body force loads simultaneously in the <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> the <b>webs,</b> <b>and</b> the deformation of the panels is mainly driven by the force in the ribs. The distribution of force in the grid-rib panel can be found as the superposition of the two uni-directional stiffened panels. The velocity distribution for the grid-rib panel is primarily affected by the X-directional ribs, then the Y-directional <b>ribs,</b> <b>and</b> the variation of the velocity {{are influenced by the}} force distribution primarily and secondly the inertial effect. Mutual influence of deformation exists between the region undergoing deformation and the deformed or underformed free ends. It is useful to improve forming uniformity via a second discharge at the same position. Comparison between EMF and the brake forming with a stiffened panel shows that the former has more advantages in reducing the defects of springback and buckling...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Blenheim {{employed a}} light-alloy monocoque structure using open-section stringers, and {{was constructed in}} three sections. The wing is also built in three section, the center-section of which is bolted and rivetted to the fuselage. The outer wing sections are tapered in chord and thickness. Extensive use of Alclad sheeting is made in elements such as the <b>ribs,</b> skin, flaps, <b>and</b> <b>web</b> reinforcement of the spars. The tail unit is of a cantilever monoplane style, using an all-metal tailplane and fin while the aerodynamically-balanced rudder and elevators use a metal frame covered with fabric. The undercarriage was hydraulically-retracted, with an auxiliary hand-pump for emergency actuation; medium-pressure tyres were used, complete with pneumatically-actuated differentially-control brakes.|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} for structural modeling of airplane wings is presented taking transverse shear effects into account. The kinematic assumptions of first order shear deformation plate theory {{in combination with}} numerical analysis based on simple polynomials which define geometry, construction and displacement approximations lead to analytical expressions for elements of the stiffness and mass matrices and load vector. Contributions from the cover skins, spar <b>and</b> <b>rib</b> caps <b>and</b> spar <b>and</b> <b>rib</b> <b>webs</b> are included as well as concentrated springs and concentrated masses. Limitations of current equivalent plate wing modeling techniques based on classical plate theory are discussed, and the improved accuracy of the new equivalent plate technique is demonstrated through comparison to finite element analysis and test results. Analytical derivatives of stiffness, mass and load terms with respect to wing shape lead to analytic sensitivities of displacements, stresses and natural modes with respect to planform shape and depth distribution. This makes the new capability an effective structural tool for wing shape optimization...|$|R

40|$|During embryogenesis, {{primordial}} {{germ cells}} (PGCs) and somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs) migrate and coalesce {{to form the}} early gonad. A failure of the PGCs and SGPs to form a gonad with the proper architecture not only affects germ cell development, but {{can also lead to}} infertility. Therefore, it is critical to identify the molecular mechanisms that function within both the PGCs and SGPs to promote gonad morphogenesis. We have characterized the phenotypes of two genes, longitudinals lacking (lola) <b>and</b> ribbon (<b>rib),</b> that are required for the coalescence and compaction of the embryonic gonad in Drosophila melanogaster. <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> lola are expressed in the SGPs of the developing gonad, and genetic interaction analysis suggests these proteins cooperate to regulate gonad development. Both genes encode proteins with DNA binding motifs and a conserved protein-protein interaction domain, known as the Broad complex, Tramtrack, Bric-à-brac (BTB) domain. Through molecular modeling and yeast-two hybrid studies, we demonstrate that <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola homo- and heterodimerize via their BTB domains. In addition, analysis of the colocalization of <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola with marks of transcriptional activation and repression on polytene chromosomes reveals that <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola colocalize with both repressive and activating marks and with each other. While previous studies have identified <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola targets in other tissues, we find that <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola are likely to function via different downstream targets in the gonad. These results suggest that <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola act as dual-function transcription factors to cooperatively regulate embryonic gonad morphogenesis...|$|R

30|$|This {{research}} {{has developed a}} reliable mathematical model to predict the effective thermal conductivity of reinforced concrete containing round rebars. However, to increase the adhesion between rebar and concrete, many industries generally use deformed rebars that have <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> nodes. Nevertheless, <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> nodes increase the volume fraction of steel contribution of the bar only slightly. Therefore, this model could be also applicable to reinforced concrete that uses rebars that have <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> nodes, because their effect on volume fraction of steel is probably negligible.|$|R
