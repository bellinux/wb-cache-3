However, the number of unemployed along the line was so great, owing to the ongoing economic problems, {{that the company had}} no difficulty replacing the absent strikers. In response, the strikers resolved to occupy portions of the rail line, and to stop trains from passing unless the company rescinded the wage cuts.|$|E
5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> and benefits for Legionnaires, which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command. These policies applied only to new recruits, but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of new recruits, who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers. Gibbon suggests that from here only a small spark was required to ignite a rebellion.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanitation}} workers' {{strike of}} 1968 {{was a response}} to a restructuring of hours resulting in a new system of pay for the sanitation workers. This new pay plan effectively reduced weekly wages for sanitation workers from $101.40 for 6 days of work (which included time and a half for Saturday) to $73 for 5 days of work. This new plan amounted to a 15% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> per hour and a 28% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> per week. After the walkout, strikers demanded a $0.25 increase in their hourly wage before they would return to work.|$|E

The 1890s were also a period of economic hardship in Australia, the result of which was a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the size of the permanent forces in a number of colonies, decreased training opportunities, <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> for militia and decreased turn out in volunteer units, although this last effect was largely turned around by the mid-1890s when members of the militia and permanent forces who had been turned out due to economic circumstances joined the ranks of the volunteers.|$|R

500|$|In {{his first}} year in office, Hayes was faced with the United States' largest labor {{disturbance}} to date, the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. In order to make up for financial losses suffered since the panic of 1873, the major railroads cut their employees' wages several times in 1877. In July of that year, workers from the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad walked off the job in Martinsburg, West Virginia, to protest their <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>pay.</b> The strike quickly spread to workers of the New York Central, Erie, and Pennsylvania railroads, with the strikers soon numbering in the thousands. Fearing a riot, Governor Henry M. Mathews asked Hayes to send federal troops to Martinsburg, and Hayes did so, but when the troops arrived there was no riot, only a peaceful protest. In Baltimore, however, a riot did erupt on July 20 and Hayes ordered the troops at Fort McHenry to assist the governor in its suppression.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after her}} {{marriage}} to Hurley, Lloyd went to Bournemouth to recuperate from exhaustion. [...] Within days she was back performing in London music halls. From {{the start of the}} new century, music hall artistes and theatre managers had been in dispute over working conditions, a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> and perks, and an increased number of matinée performances. [...] The first significant rift was a 1906 strike, initiated by [...] The Variety Artistes' Federation. The following year, the Music Hall War commenced, which saw the Federation fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music-hall performers. Although popular enough to command her own fees, Lloyd supported the strike, acted as a picket for the strikers and gave generously to the strike fund. To raise spirits, she often performed on picket lines and took part in a fundraising performance at the Scala Theatre. During one demonstration, she recognised someone trying to enter and shouted, [...] "Let her through, girls, she'll close the music hall faster than we can." [...] The singer was Belle Elmore, later murdered by her husband, Dr. Crippen. The dispute ended later the same year with a resolution broadly favourable to the performers. In 1909, Lloyd appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in Dundee where a critic for The Courier noted [...] "Her bright smile and fascinating presence {{has much to do with}} her popularity, while her songs are of the catchy style, perhaps not what a Dundee audience is familiar with, but still amusing and of an attractive style." ...|$|E
40|$|Germany's more {{compressed}} {{wage structure}} is taken by many analysts {{as the main}} cause of the German-US difference in job creation. We find that the US has a more dispersed level of skills than Germany but even adjusted for skills, Germany has a more compressed wage distribution than the US. The fact that jobless Germans have nearly the same skills as employed Germans and look more like average Americans than like low skilled Americans runs counter to the wage compression hypothesis. It suggests that the pay and employment experience of low skilled Americans is a poor counterfactual for assessing how <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> might affect jobless Germans. ...|$|R
