500|$|The {{decision}} {{to proceed with}} the B.2 versions of the Vulcan was made in May 1956. It was anticipated that the first B.2 would be around the 45th aircraft of the 99 then on order. As well as being able to achieve greater heights over targets, it was believed that operational flexibility could be extended by the provision of in-flight <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> and tanker aircraft. The increasing sophistication of Soviet air defences required the fitting of electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment and vulnerability could be reduced by the introduction of the Avro Blue Steel stand-off missile, then in development. In order to develop these proposals, the second Vulcan prototype VX777 was rebuilt with the larger and thinner phase 2C wing, improved flying control surfaces and Olympus 102 engines, first flying in this configuration in August 1957. Plans were in hand to equip all Vulcans from the 16th aircraft onwards with in-flight refuelling receiving equipment. A B.1, XA903, was allocated for Blue Steel development work. [...] Other B.1s were used {{for the development of the}} BOl.6 (later Olympus 200), XA891; a new AC electrical system, XA893; and ECM including jammers within a bulged tail-cone and a tail warning radar, XA895.|$|E
500|$|Heading {{into the}} new season, {{attention}} also focused on the McLaren team and its driver Nigel Mansell. He was initially announced as the partner of Mika Häkkinen; however, {{a week before the}} first race, McLaren announced that Mansell would not compete in the first two races of the new season, as he could not fit into the MP4/10 car. Mansell's arrival at McLaren was due to demand from the team's sponsors, including Philip Morris, whose brand, Marlboro, was on the car, who wanted to enjoy the publicity associated with the [...] World Champion's return even if it meant him performing worse than teammate Häkkinen. His place at McLaren for the first two races was taken by the team's test driver, Mark Blundell, as McLaren worked to build a wider monocoque to accommodate Mansell. McLaren were also concerned about the standard <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> provided for 1995 by suppliers Intertechnique, having suffered a major leak in a test of the new rig outside of its factory. Intertechnique had redesigned the fuel equipment, which was used by all of the teams, {{in the wake of a}} pit lane fire suffered by driver Jos Verstappen during the previous year's German Grand Prix. The new fuel rigs, in addition to being half the size of the 1994, also featured longer nozzles, and were designed to lock onto the car before any fuel could begin to flow. Intertechnique traced the problem to a faulty valve within the equipment, which caused [...] of fuel to leak, and modified the parts accordingly. Intertechnique and the FIA advised the teams to refuel the cars slowly and carefully during pitstops to avoid any further leaks, a situation that was considered unsatisfactory by many of the team principals and mechanics. A new regulation for 1995 also mandated the teams' fuel suppliers to send samples of their fuel to the FIA prior to each Grand Prix, which the governing body would use as a reference when conducting fuel tests at the event itself. Thus only fuel approved by the FIA in advance was allowed; any deviations from the samples on file was not permitted. As before, all cars were subject to routine fuel tests as part of the scrutineering process throughout the weekend to ensure compliance with the sport's technical regulations. The rule change had been proposed by the Elf oil company in 1993 and unanimously supported by the other F1 suppliers in order to speed up the fuel-testing process.|$|E
2500|$|Canada {{purchased}} five Boeing 707s in 1970–71 {{to replace}} the RCAF's [...] CC-106 Yukons in the long range transport role and the CC-109 Cosmopolitan as an executive or short-range transport. [...] The first four aircraft had been built for Western Airlines, but that order was subsequently cancelled; the fifth was bought separately a year later. To fulfil Canada's requirements for aerial refueling, two aircraft were fitted with Beechcraft made probe and drogue refueling pods in 1972. The two sets of <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> was moved from aircraft to aircraft to keep fleet utilization even between the airframes.|$|E
50|$|The RAF used Matadors in {{the flat}} bed form for load carrying. The 6-wheeler Matador Type A with <b>{{refuelling}}</b> pumps and <b>equipment</b> by Zwicky Ltd, {{was used as a}} refuelling tanker, capable of carrying 2,500 Imperial gallons of fuel and also for towing ashore Short Sunderland flying boats at their stations.|$|R
500|$|The 46th {{production}} aircraft and first B.2, XH533, first flew in September 1958 fitted with Olympus 200 engines with [...] thrust, {{six months before}} the last B.1 XH532 was delivered in March 1959. Rebuilding B.1s as B.2s was considered but rejected over cost. Nevertheless, to extend the B.1's service life, 28 were upgraded by Armstrong Whitworth between 1959 and 1963 to the B.1A standard, including features of the B.2 such as ECM <b>equipment,</b> in-flight <b>refuelling</b> receiving <b>equipment,</b> and UHF radio. The second B.2, XH534, flew in January 1959. Powered by production Olympus 201 with [...] thrust, it was more representative of a {{production aircraft}}, being fitted with an in-flight refuelling probe and a bulged ECM tail cone. Some subsequent B.2s were initially lacking probes and ECM tail cones, but these were fitted retrospectively. The first 10 B.2s outwardly showed their B.1 ancestry, retaining narrow engine air intakes. Anticipating even more powerful engines, the air intakes were deepened on the 11th (XH557) and subsequent aircraft. Many of the early aircraft were retained for trials and it was the 12th B.2, XH558, that was the first to be delivered to the RAF in July 1960. Coincidentally, XH558 would also be the last Vulcan in service with the RAF, before being retired in 1992.|$|R

They were equipped with two 5-inch rapid-fire cannons, fore and aft. Unlike the later [...] which had a unique arrangement aft of the superstructure, with a flight deck and a below-decks hangar for two LAMPS helicopters, these two cruisers had only a landing pad aft and basic <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment.</b> There was also a full suite of anti-submarine warfare equipment. Thus, these ships were designed to face all threats, in the air, on the surface, and underwater.|$|E
2500|$|The German Grand Prix {{brought up}} more {{controversy}} leading to further allegations of cheating by Benetton. During a pit stop, the Benetton car of Jos Verstappen {{was set on}} fire during refuelling as the fuel nozzle would not enter the car properly. Verstappen suffered minor burns, with four of the Benetton mechanics also burned. Intertechnique, the company which manufactures the <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> for all the teams, were delegated by the governing body to examine the Benetton factory shortly after the German race. After Intertechnique examined the factory, a statement was released by the FIA. In the statement, the FIA said that [...] "the [...] valve was slow to close {{because of the presence}} of a foreign body" [...] and that a filter designed to eliminate any possible risk of fire had been removed. An estimate by an outside party stated that without the filter, fuel flowed into the car at a 12.5% faster rate than usual, saving one second per pit stop. Benetton issued a press release shortly after, announcing that they had contacted an [...] "independent company specialising in accident investigation" [...] to give opinions on the refuelling method. They also announced that a copy of the FIA report had been sent to Marriott Harrison, their legal advisers. The FIA announced, as a result of their findings, that Benetton would be summoned to a World Motor Sport Council meeting on October 19. On August 11, three days before the Hungarian Grand Prix, Intertechnique representatives said that no request had been sent from Benetton to remove the filter from the nozzle and that they would never authorise Benetton to remove the nozzle. Benetton made a press release on August 13, stating that there was a fault in the equipment provided by Intertechnique.|$|E

50|$|With the {{changeover}} of traction from {{steam to}} diesel and electric locomotives, a comprehensive reorganisation of Bahnbetriebswerke was necessary. Sites {{that were only}} needed {{for the maintenance of}} steam locomotives no longer had any significance. And whilst for the servicing of electric locomotives, hardly any special installations were necessary apart from the erection of catenary in the Bw, the most important measure for the stabling of diesel locomotives was the installation of <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like the Windscale designs, the Magnox {{reactors}} allowed {{access to}} the fuel channels and could be refuelled while operating. This was a key criterion for the design because its use of natural uranium leads to low burnup ratios and the requirement for frequent refuelling. For power use, the fuel canisters were left in the reactor as long as possible, while for plutonium production they were removed earlier. The complicated <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> proved to be less reliable than the reactor systems, and perhaps not advantageous overall.|$|E

50|$|A {{total of}} four flying S.30 series flying boats - Cabot, Caribou, Clyde and Connemara - were {{equipped}} with in-flight <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> and extra fuel tanks in order {{that they could be}} used to provide a regular trans-atlantic airmail service. The concept was for the aircraft to take off at lower weights and, once airborne, take on extra fuel to reach an all up weight of 53000 lb, giving the aircraft a range of over 2500 mi. The extra fuel reduced the payload to 4270 lb against the 6250 lb of the standard aeroplane. The refuelling was performed by three converted Handley Page Harrow bombers, one operating out of Ireland and two out of Newfoundland.|$|E
50|$|Basic groundcrewman {{aircraft}} support training {{consists of}} three individual courses, totalling approximately 19 weeks. The first course conducted is a basic drivers course where soldiers gain qualifications in operating the Army Landrover 110 and Unimog truck. This lasts for 38 days and is held at Puckapunyal in Victoria. The next course to be completed is the two-week bulk fuel tanker course held at the Army Logistic Training Centre at Bandiana in Victoria. This course involves instruction in operating bulk and portable <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> and fuel quality control. The final course, and longest in duration at 9 to 12 weeks is the forward arming and refuelling course, held at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre in Queensland. Here soldiers are taught aircraft refuelling and arming operation both in the barracks and field environment.|$|E
50|$|The two X-47B demonstrators were {{initially}} {{planned to have}} a three-year test program with 50 tests at Edwards AFB and NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, culminating in sea trials in 2013. However, the aircraft performed so consistently that the preliminary tests stopped after 16 flights. Thereafter, the Navy {{decided to use the}} aircraft to demonstrate carrier launches and recoveries, as well as autonomous inflight refueling with a probe and drogue. In November 2011, the Navy announced that aerial <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> and software would be added to one of the prototype aircraft in 2014 for testing. The Navy also affirmed that the demonstrator aircraft would never be armed. In 2012, Northrop Grumman tested a wearable remote control system, designed to allow ground crews to steer the X-47B while on the carrier deck.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, 14 former BA Super VC10s were {{purchased}} and stored for spare parts. In the early 1990s, {{to help the}} VC10 fleet replace the recently retired Handley Page Victor tankers, five of the stored aircraft were converted to VC10 K4 tankers. Shortly after entering service, extensive wing plank corrosion was discovered on the lower wing surfaces; this was attributed mainly to the storage method used prior to conversion, the wing tanks had been defuelled and filled with water as ballast. Extensive wing plank corrosion rectification work, including plank replacement, often took place during major services. The K4 conversions, as with the K2, lacked forward freight doors, thus {{it was decided that}} there would be no internal refuelling tanks fitted. The K4 has identical <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> to the K2 and K3, but lacks the extra fuselage fuel tanks and retains the same fuel capacity as a Super VC10.|$|E
