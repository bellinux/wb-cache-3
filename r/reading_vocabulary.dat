40|$|Research {{shows that}} too many {{unfamiliar}} words can render a reading comprehension. All of the reading teachers know about this; therefore they always discuss some vocabularies to students after they have read a reading passage. Meanwhile the interactive theorists postulate that prior-teaching vocabulary can improve the reading comprehension because the students have had the schemata (in this case is the <b>vocabulary)</b> before they <b>read</b> the passage. A research proving the different effects between teaching <b>reading</b> using <b>vocabulary</b> prior and post reading has not been done yet. The aim {{of the present study}} was therefore to determine the effects of the teaching of <b>reading</b> by using <b>vocabulary</b> prior to <b>reading</b> and the teaching of <b>reading</b> by using <b>vocabulary</b> post-reading on the students’ reading comprehension. The question investigated was : Are there any different effects between the teaching of <b>reading</b> using <b>vocabulary</b> prior to <b>reading</b> and the teaching of <b>reading</b> using <b>vocabulary</b> post-reading on the students’ reading comprehension? The hypothesis was then put forward the teaching of <b>reading</b> using <b>vocabulary</b> prior to <b>reading</b> and the teaching of <b>reading</b> using <b>vocabulary</b> post-reading have a significant difference between the group which was taught by using <b>vocabulary</b> prior to <b>reading</b> and the group which was taught by using vocabulary post-reading on the students’ reading comprehension. A quasi-experiment study was then conducted. A pretest-posttest two groups design was employed in the study. The sample comprised sixty four (64) students of the first grade of St. Stanislaus Senior High School in the academic year of 2003 / 2004. The students taken as samples were selected at random. The multiple choice comprehension test was used to examine the students reading comprehension. The analysis of T-test was used to analyze the mean differences of reading comprehension of the students in both groups. The result of the data analyses reveals that on the whole, the teaching of <b>reading</b> using <b>vocabulary</b> prior to <b>reading</b> does not differ significantly from the teaching <b>reading</b> using <b>vocabulary</b> post-reading on the students’ reading comprehension. For the further research, it is suggested to prolong the treatments. Further research with the same direction is also welcome in order to confirm, modify, or reject the conclusion of the present study...|$|R

Results from 3 age groups of Chinese-English bilingual children showed that speech perception was more predictive of <b>reading</b> and <b>vocabulary</b> in the L 1 than L 2. While morphological awareness uniquely predicted <b>reading</b> and <b>vocabulary</b> in both languages, phonological awareness played such a role after we controlled for morphological awareness only in the L 2, which was alphabetic.

Poor and better readers were defined to belong to the lowest 30 % and to the higher 70 % of a longitudinal sample, respectively. It appeared that for word recognition the developmental curves for the groups were very distinct and followed similar patterns. For <b>reading</b> comprehension, <b>vocabulary</b> and spelling, the developmental curves showed similar patterns with decreasing differences across grades, however. Clear seasonal effects were found for <b>reading</b> comprehension, <b>vocabulary</b> and spelling, while the seasonal effect for word recognition was restricted to the early grades. It appeared that students with initially poor abilities in word recognition and reading comprehension showed greater improvement over time on <b>reading</b> comprehension, <b>vocabulary</b> and spelling than students with initially better abilities in word recognition and reading comprehension. These findings contradict the existence of a Matthew effect for these skills. For word recognition, a clear differential effect could not be found: the groups did not differ systematically in mean development. The gap between the poor and better decoders did not widen over time for this skill; so a Matthew effect for word recognition was not supported...|$|R

Results from two independent samples of children aged 3 – 5, and 5 years, with mean word reading levels of 7 and 9 years respectively, showed underdevelopment of their context-free letter sounds and phoneme awareness, relative to their word reading levels and normal comparison samples. Despite such underdevelopment, these exceptional readers engaged in a form of phonological recoding that enabled pseudoword reading, {{at the level of}} older-age normal controls matched on word reading level. Moreover, in the 5 -year-old sample further experiments showed that, relative to normal controls, they had a bias toward use of sublexical information from their <b>reading</b> <b>vocabularies</b> for phonological recoding of heterophonic pseudowords with irregular consistent spelling, and were superior in accessing word meanings independently of phonology, although only if the readers were without exposure to explicit phonics.

Secondly, these results indicate that dyslexics on vmbo can perform equally well compared to their classmates when given more time. Thirdly, since dyslexics on vmbo can perform equally well on a comprehensive reading test, when given more time, it may be unnecessary to give them more adjustments in high school (e. g. reading texts aloud).

40|$|Abstract This article reviews recent {{research}} on consulting a dictionary in L 2 <b>reading</b> and <b>vocabulary</b> learning. From {{the perspective of}} cognitive learning theory, the author re-evaluates the limited role that has often been accorded to dictionary consulting. It is noted that, among the three available lexical processing strategies (inferencing, consulting and ignoring), learners tend to use consulting infrequently and selectively and also to differ among {{each other in their}} strategy use. Consulting in combination with inferencing is shown to have the greatest positive effect on performance in L 2 <b>reading</b> and <b>vocabulary</b> learning, although consulting is found to slow down task completion. Excerpts from think-aloud protocols illustrate the potential contribution of strategic dictionary use to the cognitive processes required for vocabulary acquisition: attention to form-meaning connections, rehearsal of words for storage in long-term memory and elaboration of associations with other knowledge. Among the pedagogical implications of these findings is the need for training in lexical processing strategies in order to help learners use the dictionary effectively and accurately in L 2 <b>reading</b> comprehension and <b>vocabulary</b> learning...|$|R

Twice each year two standardized tests for each skill were administered. For two successive periods, one of the tests for each skill was the same. To describe the development in terms of a latent variable evolving across grades, the structured-means version of the structural equation model was used. The growth was expressed in terms of effect size. With respect to the first question, clear seasonal effects were found for <b>reading</b> comprehension, <b>vocabulary</b> and spelling, while the seasonal effect for decoding efficiency was restricted to the early grades. Progress tended to be greater from fall to spring than from spring to fall. For decoding efficiency, and to a lesser degree for vocabulary and spelling, growth showed a declining trend across grades.
