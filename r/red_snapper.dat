25|$|The coral fauna lacks {{diversity}} and {{shows signs of}} frequent storm damage. The corals include several genera not seen at Taongi Atoll, and the diversity of fish is much greater, including the two-spot <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> humpback <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> leopard grouper, and humphead parrot fish.|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} variety of hot dog in Maine {{is made with}} natural casing. The casing is colored red, and one company refers to their red variety as <b>red</b> <b>snappers.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} {{approach was}} developed to distinguish species of <b>red</b> <b>snappers</b> among commercial salted fish products. The specific fragments of the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA gene, which were about 450 bp, were obtained using the semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (semi-nested PCR). Subsequently, PCR arnplicons were sequenced, aiming to select restriction endonucleases that generated species-specific {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) profiles. Discrimination of <b>red</b> <b>snappers</b> Lutjanus sanguineus, Lutjanus erythopterus from Lutjanus argentimaculatus, Lutjanus malabarius and other morphologically similar fishes such as Lethrinus leutjanus and Pinjalo pinjalo was feasible by one restriction digestion reaction with three endonucleases Hae III, Sca I and SnaB I, however, for discrimination of L. sanguineus and L. erythopterus, another restriction digestion reaction with single restriction endonuclease Mae II was needed. The semi-nested PCR-RFLP was demonstrated to be reliable in species identification of salted fish products in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{crustaceans}} and fish live {{in association with}} this urchin. These include the commensal shrimps Periclimenes hirsutus and Stegopontonia commensalis and the crab Zebrida adamsii. Another crab, Dorippe frascone is a symbiont and carries the urchin on its back. Certain juvenile fish also live among the spines including young emperor <b>red</b> <b>snappers</b> (Lutjanus sebae), cardinal fish (Apogonidae) and the zebra lionfish.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, NOAA, {{citing the}} Magnuson-Stevens Act, banned fishing of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> until the {{population}} has time to recover.|$|E
25|$|The local {{specialty}} is Huachinango or whole <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> usually prepared Veracruzana (with savory tomato sauce) or al mojo de ajo (with garlic sauce).|$|E
25|$|Veracruz’s long {{coastline}} {{supports a}} large fishing industry, producing one-fifth of Mexico’s catch. Most of the country’s mojarra, oysters and shrimp come from here. Other major fish catches include crab, sea bass and <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} fishing {{depends on the}} type {{and size of the}} fish to be caught. Trawling is used to catch shrimp, carite, snapper and cavali. The main catches from seine and gill nets are king fish, shark and carite. Fish pot catches are <b>red</b> <b>snappers</b> and jacks. Fishing is a year-round {{activity}} in the Caribbean and it directly employs thousands of people.|$|R
50|$|The lagoon, at most 8 ft deep, {{is home to}} <b>red</b> <b>snappers,</b> gruntfish, sardines, {{swordfish}} {{and black}} mullets.Oysters cling to the mangrove roots.Birds that feed in the lagoon include scarlet ibis, red-legged tinamous, frigatebirds, blue herons, green herons, great egrets, ground doves, cormorants and flamingos.Three endemic land species are present: the deer Odocoileus carriacou margaritae, the rabbit Sylvilagus floridanus margaritae and the snake Leptotyphlops albifrons margaritae.|$|R
5000|$|Atlantis is themed to {{look like}} an Atlantis Temple, and with a volume of 500000 gal L it is the largest tank in the aquarium. Atlantis is home to seven shark species: Sand tiger sharks, Nurse sharks, Brown shark, Wobbegong sharks, White tip reef sharks, Black tip reef sharks, and Zebra sharks. It also {{contains}} southern stingrays, giant shovel-nosed guitarfish, and green sawfish. Atlantis is also home to several sea turtles - two Loggerhead sea turtles, two Kemp's Riddley sea turtles, and a Giant Green Sea Turtles which was added in March 2011. In addition, it has groupers, <b>red</b> <b>snappers,</b> <b>red</b> drums, pork fish, jacks, permits, and many more species.|$|R
25|$|Seafood Watch {{have placed}} {{on their list}} of seafood that sustainability-minded {{consumers}} should avoid the following demersal fish: sturgeon (imported wild), Chilean seabass, cod (Atlantic, imported Pacific), flounder (Atlantic), halibut (Atlantic), sole (Atlantic), grouper, monkfish, orange roughy, demersal shark, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> and tilapia (Asia farmed).|$|E
25|$|Anguillian cuisine is {{influenced}} by native Caribbean, African, Spanish, French and English cuisines. Seafood is abundant, including prawns, shrimp, crab, spiny lobster, conch, mahi-mahi, <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> marlin and grouper. Salt cod is a staple food eaten on its own and used in stews, casseroles and soups. Livestock is limited due to {{the small size of}} the island and people there use poultry, pork, goat and mutton, along with imported beef. Goat is the most commonly eaten meat, used in a variety of dishes.|$|E
25|$|When NOAA retired the {{fisheries}} research ship NOAAS John N. Cobb (R 552) in August 2008, Oregon II became the oldest {{ship in the}} NOAA fleet. She achieved a milestone on 27 July 2012, when she departed Pascagoula on her 300th research cruise, an annual assessment of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> and shark populations in the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean. By that time, she had logged 10,000 days at sea and more than 1,000,000 nautical miles (1,850,000km), and her projects had taken her {{as far south as}} the Amazon River delta in Brazil and as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts.|$|E
40|$|A case of {{vibriosis}} {{caused by}} Vibrio harveyi in adult mangrove <b>red</b> <b>snappers</b> reared in floating net cages is {{reported for the}} first time from India. The pathogen was confirmed using biochemical characterisation, by nested PCR and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Histopathology revealed chronic nature of the disease. The outbreak of mortality was consequent to elevated water temperature and handling. Importance of stress factors as stimulus to outbreak of mortality is discussed...|$|R
5|$|Fish are {{plentiful}} {{in the waters}} surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African <b>red</b> <b>snappers</b> (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|R
2500|$|In general, {{the aquatic}} fauna {{population}} is healthy, but of low diversity, possibly {{due to the}} atoll's isolation. Researchers have not seen any marine turtles, but Polynesian custom regarding harvesting assumed their presence. Examples of the giant clam family Tridacnidae are very abundant, except for the largest giant clam T. gigas. Smaller bivalves were present, but few Mollusks. The reef fish are primarily emperor breams, parrotfish, and <b>red</b> <b>snappers.</b> Also present are moray eel and grey reef shark. Approximately 100 stony coral species and two soft coral species are present.|$|R
25|$|Orton's {{consistent}} {{band from}} 1999's Central Reservation until around 2006 was guitarist Ted Barnes, keyboardist Sean Read, ex-Sandals drummer Will Blanchard and former <b>Red</b> <b>Snapper</b> member Ali Friend on bass. However, this had changed by 2008, with Ali and Ted having {{moved on to}} form their own band Clayhill, and Ted having pursued his own projects, with Orton guesting on his solo debut album, Short Scenes. After that Orton's touring band consisted of Amidon, Steinberg, with Steven Nistor on drums, and her current touring band consists of Alex Thomas on sticks, vocals and electronics, and Grey McMurray on guitar, bass and electronics.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} {{and during the}} colonial period, many other spices and {{ingredients}} were brought and have had a greater influence in the cooking here than {{in other parts of}} the country. From Europe, the Spanish brought saffron, parsley, thyme, marjoram, bay laurel, and cilantro as well Asian spices such as cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper. The Spaniards also brought wheat, rice, almonds, olives and olive oil, garlic, and capers. The latter three are essential ingredients in what is perhaps the most famous specialty of the region, huachinango a la veracruzana, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> in a spicy tomato sauce. Caribbean imports such as sugar cane and pineapple were adapted as well as the peanut, brought from Africa by the Portuguese via Brazil.|$|E
25|$|One such dish is mais moulu (mayi moulen), {{which is}} {{comparable}} to grits that can be eaten with sauce pois (sòs pwa), a bean purée made from one of many types of beans such as kidney, pinto, chickpeas, or pigeon peas (known in some countries as gandules). Mais moulin can be eaten with fish (often <b>red</b> <b>snapper),</b> or alone depending on personal preference. Some of the many plants used in Haitian dishes include tomato, oregano, cabbage, avocado, bell peppers. A popular food is banane pesée (ban-nan'n peze), flattened plantain slices fried in cooking oil (known as tostones in the Spanish-speaking Latin American countries). It is eaten both as a snack {{and as part of}} a meal, and is often eaten with tassot and griot (deep-fried goat and pork).|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture is {{regarded}} as the most promising source of protein food in the years ahead. Milkfish and Nile tilapia are the major fishes now produced but groupers, sea bass, rabbitfish, <b>red</b> <b>snappers,</b> carps, and catfishes are grown by some farmers. The tiger shrimp is still the most important cultured crustacean, but white shrimps and mudcrabs also have great potential. Oysters and mussels are produced in considerable amounts. Mariculture of the seaweed Eucheuma is now a well established industry, and the pond culture of Gracilaria for agar extraction is beginning to take off...|$|R

In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in the fleet of small {{mechanised}} shrimp trawlers in Kerala from 769 trawlers day- 1 in 1973 to 3500 trawlers day- 1 in 1980 resulted in considerable erosion in the estimated annual net profit trawler- 1 from a maximum of Rs. 537. 5 x 10 3 in 1976 to a minimum of Rs. 5805 in 1982. This study proposes to optimise the fleet at 1460 trawlers day- 1 at which the net profit day- 1 for the trawler sector in Kerala would be Rs. 2. 127 x 10 6 (or Rs. 457. 305 x 10 6 year- 1 of 215 fishing days). At this economically optimum level of fishing effort, the yield from trawl fishery is estimated at 91323 tons, comprising 44931 tons of shrimps and 46392 tons of finfish. The optimum number of trawlers may be chosen each year by about March or April by lot.
