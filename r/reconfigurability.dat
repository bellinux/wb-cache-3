This static <b>reconfigurability</b> distinguishes between reconfiguration time and run time. Dynamic <b>reconfigurability</b> denotes the capability of a dynamically reconfigurable system that can dynamically change its behavior during run time, usually in response to dynamic changes in its environment.|$|E

50|$|Research {{regarding}} the (dynamic) <b>reconfigurability</b> of wireless communication systems is ongoing {{for example in}} working group 6 of the Wireless World Research Forum (WWRF), in the Wireless Innovation Forum (WINNF) (formerly Software Defined Radio Forum), and in the European FP6 project End-to-End <b>Reconfigurability</b> (E²R). Recently, E²R initiated a related standardization effort on the cohabitation of heterogeneous wireless radio systems {{in the framework of}} the IEEE P1900.4 Working Group.See cognitive radio.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{the menus}} were refined from the IPCop approach, {{reducing}} complexity, but also reducing <b>reconfigurability</b> {{of the individual}} services.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} {{whether or not}} these or similar goals can be reached for specific faults is addressed by <b>reconfigurability</b> analysis.|$|E
50|$|In {{reconfigurable}} computing and in supercomputing {{these terms}} {{refer to the}} data path width. The use of about one bit wide processing elements like the configurable logic blocks (CLBs) in an FPGA is called fine-grained computing or fine-grained <b>reconfigurability,</b> whereas using wide data paths, such as, for instance 32 bits wide resources, like microprocessor CPUs or data-stream-driven data path units (DPUs) like in a reconfigurable datapath array (rDPA) is called coarse-grained computing or coarse-grained <b>reconfigurability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Protocol {{independence}} and the abstract language model allow for <b>reconfigurability</b> - P4 targets {{should be able to}} change the way they process packets (perhaps multiple times) after they are deployed. This capability is traditionally associated with forwarding planes built on general-purpose CPUs or network processors, rather than the fixed function ASICs. Although within the language there is nothing to prevent a given target from optimizing around a certain set of protocols, these optimizations are invisible to the language author and may ultimately reduce the system’s flexibility and <b>reconfigurability</b> goals.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of {{wireless}} communication dynamic <b>reconfigurability</b> tackles the changeable behavior of wireless networks and associated equipment, specifically {{in the fields of}} radio spectrum, radio access technologies, protocol stacks, and application services.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of Control reconfiguration, a field of {{fault-tolerant}} control within control engineering, <b>reconfigurability</b> is a property of faulty systems meaning that the original control goals specified for the fault-free system can be reached after suitable control reconfiguration.|$|E
50|$|Polarization {{reconfigurable}} antennas {{are capable}} of switching between different polarization modes. The capability of switching between horizontal, vertical and circular polarizations {{can be used to}} reduce polarization mismatch losses in portable devices. Polarization <b>reconfigurability</b> can be provided by changing the balance between the different modes of a multimode structure.|$|E
50|$|A bush robot is a {{hypothetical}} machine whose body branches in a fractal way into trillions of nanoscale fingers, to achieve very high dexterity and <b>reconfigurability.</b> The concept {{was described by}} Hans Moravec in a final report for NASA in 1999, who projected that development of the necessary technology will take half a century.|$|E
50|$|Compound {{reconfiguration}} is {{the capability}} of simultaneously tuning several antenna parameters, for instance frequency and radiation pattern. The most common application of compound reconfiguration is the combination of frequency agility and beam-scanning to provide improved spectral efficiencies. Compound <b>reconfigurability</b> is achieved by combining in the same structure different single-parameter reconfiguration techniques or by reshaping dynamically a pixel surface.|$|E
5000|$|Dew computing—In the {{existing}} computing hierarchy, the Dew computing is positioned {{as the ground}} level for the cloud and fog computing paradigms. Compared to fog computing, which supports emerging IoT applications that demand real-time and predictable latency and the dynamic network <b>reconfigurability,</b> Dew computing pushes the frontiers to computing applications, data, and low level services away from centralized virtual nodes to the end users.|$|E
5000|$|Each rDPU can be {{configured}} {{to perform}} an individual function. These rDPUs and interconnects can be programmed after the manufacturing process by the customer/designer (hence the term [...] "reconfigurable") so that the rDPA can perform whatever complex computation is needed. Because rDPUs are multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bits), we talk about coarse-grained <b>reconfigurability</b> - in contrast to FPGAs with single-bit wide configurable logic blocks, called fine-gained reconfigurable.|$|E
5000|$|Radiation pattern <b>reconfigurability</b> {{is based}} on the {{intentional}} modification of the spherical distribution of radiation pattern. Beam steering is the most extended application and consists in steering the direction of maximum radiation to maximize the antenna gain in a link with mobile devices. Pattern reconfigurable antennas are usually designed using movable/rotatable structures [...] or including switchable and reactively-loaded parasitic elements.. In last 10 years, metamaterial-based reconfigurable antennas have gained attention due their small form factor, wide beam steering range and wireless applications.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{manufacturers}} of MS-DOS computers such as Compaq, Zenith, and DEC promised to provide support, as did software {{companies such as}} Ashton-Tate and Lotus. After previewing Windows, BYTE magazine stated in December 1983 that it [...] "seems to offer remarkable openness, <b>reconfigurability,</b> and transportability as well as modest hardware requirements and pricing … Barring a surprise product introduction from another company, Microsoft Windows {{will be the first}} large-scale test of the desktop metaphor in the hands of its intended users".|$|E
50|$|Domain {{analysis}} is derived primarily from artifacts produced from past {{experience in the}} domain. Existing systems, their artifacts (such as design documents, requirement documents and user manuals), standards, and customers are all potential sources of domain analysis input. However, unlike requirements engineering, domain analysis does not solely consist of collection and formalization of information; a creative component exists as well. During the domain analysis process, engineers aim to extend knowledge of the domain beyond what is already known and to categorize the domain into similarities and differences to enhance <b>reconfigurability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The GNU Radio {{software}} {{provides the}} framework and tools {{to build and}} run software radio or just general signal-processing applications. The GNU Radio applications themselves are generally known as [...] "flowgraphs", which {{are a series of}} signal processing blocks connected together, thus describing a data flow. As with all software-defined radio systems, <b>reconfigurability</b> is a key feature. Instead of using different radios designed for specific but disparate purposes, a single, general-purpose, radio can be used as the radio front-end, and the signal-processing software (here, GNU Radio), handles the processing specific to the radio application.|$|E
50|$|Cyber{{manufacturing}} is {{a concept}} derived from cyber-physical systems (CPS). Basically, it refers to a modern manufacturing system that offers an information-transparent environment to facilitate asset management, provide <b>reconfigurability,</b> and maintain productivity. Compared with conventional experience-based management systems, cyber manufacturing provides an evidence-based environment to keep equipment users aware of networked asset status, and transfer raw data into possible risks and actionable information. Driving technologies include design of cyber-physical systems, combination of engineering domain knowledge and computer sciences, {{as well as information}} technologies. Among them, mobile applications for manufacturing is an area of specific interest to industries and academia.|$|E
50|$|Polarization and {{radiation}} pattern <b>reconfigurability,</b> and frequency tunability, are usually achieved by incorporation of III-V semiconductor components, such as SPST switches or varactor diodes. However, these components {{can be readily}} replaced by RF MEMS switches and varactors {{in order to take}} advantage of the low insertion loss and high Q factor offered by RF MEMS technology. In addition, RF MEMS components can be integrated monolithically on low-loss dielectric substrates, such as borosilicate glass, fused silica or LCP, whereas III-V compound semi-insulating and passivated silicon substrates are generally lossier and have a higher dielectric constant. A low loss tangent and low dielectric constant are of importance for the efficiency and the bandwidth of the antenna.|$|E
50|$|The idea of cyber {{manufacturing}} mainly {{stems from}} the fact that Internet-enabled services have released great business values in economic sectors such as retail, music, consumer products, transportation, and healthcare. However, compared to existing Internet-enabled sectors, manufacturing assets are less connected and less accessible in real-time. Besides, current manufacturing enterprises make decisions following a top-down approach: from overall equipment effectiveness to assignment of production requirements, without considering the condition of machines. This will usually lead to inconsistency in operation management due to lack of linkage between factories, possible overstock in spare part inventory, as well as unexpected machine downtime. Such situation calls for connectivity between machines as a foundation, and analytics on top of that as a necessity to translate raw data into information that actually facilitates user decision making. Expected functionalities of cybermanufacturing systems include machine connectivity and data acquisition, machine health prognostics, fleet-based asset management, and manufacturing <b>reconfigurability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Linear optics, as a {{platform}} for quantum computation specifically, began to show a marked rise in activity {{after the publication of}} the seminal theory paper of Knill-Laflamme-Milburn, which demonstrated the feasibility of linear optical quantum computers using post-selection, feed-forward and number resolving detection. Following this there were several experimental proof-of-principle demonstrations of two-qubit gates performed in bulk optics. [...] It soon became clear that integrated optics could provide a powerful enabling technology for this emerging field. [...] Early experiments in integrated optics demonstrated the feasibility of the field via demonstrations of high-visibility non-classical and classical interference in simple components based on linear optics such as directional couplers (DCs) and Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These components were then be used to fabricate more complicated circuits such as multi-photon entangling gates as well as core components used for fully reconfigurable quantum circuits, where <b>reconfigurability</b> can achieved using both thermal and electro-optic phase shifters.|$|E
5000|$|These {{technologies}} {{are based on}} the manipulation of continuous liquid flow through microfabricated channels. Actuation of liquid flow is implemented either by external pressure sources, external mechanical pumps, integrated mechanical micropumps, or by combinations of capillary forces and electrokinetic mechanisms. [...] Continuous-flow microfluidic operation is the mainstream approach because it is easy to implement and less sensitive to protein fouling problems. Continuous-flow devices are adequate for many well-defined and simple biochemical applications, and for certain tasks such as chemical separation, but they are less suitable for tasks requiring a high degree of flexibility or fluid manipulations. These closed-channel systems are inherently difficult to integrate and scale because the parameters that govern flow field vary along the flow path making the fluid flow at any one location dependent on the properties of the entire system. Permanently etched microstructures also lead to limited <b>reconfigurability</b> and poor fault tolerance capability.|$|E
50|$|The Component Video Cable {{provides}} video quality {{superior to}} that of the RF modulator, composite video cable and s-video cable and is equal in quality to RGB Scart (at 576i/50 Hz or 480i/60 Hz). It also enables the use of progressive scan (480p/60 Hz) in supported games which is a feature not possible with most other cables (The Japan-only D-Terminal cable also has this feature). PAL released games did not have the ability to output progressive 480p games. The connector plugs into the Digital AV port rather than the Analog AV port used by other cables and contains a Macronix CMPV-DOL video chip (a digital-to-analog converter). This converts the YCBCR digital video coming from the digital port to the YPBPR analog format used by component video equipment. While CMPV-DOL's <b>reconfigurability</b> allows it to carry out unusual functions such as YCBCR to RGBHV conversion, it cannot take advantage of the digital audio from the console's digital port. This means that a separate cable, such as the system's standard A/V cable, must also be connected to the Analog AV port in order to transmit the audio signal.|$|E
50|$|Computing with memory {{platforms}} {{are typically}} {{used to provide}} the benefit of hardware <b>reconfigurability.</b> Reconfigurable computing platforms offer advantages in terms of reduced design cost, early time-to-market, rapid prototyping and easily customizable hardware systems. FPGAs present a popular reconfigurable computing platform for implementing digital circuits. They follow a purely spatial computing model. Since their inception in 1985, {{the basic structure of}} the FPGAs has continued to consist of two-dimensional array of Configurable Logic blocks (CLBs) and a programmable interconnect matrix. FPGA performance and power dissipation is largely dominated by the elaborate programmable interconnect (PI) architecture. An effective way of reducing the impact of the PI architecture in FPGA is to place small LUTs in close proximity (referred as clusters) and to allow intra-cluster communication using local interconnects. Due to the benefits of a clustered FPGA architecture, major FPGA vendors have incorporated it in their commercial products. Investigations have also been made to reduce the overhead due to PI in fine-grained FPGAs by mapping larger multi-input multi-output LUTs to embedded memory blocks. Although it follows a similar spatial computing model, part of the logic functions are implemented using embedded memory blocks while the remaining part is realized using smaller LUTs. Such a heterogeneous mapping can improve the area and performance by reducing the contribution of programmable interconnects.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatives to {{the above}} closed-channel continuous-flow systems include novel open structures, where discrete, {{independently}} controllable dropletsare manipulated on a substrate using electrowetting. Following the analogy of digital microelectronics, this approach {{is referred to as}} digital microfluidics. Le Pesant et al. pioneered the use of electrocapillary forces to move droplets on a digital track. The [...] "fluid transistor" [...] pioneered by Cytonix also played a role. The technology was subsequently commercialised by Duke University. By using discrete unit-volume droplets, [...] a microfluidic function can be reduced to a set of repeated basic operations, i.e., moving one unit of fluid over one unit of distance. This [...] "digitisation" [...] method facilitates the use of a hierarchical and cell-based approach for microfluidic biochip design. Therefore, digital microfluidics offers a flexible and scalable system architecture as well as high fault-tolerance capability. Moreover, because each droplet can be controlled independently, these systems also have dynamic <b>reconfigurability,</b> whereby groups of unit cells in a microfluidic array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. Although droplets are manipulated in confined microfluidic channels, since the control on droplets is not independent, it should not be confused as [...] "digital microfluidics". One common actuation method for digital microfluidics is electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). Many lab-on-a-chip applications have been demonstrated within the digital microfluidics paradigm using electrowetting. However, recently other techniques for droplet manipulation have also been demonstrated using surface acoustic waves, optoelectrowetting, mechanical actuation, [...] etc.|$|E
40|$|As a {{critical}} requirement for spacecraft autonomous control, <b>reconfigurability</b> {{should be considered}} in design stage of spacecrafts by involving effective <b>reconfigurability</b> analysis method in guiding system designs. In this paper, a novel <b>reconfigurability</b> analysis method is proposed for spacecraft design. First, some basic definitions regarding spacecraft <b>reconfigurability</b> are given. Then, based on function tree theory, a <b>reconfigurability</b> modeling approach is established to properly describe system’s <b>reconfigurability</b> characteristics, and corresponding analysis procedure based on minimal cut set and minimal path set is further presented. In addition, indexes of fault reconfigurable degree and system reconfigurable rate for evaluating <b>reconfigurability</b> are defined, and the methodology for analyzing system’s week links is also constructed. Finally, the method is verified by a spacecraft attitude measuring system, and the results show that the presented method cannot only implement the quantitative <b>reconfigurability</b> evaluations but also find the weak links, and therefore provides significant improvements for spacecraft <b>reconfigurability</b> design...|$|E
40|$|To compete, {{manufacturing}} companies need production systems that quickly {{can respond to}} changes. To handle change drivers such as volume variations or new product variants, <b>reconfigurability</b> is advocated as a competitive means. This implies an ability to add, remove, and/or rearrange {{the structure of the}} production system to be ready for future changes. Still, {{it is not clear how}} the production system design process can capture and support the design of reconfigurable production systems. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to increase the knowledge of how to support the design of reconfigurable production systems. <b>Reconfigurability</b> could be defined by a number of <b>reconfigurability</b> characteristics including convertibility, scalability, automatibility, mobility, modularity, integrability, and diagnosability. In eight case studies, <b>reconfigurability</b> characteristics in production system design were studied in order to investigate <b>reconfigurability</b> needs, knowledge, and practice in {{manufacturing companies}}. In three of the case studies reconfigurable production systems were studied to identify the links between change drivers and <b>reconfigurability</b> characteristics. In the remaining five case studies, <b>reconfigurability</b> in the production system design processes was addressed in terms of needs, prerequisites, and consideration. Based on the literature review and the case studies, support for reconfigurable production system design is suggested including two parts. The first part comprises support for analyzing the need for <b>reconfigurability.</b> Based on relevant change drivers the need for <b>reconfigurability</b> must be identified to enable selection of right type and degree of <b>reconfigurability</b> for each specific case of application. A comprehensive view of the <b>reconfigurability</b> characteristics is presented and links between change drivers and <b>reconfigurability</b> characteristics are described. The characteristics are divided into critical characteristics, that lead to a capacity or functionality change of the production system, and supporting characteristics, that reduce system reconfiguration time but do not necessarily lead to a modification of functionality or capacity of the production system. The second part provides support in how to consider <b>reconfigurability</b> in the production system design process. A holistic perspective is crucial to design reconfigurable production systems and therefore constituent parts of a production system are described. According to their character physical, logical, and human reconfiguration must be considered through the whole production system design process...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the fields}} of {{reconfigurable}} manufacturing systems, holonic manufacturing systems, and multi-agent systems have made technological advances to support the ready reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems. While these technological advances have demonstrated robust operation and been qualitatively successful in achieving <b>reconfigurability,</b> limited effort {{has been devoted to}} the measurement of <b>reconfigurability</b> in the resultant systems. Hence, it is not clear 1.) to which degree these designs have achieved their intended level of <b>reconfigurability</b> 2.) which systems are indeed quantitatively more reconfigurable and 3.) how these designs may overcome their design limitations to achieve greater <b>reconfigurability</b> in subsequent design iterations. Recently, a <b>reconfigurability</b> measurement process based upon axiomatic design and the design structure matrix has been developed. This paper now builds upon these works to provide a set of composite <b>reconfigurability</b> measures. Among these are measures for its key characteristics of integrability, convertibility, and customization, which have driven the qualitative and intuitive design of these technological advances. These measures are then demonstrated on an illustrative example followed by a discussion of how they may be practically applied in large automated manufacturing systems...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, space {{systems have}} been built for pre-defined missions, fixed requirements, and {{optimized}} for highest performance. Sustainable system architectures however need to be affordable, ensure delivery of value, minimize failure risk, and adapt to new requirements. <b>Reconfigurability</b> in systems can be a means for achieving these desirable characteristics. Currently, there is no formal methodology for studying <b>reconfigurability</b> issues in system architecture and design. This paper presents such a methodology and investigates how <b>reconfigurability</b> can be a means for reducing cost and mitigating risk. As a specific case study, reconfigurable planetary surface vehicles for human exploration of Moon and Mars are analyzed. It is assumed that <b>reconfigurability</b> is primarily desired in the system to maximize value through multi-functionality (and thereby reduce total mass required to be transported to planetary surface). It is found that for the specific case study analyzed, the mass savings due to <b>reconfigurability</b> in a fleet of vehicles {{can be on the}} order of 35 % while risk of non-performance can be reduced to 1 %. The cost of reconfiguration however goes up with increasing <b>reconfigurability</b> in the system. ...|$|E
