60|$|Another day, {{the warmest}} {{of the spring}} so far, she rode a Navajo mustang she had {{recently}} bought from a passing trader; and at the farthest end of her section, in rough wooded and <b>ridged</b> <b>ground</b> she had not explored, she found a canyon with red walls and pine trees and gleaming streamlet and glades of grass and jumbles of rock. It was a miniature canyon, to be sure, {{only a quarter of}} a mile long, and as deep as the height of a lofty pine, and so narrow that it seemed only the width of a lane, but it had all the features of Oak Creek Canyon, and so sufficed for the exultant joy of possession. She explored it. The willow brakes and oak thickets harbored rabbits and birds. She saw the white flags of deer running away down the open. Up at the head where the canyon boxed she flushed a flock of wild turkeys. They ran like ostriches and flew like great brown chickens. In a cavern Carley found the den of a bear, and in another place the bleached bones of a steer.|$|E
40|$|A {{graphene}} sheet gated with a <b>ridged</b> <b>ground</b> plane, {{creating a}} soft-boundary (SB) graphene nanoribbon, is considered. By adjusting the ridge parameters and bias voltage a channel {{can be created}} on the graphene which can guide TM surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). Two types of modes are found; fundemental and higher-order modes with no apparent cutoff frequency and with energy distributed over the created channel, and edge modes with energy concen-trated at the soft-boundary edge. Dispersion curves, electric near-field patterns, and current distributions of these modes are determined. Since the location where energy is concentrated in the edge modes can be easily controlled electronically by the bias voltage and frequency, the edge-mode phenomena is used to propose a novel voltage controlled plasmonic switch and a plasmonic frequency demultiplexer...|$|E

40|$|A {{single layer}} single element {{rectangular}} microstrip antenna on <b>ridge</b> <b>ground</b> plane for improved bandwidth is theoretically investigated {{with a view}} to develop a concrete physical insight in to the phenomenon. The simple single element probe fed rectangular microstrip antenna fabricated on conventional PTFE (Poly Tetra Fluride Ethelene) substrate have many advantages except its narrow bandwidth. The present study proposes the technique to control the resonant modes of a microstrip antenna for yielding better bandwidth using transverse resonance method. The present antenna is designed to fabricate on <b>ridge</b> <b>ground</b> plane which has been compared with conventional structure and around 6 % - 7 % improvement in bandwidth is revealed. The detailed variation of radiation pattern across its frequency band has been studied and presented in this paper. The proposed idea has been verified through a commercial software package (High Frequency Structure Simulator) for a patch operating in X band and explained quantitatively. The electric surface current distribution over the patch surface for both the conventional and proposed antenna is presented to explain the broad banding effect physically...|$|R

It is expected to rain on the fair day every year, which makes it popular in the whole District. Around 5,000 to 10,000 people's gathering is expected on that day.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [184]- 191) The {{western north}} coast of Yucatan has four geomor- phic zones: the dune ridge, swamp-lagoon, tsekel, and karst. The mangrove swamps {{in the area}} have been altered due to a man-made breach in the dune <b>ridge.</b> <b>Ground</b> water appears to be confined in the coastal zone of Yucatan by a dense calcrete layer that extends {{across the surface of}} the carbonate bedrock. The hydraulic head has been increased and the salt water interface has been depressed in the coastal zone due to the presence of these confining conditions. Large ground-water fluctuations have been correlated with tidal oscillations. These fluctuations are used here to calculate aquifer dispersivity, and provide limiting values for the hydraulic conductivity in the carbonate bedrock. The primary processes affecting geochemistry that are occurring in the water bodies in the study area are mixing of fresh and salt water, evaporation, and precipitation- dissolution of carbonate minerals. The majority of the water samples taken from the study area are supersaturated with respect to dolomite, aragonite, and calcite. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
