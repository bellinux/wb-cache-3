A recent acclaimed production of THE CHERRY ORCHARD in London played for over three hours; but de Wet's research revealed that Chekhov had intended the third act to last for only fourteen minutes. Chekhov's deriding of Stanislavsky's directing and acting of THE SEAGULL is now famous: “The stage demands a degree of artifice … What would happen if you cut the nose out of one of Kramskoy’s paintings and substituted a real one?

Little work has been performed to characterize the walking behavior in adult w 1118 flies.

We statistically modeled the distribution of distances to center and extracted the walking structures of w 1118 flies. Pulsed light stimulation redistributed the time proportions for individual walking structures.

40|$|Stimulation with <b>rhythmic</b> <b>light</b> flicker (photic driving) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, mood disorder, migraine, and epilepsy. In particular, the adjustment of spontaneous brain rhythms to the stimulus frequency (entrainment) is used to assess the functional flexibility of the brain. We aim to gain deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying this technique and to predict the effects of stimulus frequency and intensity. For this purpose, a modified Jansen and Rit neural mass model (NMM) of a cortical circuit is used. This mean field model has been designed to strike a balance between mathematical simplicity and biological plausibility. We reproduced the entrainment phenomenon observed in EEG during a photic driving experiment. More generally, we demonstrate that such a single area model can already yield very complex dynamics, including chaos, for biologically plausible parameter ranges. We chart the entire parameter space by means of characteristic Lyapunov spectra and Kaplan-Yorke dimension as well as time series and power spectra. Rhythmic and chaotic brain states were found virtually next to each other, such that small parameter changes can give rise to switching from one to another. Strikingly, this characteristic pattern of unpredictability generated by the model was matched to the experimental data with reasonable accuracy. These findings confirm that the NMM is a useful model of brain dynamics during photic driving. In this context, it can be used to study the mechanisms of, for example, perception and epileptic seizure generation.

40|$|The {{neurologic}} {{music therapy}} {{is a new}} scope of music therapy. Its techniques deal with dysfunctions resulting from diseases of the human nervous system. Music {{can be used as}} an alternative modality to access functions unavailable through non-musical stimulus. Processes in the brain activated by the influence of music can be generalized and transferred to non-musical functions. Therefore, in clinical practice, the translation of non-musical therapeutic exercises into analogous, isomorphic musical exercises is performed. They make use of the executive peculiarity of musical instruments and musical structures to prime, cue and coordinate movements. Among musical components, a repetitive rhythm plays a significant role. It regulates physiologic and behavioural functions through the mechanism of entrainment (synchronization of biological rhythms with musical rhythm based on acoustic resonance). It is especially relevant for patients with a deficient internal timing system in the brain. Additionally, regular rhythmic patterns facilitate memory encoding and decoding of non-musical information hence music is an efficient mnemonic tool. The music as a hierarchical, compound language of time, with its unique ability to access affective/motivational systems in the brain, provides time structures enhancing perception processes, mainly in the range of cognition, language and motor learning. It allows for emotional expression and improvement of the motivation for rehabilitation activities. The new technologies of rhythmic sensory stimulation (i. e. Binaural Beat Stimulation) or rhythmic music in combination with <b>rhythmic</b> <b>light</b> therapy appear.

40|$|SummaryA {{fundamental}} {{property of}} circadian rhythms is {{their ability to}} persist under constant conditions.

We found that flies overexpressing the pacemaker gene per or the morgue gene are also behaviorally <b>rhythmic</b> under constant <b>light.</b> Unexpectedly, the LNvs do not drive these rhythms: they are molecularly arrhythmic, and PDF—the neuropeptide they secrete to synchronize behavioral rhythms under constant darkness—is dispensable for rhythmicity in constant light.

40|$|Air {{humidity}} is {{an environmental}} cue that influences many physiological responses in terrestrial organisms. In early chronobiology studies, {{it was thought}} that humidity could influence the circadian clock. However, no further studies have been performed in pursuit of this idea, nor humidity been investigated as a potential Zeitgeber, despite the fact that daily humidity fluctuation has been widely observed. Here, we report that humidity is a Zeitgeber on par with light and temperature and that it can fundamentally influence plant physiology. Using 10 years of weather records obtained from Harvard Forest and Weather Underground databases, we quantitatively characterized humidity oscillation as a natural phenomenon and found that the circadian oscillation of humidity (i. e., lower during the day and higher at night) is robust and independent of climates or seasons. Moreover, there is a 2 -hour overlap of high humidity with light in the morning, suggesting a possible interplay between these two environmental cues and the circadian clock. We then tested and found that humidity can indeed entrain the circadian clock as a bona fide Zeitgeber through regulation of the plant core morning clock gene CCA 1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1) and the core evening clock gene TOC 1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1). However, the core morning clock gene LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL), partner of CCA 1, resists the humidity-entrainment, indicating that the plant circadian clock may have two intertwined loops: one is responsive to both light and humidity via CCA 1, whereas the other is responsive only to light mediated by LHY. In the absence of <b>rhythmic</b> <b>light</b> signal, humidity can entrain the clock, whereas in the presence of light in the morning, humidity synergistically reinforces the clock. At the physiological level, the humidity-entrained clock provides additional advantages to plants. It can improve energy storage, reduce the flowering time and improve seed production in a circadian-dependent manner. Additionally, we found that humidity can fundamentally shape plant-microbe interactions because it is a key signal for the initial induction of the bacterial type III secretion system and effector genes required for virulence. Thus, it is necessary for plants to mount an appropriate response to pathogen infections at night when humidity naturally rises. These findings demonstrate how terrestrial organisms could adapt to humidity oscillation, a universal environmental cue, to strategically maximize their own fitness. We propose that humidity-sensing might be an ancient determinant shaping the evolution of terrestrial organisms after their transition away from aquatic environment. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{cyanobacterium}} Synechococcus elongatus expresses robust circadian (daily) rhythms {{under the}} control of the KaiABC-based core clockwork. Unlike eukaryotic circadian systems characterized thus far, the cyanobacterial clockwork modulates gene expression patterns globally and specific clock gene promoters are not necessary in mediating the circadian feedback loop. The oscilloid model postulates that global rhythms of transcription are based on rhythmic changes in the status of the cyanobacterial chromosome that are ultimately controlled by the KaiABC oscillator. By using a nonessential, cryptic plasmid (pANS) as a reporter of the superhelical state of DNA in cyanobacteria, we show that the supercoiling status of this plasmid changes in a circadian manner in vivo. The rhythm of topological change in the plasmid is conditional; this change is <b>rhythmic</b> in constant <b>light</b> and in light/dark cycles, but not in constant darkness.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{relevance of}} brain oscillations in the alpha frequency range (8 - 13 Hz) has been repeatedly investigated {{through the use}} of rhythmic visual stimulation. The underlying mechanism of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) measured in EEG during rhythmic stimulation, however, is not known. There are two hypotheses on the origin of the SSVEPs: entrainment of brain oscillations and superposition of event-related responses (ERPs). The entrainment but not the superposition hypothesis justifies rhythmic visual stimulation as a means to manipulate brain oscillations, because superposition assumes a linear summation of single responses, independent from ongoing brain oscillations. Here, we stimulated participants with a <b>rhythmic</b> flickering <b>light</b> of different frequencies and intensities [...] We measured entrainment by comparing the phase coupling of brain oscillations stimulated by rhythmic visual flicker with the oscillations induced by arrhythmic jittered stimulation, varying the time, stimulation frequency, and intensity conditions. In line with a theoretical concept of entrainment (the so called Arnold tongue), we found the phase coupling to be more pronounced with increasing stimulation intensity as well as at stimulation frequencies closer to each participant’s intrinsic frequency. Only inside the Arnold tongue did the conditions significantly differ from the jittered stimulation. Furthermore, even in a single sequence of an SSVEP, we found non-linear features (intermittency of phase locking) that contradict the linear summation of single responses, as assumed by the superposition hypothesis. Our findings provide unequivocal evidence that visual rhythmic stimulation entrains brain oscillations, thus validating the approach of rhythmic stimulation as a manipulation of brain oscillations...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{circadian}} clocks {{have been}} {{thought of as}} a neurobiological phenomenon. This view changed somewhat over recent years with the discovery of peripheral tissue circadian oscillators. In mammals, however, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus still retains the critical role of a central synchronizer of biological timing. Zebrafish, in contrast, have always reflected a more highly decentralized level of clock organization, as individual cells and tissues contain directly light responsive circadian pacemakers. As a consequence, clock function in the zebrafish brain has remained largely unexplored, and the precise organization of rhythmic and light-sensitive neurons within the brain is unknown. To address this issue, we used the period 3 (per 3) -luciferase transgenic zebrafish to confirm that multiple brain regions contain endogenous circadian oscillators that are directly light responsive. In addition, in situ hybridization revealed localised neural expression of several <b>rhythmic</b> and <b>light</b> responsive clock genes, including per 3, cryptochrome 1 a (cry 1 a) and per 2. Adult brain nuclei showing significant clock gene expression include the teleost equivalent of the SCN, as well as numerous hypothalamic nuclei, the periventricular grey zone (PGZ) of the optic tectum, and granular cells of the rhombencephalon. To further investigate the light sensitive properties of neurons, expression of c-fos, a marker for neuronal activity, was examined. c-fos mRNA was upregulated in response to changing light conditions in different nuclei within the zebrafish brain. Furthermore, under constant dark (DD) conditions, c-fos shows a significant circadian oscillation. Taken together, these results show that there are numerous areas of the zebrafish central nervous system, which contain deep brain photoreceptors and directly light-entrainable circadian pacemakers. However, there are also multiple brain nuclei, which possess neither, demonstrating a degree of pacemaker complexity that was not previously appreciated...|$|R
