2500|$|The Democrats {{have also}} had a candy desk since at least 1985. A <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> located on the front wall, {{belonging}} to the United States Senate Democratic Conference Secretary, is also filled with sweets. This tradition began [...] "sometime later" [...] than the better known candy desk; Hershey Kisses were the most popular candy from this desk during the 1980s, followed by small caramels. Candy for this desk is paid for through a [...] "candy fund" [...] to which senators {{who would like to}} partake of the desk's contents contribute. Until he left the Senate in 2015, Jay Rockefeller was responsible for collecting the money and purchasing the candy. This tradition is not widely known; in fact, it is so little-known that the Historian of the United States Senate does not know much about it.|$|E

50|$|Abner Cutler & Son were cabinetmakers in Buffalo, New York {{who started}} {{production}} in the late 1820s. The firm specialised in <b>rolltop</b> <b>desks</b> and by the 1850s had been granted seven patents related to the desk's mechanism. The company was known as 'Cutler & Son' by the 1870s and exhibited some desks at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. By the early 1900s, the firm {{was known as the}} 'Cutler Desk Co.' In 1930 it was taken over by the Sikes Chair Co., also of Buffalo.|$|R
50|$|It {{began as}} part of Paris, granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1771 to Captain Joshua Fuller and his company of 64 {{soldiers}} as payment for their service to the colony. First settled in 1779, the land was considered superior for pasturage and hay crops, and orchards were large and productive.Mills were built along the Little Androscoggin River. The Paris Manufacturing Company, which was started modestly by Henry Franklin Morton in 1861 at West Sumner, grew into an important manufacturer. Near the Grand Trunk Railway depot in West Paris, it built a factory to make products including sleds, skis, wagons, step ladders, wheelbarrows, ironing boards, children's <b>rolltop</b> <b>desks</b> and other furniture.|$|R

For several years, he {{recorded}} instances when {{the staff of the}} Metropolitan were interviewed on television including the Director Philippe de Montebello’s Sunday show on PBS and made DVDs for the Watson Library at the Metropolitan. Marvin helped curator Wolfram Koeppe and devised a way to show the furniture of David and Abraham Roentgen which is beautiful wood inlay marquetry with secret compartments, sliding panels, <b>rolltop</b> <b>desks,</b> clocks, thermostats, and in some cases opened like beautiful butterflies. The viewers were able to see actual videos of the pieces being opened and displayed showing all of its secret compartments and sliding panels and mechanical innerworkings. A video clip from the 2012 show of the Berlin cabinet went viral on YouTube with over thirteen million hits (Now at 11/22/2016) Use this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKikHxKeodA The technique of using monitors to enhance, enlarge, and illustrate objects such as furniture, sculpture, pottery, and jewelry has become a standard since Marvin first suggest it.|$|R

50|$|A <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> is a 19th-century {{reworking}} of {{the pedestal}} desk with, in addition, {{a series of}} stacked compartments, shelves, drawers and nooks {{in front of the}} user, much like the bureau à gradin or the Carlton House desk. In contrast to these the compartments and the desktop surface of a <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> can be covered by means of a tambour consisting of linked wooden slats that roll or slide through slots in the raised sides of the desk. In that, it is a descendant in function, and partly in form, of the cylinder desk of the 18th century. It is a relative of the tambour desk whose slats retract horizontally rather than vertically.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Wooton desk, {{the fall}} front desk {{and others with}} a hinged desktop (and unlike closable desks with an {{unmovable}} desktop like the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> or the cylinder desk) all documents and various items must {{be removed from the}} work surface of the slant-top desk before closing up.|$|E
50|$|The film, {{considered}} a screwball comedy, {{centers on a}} reporter, Hildebrand 'Hildy' Johnson (Pat O'Brien) and his editor (Adolphe Menjou), who hope {{to cash in on}} a big story involving an escaped accused murderer, Earl Williams (Stone) and hide him in a <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> while everybody else tries to find him.|$|E
50|$|Like the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk,</b> {{which was}} invented much later, the {{cylinder}} desk usually has a fixed work surface: the paperwork {{does not have}} to be stored before the desk is shut. Some designs, however, have the capacity to slide the desk surface out a few inches to expand the available work area.|$|E
5000|$|A tambour desk is a {{desk with}} desktop-based drawers and s, {{in a way}} {{resembling}} bureau à gradin. The small drawers and nooks are covered, when required, by reeded or slatted shutters, tambours, which usually retract in the two sides, left and right. It is a flatter and [...] "sideways" [...] version of the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Because it was {{produced}} in vast numbers and at varying levels of quality, the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> is popular in the antique market. It is usually expensive especially if the wood used is expensive. It is also popular amongst set decorators who want to recreate the [...] "ambiance" [...] of an office of the late 19th or early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|By this {{capacity}} of hiding or revealing the main working area the spinet desk {{could be said}} to be a smaller, less obtrusive cousin of the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> and the cylinder desk. Like them, and unlike the secretary desk or the fall front desk, it can be closed up without disturbing too much the paperwork and various documents and implements left on the main desktop surface.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk,</b> the tambour desk uses straight, {{perfectly}} vertical rows of shutters, and {{the work}} surface rests on a few drawers, which in turn are supported by short legs instead of pedestals. In addition, half of the desktop folds back on itself when not in use. The desktop is supported by sliders, like a secretary desk or a slant top desk when it is unfolded.|$|E
50|$|Some armoire desks have a {{fixed work}} surface, which stays in place {{when the doors}} are closed, and moves only for {{ergonomic}} adjustments. This kind of armoire desk is a direct descendant of the antique <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> which was common in corporate or government offices three or four generations ago, since it provides a fast and efficient way to store or hide current work.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "desk" [...] {{originated}} from the Modern Latin word desca “table to write on”, from the mid 2nd century. It is {{a modification of}} the Old Italian desco [...] "table", from Latin discus [...] "dish" [...] or [...] "disc". The word desk has been used figuratively since 1797. A desk may also {{be known as a}} bureau, counter, davenport, escritoire, lectern, reading stand, <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk,</b> school desk, workspace, or writing desk.|$|E
50|$|The Summer House, {{the largest}} {{building}} in the complex, is nearly {{twice the size of}} the Winter House. Its main block, almost as large as the Winter House, rests on a concrete foundation which is exposed due the sloping terrain, while a slightly smaller ell is attached to the west. A porch extends across the full length of the southern elevation. This building still houses some of Rich's furniture and working materials, including a typewriter and a <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a 2004 sketch on the TV show MADtv, Franklin, {{played by}} Paul Vogt, sends Samuel Adams, played by Josh Meyers, {{to the future}} in a time machine he made from a <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk.</b> Franklin {{wanted to know if}} the American Revolution was a success, but gets {{frustrated}} when Adams only comes back to tell him that Samuel Adams Beer is a success. The time machine also brings back a man named Jerry, played by Ike Barinholtz, who is little help to Franklin.|$|E
50|$|Like the slant top desk, {{the main}} work surface is a hinged {{piece of wood}} which is flat when open and oblique when raised to enclose {{secondary}} work surfaces such as small shelves, small drawers and nooks stacked {{in front of the}} user. Thus, like the Wooton desk, the fall front desk and others with a hinged desktop, and unlike closable desks with an unmovable desktop like the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> or the cylinder desk all documents and various items must be removed from the work surface before closing up.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> was the {{mainstay}} of the small or medium-sized office {{at the end of}} the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. It gradually fell out of favor with the introduction of the steel desk and the coming of greater quantities of correspondence and other documents, which made the small stacked drawers and small shelves obsolete. There were just too many letters to bother folding them again and placing them in the proper slot and there was too little time to open and close all the small drawers to look for things.|$|E
50|$|Set in 1929, {{the story}} focuses on ace {{reporter}} Hildy Johnson, {{who has just}} quit {{his job at the}} Chicago Examiner to marry his fiancée Esther Stone and write screenplays for her movie mogul father, much to the dismay of unscrupulous and cantankerous editor Walter Burns. When streetwalker Mollie Malloy, girlfriend of escaped condemned killer Earl Williams, reveals to Hildy he has secreted himself in a <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> in the courthouse, Hildy cannot resist the lure of writing what could be the biggest scoop of his journalistic career before he boards the train for the West Coast.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{cylinder}} desk, the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> could be mass-produced rather easily since the simple wooden slats {{could be turned}} out very fast in a uniform way. In contrast, the wooden section of a cylinder had {{to be treated with}} great pains to keep its form perfectly over time, lest it warp or bend, and make it impossible to retract or extend. The wooden slats of the rolltop's tambour were usually joined together by being all attached to a cloth or leather foundation, and were thus less influenced by the problems which plagued {{the cylinder}} desk.|$|E
50|$|The US Patent Office {{issued a}} patent {{for the first}} American-made <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> to Abner Cutler of Buffalo, NY in 1850. Similar desks had been seen in Europe before Cutler's patent. The {{cylinder}} desk was a predecessor of the rolltop, and had been in use in France in the 1700s, but warping of the top was common as it was made from {{a single piece of}} wood. The tambour desk may also be considered an early rolltop even though the work surface was only partly covered by the top. The rolltop became a standard item of the Victorian office. Cutler's company flourished until around 1919, when the rolltop design declined in popularity and was replaced by Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles.|$|E
50|$|In August 1774 the cabinet-maker David Roentgen, {{based in}} the town of Neuwied on the lower Rhine, met Rémond in Paris.This was to be the start of a long and {{productive}} relationship between the two men.In future, most of Roentgen's pieces were ornamented with bronze from Paris, including mounts by Rémond and sometimes sculptural work from artists such as Louis-Simon Boizot.Roentgen sold a <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> to Catherine the Great in April 1786, decorated in bronze, with a chiming clock. The clock incorporates a bronze sculpture and bronze ornamentation made with great skill and artistry by Rémond.In a set of five cabinets that Roentgen made for Catherine between 1786 and 1788 Rémond made the arabesque ornaments on the door panels and bronze medallions of the philosophers Cicero and Plato.|$|E

5000|$|More {{paper and}} {{correspondence}} drove {{the need for}} more complex desks and more specialized desks, such as the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk,</b> which was a mass-produced, slatted variant of the classical cylinder desk. [...] It provided a relatively fast and cheap way to lock up the ever increasing flow of paperwork without having to file everything {{by the end of the}} day. Paper documents became voluminous enough to be stored separately in filing cabinets. Correspondence and other documents were now too numerous to get enough attention to be rolled up or folded again, then summarized and tagged before being pigeonholed in a small compartment over or under the work surface of the desk. The famous Wooton desk and others were the last manifestations of the [...] "pigeonhole" [...] style. The surfaces of some newer desks could be transformed into many different shapes and angles, and were ideal for artists, draftsmen, and engineers.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} meeting started, Gordon left his {{partners}} {{and walked down the}} hall where he claimed to have entered the room of a young lady, 22-year-old mob prostitute Nancy Presser, with whom he {{spent the rest of the}} afternoon. He admitted he had talked to some men after leaving the meeting, but police did not release their names. Lou Parkowitz was also present the room and left when the participants began discussing serious matters. He was the last to see Greenberg and Hassel alive as, several minutes later, he returned to the room after hearing gunfire and found both men had been shot to death. Parkowitz claimed that he had passed several men running past him as he hurried back to the room. Entering the room, Parkowitz discovered Hassel's body laying face down near the office doorway while Greenberg was slumped over a closed <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> shot five times in the chest and head.|$|E
5000|$|The B-24's spacious, slab-sided {{fuselage}} (which {{earned the}} aircraft the nickname [...] "Flying Boxcar") was built around two central bomb bays that could accommodate up to 8,000 lb of ordnance in each compartment (but rarely did, as this decreased range and altitude). The forward and aft bomb bay compartments were further split longitudinally with a centerline ventral catwalk just nine inches (23 cm) wide, which also functioned as the fuselage's structural keel beam. An unusual four-panel set of all-metal, tambour-panel [...] "roller-type" [...] bomb bay doors, which operated {{very much like}} the movable enclosure of a <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk,</b> retracted into the fuselage, creating a minimum of aerodynamic drag to keep speed high over the target area, and also allowed the bomb bays to be opened while on the ground; the low ground clearance prevented the use of normal bomb bay doors. The occasional need for crewmen to move around inside from fore to aft within the B-24's fuselage during a mission over the narrow catwalk was a drawback shared with other designs.|$|E
5000|$|Grant's {{character}} describes Bellamy's character {{by saying}} [...] "He {{looks like that}} fellow in the movies, you know...Ralph Bellamy!" [...] According to Bellamy, the remark was ad libbed by Grant. Columbia studio head Harry Cohn thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other [...] "inside" [...] remarks in the film. When his character is arrested for a kidnapping, he describes the horrendous fate suffered by the last person who crossed him: Archie Leach (Grant's birth name). Another line that people think is an inside remark is when Earl Williams attempts {{to get out of}} the <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk</b> he's been hiding in, Grant says, [...] "Get back in there, you Mock Turtle." [...] The line is a [...] "cleaned-up" [...] version of a line from the stage version of The Front Page ("Get back in there, you God damned turtle!") and Grant also played [...] "The Mock Turtle" [...] in the 1933 film version of Alice in Wonderland. In fact, this line is the same in the 1931 movie of [...] "The Front Page." ...|$|E
40|$|This is serious. Turtles live {{in every}} nook and cranny of my house–on shelves, in bookcases, on the mantle over the fireplace, in a special cabinet with glass doors that’s filled to overcrawling, in the cubbies of my <b>rolltop</b> <b>desk.</b> It all started when I became {{director}} of the Cognitive Sciences Center at the University of Minnesota in the late 1970 s, and my family discovered that the turtle is the logo of the Center. The first carved turtle, a gift from my wife, came into my life innocently enough, but they have multiplied beyond imagination and the situation has gotten out of control...|$|E
