Stop codons are also called [...] "termination" [...] or [...] "nonsense" [...] codons. They signal {{release of the}} nascent {{polypeptide}} from the ribosome because no cognate tRNA has anticodons complementary to these stop signals, allowing a <b>release</b> <b>factor</b> to bind to the ribosome instead.|$|E
2500|$|The correct {{amino acid}} is covalently bonded {{to the correct}} {{transfer}} RNA (tRNA) by amino acyl transferases. The amino acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3' OH of the tRNA by an ester bond. When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it, the tRNA is termed [...] "charged". Initiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to the 5' end of mRNA {{with the help of}} initiation factors (IF). Termination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) on the mRNA. tRNA usually cannot recognize or bind to stop codons. Instead, the stop codon induces the binding of a <b>release</b> <b>factor</b> protein that prompts the disassembly of the entire ribosome/mRNA complex and the hydrolysis and the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome. Drugs or special sequence motifs on the mRNA can change the ribosomal structure so that near-cognate tRNAs are bound to the stop codon instead of the release factors. In such cases of 'translational readthrough', translation continues until the ribosome encounters the next stop codon.|$|E

40|$|Nine normal {{volunteers and}} 15 {{patients}} with pituitary disorders {{were given a}} combined test of anterior pituitary function using four hypothalamic <b>releasing</b> <b>factors</b> and arginine vasopressin.

Arginine vasopressin (10 pressor units) was given intramuscularly at the same time. Plasma or serum samples were assayed for concentrations of cortisol, growth hormone, luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, and thyroid stimulating hormone at multiple times for 120 minutes. No troublesome side effects occurred. The results of the <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> combined test with arginine vasopressin were compared in the same subjects with a conventional combined test using insulin together with thyrotrophin releasing hormone and luteinising hormone releasing hormone. No difference was observed in the basal and peak concentrations of luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and prolactin. Both cortisol and growth hormone responses to the <b>releasing</b> <b>factors</b> with arginine vasopressin were much greater than those seen with insulin induced hypoglycaemia or the combined <b>releasing</b> <b>factors</b> without arginine vasopressin. Patients with pituitary hypo-function were similarly recognised in both studies. There was a rapid increase in all hormone values with a peak usually by 60 minutes.

40|$|SUMMARY Corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> and {{vasopressin}} {{were measured}} in major brain regions including the neurohypophysis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive VVistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) during development of hypertension. The highest concentration of corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> was found hi the hypothalamus in both strains. Corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> was decreased in most major brain regions of SHR. In the hypothalamus, corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> was lower in 3 - and 6 -week-old SHR than in age-matched WKY (p< 0. 01), but was similar at 12 and 24 weeks of age. The content of corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> {{did not differ}} in the neurohypophysis in 3 -week-old rats but began to decrease at 6 weeks of age (p < 0. 01) and continued to decrease during the development of hypertension (p < 0. 01). Brain vasopressin concentration did not differ between SHR and WKY except in the hypothalamus. The level of hypothalamic vasopressin was consistently lower in SHR than in WKY (p < 0. 01). These peptides are thought to be associated with autonomic nervous regulation, and our results may further strengthen the possibility that the deficit of the peptides may be involved in the development of spontaneous hypertension.

The effects exerted by two stress-related neuropeptides, corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> and nociceptin/orphaninFQ, on the outflow of [3 H] 5 -hydroxytryptamine were investigated in superfused rat {{dorsal raphe nucleus}} slices. Electrical stimulation (100 mA, 1 msec for 2 min) evoked a frequency-dependent peak of [3 H] 5 -hydroxytryptamine outflow, which was sodium and calcium-dependent. Corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> (1 - 100 nM), concentration-dependently inhibited the stimulation (3 Hz) -evoked [3 H] 5 -hydroxytryptamine outflow; the inhibition by 30 nM corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> (to 68 ± 5. 7 %) was prevented both by the non selective CRF receptor antagonist alpha-helicalCRF(9 - 41) (300 nM) and by the CRF 1 receptor antagonist antalarmin (100 nM). The CRF 2 agonist urocortin II (10 nM) did not modify [3 H] 5 -hydroxytryptamine outflow, ruling out the involvement of CRF 2 receptors. Bicuculline, a GABAA antagonist (10 µM), prevented the inhibitory effect of corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> (30 nM), supporting {{the hypothesis that the}} inhibition was mediated by increased -aminobutyric acid release. Nociceptin/orphaninFQ (1 nM - 1 µM) exerted an antalarmin- and bicuculline-insensitive inhibition on [3 H] 5 -hydroxytryptamine outflow, with the maximum at 100 nM (to 63 ± 4. 2 %), antagonized by the NOP receptor antagonist UFP- 101 (1 µM). Dorsal raphe nucleus slices prepared from rats exposed to 15 min of forced swim stress displayed a reduced [3 H] 5 -hydroxytryptamine outflow, in part reversed by antalarmin and further inhibited by nociceptin/orphaninFQ. These findings indicate that (i) both corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> and nociceptin/orphaninFQ exert an inhibitory control on dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic neurons; (ii) the inhibition by corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>factor</b> involves -aminobutyric acid neurons; (iii) nociceptin/orphaninFQ inhibits dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin system in a corticotropin releasing factor- and -aminobutyric acid-independent manner; iv) nociceptin/orphaninFQ modulation is still operant in slices prepared from stressed rats.
