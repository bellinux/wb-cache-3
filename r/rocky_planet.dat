The inner planet, Kepler-10b, is a <b>rocky</b> <b>planet</b> that orbits every ~0.8 days at a distance of 0.01684 AU. Kepler-10c's equilibrium temperature is estimated at 584 K, almost four times hotter than Jupiter's. The planet's orbital inclination is 89.65º, or almost edge-on with respect to Earth and to Kepler-10. Transits have been observed at points where Kepler-10c has crossed in front of its host star.|$|E
5|$|Around 25–33% {{of white}} dwarfs have metal lines in their spectra, which is notable because any heavy {{elements}} in a white dwarf should sink into the star's interior in just {{a small fraction of}} the star's lifetime. The prevailing explanation for metal-rich white dwarfs is that they have recently accreted rocky planetesimals. The bulk composition of the accreted object can be measured from the strengths of the metal lines. For example, a 2015 study of the white dwarf Ton 345 concluded that its metal abundances were consistent with those of a differentiated, <b>rocky</b> <b>planet</b> whose mantle had been eroded by the host star's wind during its asymptotic giant branch phase.|$|E

5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a <b>rocky</b> <b>planet</b> with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stage of}} <b>rocky</b> <b>planet</b> {{formation}} is the merger stage. It begins when {{only a small}} number of planetesimals remains and embryos become massive enough to perturb each other, which causes their orbits to become chaotic. During this stage embryos expel remaining planetesimals, and collide with each other. The result of this process, which lasts for 10 to 100million years, is the formation of a limited number of Earth sized bodies. Simulations show that the number of surviving planets is on average from 2 to 5. In the Solar System they may be represented by Earth and Venus. Formation of both planets required merging of approximately 10–20 embryos, while an equal number of them were thrown out of the Solar System. Some of the embryos, which originated in the asteroid belt, are thought to have brought water to Earth. Mars and Mercury may be regarded as remaining embryos that survived that rivalry. Rocky planets, which have managed to coalesce, settle eventually into more or less stable orbits, explaining why planetary systems are generally packed to the limit; or, in other words, why they always appear to be at the brink of instability.|$|E

25|$|The COROT team then {{published}} a second paper on COROT-7b's mass, removing stellar activity through analysis only of radial velocity data for which multiple measurements {{were taken in}} a given night. The planet is weighed at 7.42 Earth masses, yielding an average density of 10.4 ± 1.8 g cm−3, far higher than the Earth's and {{similar to that of}} the second <b>rocky</b> <b>planet</b> found, Kepler-10b.|$|E
25|$|COROT-7b has {{a maximum}} surface {{temperature}} between 1800 and 2600°C (3300 to 4700 degrees Fahrenheit). Due to the high temperature, it may be covered in lava. The composition and density of the planet, though weakly constrained, make COROT-7b a probably <b>rocky</b> <b>planet,</b> like Earth. It could belong to a class of planets that are thought to contain up to 40% water (in the form of ice and/or vapor) in addition to rock. However, {{the fact that it}} formed so close to its parent star may mean that it is depleted of volatiles. A strong possibility exists that the planet's rotation is tidally locked to the orbital period, so that temperatures and geologic conditions {{on the sides of the}} planet facing towards and away from the star may be dramatically different. Theoretical work suggests that CoRoT-7b could be a chthonian planet (the remains of a Neptune-like planet from which much of the initial mass has been removed due to close proximity to its parent star). Other researchers dispute this, and conclude COROT-7b was always a <b>rocky</b> <b>planet</b> and not the eroded core of a gas or ice giant, due to the young age of the star system.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} advances by NASA's Kepler Mission was the discovery of an abundant new population of highly irradiated planets with sizes between that of the Earth and Neptune, unlike anything found in the Solar System. Subsequent analysis showed that at 1. 5 R_⊕ there is a transition from a population of predominantly rocky super-Earths to non-rocky sub-Neptunes, which must have substantial volatile envelopes to explain their low densities. Determining the origin of these highly irradiated <b>rocky</b> <b>planets</b> will be critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency of potentially habitable Earth-like <b>planets.</b> These short-period <b>rocky</b> super-Earths could simply be the stripped cores of sub-Neptunes, which have lost their envelopes due to atmospheric photo-evaporation or other processes, or they might instead be a separate population of inherently <b>rocky</b> <b>planets,</b> which never had significant envelopes. We suggest an observational path forward to distinguish between these scenarios. Using models of atmospheric photo-evaporation we show that if most bare <b>rocky</b> <b>planets</b> are the evaporated cores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys push to longer orbital periods. On the other hand, if most <b>rocky</b> <b>planets</b> formed after their disks dissipate then these planets will have formed without initial gaseous envelopes. In this case, we use N-body simulations of planet formation to show that the transition radius should increase with orbital period. Moreover, we show that distinguishing between these two scenarios should be possible in coming years with radial velocity follow-up of planets found by TESS. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of this work for current efforts to measure η_⊕, which may yield significant overestimates if most <b>rocky</b> <b>planets</b> form as evaporated cores.
