Bioproizvodnost amorfe istraživana je na tri pokusne plohe unutar četiri pokusna polja. Broj ploha ujedno označava duljinu ophodnje. Mjerenjem su utvrđeni parametri bioproizvodnosti amorfe od broja panjeva na plohama, broja izdanaka na pojedinom panju i na plohi, visine i promjera izdanaka te izmjere zelene biomase nakon sječe odvagom. Određeni parametri preračunati su na hektar. U jednogodišnjoj ophodnji zelena biomasa amorfe u četvrtom turnusu u rasponu je od 7, 40 t/ha do 13, 20 t/ha, a prosječna 10, 15 t/ha. Uz udio vlage 35, 92 % suha je biomasa 6, 50 t/ha. Prosječna zelena masa jednog izdanka amorfe na plohama iznosi 0, 0897 kg. Prosječna dvogodišnja proizvodnja zelene biomase u drugome turnusu dosegla je iznos od 24, 52 t/ha, dok je prosječna godišnja bioproizvodnja 12, 26 t/ha. Udio vlage u zelenoj biomasi je 35, 71 %, što znači da je dvogodišnja bioproizvodnja suhe biomase 15, 76 t/ha, odnosno godišnji je prosjek 7, 88 t/ha. Prosječna masa jednog izdanka amorfe na plohama iznosi 0, 2404 kg. Zelena biomasa u četverogodišnjoj ophodnji ostvarena je u rasponu 33, 24 t/ha do 51, 40 t/ha, s prosjekom od 42, 06 t/ha. Prosječna godišnja proizvodnja zelene biomase ostvaruje se od 8, 31 t/ha do 12, 85 t/ha, s prosječnom vrijednošću za sve plohe 10, 52 t/ha.

At the {{beginning}} of 2008, {{within the scope of}} the project Forest products and harvesting technology agreed with Croatian Forests Ltd, Zagreb, we have set up a research of biopotential, energetic characteristics and harvesting technology and use of indigobush biomass. From the above mentioned project, in 2012, a separate project Biopotential and energy characteristics of indigobush was transferred to the Academy of forestry sciences. The research ground was established in the pure indigobush stand in the forest management unit of the Posavina Forests, department 126 a, Forest Office Sunja, Forest Administration Sisak. Within the block system, four test fields have been established; each with six 5 x 5 m large sub-test plots. (Figure 1) This paper shows the results of the fourth year of research of indigobush considering its bioproductivity potential with a reference to the prescribed standards, harvesting characteristics and market demands, all which determines its position within the family of renewable <b>resources</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> biomass for energy purposes. The research has encompassed plots 1, 2 and 4, i. e. bioproductivity of indigobush in one-year, two-year and four-year rotations. Within the scope of forest biomass issues, a higher number of HRN EN standards was considered, and a critical review of the terminology related to forest biomass, i. e., hard fuels, a term unscrupulous authors use in their publications. Data of plots 1 are shown in Figures 3 and 4. In a one-year rotation per hectare, there were 87 200 to 140 400 one-year-old sprouts of indigobush. Mean height of sprouts on plots vary in a narrow range of 16 cm, taking a value of 2. 07 m on the test field IV and up to 2. 23 m on the test field II. The smallest mean diameter is recorded on the test field II and it amounts to 7. 11 mm, while the largest was found on the test field III and it was 7. 56 mm. Green indigobush mass on plots 1 ranges between 18. 50 kg to 33. 00 kg or in the calculation per hectare of the surface, it ranges between 7. 40 t/ha and 13. 20 t/ha. The difference between the smallest and the biggest value of green mass production on plots 1 is significant and it amounts to 5. 80 t/ha. Average bioproduction of the green mass of indigobush on plots 1 in the fourth year of research amounts to 10. 15 t/ha. Mean mass of one sprout of indigobush for all four plots is 0. 0897 kg. Data of plots 2 are shown in Figures 5 and 6. Number of sprouts on plots 2 ranges from 225 on fields II and IV up to 303 on field I, respectively, from 90 000 pcs/ha to 121 000 pcs/ha. Minimal mean height of 2. 67 m is recorded in field I, and the maximal in field II, namely, 2. 81 m. Mean diameter was the lowest on plot 2 in field I and it amounts to 9. 82 mm, while the largest of 11. 77 mm was recorded on test field IV. After long vegetation the established production of green mass of indigobush on plots amounts from 55. 50 kg to a maximum of 70. 50 kg or from 22. 20 t/ha to 28. 20 t/ha. Average biannual production of green biomass amounts to 24. 52 t/ha, respectively, average annual value amounts to 12. 26 t/ha. Mean mass of one sprout of indigobush on plots assumes the value from 0. 199 kg to 0. 264 kg, i. e. 0. 240 kg on average for all plots. The parameters of bioproduction of indigobush for plots 4 are shown in Figures 7 and 8. Mean sprout height on plots 4 varies from 2. 82 m to 3. 04 m, and the diameter from 11. 49 mm to 13. 96 mm. The accumulated green biomass of indigobush during four vegetative periods varies between 83. 10 kg/plot to a maximum of 128. 50 kg/plot. After four-year rotations, per hectare, we acquired from 90 800 to 131 600 or an average of 109 000 sprouts and green biomass between 33. 24 t/ha and 51. 40 t/ha or an average of 42. 06 t/ha. Average annual production of green biomass on plots 4 ranges from 8. 31 t/ha to 12. 85 t/ha and the mean value for all plots is 10. 52 t/ha. Mean mass of one sprout of indigobush on all plots is 0. 386 kg. Table 1 and Figures 9, 10 and 11 show data of the variation analysis of diameter at breast height, and Table 2 and Figures 12, 13 and 14 show data of the variation analysis of mean sprout height of indigobush, including a discussion. Table 3 shows the production of green biomass, laboratory determined percentages of moisture ratio of green indigobush and dry biomass matter. On plots 1, the percentage of moisture of indigobush wood ranges from 35. 27 % to 37. 02 % with a mean value of 35. 92 %, on plots 2 the range of moisture is between 35. 26 % and 36. 03 % with mean value of 35. 71 %, while on plots 4 it ranges between 30. 91 % and 35. 59 % with a mean value of 33. 19 %. The proportion of dry matter in the samples of indigobush wood, relevant for all tested plots, ranges from 62. 98 % to 69. 09 %. In average, it is lowest on plots 1 with 64. 08 %; on plots 2 the average value is 64. 29 %, and on plots 4 it is the highest and it amounts to 66. 81 %. Absolute values of the produced dry indigobush biomass in 2011 on plots 1 ranges from 11. 88 kg/plot to 21. 36 kg/plot or in average 16. 26 kg/plot, i. e., or 6. 5 t/ha of dry biomass. On plots 1, which are harvested on a yearly basis {{at the end of every}} vegetative period, the annual level of bioproductivity of dry biomass after the first vegetation in 2008, it amounted to 12 t/ha (Krpan and Tomasic, 2009), after the second (2009) it was 7. 87 t/ha (Krpan et al. 2011 – 2), after the third (2010) it was 9. 79 t/ha, and in 2011 it was 6. 5 t/ha, and thus it could be concluded that bioproductivity of indigobush in one year rotation varies and has a decreasing trend in comparison with the first vegetation. In a two-year rotation on plots 2, it was produced between 35. 64 kg and 52. 30 kg, with an average of 40. 99 kg/plot (Krpan et al. 2011 – 2). Therefore, the mean biannual bioproductivity of dry indigobush matter amounted 16. 40 t/ha or on an annual average basis it was 8. 20 t/ha which increases the value of bioproductivity for 0. 31 t/ha in comparison with the second biannual yield in 2011. In the four-year rotation of indigobush on plots 4, the established bioproductivity of dry biomass of indigobush has a value from 55. 05 kg/plot to a maximum of 86. 62 kg/plot or an average of 70. 25 kg/plot, respectively, 28. 10 t/ha. Mean annual bioproductivity of dry biomass in the four year rotation was 7. 03 t/ha. Bioproductivity of indigobush in this paper, based on the measurements of growth and increment parameters, density of the sprouts, parameters of laboratory research, its green mass, moisture and dry matter per plot unit in one-year, two-year and four-year rotation, despite the understandable variations, shows the potential benefit of indigobush within the family of solid fuels derived from forest biomass for energy. This paper showed previous research results based on which, due to the variations in the annual biomass production, it is not possible to choose and recommend an optimal rotation...|$|E
40|$|The {{forest is}} not a legacy from our forefathers - it's {{something}} we hand down in trust to our children. 'Many African countries are now trying out various means of halting {{the destruction of the}} vast expanses of dense forest which forms an invaluable and irreplaceable heritage. Structured and sensible management would enable the forest to serve many needs. Each year eight million hectares of dense rainforest, nearly the equivalent of a country the size of Benin, succumb to the chainsaw and machetes of developers and farmers in search of more land. At that rate half the skill remaining tropical rainforests will have disappeared {{by the end of the}} century. Fortunately, many tropical countries have now become more aware of this impending ecological and economic catastrophe. For a decade now conference after conference has sought ways to reverse the process of deforestation. The challenge that must be faced is to preserve an ecosystem which, although changed, is still immensely rich biologically, at the same time as producing wood and other commodities on a long-term basis. The means employed will vary from country to country, according to the characteristics of the forest, but all geared to the same result: marrying the requirements of production to those of conservation. Planting can reduce destruction Many African countries, for example the Congo, Cameroon and Zaire have already lost a large proportion of their forest wealth. In others, the entire forest mass has gone, and in these it is too late for protection or natural regeneration measures. Planting alone can replace the desired trees. But this method is limited in its effectiveness, and used only as a last resort. In the past, tree plantations were common, established by colonialists as a matter of policy in order to replenish wood stocks. They chose the best sites near ports, roads and large towns. 'In economic terms, these plantations were not a bad thing: they replaced scattered forest areas with plots which were both accessible and within certain geographical limits,' explains Rene Catinot, an international consultant. 'They were highly productive although they could not cover the entire surface area of the forest which had been destroyed elsewhere. But, a selectively cultivated and well-maintained forest produces eight to ten times more wood than wild forest and so foresters needed to plant only one hectare for every ten hectares felled. ' This in a way accounts for the disappearance of forests in many countries. Only a tenth has been replanted, the rest of the area has been occupied by peasant farmers in search of new land to cultivate. But after years producing cassava, yams and taro, the land becomes barren, and the itinerant farmers move on, leaving land that can no longer sustain trees. All that is left of a once luxuriant and dense forest are patches of exhausted infertile land, prone to erosion. The objective of conservationists today is to preserve the tropical rainforest in its original state. This forest is exceptionally rich, supporting more than a hundred different tree species per hectare, compared to the 10 - 15 in temperate forests. Botanists emphasize the importance of this heritage, and some of the component species which make it up have yet to be catalogued. Similarly sociologists and economists endeavour to demonstrate the indispensability of the forest's secondary products: rattan, gum, resin, oils, bamboo, perfume, spices, medicines and pesticides. In some instances secondary products are more important than timber. Exploitation for conservation Given the current population explosion, a 'hands-off' policy of leaving the dense tropical forest to regenerate itself {{is not a}} viable option. 'That would be a mistake,' emphasizes Jean Esteve, a scientist with the Centre Technique Forestier Tropical. 'There are certain areas, which could be classified Plantations are no substitute for natural forest in order to preserve the forest heritage, but outside these the forest must be developed if we wish to save it, but this must be don' carefully. ' Among the arguments for exploiting the forests, is that when the forest is thinner it i revitalized and becomes more vigorous Furthermore, a forest with financial interest is likely to be better protected against incur signs from farmers. Wild, untended fores is more likely to be ravaged by local inhabitants in search of agricultural land If, however, felled forest is replanted the local people can enjoy immense and sustainable <b>resources</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> animals medicines and fruit. Furthermore, fores management carried out on a regular basis gives the population long-tern employment. What better reasons for forest dwellers to defend it and to participate spontaneously in its conservation. Even if forests are felled heavily, they can still be regenerated as long as they are no let fallow indiscriminately or become subjected to itinerant farmers. This is why i is so vital to develop management practice which will generate income from the wood without destroying the forest. In line with the Tropical Forest Action Plan's guideline the Central African Republic has put into effect one of the most original management techniques evolved by scientists: the use of poison. The method involves artificial intervention in the process of natural selection (the 'law of the jungle') whereby trees of potential value, compete for space, water and light with those of limited economic use. Workers of the Office National de Forets (ONF) select potentially useful specimens from the virgin forest, and give them a helping hand by killing off some of the competitors with chemical arboricides. Thus the less useful trees die upright, allowing the others space for rapid growth. The ONF then adopts the stockman's technique of 'fattening up the good trees' for exploitation. The results of an experiment on 500 ha of forest in Lobaya, in the south of Central African Republic, seem promising, and it will be extended to other regions and countries. Togo invests in a variety of methods Togo's forest is under extreme threat, disappearing at a rate of 12, 000 ha per year, and the authorities have undertaken several measures to combat this process which, if left unchecked, would destroy the entire forest area in the next 50 years. Their first step was to import timber, which is scarce in Togo, from Ghana, Benin and Nigeria to relieve the pressure on their own forests. The next step was large-scale plantation of eucalyptus for timber and fuelwood near the large coastal urban centres. The Amenagement Forestier et Reboisement Industriel (Forest management and industrial reforestation (AFRI) project, launched in 1982, now covers an area of 10, 000 ha about 50 km north of Lome. Every four years the wood is cut and sold to charcoal burners or carpenters. The tree stump develops shoots which, another four years on, produce new trees. This 'coppicing' continues for four cycles permitting this type of 'artificial' forest to remain in production for 20 years before replanting is necessary. At the same time Togo is creating listed forest parks which are protected by law, although cases of contravening of these laws are numerous despite a total ban on felling in these zones. Finally, the Rivers and Forests authorities are moving towards tax exemptions for private businesses which replant for commercial and industrial purposes. The aim of this is to encourage landowners to invest in wood as a perennial growth industry and the Plateaux region already has large privately-owned teak plantations. So, the often-opposed interests of profit and conservation can work together if encouraged by this sort of fiscal policy. Forest demarcation is - the way of the future Despite these small glimmers of hope in the task of conserving the forest, destruction forges ahead at an alarming rate. 'The tropical rainforest has been disappearing for years now, and during these years scientists and technologists have been working on forestry conservation techniques. But things are not improving. So what now?' asked UNESCO's Malcolm Hadley at a tropical rainforest workshop in Cayenne in 1990. Many rainforests could be managed productively, and the techniques to do this are technically and economically viable. In other words, the tools to do the job may not yet be perfect, but they exist. 'Research alone won't save the forest unless at some point the findings are applied, and that depends on political decisions,' was the opinion of John Palmer of the International Union of Forestry Research Organizations (IUFRO). Political pressure will often stop a country from enforcing legislation: in Senegal or Cote d'lvoire the authorities endorse the clearance of classified forest for firewood or agriculture. There are those who believe that a halt to this accelerated destruction of the tropical rainforest will come neither from the forest itself nor from the forest-dwellers. The most damage is caused by the slash-and burn itinerant farmers, who would fell trees for the sake of growing a handful of food, and outdo the woodcutters in their rush to sell firewood. Development alone will not solve this problem, and the only way of reducing the enormous pressure on the available land is to intensify agriculture. In the end, management is the answer. Forestry zones must be demarcated, and each one must fulfil a specific objective: classified forest must preserve the genetic variety; there must be timber forest for industrial use; zones for village needs; and plantations of trees compatible with agriculture practices. But all this effort will be worth nothing unless the forest conservation is shown to be a viable prospect for the people who live there. Saving the forest is everyone's responsibility, and this will only happen if the forest-dwellers are made to understand the need to protect their environment.

Various modelling methods are applied to this information to predict log yields for different stands, through time and under different cutting strategies. This yield information allows the scheduling component (ATLAS Market Supply) to find an optimal way of meeting the demand for logs of varying qualities from the available stands, given harvesting capabilities and transport distances. Assuming the issues arising from initial use of the system can be addressed, the indications are that the combined system of pre-harvest forest assessment and optimisation of harvesting and log allocation is able to characterise the <b>resource</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> qualities and provide the best match of logs to customer demands, thereby maximising the returns to both the grower and the processor...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{examines the}} management and sustainability <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> pasture on the commons of Norfolk from the medieval period until the early nineteenth century. It has been generally accepted that areas <b>of</b> common <b>wood</b> pasture were particularly unstable environments, subject to overgrazing and tree removal with little means of maintaining the dual <b>resources</b> <b>of</b> pasture and <b>wood.</b> However, evidence from the populous and intensively farmed county of Norfolk challenges that assertion. Using sources including manorial records, manuscript maps and the documentation associated with Parliamentary Enclosure this paper demonstrates that individual tenants and groups of commoners defended their right to use and maintain wooded common pastures. Manorial records defined customary rights to manage existing pollards and for the regular planting of young trees on commons. Peasant farmers continued to exercise these rights throughout {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries and, when challenged, took their grievances to the law courts, making full use of the contemporary judicial system. The evidence from Norfolk suggests that wood pastures were managed and replenished by those with common rights, who sustained this resource despite opposition and the potential for overuse. Only when the commons themselves succumbed to Enclosure in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century did common wood pasture cease to be a customary part of the Norfolk landscape...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{identify}} using wood sustainably in buildings in Taiwan with low environmental impacts. First, attitudes of building design-related professionals were investigated towards the use <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> in building design in Taiwan. And then, since most <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> is imported to Taiwan from overseas, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the environmental impacts <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> and sustainability <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> <b>resources.</b> A simplified assessment <b>of</b> using <b>wood</b> in a sustainable manner was proposed, including five indicators, such as embodied energy consumption, embodied CO 2 emissions, economic cost, forest resource and natural durability <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> species. In the third part of the thesis, environmental impacts <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> structure, reinforced concrete structure and steel structures were analysed in construction and material recovery phases. Both qualitative and quantitative research methodology was utilised in this thesis. Qualitative methodology in questionnaire survey was applied to the analysis of attitudes of building professionals towards the use <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> in Taiwan. Quantitative research based on life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to the analysis of environmental impacts <b>of</b> imported <b>wood</b> and three different building structures in Taiwan. The results of questionnaire survey revealed positive attitudes towards the use <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> in building design. It has found that at present professionals preferred using wood in substructure than in main structure in building design. In addition, factors of economic value, beauty, sustainability <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> availability <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and the role of proprietor influenced their attitudes <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> utilisation. Besides, as for sustainability <b>of</b> using <b>wood</b> with five indicators, wood from Canada was the most sustainable resource, followed by Oceania, and Sweden.

40|$|Globalization offers {{developing}} countries {{the opportunities to}} create wealth through export-led growth, to expand international trade in goods and services, and {{to gain access to}} new ideas, technologies, and institutional designs. But globalization also entails problems and tensions that must be appropriately managed. For one thing, global business cycles can contribute greatly to macroeconomic volatility at the national level. The scope and severity of crises in Mexico (1994 - 95), Asia (1997), Russia (1998), and Brazil (1999) suggests the severity of the financial vulnerability {{developing countries}} face nowadays. With financial markets so highly integrated, problems are transmitted rapidly from one country to another. The rapid transmission of financial shocks changes levels of confidence and affects exchange rates, interest rates, asset prices, and, ultimately, output and employment - with consequent social effects. Policymakers should also be concerned about how globalization exacerbates job instability and income disparities both within and across countries. Macroeconomic and financial crises, by increasing poverty and social tensions, can be political destabilizing. As the 20 th century ends, the <b>resources</b> <b>of</b> Bretton <b>Woods</b> institutions are strained because of the large and complex rescue packages needed to deal with large-scale volatility. Development policy agendas in the era of globalization need to articulate traditional concerns with growth, stability, and social equity with new themes such as transparency and good governance at several levels: national, regional, and global.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} studies <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> usually involve destructive wood assessments, with time-consuming {{tests that}} use large amounts <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> (<b>wood).</b> Although {{this is not}} a limiting factor, it could be attenuated by the use of a nondestructive technique known as near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). This technique has been applied to evaluate compounds containing C-H, N-H, S-H or O-H bonds, and involves quick analyses and can be applied to process control tasks. The objective of this work is to use the NIRS technique to obtain calibrations for mechanical properties <b>of</b> Eucalyptus sp. <b>wood.</b> A natural E. urophylla hybrid at age 7 was used as obtained from V&M Florestal crops. Spectra were measured directly in solid wood (radial, tangential and transverse faces) and in ground wood, in diffuse reflectance mode, using a Bruker spectrometer in the 800 to 1, 500 nm range. The NIRS technique proved suitable to estimate modulus of elasticity in solid wood, with values r= 0. 91 and RPD= 2. 6, and in ground wood, with values r= 0. 87 and RPD= 2. 0. Modulus of rupture and compressive strength presented r values below 0. 9. First and second derivative pretreatments provided a slight increase in correlation values for the properties in question. Calibrations for different plank faces did not present a defined variation pattern. Solid wood and ground wood presented similar correlation values for all properties. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Saproxylic {{insects are}} {{important}} for the decomposition <b>of</b> dead <b>wood,</b> and therefore crucial for maintaining healthy forest ecosystems. There is, however, little knowledge {{about their ability to}} respond to massive <b>resource</b> pulses <b>of</b> dead <b>wood</b> caused by outbreaks of defoliating insects. This study investigates the numerical response of saproxylic beetles to increased availability <b>of</b> dead <b>wood</b> caused by outbreaks of geometrid moths in the mountain birch forest of Finnmark, Northern Norway. Beetles were sampled with window (flight interception) traps in 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016 along two 20 km long transects with differences in habitats and defoliation histories. Both transects started in forest that was damaged by outbreaks during the period 2001 - 2009 (high dead wood abundance) and ran towards healthy, undamaged forest (normal dead wood abundance). Galleries and exit-holes made by saproxylic beetles on dead stems were also counted along the same transects in 2016. This were done to assess differences in utilization rates of dead trees by the beetles between damaged and undamaged forest and transects. The abundance of saproxylic beetles in the study system increased from 2011 to 2015. However, this response was seemingly driven by a few dominant species related to early successional stages <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> decay. Habitat variations between transects did in addition appear to heavily affect most of the beetle community, including the dominant species. The beetles appeared to favor areas with more variation and productivity, which corresponds with the utilization rates of dead trees by saproxylic beetles. The rates of galleries and exit-holes were highest in such areas as well as on stems with high diameters. However, the saproxylic beetle community has yet to utilize all the dead <b>wood</b> <b>resources</b> <b>of</b> the area as of 2016, and the wood remains in an early stage of decomposition. Less preferable dead wood resources and the cold climate of the region may partially explain why the beetle community have been unable to mount a sufficient numerical response to handle all the dead wood resources. The dead wood created by the moth outbreak may therefore spend longer time to decompose past the earliest successional stages than anticipated...|$|R

40|$|Wood {{has been}} an {{essential}} material in many endeavors since humanity 2 ̆ 7 s earliest days. Although Japan is rich in forest <b>resources,</b> substantial amounts <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> are imported from abroad due to increased timber demand in the modern age. As a result, the Port of Nagoya has become well-known as a site handling large volumes <b>of</b> imported <b>wood.</b> This increased volume <b>of</b> imported <b>wood,</b> in turn, created {{the need for more}} lumber yard fields within the port area. In 1959, high tidal waves caused by the Ise Bay Typhoon swept much wood away from the lumber yard field and caused a great deal of damage to the houses and lives of the neighborhood. Therefore, a new timber-handling district was established {{on the west side of}} the harbor, and most of the businesses relocated to this site. Unfortunately, decreased domestic timber demand due to the 1973 oil shock caused the Port 2 ̆ 7 s wood-handling volume to decrease. Timber companies that purchased land in the industrial district began to file motions to withdraw from the land. Lumber yard field utilization dropped, and some areas of the lumber yard field became landfill. Shipping and logistics companies gradually took over many sites from which timber companies withdrew. As a result, the nature <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> industrial park has significantly changed. The erosion of the timber-handling district, which had expanded while developing in tandem with the Nagoya, seems to strike an end to the historic role. The Port 2 ̆ 7 s management association has thus accepted the need to consider these changes in the industrial structure of Nagoya region, and began to restructure the timber-handling district to suit the needs of the next generation...|$|R
