50|$|Tule (Schoenoplectus acutus {{also called}} bulrushes) have a thin (~1 cm or 0.5 inch) diameter, rounded green stems that grows to 1 to 3 metres (3-10 ft) tall. They grow well in marshes, {{wetlands}} {{or at the}} edges of bodies of water. The tule stem has a pithy interior filled with spongy tissue packed with air cells—this makes it float well on water as well as a good insulator. Native Americans used tule for making and thatching huts, baskets, mats, boats, decoys, hats, clothing and shoes. Tule was typically cut using deer scapula <b>saws</b> that had <b>rough</b> <b>saw</b> like edges <b>cut</b> into them. Tule has to be handled with care when green to avoid breaking the stem and gains strength when it is partially dried.|$|R

50|$|Diamond {{grinding}} involves {{removing a}} thin layer at the surface of hardened PCC using closely spaced diamond saw blades. The level surface is achieved by running the blade assembly at a predetermined level across the pavement surface, which produces <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> grooves. The uncut concrete between each <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> breaks off more or less at a constant level above the <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> grooves, leaving a level surface (at a macroscopic level) with longitudinal texture. The result is a pavement that is smooth, safe, quiet and pleasing to travel.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} different machining modes on the flexural strength CAD-CAM restorative materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four different CAD-CAM materials were used: VITA MARKII, VITA Enamic (VITA Zahnfabrik), Empress CAD, and e. max CAD (Ivoclar Vivadent). Rectangular bars for each material (except e. max CAD) were made by three procedures: <b>saw</b> <b>cut,</b> normal mill and fast mill. Each subgroup had a sample size of 5. <b>Saw</b> <b>cut</b> bars were cut by a BUHLER diamond blade saw. Milled bars were made using SIRONA CEREC MCXL milling unit. The 3 -point flexural strength test was performed using a universal testing machine. Surface roughness was measured using a profilomer. Student t-test and Tukey-Kramer statistical analysis were performed to check significant differences. RESULTS: e. max CAD <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> group was significantly stronger than the milled group. There {{was no difference in}} the strength of the Empress CAD groups. Enamic <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> group was significantly stronger than the normal milled but not the fast milled one. There {{was no significant difference between}} the Enamic milled groups. Vita MKII <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> was significantly stronger than both milled groups. There was no difference in the strength between the milled MKII groups. The surface roughness of the <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> groups in all materials were significantly less than their milled counterparts in both longitudinal and transverse measurements. CONCLUSION: Machining had a significant effect on the surface roughness of materials. Damage from machining can cause the material to have lower flexural strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{position}} of the first metatarsal following a crescentic osteotomy for hallux valgus {{is a function of}} the size of the <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> and orientation of the osteotomy. This study reports the effect of these variables, recommended tech-nique, and potential pitfalls when using the crescent os-teotomy. Using molded polyurethane foam metatarsals and a precision drill press which controlled the <b>saw</b> <b>cuts,</b> the following variables were studied: (1) orientation of the <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> to the metatarsal, (2) the saw size (diameter of the saw relative to the shaft width of the osteotomy site), and (3) the direction toward which the crescent faces (proximal/distal). Best correction can be obtained if the saw diameter is larger than the diameter of the osteotomy site (allowing a greater degree of correction before im-pingement), the saw tip is tilted slightly toward the sesa-moids (which ensures that the metatarsal does not rotate medially with correction), and the saw is rotated laterally to cause slight declination of the toe...|$|R
40|$|Concrete sawing {{operations}} are performed at pre-determined locations {{within the first}} 24 hours to prevent random cracking on jointed plain concrete pavements. In current construction procedures, the depth and {{the timing of the}} saw is usually established by the contractor based on experience. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the effect of several concrete mixture proportions and constituents on the early-age fracture properties and their effect on <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> timing and depth for concrete pavements with several slab geometries. Concrete pavement mixtures with different coarse aggregate size and cementitious content were evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the measured fracture properties on <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> model predictions. Finite element analysis was used to derive the geometric correction factors necessary to characterize the fracture properties of concrete based on the wedge plitting test configuration. A <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> depth model proposed by Zollinger was modified to determine the timing and depth of notches on jointed plain concrete pavements. The theoretical analysis and practical example lead to the observation that if greater time is desired before saw cutting, the design should favor concrete materials with slower development of fracture properties. Larger coarse aggregate tends to increase concrete fracture toughness, and therefore will require deeper <b>saw</b> <b>cuts.</b> Thinner concrete pavements also require significantly deeper notch depth ratios relative to thicker slabs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract For {{the purpose}} of {{exploring}} deformation characteristics of jointed rock masses, influence of joint inclination and confining pressure on the mechanical behavior of discontinuous rock a series of compression tests were conducted under satisfactory testing conditions on three types of sandstone from various locations. Three groups of jointed specimens were used in this research, including specimens containing <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> planar joint, shear-surface joint and split breakage joint. The specimens were tested triaxially up to 70 MPa confined pressure. A 5 MN servo-controlled stiff testing machine was employed and a monitoring system was set up using a microcomputer controlled logger. The deformation characteristics of jointed specimens with <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> joints were different in low and high confinements, however, in split breakage joints sliding behavior was the same in low and high confinements. Mohr envelope for 60 ° inclination in split breakage joints was above that of 45 ° in both <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> and split breakage joints, i. e. a higher coefficient of sliding friction or a higher shear strengt...|$|R
