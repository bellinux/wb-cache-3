5|$|Field marshal is the five-star {{rank and}} highest {{attainable}} <b>rank</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian Army. Though the rank is placed above general, {{it is not}} observed in the regular structure. It is a largely ceremonial or wartime rank, having been awarded only twice. A field marshal receives the full pay of a four–star general, and is considered a serving officer until their death. They wear a full uniform on all ceremonial occasions. In addition to this, they also run {{an office in the}} Army Headquarters with a secretariat.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} {{scarcity of}} hyena depictions in Paleolithic rock art has been theorised {{to be due}} to the animal's lower <b>rank</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, and it was not sought after as prey. Also, it was not a serious rival like the cave lion or cave bear, and it lacked the impressiveness of the mammoth or woolly rhino.|$|E

He rescued many people and took them secretly to Mangalore or Tellicherry. He proposed that those anxious to regain their liberty could be rescued on payment to him of a certain sum of money.

5|$|In 1762 Crillon {{moved to}} Spain, {{where he served}} as a lieutenant-general – the highest <b>rank</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bourbon armies – and was made a Knight of the Order of Charles III in 1780.

The army landed on the island on 19 August 1781 and laid siege to the British garrison in Fort St. Philip at Mahon. The siege was concluded successfully on 5 February 1782 when the British surrendered, for which Crillon was made a grandee of Spain and took the title of Duke of Crillon-Mahon. He was subsequently put in charge of the joint French and Spanish force that had been besieging Gibraltar since 1779. Despite his efforts, Gibraltar proved impregnable and peace was restored in 1783.|$|E

In 1819, Duyệt was in Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa in northern Vietnam putting down revolts for Gia Long. During this time, he joined forces with a former rebel leader from a highlands minority group in Cao Bằng. This man became Duyệt's adopted son under the name Lê Văn Khôi and his men also rallied to the court. Khoi was then propelled directly into a high-ranking post in Gia Định. During the final four years of Gia Long's reign, Duyệt ascended to the highest <b>rank</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> court, and he and Pham Dang Hung, another southerner, {{were the only people}} present as the emperor died.

Later in the war, he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy {{to deal with what}} he considered to be the greater priority, the defeat of Germany, rather than have it be used against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} years, Porto Alegre turned his {{attention}} to politics, retiring from his military career as a lieutenant general, the second-highest <b>rank</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Army. He was an affiliate of the Liberal Party at the national level and was elected to the legislature of Rio Grande do Sul. He also founded a provincial party, the Progressive-Liberal Party—a coalition of Liberals like him and some members of the Conservative Party. Porto Alegre later entered the lower house of the Brazilian parliament and was briefly Minister of War. When the Paraguayan War erupted in 1864, he returned to active duty. One of the main Brazilian commanders during the conflict, his participation was marked by important battlefield victories, as well as constant quarrels with his Argentine and Uruguayan allies.|$|E
