In particular, alpha-induced nuclear reactions that occur on tracer elements added to the NIF capsule have been shown through simulation to be a very sensitive diagnostic for mix.

Reactions on elements doped into the innermost part of the capsule ablator would therefore be sensitive to material that had mixed into the hot spot. <b>Radiochemical</b> <b>determinations</b> of activated detector elements may perhaps be the only true measure of mix that occurs in a NIF capsule, particularly in cases when the capsule fails...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Organic d acid (oxalic and succinic) {{adsorption}} onto montmorillonite is feasible, but weak (- 1 mg/g). The {{comparison of}} chemical and <b>radiochemical</b> <b>determinations</b> reveals that 80 % of the acid {{in contact with the}} smectite is used to attack the clay lattice. The pH is the main parameter involved in adsorption, and fixation passes through a minimum for pH 6 to 7. Polyacrylate adsorption is also weak (- 1. 5 mg/g). It changes with the nature of the exchangeable cation of smectite. Its pH-dependence displays apronounced maximum for a value corresponding tothe pKa of the acidic functions (pH- 6. 8), and a minimum at about pH 8. On the assumption that a polyacrylate macromolecule is 100 % hydrolyzed, itfollows that he-COOH groups carried by 20 % hydrolyzed polyacrylamide molecules (uch as those used in the tertiary recovery of petroleum) contribute at the very most to 10 % of the total adsorption onto clay. Fixation, therefore, involves predominantly protonation of the amide functions at the edge surfaces of the clay. The acidic functions play a minor ole in the adsorption phenomenon in that they affect he length of the macromol-ecule. The extent of this contribution, however, is virtually impossible to estimate.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} new and traditional surface materials for use in cattle barns. The evaluated concrete materials had different compositions and included different additives and coatings. Contact angle meter, optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy SEM were used for characterization of surface properties. Radiochemical methods and a biochemical adenosine triphosphate ATP method were used to determine cleanability. A specific methodological aim was to examine the correlations between these determination methods. A statistically significant difference was observed between contact angles of non-coated concretes, coated concretes and joint materials. In general, coatings smoothened surfaces and the joint materials were the roughest surfaces, as illustrated by profilometry and SEM. On the basis of the <b>radiochemical</b> <b>determination</b> methods, coatings improved the cleanability of concrete. An epoxy joint material was cleaned efficiently from the oil model soil and from the labelled feed soil when compared to the two cement-based joint materials. According to the results of the biochemical ATP method the manure test soil was cleaned better from a concrete including inorganic sealant than from the other materials examined. The cleanability results of oil model soil used in the radiochemical method correlated with the results of the test feed soil used in the biochemical ATP method. Both determination methods of cleanability appeared to be suitable for examining the cleanability of surfaces soiled with agricultural soils. Only the <b>radiochemical</b> <b>determination</b> gives detailed quantitative results, but it can be used only in laboratory studies. The results of this laboratory study will be used for selecting materials for a pilot study in a cattle barn. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{mechanism}} of action and metabolism of clozapine, a complex drug used in psychopharmacology, is not completely understood. The effects of this compound in human body are related to some interactions with serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter receptors. To further elucidate the {{mechanism of}} action and to support ongoing drug metabolism studies, [14 C] clozapine with suitable radiochemical purity was synthesized in nuclear research center of AEOI. Methods: In this report radiochemical and chemical purity of [14 C] clozapine were determined by liquid scintillation and reversed phase-HPLC respectively. Separation of [14 C] clozapine and its synthesized interface products was carried on C 8 optimal column and UV detector at 254 nm. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitril-buffered aqueous solution of sodium phosphate with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Results: Detection limit and analytical precision of RP-HPLC method were 0. 01 µg/ml and 1 - 3. 4 % respectively. The chemical purity of synthesized clozapine was > 99 %. For determination of activity and radiochemical purity, liquid scintillation spectrometer was used and counting was done by direct addition of samples to ACS (Amersham) solution. Specific activity of synthesized clozapine was 10 µCi/mg and radiochemical purity of > 99. % was achieved. Conclusion: By separation of [14 C] clozapine and its synthesized intermediate products the represented methods, in addition to determination of total yield of reaction, {{it was possible to}} determine every step of reaction therefore; it was not nessaseray to use classical methods such as: distillation, liquid-liquid extraction, etc. If the HPLC instrument is equipped with <b>radiochemical</b> detector, simultaneous <b>determination</b> of <b>radiochemical</b> as well as chemical yields of products are possible...|$|R
40|$|Suspensions {{of human}} and pig blood {{platelets}} have been studied by 31 P NMR at 145. 7 MHz and by chemical and <b>radiochemical</b> <b>determination</b> of nucleotide levels. In both types of platelets the cytoplasmic nucleotide pool, which was prelabeled by incubation with [14 C]adenine, was selectively reduced by addition of H 2 O 2 /NaN 3 or 2 -deoxyglucose/antimycin A. After the reduction of cytoplasmic ATP in human platelets, the 31 P NMR spectra showed an almost complete loss of the nucleoside di- and triphosphate resonances at temperatures examined (4 [...] 50 degrees C), indicating that only the cytoplasmic nucleotides had been observed, with no detectable contributions from the granular ATP, ADP, and pyrophosphate. Slow tumbling of the granular nucleotides, possibly due to aggregation, is the probable explanation of their undetectability at 145. 7 MHz. Similar experiments showed that in pig platelets, granular ATP and ADP were not detected by 31 P NMR at 4 degrees C but were observed at higher temperatures, indicating that aggregation may be occurring at the lower temperatures. Upon thrombin stimulation of human platelets, the NMR spectra and the chemical and radioactivity analyses showed that the granular adenylates and pyrophosphate were secreted, and that cytoplasmic ATP levels were appreciably reduced...|$|E
40|$|Migraine is a {{recurrent}} neurovascular disease. Its two most common forms-migraine without aura (MO) and migraine with aura (MA) -both show familial clustering and a complex pattern of inheritance. Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) {{is a rare}} monogenic subform caused by mutations in the calcium channel gene CACNA 1 A or the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase gene ATP 1 A 2. An involvement of FHM genes in the pathogenesis of common forms of migraine is not proven. We therefore systematically screened ATP 1 A 2 in families with several members affected by MA and/or MO. We identified two novel missense alterations [c. 520 G>A (p. E 174 K) and c. 1544 G>A (p. C 515 Y) ] in two out of 45 families, which were not found in 520 control chromosomes. Functional studies of these variants in Xenopus oocytes by two-electrode voltage clamp measurements and <b>radiochemical</b> <b>determination</b> of ATPase activity showed that C 515 Y leads to a complete loss of function comparable with the effect of FHM-mutations whereas for E 174 K no functional alteration {{could be found in}} the in vitro assays. In conclusion we propose that rare variants in ATP 1 A 2 are involved in the susceptibility to common forms of migraine, because of 1) the absence of alterations in controls, 2) the particular pattern of segregation in both families, 3) the high conservation of mutated residues in Na(+) /K(+) -ATPases, 4) the functional effect of C 515 Y, and 5) the involvement of ATP 1 A 2 in a monogenic form of migraine...|$|E

A B-cell origin was confirmed by the expression of CD 19 and HLA-DR. Four stages of B-cell leukemias were defined: stage I (pro-B) as CD 10 -, cytoplasmic mu- (c mu-), surface Ig- (sIg-); stage II (cALL) as CD 10 +/c mu-/sIg-; stage III (pre-B) as CD 10 + or -/c mu+/sIg-; and stage IV (B) as CD 10 -/c mu-/sIg+. A linear correlation was found between immunohistochemical and <b>radiochemical</b> <b>determination</b> of 5 'NT (r =. 86). 5 'NT {{expression was}} low in T-cell leukemias and stage I, high in stages II and III, and low again in stage IV of B-cell leukemias. 5 'NT expression {{was not related to}} c mu, CD 20, CD 21, CD 22, CD 34, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression, but was significantly related to CD 10 and inversely related to kappa/lambda expression.

Within the group of CD 10 + leukemias no differences were detected between 5 'NT+ and 5 'NT- cells in their expression of other B-cell antigens. We conclude that the place of 5 'NT in leukemias corresponding to early stages of B-cell development has been characterized. 5 'NT is expressed in CD 10 + stages and decreases before the expression of sIgs.

40|$|Summary. Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) {{spermatozoa}} {{were found}} to have a high but variable rate of aerobic fructolysis. Efforts to correlate the rate of aerobic fructolysis with spermatozoal motility {{led to the development of}} a <b>radiochemical</b> method for <b>determination</b> of lactate. Rates of aerobic fructolysis, regulated by titration with fluoride and iodoacetate, have been shown to be positively correlated with motility ratings. Spermatozoal motility was depressed but not abolished by titration with antimycin A, amytal, cyanide, and 2 -N-heptyl- 4 -hydroxy=req- quinoline N-oxide in the presence of fructose. Titration of washed spermatozoa with quinoline N-oxide in the absence of fructose showed respiratory rates to be positively correlated with motility. Incubation of washed spermatozoa under anaerobic conditions in the presence of fructose caused a slight but perceptible loss in motility. Motility was completely abolished by incubation of washed spermatozoa in the absence of fructose but was restored by aeration. Monkey spermatozoa were further shown to be characterized by a rate of endogenous respiration comparable to that reported for the sperma-tozoa of many domestic animals, including the ram and bull. Substrates which significantly stimulated respiration were pyruvate, succinate, =aketoglutarateand malate. A mechanism for the decarboxylation of pyruvate independent of respiration (pyruvate dismutation) was indicated by the fact that more than twice as much radio-activity was found in evolved 14 CO 2 when [1 - 14 C]pyruvate was used as substrate than was found when an equal amount of [3 - 14 C]pyruvate was used. 14 CO 2 formation from the latter compound was almost completely inhibited by 2 =. =m A; 14 CO 2 evolution from the former was inhibited less than 30...|$|R

Final dimensions were obtained by cold rolling. A special radiation capsule was designed which contained heat control and enough thermocouples to ensure a good continuoustemperature history throughout the test. This capsule and the method by which the specimens were loaded are discussed in some detail. Because of the capsule instrumentatton. the known MTR position into which the capsule was placed. and the dostmeters placed tn the capsule {{it was possible to}} obtain a complete flux and temperature history of the capsule during the irradiation.

40|$|Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36 {{amino acid}} peptide, is widely {{distributed}} in the central and peripheral nervous system, where it acts as a neurotransmitter and exhibits {{a large number of}} physiological functions, including the regulation of blood pressure, control of food intake, anxiety, pain and hormone secretion. In humans, these effects are mediated by four receptor subtypes (Y 1, Y 2, Y 4, Y 5), all belonging to class A of the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The Y 2 R is expressed, e. g., in sympathetic nerve endings, in the renal tubules and in distinct brain regions such as the hippocampus and the hypothalamus. It is discussed to be involved in several human diseases, for instance, epilepsy, obesity and cancer, and therefore regarded as an attractive target in drug design. However, antagonistic pharmacological tools for the elucidation of the receptor´s function in health and disease are still missing. In 1999, the (S) -argininamide BIIE 0246, a C-terminal mimic of NPY, was reported the first highly potent and selective Y 2 R antagonist. NG-Acylation of BIIE 0246 was demonstrated to retain or even increase the Y 2 R affinity, thereby improving the pharmacokinetic properties. Thus, we prepared Nω-aminoacylated analogs as precursors towards radio- and fluorescence labeled as well as bivalent pharmacological tools according to the guanidine-acylguanidine bioisosteric approach. Such derivatives, bearing a free amino group, exhibited the highest Y 2 R affinities (Ki < 10 nM). Interestingly, masking the positive charge, e. g. by acylation, resulted in decreased affinities, presumably, due to the loss of an additional electrostatic interaction of the primary amine with the receptor. Bivalent ligands were synthesized starting from various amine precursors derived from BIIE 0246 by acylation with different aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. Only minor differences in affinities (Ki = 61 - 300 nM) were observed {{for the majority of the}} compounds, irrespective of the diversity in length and chemical nature of the spacer. However, bivalent ligand 4. 6, constructed from an amine precursor bearing an additional amino group in the linker, showed a binding affinity (Ki = 21 nM) and antagonistic activity (KB = 15 nM) in the same range as the monovalent antagonists, corroborating the affinity-enhancing effect of a positive charge in the linker. Fluorescence ligands were synthesized from the amine precursors by acylation with succinimidyl esters or by ring transformation of pyrylium dyes. In terms of retaining affinity, the pyrylium dyes were superior to the bulky cyanine, hemicyanine and Bodipy dyes. Whereas the majority of the cyanine and hemicyanine labeled fluorescent ligands proved to be suitable for the detection of Y 2 Rs at the cell membrane by confocal microscopy, rapid cellular uptake was observed for most of the Py- 1 and Py- 5 coupled antagonists. Based on the results from binding studies and confocal microscopy, four fluorescent Y 2 R antagonists (5. 4, 5. 15 - 5. 17) were chosen for flow cytometric binding studies. These compounds turned out to be applicable as labeled standard ligands in saturation and competition binding experiments. Interestingly, kinetic studies revealed a pseudo-irreversible binding of 5. 16 at the Y 2 R. The endogenous ligand NPY was not able to displace the novel red-fluorescent Y 2 R antagonists 5. 4 and 5. 16 even at very high concentrations. Acylation of the amine precursor (S) - 3. 48 with succinimidyl [2, 3 - 3 H]-propionate afforded the easily accessible, highly potent and selective tritiated Y 2 R antagonist [3 H]-UR-PLN 196 (A 2 : 43 nM, Ca 2 + assay; KD: 43 nM, determined by kinetic studies), which was shown to be useful for the quantification of Y 2 R binding sites and for the <b>radiochemical</b> <b>determination</b> of Y 2 R binding affinities of small molecules. In addition, the novel radioligand was identified as an insurmountable antagonist against pNPY exhibiting pseudo-irreversible binding at the Y 2 R similar to the fluorescent labeled antagonist 5. 16. In conclusion, this work presents a straight-forward synthetic route towards labeled argininamide-type Y 2 R antagonists related to BIIE 0246 with improved physicochemical properties. These compounds are useful pharmacological tools for the detection of the Y 2 R in vitro and for detailed investigations of the antagonistic binding mode, respectively, as well as for the identification and characterization of small molecule Y 2 R antagonists. Moreover, these tracers are suitable to replace labeled NPY standard ligands in binding assays due to their beneficial properties in terms of Y 2 receptor subtype selectivity, antagonistic mode of action, stability and kinetics...|$|E
40|$|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} neuropeptides in the central and peripheral nervous system. This 36 -amino acid peptide is involved in the regulation of numerous physiological functions such as food intake, blood pressure, stress, nociception and hormone secretion. In humans, the action of NPY is mediated by four receptor subtypes (Y 1, Y 2, Y 4 and Y 5), members of the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The Y 1 receptor (Y 1 R) is expressed e. g. in vascular smooth muscle, adipose tissue, in the gastrointestinal tract and in distinct brain regions such as the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus. Recently, the Y 1 R gained new interest as it was reported to be expressed in malignancies (e. g. breast and prostate cancer, ovarian and adrenal tumors). The first highly potent and selective Y 1 R antagonist was the (R) -argininamide BIBP 3226, a C-terminal mimic of NPY. NG-Acylation of BIBP 3226 was demonstrated to retain or even increase the Y 1 R affinity, thereby improving the pharmacokinetic properties. Taking advantage of these phenomena led to selective radio- and fluorescence labeled argininamide-type Y 1 R antagonists described in this thesis. NG-substitution with [2, 3 - 3 H]-propanoic acid yielded the easily accessible, highly potent and selective tritiated Y 1 R antagonist [3 H]-UR-MK 114 (KB = 0. 8 nM, KD = 1. 2 nM), which was shown to be a useful pharmacological tool for the <b>radiochemical</b> <b>determination</b> of Y 1 R ligand affinities, the quantification of Y 1 R binding sites and for autoradiography. Another high affinity potential tritium ligand (Ki = 1. 3 nM), containing an aminocarbamoyl linker between the BIBP 3226 pharmacophore and tritiated propionic acid, was prepared and investigated pharmacologically. Aiming at molecular probes for in vivo imaging of Y 1 Rs, several potential Y 1 R antagonistic PET ligands were prepared and characterized. For this purpose, omega-aminocarboxylic acids of different length and chemical structure were attached to the guanidine of BIBP 3226, yielding amine precursors for coupling with small fluorinated carboxylic acids (2 -fluoropropanoic and 4 -fluorobenzoic acid). Two Y 1 R antagonists with Ki values in the low two-digit nM range were prepared as prototype 18 F-labeled PET ligands and administered intravenously to nude mice bearing Y 1 R expressing subcutaneous SK-N-MC xenografts. One of these PET ligands enabled the detection of the tumor during an early period (< 25 min) after administration, but late imaging of the tumor after systemic clearance of the tracer failed. The relatively high lipophilicity of the PET ligands (logP in the range of 1 � 4) led to rapid biliary excretion, requiring optimization of the physicochemical properties. Diverse BIBP 3226 derived amine precursors were also used for the preparation of a series of Y 1 R selective fluorescent ligands. In terms of retaining affinity, low molecular weight pyrylium dyes as well as a newly prepared benzothiazolium derivative proved to be superior to cyanine dyes such as S 0436. The majority of the most potent fluorescent Y 1 R antagonists (Ki = 10 - 50 nM) was successfully applied in confocal microscopy and flow cytometric equilibrium binding studies. As bivalent ligands are considered as potential tools to study the dimerization of GPCRs, a series of bivalent Y 1 R antagonists was prepared through the connection of two BIBP 3226 pharmacophoric entities by dicarboxylic acids of different chain length (8 � 36 atoms) and structure. To exploit the fact that the distomer of BIBP 3226, the (S) -enantiomer, is more than 1000 times less potent, sets of (R,R) -, (R,S) - and (S,S) -configured bivalent ligands were synthesized. The most potent bivalent ligand (Ki = 9 nM), consisting of a 20 atom spacer, revealed a moderately lower Y 1 R affinity for the (R,S) -stereoisomer compared to the (R,R) -enantiomer (factor of 5), which was not observed for other pairs of (R,R) - and (R,S) -configured bivalent ligands. Interestingly, among the (R,R) -configured ligands only minor differences in affinities (Ki values 9 - 63 nM), irrespective of spacer length and chemical diversity, were observed. A potential bivalent radioligand (Ki = 18 nM) is considered as a potential tool to perform investigations on the stoichiometry of binding sites in combination with monovalent radioligands. The achievements in the Y 1 R antagonists motivated the preparation of NG-Boc-Na-Fmoc-arginine bearing an appropriate NG�-acyl residue as a versatile building block for solid phase synthesis of modified peptides. The incorporation of such an arginine substitute into angiotensin II (AT) resulted in amino-functionalized and fluorescence-labeled AT derivatives with retained agonistic potency at the AT 1 receptor (EC 50 : 21 and 80 nM, AT: 17 nM). As these arginine derivatives could be universally applied to prepare ligands for any peptidergic receptor, the proof of concept described in this thesis could promote the development and broaden the spectrum of molecular imaging tools...|$|E
