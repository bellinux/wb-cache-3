40|$|Public {{lands are}} {{utilized}} by both <b>recreationists</b> and wildlife. The dual use mandate (Organic Act) requires {{the preservation of}} resources while maintaining recreational opportunities. Understanding <b>recreationists</b> helps us by identifying the habits, views, and economic contribution of outdoor <b>recreationists.</b> Policy makers then have an additional tool when making public land decisions that impact outdoor recreation. As part of a study examining interactions between <b>recreationists</b> and wildlife, we surveyed 311 <b>recreationists</b> at various trailheads in the Owyhee Recreational Area. In addition to gathering demographic information (average age: 34 - 49, average spent in 2013 : $ 4, 700), we asked about views on public land policies and use, and perceived recreational impacts on the ecosystem. The data show that although <b>recreationists</b> don’t agree with total trail closures, they do agree that trails should be seasonally closed to protect sensitive wildlife. When asked about factors that affect the integrity of public lands (wildfires, off-highway recreation, climate change, etc.) initial results show a moderate correlation (r=. 77498) between factors they had personally observed and their views on how those factors should be managed. This may indicate that <b>recreationists</b> {{are more inclined to}} accept land use policies if they are personally aware of how certain factors impact the ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of private}} lands for public {{recreation}} {{is a highly}} emotive issue in Ireland at present. Conflict over access rights, disturbance, liability and compensation {{has resulted in the}} closure of many sections of the countryside to those wishing to walk, climb, fish or swim. This research examines the attitudes of both the landowners and <b>recreationists</b> towards access to the countryside for walking access. An extensive literature review and a pilot study concluded that the key issue can be surmised into four topics: Disturbance, privacy, liability and compensation. A total of 162 on-site surveys were conducted (n = 85 Landowners, n = 77 <b>Recreationists).</b> The data was supplemented by eight in-depth interviews. Results show that there are many areas of agreement between both groups, access may be restricted (74 % Landowners, 88 % <b>Recreationists),</b> participants should accept the risks involved (99 % Landowners, 100 % <b>Recreationists),</b> <b>recreationists</b> should heed dangers (98 % Landowners, 100 % <b>Recreationists)</b> and that recreation has negative impacts on farmland and on landowners. Differences exist in the data with landowners more aware of the Occupiers’ Liability Act(1995), (P < 0. 001), landowners want compensation for access (P< 0. 001), and landowners should be compensated for work to facilitate access(P< 0. 5). <b>Recreationists</b> are more aware of environmental codes (P< 0. 001), they think that recreation is positive for their health(P< 0. 001) and that it is more positive for the local infrastructure. 55 % of <b>recreationists</b> are willing to pay a mean fee of € 2. 24 to guarantee access, while 69 % of landowners are willing to accept a mean fee of € 6. 27 to provide this access. Results show that a proportion of both groups are willing to cooperate and work together towards an accessible countryside to the benefit of both landowners and <b>recreationists.</b> Future collaboration must work towards an accepted level of access throughout the Irish countryside which eases the concerns of landowners and allows sufficient access for <b>recreationists...</b>|$|R

40|$|Perceived {{crowding}} is {{an important}} issue influencing recreationists' satisfaction with their nature-based leisure experiences. Past work, however, has consistently revealed that crowding accounts for a conspicuously low level of variation in satisfaction. Central to the concerns are intervening factors between perceived crowding and satisfaction, the mechanisms by which <b>recreationists</b> employ to cope with perceived crowding, and other drivers of the crowding- satisfaction relationship. Given this, I explored two questions related to <b>recreationists?</b> perceptions of crowding within the context of boating in central Texas. First, what are some additional crowding-related factors that contribute to <b>recreationists?</b> satisfaction with their experiences? My findings revealed that expectations of encounters with other boaters contributed a large portion to the variance in satisfaction. Second, how does <b>recreationists?</b> attachment to the resource influence their choice of coping strategy in response to perceived crowding? In an effort to answer this question, I investigated the moderating role of place attachment in <b>recreationists?</b> selection of coping mechanisms in response to perceived crowding.

40|$|The {{tension between}} 'acceptable' human {{use of the}} {{environment}} and the management systems that intend to mitigate this use continues to be an important focus for discussion and research. This is particularly evident in the situation of recreation in parks and protected areas. Enhancing public participation in {{the development and implementation of}} resource management objectives has received much attention, in literature and in practice, as a way to mediate this tension. However, how this participation will come about or is to be facilitated necessitates further investigation. This thesis further develops the notion of public participation with a focus on recreationists as a valuable source of assistance for achieving the conservation agenda. It also highlights that the assistance that recreationists could potentially offer remains predominately untapped. Two reasons for this include the restrictiveness inherent in current recreation and environment management approaches, and underlying assumptions that discount the value of public participation or cater to an active public, or <b>recreationist,</b> minority. Drawing on relevant social research, this thesis attempts to better understand the individual <b>recreationist</b> and derive from this an understanding of possible opportunities through which <b>recreationist</b> participation in conservation could be enhanced. Complementing this discussion is an identification of park managers as key recipients of this research, and a redefinition of their role from manager to one that emphasizes aspects of leadership. Two methods were employed to further investigate this research: an extensive review of relevant theory as well as the use of two case studies: Killarney Provincial Park (Ontario, Canada) and Fish Creek Provincial Park (Alberta, Canada). Within each case study, interviews were conducted in the months of June and July 2000 with park staff and other appropriate individuals. At the same time, recreationists from both parks were surveyed. Interviews and survey questions were guided by the primary question of, how can the role of recreationists in the conservation of parks and protected areas be enhanced? Eleven recommendations emerged from this research in regard to: opportunities for recreationists to participate in conservation, the role of social research, and the relationship between park manager and <b>recreationist.</b> This paper concludes by establishing an argument advocating <b>recreationist</b> participation in conservation, and offers ways in which this participation could be achieved...|$|E

Two exposure scenarios, <b>recreationist</b> and maintenance worker, were considered. A residential scenario was not considered because the material was assumed to be left intact (i. e., the concrete would not be rubbleized because the location would not be suitable for construction of a house). The <b>recreationist</b> was assumed to use the tunnel for 8 hours per day for 1 week as an overnight shelter. The maintenance worker was assumed to spend 20 hours per year working in the tunnel. Six exposure pathways were considered in calculating the dose. Three external exposure pathways involved penetrating radiation emitted directly from the contaminated tunnel floor, emitted from radioactive particulates deposited on the tunnel floor, and resulting from submersion in airborne radioactive particulates. Three internal exposure pathways involved inhalation of airborne radioactive particulates; inadvertent direct ingestion of removable, contaminated material on the tunnel floor; and inadvertent indirect ingestion of airborne particulates deposited on the tunnel floor. The gradual removal of surface contamination over time and the ingrowth of decay products were considered in calculating the dose at different times.

40|$|In Finland, {{privately owned}} nature areas {{are widely used}} for {{recreation}} due to open public access. However, since landowners are not obligated to take everyman’s rights into consideration when making management decisions, the recreational quality of nature areas is not guaranteed for users.

40|$|With {{the public}} {{acquisition}} of Valles Caldera National Preserve in 2000, Congress granted management to a Board of Trustees, a unique experiment in public land management. Ten {{years into the}} experiment, the trust model has been failing to meet certain management objectives and is under pressure by outdoor <b>recreationists</b> to provide greater public access to this treasured piece of land in New Mexico. Pressure has become {{so great that the}} United States Senators from New Mexico have introduced legislation, the Valles Caldera National Preserve Management Act, which would transfer management to the National Park Service. To address this blossoming issue, and to really understand what is happening on this highly treasured land, this research sets out explore the many attitudes and perceptions of the Valles Caldera’s <b>recreationists.</b> To gather the necessary data set, a survey questionnaire was developed and administered to <b>recreationists</b> of the Valles Caldera through a number of online mediums, posted flyers, and various on-site methods. At the time the surveys were closed to the public, 712 (36 %) <b>recreationists</b> had responded to the survey. A detailed statistical analysis of the acquired data was then performed using Vaske’s (2008) Potential for Conflict Index, the chi-square test, and other descriptive methods in order to help bridge the gap between these recreational perceptions and attitudes, and future management decisions on the Valles Caldera. The intent and purpose of this research is to provide future managers of the Valles Caldera, whoever that might be, with valuable information that can lead to management actions that appropriately reflect the needs of those using the Caldera for recreation. Further, this research offers the opportunity for the public to have their voice heard where it may not have existed otherwise. This research has identified recreationists’ attitudes and perceptions towards public access, religious and cultural sites, environmental preference, crowding, livestock grazing. Preference for recreational activities and the amount of money <b>recreationists</b> are willing to spend to recreate are also discussed. More specifically, this thesis has revealed that all surveyed <b>recreationists</b> are dissatisfied with their current level of access to the Valles Caldera, {{and that there is a}} major split in respondent’s preferences towards the protection of cultural and religious sites when it could limit access for <b>recreationists.</b> Results also identified that some groups favor or understand environmental values more than other groups, and that a majority of <b>recreationists</b> favor quality of experience over quantity.

40|$|Abstract: Natural area recreationists enjoy a {{bittersweet}} relationship with resource management and environmental conservation initiatives. Although parks and protected areas exist, in part, for {{the enjoyment of}} the public, recreational activities {{have the potential to}} cause numerous negative impacts on the environment. Park managers have responded {{in a variety of ways}} such as through legislation enforcement, recreation management techniques, education, or by encouraging the public to participate in conservation programs. However, one aspect of public participation that has not received much attention is participation that explicitly recognizes the recreationist’s pursuit of their leisure activities in order to provide an appealing alternative for recreationists to participate in conservation efforts. Such recreation-sensitive conservation will require a shift in how the <b>recreationist</b> and their activities are viewed by both managers and recreationists. This paper will provide the conceptual background and rationale for continuing social research investigating how parks and protected area managers can enhance the role of the <b>recreationist</b> in conservation. 1...|$|E

Regarding air temperature and bio-meteorological assessments of thermal comfort, the most favorable seasons {{of the year for}} recreational activities for most <b>recreationists</b> are spring (March, April, and May) and autumn (September, October, and November). The main goal of this research is to determine the differences in the characteristics of <b>recreationists</b> in the park regarding different recreational activities performed under different meteorological conditions. The following characteristics of <b>recreationists</b> have been taken into account: socio-demographic characteristics; characteristics of recreational mobilities; motivation of recreationists; recreational activities performed in the park; expenditures of recreationists; and level of satisfa-ction with the existing recreation and hospitality infrastructure of the park. The differences between <b>recreationists</b> in Maksimir were determined by comparing: a) sunny days in all four seasons of the year; b) rainy days in spring and autumn; and c) sunny and rainy days in spring and autumn. Data were collected through face-to-face surveying of <b>recreationists</b> in the park in multiple locations, using the convenience sampling method. The population in the research consisted of adult residents of the City of Zagreb and its surroundings (settlements of Zagreb County), who were involved in recreational activities in the park.

Because amateur <b>recreationists</b> generally spent considerably less time in avalanche terrain, they are normally not able to achieve a similar level of expertise. As a consequence, professional methods are too complicated and the recommendations too vague for assisting amateur <b>recreationists</b> in recognizing and responding to dangerous avalanche conditions. To address the need for practical decision aids for amateur <b>recreationists,</b> a number of rule-based decision frameworks were introduced in Europe during the last decade (e. g., Reduction Method, SnowCard, Stop-or-Go, Nivotest; McCammon and Hägeli, 2005). The tragic winter of 2002 / 03, where Canada experienced an exceptional high number of recreational avalanche fatalities, prompted the Canadian avalanche community to plan a project for the design of a practical, science-based decision frameworks tailored to the specific avalanche conditions and dominant backcountry recreational user groups in Western Canada. The resulting ADFAR project (Avalanche Decision-Making Framework for Amateur <b>Recreationists)</b> is administered by the Canadian Avalanche Association (CAA) and is sponsored by Parks Canada with a grant from th...|$|R

40|$|Many outdoor {{recreation}} settings present stressful situations that directly influence {{the quality of}} one's leisure experience. Some <b>recreationists</b> are able to maintain their enjoyment by adopting various coping strategies. In conditions that induce stress, <b>recreationists</b> can select {{from a combination of}} behavioral coping strategies (e. g., substitution of recreational setting or activity) and/or cognitive coping strategies (e. g., rationalization). Previous coping research has indicated that the key to understanding the stress [...] coping process is how one appraises the stressors. In spite of the acknowledged importance of individual appraisals, however, there is scant empirical evidence available documenting this mediating effect. To explore the role of appraisal in the stress - coping relationship, I drew upon Lazarus and Folkman's transactional theory of stress and coping. Using data collected from <b>recreationists</b> boating in Texas and Korea, I tested a model where the relationship between stress and coping was hypothesized to be mediated by individual's appraisals within the context of water-based recreational activities. Data were collected from <b>recreationists</b> residing near Lake Granbury in Texas (n= 186) and <b>recreationists</b> at Lake Chung-pyung in South Korea (n= 462). Initial testing of the model illustrated poor fit. I then tested the model independently for the two groups. For Korean respondents, results showed that one's evaluative process (appraisal) mediated the relationship between stress level and selected coping strategies. Further, the degree of involvement with a recreational activity, attachment to a setting, and self-construal moderated the stress [...] appraisal [...] coping relationship. Model testing for American respondents showed that the factor structure deviated from what was originally hypothesized. Subsequent testing produced an alternate factor structure; direct action, disengagement, temporal substitution, and cognitive coping. However, there was no mediating role of appraisal in the relationship between stress and coping for this group. Moreover, there was no moderating effect of place attachment, leisure activity involvement, and self-construal for American respondents. In short, {{the results of this study}} partially supported the transactional theory of stress and coping. For both groups, positive appraisal was more strongly related to behavioral coping, while cognitive coping (rationalization) was influenced by respondents' negative appraisal of the boating conditions. Even under potentially stressful conditions, some <b>recreationists</b> consider the situation controllable. Future investigations should also consider exploring and comparing the coping processes of different user groups, across age cohorts, and among <b>recreationists</b> within similar contexts...|$|R
