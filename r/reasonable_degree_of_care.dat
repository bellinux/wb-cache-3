The result test database analysis can be conclude that very helpful to increase safety and quality butt joint. With steel specification C= 0, 15 %, Si= 0, 24 %, Mn= 0, 88 %,P= 0, 018 %, S= 0, 034 %. This material give a 90, 110, 125 ampere with SMAW AC electrode diameter 3, 2 mm x 350 mm with V root and 600 angle In the fabrication of mild steel products, components or equipment, manufacturers employ welding as the principal joining method. Mild steel are weldable materials, and a welded joint can provide optimum corrosion resistance, strength, and fabrication economy. However, designers should recognize that any metal, including stainless steels, may undergo certain changes during welding. It is necessary, therefore, to exercise a <b>reasonable</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> during welding to minimize or prevent any deleterious effects that may occur, and to preserve the same degree of corrosion resistance and strength in weld zone that is an intheren part of the base meta...|$|E

These existing simulators {{are not intended}} for simulating large distributed applications with many hosts and many concurrent connections {{over long periods of}} simulated time. We introduce a new simulator, Narses, targeted towards large distributed applications. The goal of Narses is to simulate and validate large applications efficiently using network models of varying levels of detail. We introduce several simplifying assumptions that allow our simulator to scale to the needs of large distributed applications while maintaining a <b>reasonable</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> accuracy. Initial results show up to a 45 times speedup while consuming 28 % of the memory used by ns. Narses maintains a <b>reasonable</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> accuracy [...] within 8 % on average.
