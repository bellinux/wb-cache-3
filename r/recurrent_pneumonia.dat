50|$|Individuals {{who smoke}} or {{are exposed to}} smog or other {{airborne}} pollutants can develop a condition known as COPD. In this disorder, there is constant irritation of the breathing tubes (trachea) and the small airways. The constant irritation results in excess production of mucus which makes breathing difficult. Frequently, these individuals {{wake up in the}} morning with copious amounts of foul smelling mucus and a cough which lasts all day. Wheeze and heavy phlegm are common findings. COPD is a lifelong disorder and there is no cure. Eventually most people develop <b>recurrent</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> lack any type of endurance, and are unable to work productively. One of the ways to avoid chronic bronchitis is to stop or not smoke.|$|E

5000|$|CHS is {{associated}} with respiratory arrests during sleep and, in some cases, to neuroblastoma (tumors of the sympathetic ganglia), Hirschsprung disease (partial agenesis of the enteric nervous system), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and anomalies of the pupilla. Other symptoms include darkening of skin color from inadequate amounts of oxygen, drowsiness, fatigue, headaches, and an inability to sleep at night. Those suffering from Ondine's curse also have a sensitivity to sedatives and narcotics, which makes respiration even more difficult. A low concentration of oxygen in the red blood cells also may cause hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension, culminating in cor pulmonale or {{a failure of the}} right side of the heart. [...] Associated complications may also include gastro-esophageal reflux, ophthalmologic issues, seizures, <b>recurrent</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> developmental delays, learning disabilities and episodes of fainting and temperature disregulation.|$|E

5000|$|In medicine, {{describing}} a disease as acute denotes {{that it is}} of short [...] and, as a corollary of that, of recent [...] The quantitation of how much time constitutes [...] "short" [...] and [...] "recent" [...] varies by disease and by context, but the core denotation of [...] "acute" [...] is always qualitatively in contrast with [...] "chronic", which denotes long-lasting disease (for example, in acute leukemia and chronic leukemia). In addition, [...] "acute" [...] also often connotes two other meanings: [...] onset and , such as in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where suddenness and severity are both established aspects of the meaning. It thus often connotes that the condition is fulminant (as in the AMI example), but not always (as in acute rhinitis, which is usually synonymous with the common cold). The one thing that acute MI and acute rhinitis {{have in common is that}} they are not chronic. They can happen again (as in <b>recurrent</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> that is, multiple acute pneumonia episodes), but they are not the same [...] ongoing for months or years (unlike chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is).|$|E
50|$|Bloom {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} genome instability. The most prominent features include short stature and a rash on the face that develops early in life when exposed to the sun. The skin rash is erythematous, telangiectatic, infiltrated, and scaly, it can appear across the nose, on the cheeks and around the lips. As well as these areas the rash will develop on any other sun-exposed areas including, {{the backs of the}} hands and neck. Other clinical features include a high-pitched voice; distinct facial features, including a long, narrow face, micrognathism, and prominent nose and ears; pigmentation changes of the skin including hypo-pigmented and hyper-pigmented areas, cafe-au-lait spots, and telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels), which can appear on the skin and eyes. Moderate immune deficiency, characterized by deficiency in certain immunoglobulin classes has also been related to BS, leading to <b>recurrent</b> <b>pneumonia</b> and ear infections. Most individuals with Bloom syndrome are born with a low birth weight. Hypogonadism is characterized by a failure to produce sperm, hence infertility in males, and premature cessation of menses (premature menopause), hence sub-fertility in females. However, several women with Bloom syndrome have had children. The most serious and common complication of Bloom {{syndrome is}} cancer. Other complications of the disorder include chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes, and learning disabilities. There is no evidence that mental retardation is more common in Bloom syndrome than in other people. People with Bloom Syndrome have a shortened life expectancy; the average life span is approximately 27 years. Bloom syndrome shares some features with Fanconi anemia possibly because there is overlap in the function of the proteins mutated in this related disorder.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the bronchoscopy results of children with undiagnosed recurrent cough and pneumonia presumed {{to be due to}} foreign body aspiration according to the literature. Material and Method: Thirty-seven children followed by the Yuzuncu Yil University Medical Faculty with chronic cough and <b>recurrent</b> <b>pneumonia</b> not responding to medical treatment, were included in this study between 2004 - 2008. Bronchoscopy was carried out with a rigid/flexible bronchoscope under general anesthesia in the operating room. Intergroup differences were compared with Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed Chi-square test was used for group frequency and Fisher's Exact test for group items less than five. A P value of 0. 05 was considered to indicate statistical significanceResults: Cases consisted of 21 males (56, 8 %) and 16 (43, 2 %) females. Eighteen cases with chronic cough and nineteen cases with <b>recurrent</b> <b>pneumonia</b> were followed up. A foreign body was determined in twelve (32, 4 %) cases with rigid bronchoscopy. Foreign body diagnosis was detected significantly more frequently in <b>recurrent</b> <b>pneumonia</b> cases than in chronic cough cases (p< 0, 0012).
