5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room.

Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal.

The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the {{breakdown}} ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing their feet and cleaning it with her hair.

The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but he places his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls {{on the ground with}} a silent, anguished cry. The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's stoned to death by the crowd.|$|E

40|$|The {{preferred}} green-grass and <b>red</b> (apple, <b>lipstick,</b> sports car) colors {{shown on}} the display are investigated using complex images. Ten test images {{were used in the}} experiment and each image was transformed using a memory color transformation algorithm to have nine different green-grass or red colors. The pair comparison method was used to determine the most-preferred green-grass and red colors. The green-grass colors are preferred as the average hue angle approaches 128 ° (60 % green and 40 % yellow) in CIECAMO 2 hue angle with high chroma. For red colors, apple images show high preference when the reproduced red is closer to the unique red. The artificial objects, such as <b>red</b> <b>lipsticks</b> and sports cars are preferred when reproduced with the highest chroma regardless of their hues. open...|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the reason}} behind the group {{decision}} to continue with its bright and innocent concept instead of following the trend of sexy concept was because of their fans. Duting the interview, Apink said, “The first teaser we released was the album cover photo. We’re wearing <b>red</b> <b>lipsticks</b> in the photo so many fans were worried that we might change our concept from before.”.

40|$|Dispersive Raman spectra {{have been}} {{obtained}} using a Raman microscope and an excitation wavelength of 632. 8 nm from 69 lipsticks of various colours and {{from a range of}} manufacturers without any pre-treatment of the samples. 10 % of the samples were too fluorescent to give Raman spectra. 22 % of the samples gave spectra which were unique to the brand and colour within the collected sample set. The remaining 68 % of the samples gave spectra which could be classified into seven distinct groups. Discrimination of <b>red</b> <b>lipsticks</b> by this technique was the most difficult. The spectra of deposited lipstick samples remained unchanged over a period of a least a year...|$|R

50|$|Ancient Sumerian men {{and women}} were {{possibly}} the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.

Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient Indus Valley Civilization applied <b>red</b> tinted <b>lipstick</b> to their lips for face decoration. Ancient Egyptians wore lipstick to show social status rather than gender.
