5000|$|The Ogston model however {{breaks down}} for large {{molecules}} whereby the pores are significantly smaller than {{size of the}} molecule. For DNA molecules of size greater than 1 kb, a <b>reptation</b> model (or its variants) is most commonly used. This model assumes that the DNA can crawl in a [...] "snake-like" [...] fashion (hence [...] "reptation") through the pores as an elongated molecule. At higher electric field strength, this turned into a biased <b>reptation</b> model, whereby the leading end of the molecule become strongly biased in the forward direction, and this leading edge pulls {{the rest of the}} molecule along. In the fully biased mode, the mobility reached a saturation point and DNA beyond a certain size cannot be separated. [...] Perfect parallel alignment of the chain with the field however is not observed in practice as that would mean the same mobility for long and short molecules.

5000|$|The biased <b>reptation</b> {{model has}} also been used to explain the {{mobility}} of DNA in PFGE. The orientation of the DNA is progressively built up by <b>reptation</b> after the onset of a field, and the time it reached the steady state velocity {{is dependent on the}} size of the molecule. When the field is changed, larger molecules take longer to reorientate, it is therefore possible to discriminate between the long chains that cannot reach its steady state velocity from the short ones that travel most of the time in steady velocity.

50|$|In a polymer melt, the Rouse model {{correctly}} predicts long-time diffusion {{only for}} chains {{shorter than the}} entanglement length. For long chains with noticeable entanglement, the Rouse model holds only up to a crossover time τe. For longer times the chain can only move within a tube formed by the surrounding chains.

5000|$|Soft {{matter is}} a {{subfield}} of condensed matter comprising {{a variety of}} physical systems that are deformed or structurally altered by thermal or mechanical stress {{of the magnitude of}} thermal fluctuations. They include liquids, colloids, polymers, foams, gels, granular materials, liquid crystals, and a number of biological materials. These materials share an important common feature in that predominant physical behaviors occur at an energy scale comparable with room temperature thermal energy. At these temperatures, quantum aspects are generally unimportant.Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, who has been called the [...] "founding father of soft matter," [...] received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1991 for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to the more complex cases found in soft matter, in particular, to the behaviors of liquid crystals and polymers. [...] He is especially noted for inventing the concept of <b>reptation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The thermal {{characteristics}} of polymers are {{fundamentally different from}} those of most solid materials. Solid materials typically have one melting point, the Tm, above which the material loses internal molecular ordering and becomes a liquid. Polymers have both a melting temperature Tm and a glass transition temperature Tg. Above the Tm, the polymer chains lose their molecular ordering and exhibit <b>reptation,</b> or mobility. Below the Tm, but still above the Tg, the polymer chains lose some of their long-range mobility and can form either crystalline or amorphous regions. In this temperature range, as the temperature decreases, amorphous regions can transition into crystalline regions, causing the bulk material to become more crystalline over all. Below the Tg, molecular motion is stopped and the polymer chains are essentially frozen in place. In this temperature range, amorphous regions can no longer transition into crystalline regions, and the polymer as a whole has reached its maximum crystallinity.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to this, peptide amphiphiles {{can be used}} to form more sophisticated architectures which can be tuned on demand. In recent years, two discoveries have yielded bioactive materials with more advanced structures and potential applications. In one study, a thermal treatment of peptide amphiphile solutions {{led to the formation of}} large birefringent domains in the material that could be aligned by a weak shear force into one continuous monodomain gel of aligned nanofibers. The low shear forces used in aligning the material permit the encapsulation of living cells inside these aligned gels and suggest several applications in regenerating tissues that rely on cell polarity and alignment for function. In another study, the combination of positively charged peptide amphiphiles and negatively charged long biopolymers led to the formation of hierarchically ordered membranes. When the two solutions are brought into contact, electrostatic complexation between the components of each solution creates a diffusion barrier that prevents the mixing of the solutions. Over time, an osmotic pressure difference drives the <b>reptation</b> of polymer chains through the diffusion barrier into the peptide amphiphile compartment, leading to the formation of fibers perpendicular to the interface that grow over time. These materials can be made in the form of flat membranes or as spherical sacs by dropping one solution into the other. These materials are robust enough to handle mechanically and a range of mechanical properties can be accessed by altering growth conditions and time. They can incorporate bioactive peptide amphiphiles, encapsulate cells and biomolecules, and are biocompatible and biodegradable.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{diffusive}} motion of a (non-selfinteracting) chain through a quenched random environment, constructed {{such that it}} influences only the local dynamics but not the equilibrium configuration of the chain. Our Monte Carlo results show {{that this type of}} disorder, which we call kinematic, does not ruin <b>reptation.</b> This is in sharp contrast to disorder including also entropic traps and it supports the view that <b>reptation</b> prevails in melts, where in contrast to a gel entropic trapping is absent. Our data show the characteristic features of <b>reptation,</b> irrespective of the dilution or randomness of the kinematic obstacles. Our Monte Carlo results are in quantitative agreement with our recent detailed analytical evaluation of the <b>reptation</b> model (J. Stat. Phys. 90, 1325 (1998)).

This is done here in the framework of two models in which either the polymer is fixed at stress points or it may slip through these points. The results can be summarized in the same way: the stress relaxation function is proportional to the density of polymer segments limited by stress points.

40|$|<b>Reptation</b> {{theory is}} a highly {{successful}} approach for describing polymer dynamics in entangled systems. In turn, this molecular process {{is the basis of}} viscoelasticity. We apply a modified version of <b>reptation</b> dynamics to develop an actual physical model of ion channel gating. We show that at times longer than microseconds these dynamics predict an alpha-helix-screw motion for the amphipathic protein segment that partially lines the channel pore. Such motion has been implicated in several molecular mechanics studies of both voltage-gated and transmitter-gated channels. The experimental probability density function (pdf) for this process follows t- 3 / 2 which has been observed in several experimental systems. <b>Reptation</b> theory predicts that channel gating will occur on the millisecond time scale and this is consistent with experimental results from single-channel recording. We examine the consequences of <b>reptation</b> over random barriers and we show that, to first order, the pdf remains unchanged. In the case of a charged helix undergoing <b>reptation</b> {{in the presence of a}} transmembrane potential we show that the tail of the pdf will be exponential.
