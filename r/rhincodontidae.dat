50|$|The {{whale shark}} (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving filter-feeding carpet shark {{and the largest}} known extant fish species. The largest {{confirmed}} individual had a length of 12.65 m and a weight of about 21.5 t. Unconfirmed claims of considerably larger individuals, over 14 m long and weighing at least 30 t, are not uncommon. The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom, most notably being {{by far the largest}} living nonmammalian vertebrate. It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family <b>Rhincodontidae</b> (called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984), which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The species originated about 60 million years ago.|$|E

(Copepoda: Pandaridae), {{collected}} from whale sharks, Rhincodon typus (Smith, 1828) (Orectolobiformes: <b>Rhincodontidae),</b> swimming off the North West Cape of Western Australia, is described. Pandarus rhincodonicus {{is closely related}} to Pandarus cranchii Leach, 1819. However, P. rhincodonicus differs from P. cranchii in: the armature of the posterior margin of the cephalon; the plates of segment 2 extend almost to the limit of segment 4; the shape of the caudal rami and shape of the dorsal abdominal plate; and the distribution and numbers of spines and setae on thoracic appendages. It is suggested that P. rhincodonicus is a commensal...|$|E
40|$|The Cocos (Keeling) Islands {{comprise}} the most isolated oceanic atoll {{in the tropical}} Indian Ocean and are situated 1000 km south-west of Indonesia. The remoteness of the islands has shaped the composition of marine communities but also limited scientific research. This study summarises field research on the marine fishes of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands over the last 14 years (2001 - 2014). Sixty-seven new records (from 28 families) are described and raise {{the total number of}} known fishes to 602 species from 84 families. New records span a variety of body sizes (3 cm TL Gobiodon unicolor to 500 cm TL Rhincodon typus), were observed in all major habitats, and found at both the Southern Atoll and at North Keeling Island. Notable new records include first records for the families Alopiidae, Coryphaenidae, Eleotridae, Gempylidae, Istiophoridae, Molidae, Polymixiidae, <b>Rhincodontidae,</b> Sillaginidae and Xiphiidae. Sampling from pelagic and deepwater (60 - 300 m) reef environments significantly increased the number of species described from these habitats. New records include species that have dispersed more than 2500 km (Centropyge acanthops) and dispersal ability appears to explain the lack of syngnathids and the high representation of acanthurids and holocentrids in the community. Some of the Indian Ocean species that have colonised the Cocos (Keeling) Islands now co-occur with their Pacific Ocean sister species, increasing the potential for hybridisation. Although the fish community of the Cocos (Keeling) Island resembles that of the Indo-West Pacific, the isolation and co-occurrence of Indian and Pacific Ocean species distinguishes it from all other locations...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Suspension feeding in the {{cartilaginous}} fishes evolved approximately 66 - 22 {{million years ago}} and is manifest in four independently evolved lineages of fishes (Cetorhinidae, Megachasmidae, <b>Rhincodontidae,</b> and Mobulidae). The mechanisms of filtration used by fishes are reflective of the morphology and composition of the filtering tissues. I found the filter morphology and the mechanisms of filtration in the 11 species of devil rays are different from all other filtering fishes. I used a combination of gross anatomical descriptions, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), histology, modeling, and live performance data to describe the anatomy and filtration mechanisms in the devil rays. The filter pads are offset, chevron-shaped, rigid, cartilaginous structures composed of repeating filter lobes located on the anterior (toward the incoming flow) and posterior (toward the esophagus) surfaces of the epibranchial and ceratobranchial arches. SEM and histology show that the ultrastructure of the leaf-like, ascending filter lobes varies between species; however, most are keratinous and can be either smooth or covered in cilia and some include the presence of denticles. The shape and surface of the terminal filtering lobes are distinct in each species and {{may be used as}} a tool for species identification. In some species, the stratified squamous epithelium contains a high density of mucus cells, likely serving as a mechanism for sticky sieve filtration while in others the mucus producing cells are absent. Fluid flow in the devil rays is unusual; it does not follow a continuous, parallel trajectory through the buccopharyngeal cavity as in other suspension feeding fishes. Instead there is an abrupt 90 ° turn from the initial inflowing path to move through the laterally directed branchial filter pores, over the gill tissue, and out the ventrally located gill slits. The deviation from the incoming flow results in tangential shearing stress (cross-flow) across the filter surface. This implies that devil rays can use cross-flow filtration to clear the filter after particles are caught by inertial impaction, direct interception, and/or sieving mechanisms...|$|E
