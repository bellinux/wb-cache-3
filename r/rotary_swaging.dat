Whilst conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> is still carried under the intense use of lubricants to provide desired work piece quality and to avoid forming die wear, recent scientific work focuses {{on the design of}} a dry process layout. Novel functionalized <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> dies were introduced, exhibiting both diamond like carbon (DLC) hard coated and structured surfaces to encounter complex and opposing tribological requirements when dry machining. Such dies were successfully applied to infeed <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> experiments machining steel 1. 0038 and aluminum 3. 3206 tubes. Although primary targets were achieved, the dry <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> process is subject to an increased abrasive particle generation from the work piece material and accumulation of such particles in the forming zone. Abrasive particles provoke a loss of work piece quality and ultimately lead to a clogging of the swaging unit, associated with a significant earlier termination of the forming process. This work presents the investigation of the particle generation when dry <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> with functionalized forming dies in dependence on the work piece material and the process parameter feed velocity.

40|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> is an {{incremental}} cold forming {{process for the}} manufacture of cylindrical light weight components such as axles and steering spindles and has a wide spread use in the automotive industry. The advantage of <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> is the optimal use of work piece material resources. This is due to material strengthening through strain hardening {{and the ability to}} manufacture hollow parts with variable wall thicknesses. However, main drawback is the need for an extensive lubrication to control tool wear, to discharge abrasive particles from the forming zone, and to provide adequate work piece surface quality. The subsequent, inevitable cleaning of the work pieces after manufacture leads to a significant increase of costs per unit. Thus, the development of <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> towards a dry process layout is highly innovative both under economic and ecological aspects. The omission of lubricant provokes fundamentally changed tribological conditions in tool-work piece contact, leading to changes in process forces, increased abrasive and adhesive tool wear and reduced work piece quality. A robust, lubricant free <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging,</b> offering the same product quality as a conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> process with the use of lubricant, therefore implies the control of the modified tribological properties by methodologies substituting the tasks of the lubricant.

At the sizing zone, the metal flows axially with small velocity. When a mandrel is used, the axial flow velocity at the sizing zone gets larger. For the recess method, the main deformation area is the forging zone. The metal mainly flows radially at the forging zone with large velocity. Experiments have been carried out.

The <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> of AE 42 resulted in a decrease of polarization resistance. The increase of polarization resistance in the alloys with the higher concentration of alloying elements was caused by the combined effect of grain refinement and better dispersion of particles in the matrix thanks to shear deformation during equal channel angular pressing.

To analyze the changes of the nose thickness and length at the respective reduction of inside diameter, the finite element simulations were carried out. As a result, the desired target dimension is satisfied with the diameter reduction of more than 64 % for the given preform. The thickness of nose area increased up to 56. 1 % from initial thickness of 2. 62 mm to 4. 09 mm after swaging.

The <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging</b> {{process for}} {{producing}} solid bars, tubes or wires {{is often used}} to obtain the chipless forming process compared with the conventional process such as the machining and welding operation. Furthermore, machined chip, dust particles, harmful gas, and surface contamination to be commonly generated at hot working during the conventional process could be eliminated as the swaging process is applied and conducted at room temperature. Experiments for swaged product were performed to analyze the influence of the swaging process on the mechanical properties and dimensional precision in terms of surface roughness, surface hardness, and deviation of formed dimension. The changes of dimensional precision in swaged product are also checked out and considered for various process parameters such as the forming speed and the reduction in the outer diameter. Based on the experimental results, the surface roughness is improved under the swaging process. The weight of rod shift is reduced by about 15 % from 223. 5 g to 190. 2 g.

The effect of refining grain size on fatigue crack growth is {{to increase the number of}} microstructural barriers to the advancing crack and to reduce the slip length ahead of the crack tip, and thereby lower the crack growth rate. It was found that postdeformation annealing above recrystallization temperature could additionally enhance the work-hardening capability and the ductility of the swaged material, which led to a marked reduction in the fatigue notch sensitivity.

40|$|The {{abrasive}} flow machining (AFM) {{is a new}} {{finishing operation}} that involves abrasive particles as the tool to remove work material. AFM is broadly known as “no-tool” precision finishing operation and the carrier media containing abrasive particles is called as “self-deformable stone”. In AFM, a semi-solid polymer-based media containing abrasive powders in a particular proportion is flown through the work-piece at a certain pressure. The AFM consists of three major components, i. e. machine, media and tooling or fixture. The machine consists of a frame structure, control system, hydraulic cylinder and the media cylinder. The extrusion pressure for a standard AFM process varies from 10 bars to 100 - 200 bars. The function of tooling and fixture is to position the work-piece and provide direction to the media flow through the work-piece. The media consists of a carrier, abrasive powder and some additives. The flow of the media can be modeled using finite volume method as it deals with flow of a fluid.

40|$|Ultrafine-grained metals {{produced}} by severe plastic deformation processes are distinguished with many outstanding mechanical properties {{such as a}} combination of high strength and ductility or improved fatigue behavior and thus {{can be used to}} meet the high strength requirements of the metal forming industry. Although several severe plastic deformation processes have been developed over the last three decades, the industrial utilization of such materials is still in an early stage. Production of bulk UFG materials is still expensive. Therefore, the few applications are limited to the sports goods, biomedical parts or sputtering targets where the price of the parts mostly doesn’t {{play a major role in}} the buying decision. To overcome the efficiency problems of current SPD methods, a new process, called “Equal Channel Angular Swaging” has been proposed which is based upon the combination of the conventional ECAP and the incremental bulk metal forming method of infeed <b>rotary</b> <b>swaging.</b> In the current study, firstly, mechanics of the process is investigated by using slip line field approach. It is determined that unlike conventional ECAP, due to the kinematics of the process, the friction forces help the deformation by drawing the samples into the forming operation. Accordingly, the loads in the feeding direction are relatively low. Therefore, ECAS has a great potential as a continuous and so economical SPD process. Secondly, in order to validate the slip line solution, a tool system has been developed. By the development, a thermo-mechanical coupled finite element simulation approach is utilized to investigate the effect of the geometrical parameters on material flow and temperature formation as well as process loads. It is determined that both, channel length and outer corner radius has a significant effect on the process. Accordingly, a middle channel length of 15 mm and an outer corner radius of 5 mm have been selected for the tool system of the model experiments. First experiments with the developed tool system prove the feasibility of ECAS process. The deformation of round bars from two different materials, commercially pure copper and low carbon steel was possible. Moreover, the deformation on the samples follows predominantly a simple shear pattern. Developed thermo-mechanical coupled finite element models are capable of representing the deformation as well as the process loads required to form the materials. However, due to the highly idealized assumptions by the slip line field approach, defined analytical formulas overestimate the real process forces. Nonetheless, the analytical theory is capable of representing the load correlations. The materials deformed by ECAS process are distinguished by an increased tensile strength compared to their as-received state. Moreover, microstructural investigations reveal that an average grain size under 1 µm can be achieved even after a single pass with the developed SPD process. Although model experiments prove the feasibility of ECAS and the process loads, especially in the feeding direction are low which demonstrate the potential for a continuous and economical processing, the investigated feed rate of 1 mm/s isn’t appropriate for a wide commercial implementation. Therefore, in the last step of investigations, the effect of the most important process parameters of friction, temperature, feeding speed and feeding type is investigated by means of finite element simulations. These simulations reveal that a discontinuous feeding is inevitable for the speed-up of ECAS process. Moreover, an active cooling is definitely necessary to keep the temperatures at acceptable levels and to ensure an efficient grain refinement...|$|E
