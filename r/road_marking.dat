5|$|When the New England <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> {{system was}} adopted in 1922, Route 2 was {{assigned}} to a route from New Haven north via Hartford and Springfield towards Sherbrooke, Quebec. This route followed the older blue-banded route from New Haven north to Hartford. At Hartford, Route 2 crossed the Connecticut River on the Bulkeley Bridge and ran north from East Hartford to Springfield {{on the east side}} of the river.|$|E
5|$|US 5 roughly {{follows the}} route {{used by the}} Upper Boston Post Road, an early colonial highway for {{transporting}} mail between New York City and Boston. The route was first improved in 1798 as the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike, which ran in a nearly straight line between the court houses of New Haven and Hartford. In 1922, the Upper Boston Post Road corridor was designated as Route 2 of the New England <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> system, crossing {{to the east of}} the Connecticut River in Hartford before continuing north to the Massachusetts state line. In 1926, Route 2 was redesignated as U.S. Route 5. Several realignments {{have been made in the}} cities of New Haven and Hartford with the opening of several expressways in these areas. Because it is closely paralleled by Interstate 91 between New Haven and Hartford, US 5 serves mainly as a secondary route today.|$|E
25|$|As its number indicates, it is {{the northernmost}} east–west U.S. Route in the country. It is the lowest primary-numbered east–west U.S. Route, whose numbers {{otherwise}} end in zero, and was so numbered to avoid a US0. Sections of US2 in New England were once New England Route 15, part of the New England <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> system.|$|E

Crossing Upper Mountain Road (CR11) which serves I-190 exit25B and the Niagara Scenic Parkway, the route crosses Fish Creek and through the Niagara Falls Country Club. At the club, NY265 turns westward and reaches a junction with NY104 (Lewiston <b>Road),</b> <b>marking</b> the northern terminus of NY265.|$|E
25|$|After the war Glanville {{remained}} with the RRL {{and concentrated on}} research into roads. The organisation soon adopted a radical new form of study, implementing experiments on live highways. This method resulted in improvements to surfacing materials, <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> paint, and non-skid treatments. The laboratory was significantly enlarged in 1946 and took on a wider remit to investigate road safety and traffic management. Research in this area lead to better tyre materials, zebra crossings, speed limits, and laws regarding the wearing of safety helmets and seat belts. The RRL also investigated headlight dazzle and braking distances.|$|E
25|$|When the New England <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> {{system was}} {{established}} in 1922, the Atlantic Highway within New England was signed as Route 1, with a Route 24 continuing north to Madawaska; New York extended the number to New York City in 1924 with its own Route 1. Other states adopted their own systems of numbering, and by 1926 all states but Maryland had signed the Atlantic Highway as various routes, usually changing numbers at the state line. In 1925, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways created a preliminary list of interstate routes to be marked by the states, including Route 1 along the Atlantic. This highway began at Fort Kent, Maine and followed the existing Route 24 to Houlton and Route 15 to Bangor, beyond which it generally followed the Atlantic Highway to Miami. In all states but Georgia that had numbered their state highways, Route 1 followed {{only one or two}} numbers across the state. The only significant deviation from the Atlantic Highway was between Augusta, Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida, where Route 1 was assigned to a more inland route, rather than following the Atlantic Highway via Savannah.|$|E

25|$|The first {{inter-state}} numbering for the Roosevelt Highway was in New England, {{where the}} New England <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> system {{was established in}} 1922. Route 18 followed the auto trail from Portland northwest to Montpelier, where it continued to Burlington via Route 14. Many of the states along the route also assigned numbers to the highway; for instance, New York labeled their portion Route 3 in 1924. The Joint Board on Interstate Highways distributed its preliminary plan in 1925, in which a long section of the highway was labeled US2, from St. Ignace, Michigan west to Bonners Ferry, Idaho. East of St. Ignace, instead of crossing to the Lower Peninsula like the Roosevelt Highway, the proposed Route 2 traveled north to the international border at Sault Ste. Marie. It reappeared at Rouses Point, New York, following Route 30 and then rejoining the auto trail between Burlington and Montpelier. US2 and the Roosevelt Highway both connected Montpelier to St. Johnsbury, but the latter took a direct path along Route 18, while the former was assigned to Route 25 to Wells River, where it overlapped proposed US5 north to St. Johnsbury. There, where the Roosevelt Highway turned southeast to Portland, Route 2 continued east along Route 15 to Bangor and Route 1 to Calais, then heading north on Route 24 to end in Houlton.|$|E

Between White River Junction {{and the city}} of Barre, the route {{parallels}} Interstate 89. Vermont Route 14 was originally designated in 1922 as part of the New England <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> system.

2500|$|Vermont Route 18 was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, a transcontinental auto trail organized in 1919 running from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine via Ontario. Several years later, in 1922, the New England states adopted the New England <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> system, assigning route numbers to the main through routes in the region. The Roosevelt Highway routing in Vermont was assigned Route 14 from Burlington to Montpelier, and Route 18 from Montpelier to the New Hampshire state line in Waterford. The original Vermont portion of Route 18 ran [...] from Montpelier to St. Johnsbury using modern U.S. Route 2, then modern Vermont Route 18 from St. Johnsbury to the New Hampshire line.|$|E
2500|$|The {{portion of}} VT 16 west of US 5 was {{originally}} numbered in 1922 {{as part of}} Route 12 of the New England <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> system. Route 12 was a multi-state route known as the [...] "Keene Way" [...] that began in New London, Connecticut, passing through Worcester, Massachusetts and Keene, New Hampshire before entering Vermont. In Vermont, it passed through Montpelier and continued north through the village of Barton, ending at the city of Newport. When the Vermont state highway system was officially created in 1931, New England Route 12 became Vermont Route 12, running [...] from Ascutney {{to the city of}} Newport. In 1955, a new route from Montpelier to Morrisville was added to the state highway system as the [...] "Montpelier-Morrisville State Highway". At around the same time, the road from Barton village to Westmore center had been designated as VT56.|$|E
50|$|Other {{equipment}} {{is often used}} with <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> machines. The main auxiliary equipment includes thermoplastic paint pre-heaters, hand-push pre-markers and <b>road</b> <b>marking</b> removers. Thermoplastic paint pre-heater is used to melt the solid powder coating into a viscous liquid, providing {{a steady supply of}} paint to the marking machine. Pre-markers are used to draw a field sketch in advance to avoid faulty marking. <b>Road</b> <b>marking</b> removers are used to remove old or incorrect markings. Large self-propelled machines usually do not need any support equipment, as equivalent functionality is built in.|$|E

These road features can then be used as Ground Control Objects for a photogrammetric resection to finely register the images of a terrestrial mobile mapping system.
