The wavelet spectra of tree <b>ring</b> <b>time</b> series showed signs of 11 and 22 years, possibly related to the solar activity, and periods of 2 - 8 years, possibly related to El Nio events. The cross-wavelet spectra for all tree <b>ring</b> <b>time</b> series from Brazil present a significant response to the 11 -year solar cycle in the time interval between 1921 to after 1981. These tree <b>ring</b> <b>time</b> series still have a response to the second harmonic of the solar cycle (5. 5 years), but in different time intervals. The cross-wavelet maps also showed that the relationship between the SOI x tree <b>ring</b> <b>time</b> series is more intense, for oscillation in the range of 4 - 8 years.

40|$|Abstract—A {{sine wave}} fitting {{procedure}} for characterizing measurements of a periodic signal {{in the presence}} of additive noise and an unknown time base distortion is presented. If the time base distortion is modeled by a Fourier series, it suffers from the Gibbs phenomenon (ringing) at the borders of the data record. Usually, this is solved by ignoring data samples at the borders. The latter is unacceptable for very short data records where measuring a sample is (very) expensive and/or (very) time consuming. This paper presents a solution that suppresses the ringing in the esti-mated time base distortion without ignoring data samples at the borders. The theory is illustrated on simulations and on real vessel density in the wood of a mangrove tree from Kenya (Rhizophora mucronata).

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2007, due to {{a really}} scarce {{hazelnut}} plants demand, a nurseryman took the decision of not digging {{out a lot of}} coppices prepared in July, the same year. At the <b>ringing</b> <b>time,</b> some experimental theses such as IBAK, Hydroretenteur and both, were applied to these coppices. After one vegetative season, i. e., from July to December 2007, the rooted suckers were not dug out and they remained untouched in the same place of the nursery. In November 2008, after 2 vegetative seasons, the rooted suckers were dug out and before selling them, some quality parameters were measured. As expected, the quality was better than the quality obtained(as usual) from similar coppices after only one vegetative season. In fact, the rooted suckers obtained from coppices after 2 vegetative seasons show collar diameters over 25 mm and heights over 200 cm. This kind of strong plants is highly appreciated by the local growers...|$|E
5000|$|When {{vibration}} is the excitation causing resonance (rather than {{a hammer}} blow as the strike of a bell), {{there is a}} time period between the beginning of vibration excitation, and the moment when full resonant amplitude is reached. During this time the amplitude is building-up or growing (the reverse of decaying), so this phenomenon is called reverse <b>ring</b> <b>time,</b> or RRT. For large metal structures that are commonly stress relieved with vibration, ring or reverse <b>ring</b> <b>times</b> (the time periods are the same, whether the amplitude is growing or decaying), can be 20 - 40 seconds or longer.

40|$|MasterVoIP {{technology}} {{is continuing to}} emerge as a feasible option to replace traditional telephone systems that use the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network). In the future, when All-IP networks are deployed in a large scale, VoIP will eventually substitute the classical PSTN. In comparison to PSTN-based systems, VoIP allows packet-switched data networks to be utilized for telephony and is more easily integrated with Internet-based services, such as e-mail or Web browsing. While VoIP promises both low cost {{and a variety of}} advanced services, it may entail security vulnerabilities. Unlike PSTN, intelligence is placed at the edge and the security measures are not incorporated into the network. Among many security threats, we will focus on the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Being a real-time service, VoIP is more susceptible to DoS attacks than regular Internet services, which pose serious threats to IP telephony infrastructures. They deteriorate the perceived QoS and even cripple down the devices in the path from caller to callee. Since VoIP continues to play a larger role in our global telecommunications, protecting infrastructures of VoIP from disruptive DoS attacks will be critically important to people’s everyday lives. Especially, in VoIP deployments that use SIP for call signaling, ensuring the availability of main components such as SIP proxy servers under attack should be a high priority. In this paper, we propose a detection method of the VoIP-specific DoS attack which exploits the semantics of the SIP. This attack is named the ringing-based DoS attack and performed by users who do not pick up incoming calls for an unusually long amount of time to exhaust resource at a SIP stateful proxy server. A noticeable feature of this attack {{is that it does not}} result in high incoming call traffic rates, unlike common flooding-based DoS attacks. Consequently, the ringing-based DoS attack could not be detected using previous solutions designed for flooding-based DoS attacks. To detect this attack, first we model the normal traffic of legitimate users with the gamma distribution on the assumption that the distribution of <b>ringing</b> <b>time</b> does not change rapidly. To quantify the discrepancy between the modeled normal traffic and the attack traffic, we use Pearson’s chi-square statistic. Simulation results show that the proposed detection system can detect the ringing-based DoS attacks...|$|E

The state space of time-extended Petri nets is mapped onto its basic underlying stochastic process, which can be shown to be Markovian under the assumption of exponentially distributed <b>ring</b> <b>times.</b> The integration of exponentially and non-exponentially distributed timing {{is still one of the}} major problems for the analysis and was rst attacked for continuous time Petri nets at the cost of structural or analytical restrictions. We propose a discrete deterministic and stochastic Petri net (DDSPN) formalism with no imposed structural or analytical restrictions where transitions can re either in zero time or according to arbitrary <b>ring</b> <b>times</b> that can be represented as the time to absorption in a nite absorbing discrete time Markov chain (DTMC). Exponentially distributed <b>ring</b> <b>times</b> are then approximated arbitrarily well by geometric distributions. Deterministic r-ing times are a special case of the geometric distribution. The underlying stochastic process of a DDSPN is then also a DTMC, from which the transient and stationary solution can be obtained by standard techniques. A comprehensive algorithm and some state space reduction techniques for the analysis of DDSPNs are presented comprising the automatic detection of con icts and confusions, which removes a major obstacle for the analysis of discrete time models...|$|R
