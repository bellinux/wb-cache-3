Data informing support of specialist activities such as climbing and high altitude trekking is limited. A 42 -year-old man with type 1 diabetes (duration 30 years) attended a multidisciplinary Physical Activity and Diabetes clinic planning to climb Mont Blanc {{during the summer and}} trek to Everest Base Camp in the autumn. His aims were to complete these adventures without his diabetes impacting on their success. Methods: We report the information provided that enabled him to help safely facilitate his objectives, in particular the requirement for frequent checking of blood glucose levels, the effects of altitude on insulin dose <b>requirements,</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> that Acute Mountain Sicknes may mimic the symptoms of hypoglycemia and vice versa.

40|$|Searching {{quickly and}} {{accurately}} {{in a large}} collection of images has become an increasingly important problem. The {{ultimate goal is to}} make visual search possible: allow users to search using images in addition to typing text. The typical approach is to index all the images of interest (e. g., images of landmarks, books, or DVDs) in a database and let users question the system with query images. Such a database can reach billions of images, and this poses challenges in terms of memory and computational <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> performance. In this work we provide an in depth study of systems used for searching large-scale image collections. Specifically, we provide a thorough comparison of the two leading image search approaches: Full Representation (FR) vs. Bag of Words (BoW). We derive theoretical estimates of how the memory and computational cost scale with the number of images in the database, and empirically evaluate the performance and run time on four real-world datasets. Our experiments suggest that FR provides better recognition performance than BoW, though it requires more memory. Therefore, we address these shortcomings by presenting novel methods that increase the recognition performance of BoW and decrease the memory requirements of FR. Finally, we present a novel way to parallelize FR on multiple machines and scale up database sizes to 100 million images with interactive run time...|$|E

Modern industrial plants often collect vast amount of process data in distributed control systems and management information systems. Time stress due to data overload and decision uncertainty increases the risk of operator errors. Comprehensive {{operation support}} to the operator in abnormal situations to reduce operator errors is strongly suggested. The solution to this problem is to design intelligent operation support systems that reduce the cognitive load placed on operators by providing guidance for knowledge-based decision making. This paper presents an intelligent operation support system (IOSS) structure using rich knowledge representation and hybrid reasoning strategy. The functional <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> desired features for IOSS are defined. The human operator’s recognition behavior is analyzed. It is shown that a hybrid reasoning environment that combines case-based reasoning (CBR), model-based reasoning (MBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) is consistent with operator’s problem solving.

40|$|Abstract—The {{technique}} of dynamic programming {{for the time}} regis-tration of a reference and a test pattern has found widespread use {{in the area of}} isolated word recognition. Recently, a number of variations on the basic time warping algorithm have been proposed by Sakoe and Chiba, and Rabiner, Rosenberg, and Levinson. These algorithms all assume that the test input is the time pattern of a feature vector from an isolated word whose endpoints are known (at least approximately). The major differences in the methods are the global path constraints (i. e., the region of possible warping paths), the local continuity con-straints on the path, and the distance weighting and normalization used to give the overall minimum distance. The purpose of this investigation is to study the effects of such variations on the performance of differ-ent dynamic time warping algorithms for a realistic speech database. The performance measures that were used include: speed of operation, memory <b>requirements,</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> accuracy. The results show that both axis orientation and relative length of the reference and the test patterns are important factors in recognition accuracy. Our results suggest a new approach to dynamic time warping for isolated words in which both the reference and test patterns are linearly warped to a fixed length, and then a simplified dynamic time warping algorithm is used to handle the nonlinear component of the time alignment. Re-sults with this new algorithm show performance comparable to or better than that of all other dynamic time warping algorithms that were studied. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{administrative}} structure needed to coordinate the numerous institutions of higher education offering postsecondary degree programs on an Army installation. The study then identified the management problems and solutions to those problems, as perceived by Education Services Officers when coordinating among the participating institutions. The population consisted of representatives from eleven U. S. Army Continuing Education Services Centers. The Education Services Center representatives having the responsibility for coordinating the postsecondary programs were interviewed by telephone to collect the data. An interview form was designed to elicit non-directed responses to perceived major problems confronting the representatives, problems at Department of the Army and possible solutions to the problems. Education Services representatives encountered difficulty in providing a quality program during a period when on-Post program effectiveness was evaluated by Department of the Army. Major problems existed in the coordination among several institutions with differing administrative policies, <b>requirements,</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> of transfer credit. Solutions to the problems included the adoption of an Advisory Committee concept to assist in academic advisement and evaluation, the incorporation of evaluation in program, the development of guidelines for evaluation, and clarification of the requirement for negotiation of the institution agreement. Other recommendations were to develop more concise guidelines for quality assurance and evaluation, and for the closer correlation between academic needs of Army students and professional development needs of the U.

40|$|Standard radio {{telemetry}} techniques via triangulation {{were used}} to determine coyote locations and to construct maps of coyote movement patterns in Curlew Valley (Utah and Idaho). Home range sizes were determined by establishing corresponding boundaries drawn on the basis of location, density and relative number of visitations (contour method), and then tracing the boundaries with a compensating polar planimeter. Mean home range sizes were determined directly for only those animals with home range values that reached an asymptote when plotted against corresponding time periods. This asymptotic value was considered the best estimate of the actual home range size. Four adult females and one adult male were in this category, with mean values of 18. 3 km 2 and 14. 5 km 2 respectively. The asymptote was estimated for home ranges which did not stabilize (mean values of 20. 2 and 17. 8 km for adult females and males respectively) using a home range estimator; validation of the estimator is discussed. Since no juvenile animal 2 ̆ 7 s home range appeared to reach an asymptote, no asymptotic estimates were made. Various methods of constructing home range boundaries, their advantages and disadvantages, are listed. Standardization in the home range concept is necessary if meaningful comparisons are to be made between studies. Home ranges are dynamic, and must be considered in terms of specific time frames. Guidelines for adequate description of the home range are discussed with emphasis on quantity of data, time <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> of seasonal shifts in the home range. Map analysis suggested three general patterns with regard to home ranges; namely, animals with contiguous home range areas, those with disjunct home ranges, and wandering individuals. Fifty percent of the coyotes were trapped more than 0. 5 km outside home range boundaries while an additional 42 percent were trapped {{on the periphery of the}} home range. Only 8 percent, all juveniles, were trapped within their home range. None of the 21 animals killed by hunters or trappers died well within their respective home ranges. Twenty-nine percent were killed on the periphery of their home ranges and 71 percent were killed an average of 11 km outside their home range n·· rl Ties. Several movement patterns other than home range were discernible, including brief excursions away from the home range (sallies), dispersals, and total area utilized. Mean dispersal distances for adul t males, juvenile males and females respectively were 56, 9 and 54 km; no adult female was known to disperse. Juvenile females had the greatest tendency to disperse with 53 percent involved; juvenile males, 33 percent and adult males, 30 percent. Sallies were analyzed according to distance, duration and frequency, with adult females having the longest (4. 9 km) and the greatest number of sallies (7. 9 per month), and adult males spending the most time per sally (16. 2 hours) as well as time per month (72. 9 hours) in sally activity. The total area utilized by coyotes is discussed in terms of size and measurement. Mean values for total areas utilized are 138 km 2 for adult females, 90 km 2 for adult males, 68 km 2 for juvenile males and 46 km 2 for juvenile females. Home range configuration is discussed in terms of importance and variability in form, with the majority of shapes being ameboid in character. Linearity may be a function of the method used to establish home range boundaries and use of baseline data from fixed radio telemetry stations...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new fractal based {{recognition}} method, Face Authentication using Speed Fractal Technique (FAST), is presented. The main {{contribution is}} the good compromise between memory <b>requirements,</b> execution time <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> ratio. FAST is based on Iterated Function Systems (IFS) theory, largely studied in still image compression and indexing, but not yet widely used for face recognition. Indeed, Fractals are well known to be invariant to a large set of global transformations. FAST is robust with respect to meaningful variations in facial expression and to the small changes of illumination and pose. Another advantage of the FAST strategy consists in the speed up that it introduces. The typical slowness of fractal image compression is avoided by exploiting only the indexing phase, which requires time O(D log (D)), where D {{is the size of}} the domain pool.

It is often assumed that high quality video sequences are available for recognition. However, relaxing such a <b>requirement</b> <b>and</b> implementing robust <b>recognition</b> using videos having reduced data rates can achieve efficiency in storing and transmitting video data. Three-dimensional video scalability, which refers to the possibility of reducing spatial, temporal, and quality resolutions of videos, is an effective way for flexible representation and management of video data. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the video scalability on multi-view activity recognition. We employ both a spatiotemporal feature extraction-based method and a deep learning-based method using convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The recognition performance of the two methods is examined, along with in-depth analysis regarding how their performance vary with respect to various scalability combinations. In particular, we demonstrate that the deep learning-based method can achieve significantly improved robustness in comparison to the feature-based method. Furthermore, we investigate optimal scalability combinations with respect to bitrate in order to provide useful guidelines for an optimal operation policy in resource-constrained activity recognition systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for modeling, tracking, and recognizing human faces in video sequences within one integrated framework. Conventional video-based face recognition systems have usually been embodied with two independent components: the tracking <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> modules. In contrast, our algorithm emphasizes an algorithmic architecture that tightly couples these two components {{within a single}} framework. This is accomplished through a novel appearance model which is utilized simultaneously by both modules, even with their disparate <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> functions. The complex nonlinear appearance manifold of each registered person is partitioned into a collection of submanifolds where each models the face appearances of the person in nearby poses. The submanifold is approximated by a low-dimensional linear subspace computed by principal component analysis using images sampled from training video sequences. The connectivity between the submanifolds is modeled as transition probabilities between pairs of submanifolds, and these are learned directly from training video sequences. The integrated task of tracking <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> is formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem.

Methods: The present study is a descriptive research of correlational type that used measuring method. In the study, the hospitals affiliated to Medical Sciences Universities were chosen from 4 provinces of Tehran, Fars, Lorestan, and Yazd. 432 staff members answered the quality <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> transformation process questionnaires; 500 customers answered quality dimensions questionnaires. Data analysis was done using Pearson correlation coefficient, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation. Results: The results showed that quality transformation in the studied hospitals with an average of 3. 34 was more than the satisfaction <b>and</b> the quality <b>requirements</b> with an average of 3. 75 was in a good level; also, the quality dimensions with theaverage of 3. 61 was also in a good level.
