2500|$|Trusts {{are usually}} {{created by a}} settlor, who gives assets {{to one or more}} {{trustees}} who undertake to use the assets for beneficiaries. Like in contract law no formality is required to make a trust, except where statute demands it (e.g. transfers of land, shares, for wills). To protect the settlor, English law demands a <b>reasonable</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> that a trust was intended. To be able to enforce the trust's terms, the courts also require reasonable certainty about which assets were entrusted, and which people were meant to be the trust's beneficiaries. Unlike some offshore tax havens and the United States, English law requires that a trust has at least one beneficiary if it is not charitable. The Charity Commission monitors how charity trustees perform their duties, and ensures charities serve the public interest. Pensions and investment trusts are closely regulated to protect people's savings and ensure that trustees or fund managers are accountable. Beyond these expressly created trusts, English law recognises [...] "resulting" [...] and [...] "constructive" [...] trusts that arise by automatic operation of law to prevent unjust enrichment, to correct wrongdoing or to create property rights where intentions are unclear. Although the word [...] "trust" [...] is used, resulting and constructive trusts are different because they mainly create property-based remedies to protect people's rights, and do not merely flow (like a contract or an express trust) from the consent of the parties. Generally speaking, however, trustees owe a range of duties to their beneficiaries. If a trust document is silent, trustees must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, manage the trust's affairs with reasonable care and skill, and only act for purposes consistent with the trust's terms. Some of these duties can be excluded, except where the statute makes duties compulsory, but all trustees must act in good faith {{in the best interests of}} the beneficiaries. If trustees breach their duties, the beneficiaries may make a claim for all property wrongfully paid away to be restored, and may trace and follow what was trust property and claim restitution from any third party who ought to have known of the breach of trust.|$|E

40|$|Probabilistic failure {{analysis}} is essential when analysis of stress-life (S-N) curves is inconclusive {{in determining the}} relative ranking {{of two or more}} materials. In 1964, L.

Simplified algebraic equations for confidence numbers were derived based on the original work of L. Johnson.

It is possible to rank the fatigue lives of different materials with a <b>reasonable</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> statistical <b>certainty</b> based on combined confidence numbers. These equations were applied to rotating beam fatigue tests that were conducted on three aluminum alloys at three stress levels each. These alloys were AL 2024, AL 6061, and AL 7075. The results were analyzed and compared using ASTM Standard E 739 - 91 and the Johnson-Weibull analysis. The ASTM method did not statistically distinguish between AL 6010 and AL 7075. Based on the Johnson-Weibull analysis confidence numbers greater than 99 percent, AL 2024 was found to have the longest fatigue life, followed by AL 7075, and then AL 6061.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{differential}} diagnosis of diseases and disorders having head pain as a symptom {{is often a}} difficult challenge for health care professionals. The complexity of this problem, the need for com-puter aided diagnosis, and the assumptions upon which one diagnostic software program was devel-oped are discussed. A database driven user-oriented Internet website was offered at no charge to headache sufferers, and this vehicle provided the data source for research. The software program com-pares consistent user surveys to 253 expert profiles compiled from searches of the best available mate-rial in the medical/dental literature. A database of 1288 consistent user surveys was studied and analyzed for this paper. Findings discussed are: 1. {{the large amount of}} users (63 %) who do not match any expert profile to a <b>reasonable</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> medical certainty; 2. the significance of the relatively large amount of headache sufferers (17 %) whose diagnosis or diagnoses are solely within the realm of den-tistry; and 3. the importance of differentiating between discriminating and substantiating diagnostic crite-ria. Many users do not fit existing algorithms for chronic head pain. Data generated by this computer-aided diagnostic software program challenge some current paradigms and concepts of diag-nosis. The data generated question “correct to a <b>reasonable</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>certainty,</b> ” challenge “a preponderance of the evidence ” as scientific diagnostic standards, and also question whether rendering a working diagnosis is possible on each and every patient.

An autopsy conducted by Hirsch in October 2007 found that Zadroga's death was not related to his time at Ground Zero, with Hirsch and another medical examiner signing a statement that [...] "It is our unequivocal opinion, with certainty beyond doubt, that the foreign material in your son’s lungs did not get there as the result of inhaling dust at the World Trade Center or elsewhere." [...] Hirsch concluded that Zadroga died from self-injection of prescription drugs, with Hirsch finding severe scarring in his lungs that he determined was caused by cellulose and talc granulomas and stating (through a spokesperson) that [...] "The lung disease he had was a consequence of injecting prescription drugs". Officials from the Chief Medical Examiner's office met with the Zadroga family to present his findings. A third opinion obtained by Zadroga's family later that month from Dr. Michael Baden, chief forensic pathologist of the New York State Police (and former New York City Medical Examiner), backed the original claim of WTC dust responsibility, citing the presence of glass fibers in Zadroga's lungs that could not be related to injecting drugs. The Daily News criticized Hirsch in a November 2007 editorial, stating that the results blaming the death on drug use [...] "libeled the memory of Detective James Zadroga" [...] and that Hirsch had [...] "committed a gross injustice that no apology can ever set right".|$|R
