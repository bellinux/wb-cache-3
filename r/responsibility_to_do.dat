His men surrounded the building, and he entered City Hall to confront Mayor Wood. Realizing his situation, Wood agreed to submit and was placed under arrest.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the {{controversy}} surrounding the BCS became a topic of conversation within the United States government. In 2008 U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) had {{said that he would}} hold congressional hearings on the BCS in the future after his Utah team failed to play in the national championship game. Following up on Senator Hatch's actions in the Senate, in April 2011 the Attorney General of Utah announced that he would be initiating a class action anti-trust lawsuit against the BCS, despite the fact that Utah is joining to the Pacific-10 Conference, which is an automatic qualifying conference. In May 2011 the U.S. Justice Department {{sent a letter to the}} NCAA asking for a detailed explanation about why FBS football was the only NCAA sport that the NCAA did not 1) have a playoff system in place to determine a champion and 2) why the NCAA had abrogated its <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so and given the authority to determine the NCAA Champion to an outside group such as the BCS. The Justice Department's investigation and Utah Attorney General's lawsuit are both aimed at forcing the BCS to open its books, which they are as a non-profit required to do every year and have never done, and at determining whether the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel based on Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of 1914 and the Robinson-Patman Anti-Price Discrimination Act. Two more states Attorneys General are said to be considering joining the Utah lawsuit, and the investigation by the Justice Department will probably include a minute and extensive examination of the Fiesta Bowl Scandal as well as conducting complete audits of the other BCS Bowls, the BCS itself and possibly even the schools of the 6 BCS Automatic Qualification Conferences.|$|E

The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about pushing the envelope.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how defamilisation and familisation measures can affect women’s capacity to accumulate pension income and their subsequent {{standard of living}} after retirement. Firstly, it highlights the concepts of defamilisation and familisation and discusses the potential of these measures in assisting women to save pension income through the ‘commodification of labour’ and the ‘decommodification of labour’. Secondly, it examines the major pension policies and examples of defamilisation and familisation measures in Taiwan. It shows how the current limited provision of such measures could create a ‘double jeopardy’ for women, affecting access to paid employment or resources to enable women who wish <b>to</b> undertake caring <b>responsibilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, and ultimately impacting their capacity to accumulate pension income. Thirdly, it suggests ways to strengthen defamilisation and familisation measures in order to enable women to accumulate sufficient retirement income {{on the basis of}} three preconditions. These are: policy attention to the reciprocal relationship between familisation measures/defamilisation measures and pension schemes for women; a recognition of differences among women in their preferred strategies to accumulate pension income; and an emphasis on a life course perspective to understand the double jeopardies faced by women in saving for retirement. ...|$|R
50|$|That night, the {{students}} {{are all in the}} student lounge when the cops arrive. They arrest Charlie for assault, Principal Gardner is fired, and the kids trash the lounge building. Charlie is released, and before the play, stops by Mr. Gardner's house to invite him. Charlie finds Mr. Gardner heavily intoxicated and waving a revolver. They get into a heated argument which culminates in Charlie falling into the pool after attempting to tackle Mr. Gardner, thinking he is about to commit suicide. Mr. Gardner, appearing sober, comes to his senses and dives into the pool to save Charlie and states that he was not attempting to commit suicide because he has too many <b>responsibilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> such a thing. They talk over their problems about Charlie's father and Susan, and then go to the play. Mr. Gardner takes up his old job as a history teacher again (and is now much happier), and Charlie finally gains the confidence to visit his father in prison (something he had felt uncomfortable about earlier in the film). The film ends with Charlie applying for a summer internship at a psychiatric institute.|$|R

If Aurelia can afford the expense, let her furnish her mutilated lover with wooden arms and wooden legs, and a glass eye and a wig, and give him another show; give him ninety days, without grace, and if he does not break his neck in the mean time, marry him and take the chances. It does not seem to me that there is much risk, anyway, Aurelia, because if he sticks to his singular propensity for damaging himself every time he sees a good opportunity, his next experiment is bound to finish him, and then you are safe, married or single. If married, the wooden legs and such other valuables as he may possess revert to the widow, and you see you sustain no actual loss save the cherished fragment of a noble but most unfortunate husband, who honestly strove to do right, but whose extraordinary instincts were against him. Try it, Maria. I have thought the matter over carefully and well, and it is the only chance I see for you. It would have been a happy conceit on the part of Caruthers if he had started with his neck and broken that first; but since he has seen fit to choose a different policy and string himself out as long as possible, I do not think we ought to upbraid him for it if he has enjoyed it.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{sustained}} international interest from {{health care policy}} makers, practitioners, and researchers in developing interprofessional approaches to delivering patient-centred care. In this paper, we offer a critical exploration of a selection of professional discourses related to these practice paradigms, including interprofessional collaboration, patient-centred care, and {{the combination of the}} two. We argue that for some groups of patients, inequalities between different health and social care professions and between professionals and patients challenge the successful realization of the positive aims associated with these discourses. Specifically, we argue that interprofessional and professional–patient hierarchies raise a number of key questions about the nature of professions, their relationships with one another as well as their relationship with patients. We explore how the focus on interprofessional collaboration and patient-centred care have the potential to reinforce a patient compliance model by shifting <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> patients <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the ‘‘right thing’’ and by extending the reach of medical power across other groups of professionals. Our goal is to stimulate debate that leads to enhanced practice opportunities for health professionals and improved care for patients...|$|R
40|$|In this essay, I {{will examine}} how {{technological}} progress affects {{the responsibilities of}} human agents. To this end, I will distinguish between two interpretations {{of the concept of}} responsibility, viz. responsibility as attributability and substantive responsibility. On the former interpretation, <b>responsibility</b> has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the idea of authorship. When we say that a person is responsible for her actions we mean that she is to be seen as the author of these actions. They can be attributed to her, such that she can be normatively appraised – i. e. blamed, praised, etc. – on that basis. In discussing this kind of responsibility I will show that the responsibility of human agents tends to increase as their technologies progress. This claim is often taken for granted, but seldom clarified and argued for. I will give it a clear interpretation and provide a semi-formal reasoning that supports it. The second interpretation of responsibility that I will discuss is substantive <b>responsibility.</b> It has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the normative demands that confront us with what we are required <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I will argue that technological change can affect, firstly, what our substantive responsibilities are on a case-by-case basis. Secondly, I will try to show that it can affect {{the way we think about}} our substantive responsibilities at the level of theoretical normative ethics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the infantry battalion commanders {{of the first}} Australian Imperial Force during the First World War. Although the command of an infantry battalion was an important and influential position within the army&# 146;s hierarchy it has been largely overlooked in Australian histories of the First World War. To redress this omission, this study evaluates the 183 men who held substantive commands between 4 August 1914 and 11 November 1918 and assesses their experiences, their competence, and their changing <b>responsibilities.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> so, the exercising of command has been broken up into three components: tactical ability, administrative ability, and leadership. An officer was required to exercise all three competently if his battalion was to be effective. This study demonstrates that by 1918 Australian battalion commanders were largely competent in all three. Two factors were primarily responsible for this success. First, by situating Australian battalion commanders within the wider context of the British Army, they were integrated into and beneficiaries of the institutional learning process that allowed the British Expeditionary Force to develop into a successful war-winning army by 1918. Second, Australian battalion commanders achieved proficiency through ruthless removal of inefficient officers and the appointment of potentially competent replacements. This conclusion undermines the notion that Australians were natural soldiers and leaders and instead points towards a more technical understanding of warfare, which has been absent in many retellings of the Australian experience of the First World War...|$|R
