In 1990 she was awarded the Oberrheinischen Kulturpreis by the Goethe Foundation in Basel; eight years later she was honoured with the gold medal of the Canton of Zürich for her understanding of democracy and her humanity.|$|E
40|$|Prospective and {{retrospective}} {{reserves are}} defined as conditional expected values, given some information {{available at the time}} of consideration. Each specification of the information invoked gives rise to a correspond-ing pair of reserves. Relationships between reserves are established in the general set-up. For the prospective reserve the present definition conforms with, and generalizes, the traditional one. For the <b>retrospective</b> <b>reserve</b> it appears to be novel. Special attention is given to the continuous time Markov chain model frequently used in the context of life and pension insurance. Thiele's differential equation for the prospective reserve is shown to have a retrospective counterpart. It is pointed out that the prospective and retrospective differential equations have, respectively, the Kolmogorov backward and forward differential equations as special cases. Practical uses of the differential equations are demonstrated by examples. Key words: prospective and retrospective reserves, continuou...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} bonus in life {{insurance}} is considered {{in a model}} framework where the traditional set-up is extended by letting the experience basis (mortality, interest, etc.) be stochastic. A novel definition of the technical surplus on an insurance contract is proposed, and basic principles for its repayment as bonus are discussed. Making the experience basis an endogenous part of the model opens possibilities of model-based prognostication of future bonuses. Numerical illustrations are provided.

50|$|Net {{level premium}} reserves, also called benefit reserves, only involve two cash flows {{and are used}} for some US GAAP {{reporting}} purposes. The valuation premium in an NLP reserve is a premium such {{that the value of}} the reserve at time zero is equal to zero. The net level premium reserve is found by taking the expected value of the loss random variable defined above. They can be formulated prospectively or retrospectively. The amount of prospective reserves at a point in time is derived by subtracting the actuarial present value of future valuation premiums from the actuarial present value of the future insurance benefits. <b>Retrospective</b> <b>reserving</b> subtracts accumulated value of benefits from accumulated value of valuation premiums as of a point in time. The two methods yield identical results (assuming bases are the same for both prospective and retrospective calculations).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{stochastic}} model for disability insurance contracts. The model {{is based on a}} discrete time non-homogeneous semi-Markov process (DTNHSMP) to which the backward recurrence time process is introduced. This permits a more exhaustive study of disability evolution and a more efficient approach to the duration problem. The use of semi-Markov reward processes facilitates the possibility of deriving equations of the prospective and <b>retrospective</b> mathematical <b>reserves.</b> The model is applied to a sample of contracts drawn at random from a mutual insurance company...|$|R
