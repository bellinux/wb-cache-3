30|$|The {{uncertainties}} in {{what the}} <b>rescue</b> <b>service</b> can achieve {{in the case of}} an accident indicates that the efforts made by the fire <b>rescue</b> <b>service</b> should not be taken into account when evaluating or designing a multifunctional building, at least not in Sweden with the resources the fire <b>rescue</b> <b>service</b> has there. However the fire <b>rescue</b> <b>service</b> may be able to help with management, communication, coordination etc. during an incident. This however requires planning and that the fire <b>rescue</b> <b>service</b> is included in the emergency management plans for the facility.|$|R
5|$|In 2001, the Ministry of Justice {{considered}} reorganizing {{the search}} and <b>rescue</b> <b>services,</b> and looked into moving the 330 Squadron from Banak to Hammerfest Airport. The rationale was the proximity to Hammerfest Hospital and a typical 40-minute shorter flight time to the coast. However, such a location would give longer travel time to the inner parts of Finnmark. The plans were hindered by opposition from the Air Force, {{as they would have}} to establish a military station at Hammerfest. The Norwegian Armed Forces announced in 2007 that they would carry out a major restructuring and decrease of activity in Finnmark, with the long-term plan to close the Garrison of Porsanger.|$|E

These can be a wide variety of vehicles, from standard cars, to modified vans, motorcycles, pedal cycles, quad bikes or horses. These units can function as a vehicle for officers or supervisors (similar to a fire chief's vehicle, but for ambulance services). Fire & <b>Rescue</b> <b>services</b> in North America often staff EMTs or Paramedics to their apparatuses to provide medical care without the need to wait for an ambulance.|$|E

They are distinct from and governed by a fire authority, which is the legislative, public and administrative body, made up of civilians (usually members of elected local or regional bodies). Fire authorities in England and Wales (and formerly Scotland), and therefore fire and <b>rescue</b> <b>services,</b> receive {{a large proportion of}} their funding through a share of Council Tax. Scotland and Northern Ireland have centralised fire and <b>rescue</b> <b>services,</b> and so their authorities are effectively committees of the devolved parliaments. The total budget for fire services in 2014-15 was £2.9 billion.|$|E
