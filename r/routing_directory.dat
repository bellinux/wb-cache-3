40|$|Content {{is quickly}} {{beginning}} to emerge as the core of Internet and networking applications today. Among the most important research issues with content {{is the problem of}} addressing and naming content, since a robust and naming-centric networking strategy will enable the building of next-generation Internet architectures that can easily scale content demands correctly. We propose a counter-intuitive approach to solving the naming problem, by using IPv 6 addresses as content names. We explain our proposal and architecture for using IPv 6 addresses for content names, and argue that using IPv 6 addresses for naming content will allow us to solve the problems of <b>routing</b> and <b>directory</b> services associated with naming. 1...|$|R
40|$|In today's chaotic network, {{data and}} {{services}} are mobile and replicated widely for availability, durability, and locality. Components within this infrastructure interact in rich and complex ways, greatly stressing traditional approaches to name service and routing. This paper explores an alternative to traditional approaches called Tapestry. Tapestry is an overlay location and routing infrastructure that provides location-independent routing of messages directly to the closest copy of an object or service using only point-to-point links and without centralized resources. The <b>routing</b> and <b>directory</b> information within this infrastructure is purely soft state and easily repaired. Tapestry is self-administering, faulttolerant, and resilient under load. This paper presents the architecture and algorithms of Tapestry and explores their advantages {{through a number of}} experiments...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{proposals}} for content routing in information-centric networks (ICN) {{require the use}} of content- based routing tables listing routes to name prefixes or individual named data objects (NDO), and a single naming space for NDOs. We present CORD (Content Oriented <b>Routing</b> with <b>Directories)</b> as an alternative to content routing in ICNs. CORD eliminates the need for large content-based routing tables by establishing routes to directories using distance-vector signaling and by mapping name prefixes or names of NDOs to directories using publish-subscribe mechanisms. Simulation experiments using the topology of a real ISP network are used to compare CORD with name-based content routing approaches based on link-state and distance information. The results show that CORD attains comparable data delivery and end-to-end delays, but incurs orders of magnitude less control overhead. In addition, CORD supports multipath forwarding of content requests and content...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. An object-oriented simulation model is developed {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4214, which promulgates the protocol for international telephone call <b>routing</b> and <b>directories</b> for tactical communications. The model simulates communication systems using the STANAG 4214 protocol to isolate discrepancies which could lead to the inability to successfully complete calls within the system. The model also simulates protocol modifications created to correct existing discrepancies and verifies their effectiveness in making the protocol more robust. Results show that these modifications improve STANAG call completion rate from a potential low of under 70 percent to 100 percent, while simultaneously easing the restrictions on lateral communication connections. The model is menu-driven with both graphical and hard copy output, making it useful to network planners, protocol designers, and tactical communications officers. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the construction of}} sparse covers for planar graphs and other graphs that exclude a fixed minor. We present an algorithm that gives a cover for the γ-neighborhood of each node. For planar graphs, the cover has radius no more than 24 γ − 8 and degree (maximum cluster overlap) no more than 18. For every n node graph that excludes a fixed minor, we present an algorithm that yields a cover with radius no more than 4 γ and degree O(log n). This is a significant improvement over previous results for planar graphs and for graphs excluding a fixed minor; {{in order to obtain}} clusters with radius of O(γ), it was required to have degree polynomial in n. Since sparse covers have many applications in distributed computing, including compact <b>routing,</b> distributed <b>directories</b> and synchronizers, our improved cover construction results in improved algorithms for all these problems, for the class of minor-free graphs. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a novel routing {{mechanism}} for store-andforward date communications networks will be presented. Unlike conventional <b>directory</b> <b>routing</b> procedures, which route a message along a particular path between {{the source and}} destination, this routing mechanism sub-divides the message and disperses it {{through the maze of}} paths comprising the network. Therefore, the mechanism is referred to as dispersity routing. In a recent analysis[?], conditions have been found under which dispersity routing systems provide the following advantages over conventional directory procedures: a significantly smaller average and variance of delay, less sensitivity to both incremental and large increases in link utilization, an ability to continue to operate, without adapting the routing rule, when complete link failures occur...|$|R
40|$|Network {{fragmentation}} {{occurs when}} the accessibility of a network-based resource to an observer {{is a function of}} how the observer is connected to the network. In the context of the Internet, network fragmentation is well-known and occurs in many situations, including an increasing preponderance of network address translation, firewalls, and virtual private networks. Recently, however, new threats to Internet consistency have received media attention. Alternative namespaces have emerged as the result of formal objections to the process by which Internet names and addresses are provisioned. In addition, various governments and service providers around the world have deployed network technology that (accidentally or intentionally) restricts access to certain Internet content. Combined with the aforementioned sources of fragmentation, these new concerns provide ample motivation for a network that allows users the ability to specify not only the network location of Internet resources they want to view but also the perspectives from which they want to view them. Our vision of a Perspective Access Network is a peer-to-peer overlay network that incorporates <b>routing</b> and <b>directory</b> services that allow network perspective-sharing and non-hierarchical organization of the Internet. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a directory service for such networks. We demonstrate its feasibility and efficacy using measurements from a test deployment on PlanetLab. I...|$|R
40|$|The content routing {{protocols}} for MANETs proposed to date require the flooding of content requests or link-state advertisements. The Adaptive Publish-subscribe Distance Vector (APDV) protocol {{is presented as}} an alternative. APDV combines <b>routing</b> to well-known <b>directories</b> using distance-vector signaling with publish-subscribe mechanisms to discover content. Named data objects (NDO) are published with directories, and consumers of content obtain routes to NDOs from those directories. Each node is covered dynamically by a minimum number of directories within a few hops. APDV is shown to be loop-free at every instant, to provide correct routes within a finite time, {{and to have a}} small route stretch. APDV is compared with representative protocols for routing to NDOs using link-state information and on-demand routing; the results show that APDV incurs orders of magnitude less control overhead in large wireless networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{network of}} {{embedded}} devices {{needs to be}} able to execute queries for dynamically changing content. Even in a completely reliable network, this is a formidable task because of the enormous scale of the networks, severely limited resources of individual devices (bandwidth and battery power) and the heterogeneity of resources being managed. In this work we introduce a novel information query methodology for designing online solutions for heterogeneous sensor networks with various resources (e. g., battery, bandwidth, CPU). This provides a route selection and query management mechanism that will enable a sensor network to find sensor level information without a routing algorithm specialized for the particular form of information. In order to execute such a methodology in a scalable, limited resource environment such as sensor networks we employ a novel lattice data structure, which is basically a combination of trees with small overlap that provably enables extension of any <b>routing</b> or <b>directory</b> infrastructure to an arbitrary scale, with only small overhead. We show how to use such data structures (lattices) that will enable scaling to millions of devices with an overhead that only grows logarithmically in the number of network nodes and with provably small distortion of paths. Moreover, we show a completely distributed implementation of such structures, that creates minimal overload on the client sensors. ...|$|R

Another component routes the spreadsheet workbooks to a specified directory on the host processing device. A process then checks the received spreadsheet workbooks for errors, and if no errors are detected the spreadsheet workbooks are <b>routed</b> to another <b>directory</b> to await initiation of a remote database loading process. The loading process first converts the spreadsheet workbooks to comma separated value (CSV) files. Next, a network {{connection with the}} computer system that hosts the telemetry dictionary database is established and the CSV files are ported to the computer system that hosts the telemetry dictionary database. This {{is followed by a}} remote initiation of a database loading program. Upon completion of loading a flatfile generation program is manually initiated to generate a flatfile to be used in a mission operations environment by the core ground system...|$|R

We consider two models to find a reasonable restriction on the worst-case mobility. In the pedestrian model we assume a maximum speed vmax of the radio stations, while in the vehicular model we assume a maximum acceleration amax of the points. Our goal is to maintain persistent routes with nice communication network properties like hop-distance, energy-consumption, congestion and number of interferences. A route is persistent, if we can guarantee that all edges of this route can be uphold for a given time span ∆, which is a parameter denoting the minimum time the mobile network needs to adopt changes, i. e. update <b>routing</b> tables, change <b>directory</b> entries, etc. This ∆ {{can be used as}} the length of an update interval for a proactive routing scheme. We extend some known notions such as transmission range, interferences, spanner, power spanner and congestion to both mobility models and introduce a new parameter called crowdedness that states a lower bound on the number of radio interferences. Then we prove that a mobile spanner hosts a path system that polylogarithmically approximates the optimal congestion. We present distributed algorithms based on a grid clustering technique and a high-dimensional representation of the dynamical start situation which construct mobile spanners with low congestion, low interference number, low energy-consumption, and low degree. We measure the optimality of the output of our algorithm by comparing it with the optimal choice of persistent routes under the same circumstances with respect to pedestrian or vehicular worst-case movements. Finally, we present solutions for dynamic position information management under our mobility models. ∗ Institute of Computer Science, {schindel, talu...|$|R
