5|$|Unlike many archaeological finds, {{the human}} <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site {{were able to}} be dated with environmental, geological, and archaeological methods. Human <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site are the oldest {{that have been found}} in Washington, and at the time were the oldest set of remains found in North America. Later {{radiocarbon}} work has confirmed the original dating of this site, indicating that these human remains, albeit very fragmentary, are still some of the oldest ever excavated in the New World. This finding was useful in confirming the early chronology of the region and confirming the antiquity of the styles of associated bone tools.|$|E
5|$|Capture the Flag. This mode of {{game play}} {{is by far}} the most popular among Warhawk players. In this mode each team has a flag at their base which they must defend while {{attempting}} to capture the second flag in their opponent's base. You can only capture the flag if your flag <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base.|$|E
5|$|Clinical {{trials and}} studies in animal models (including C. elegans) suggest that {{ketogenic}} diets provide neuroprotective and disease-modifying benefits {{for a number}} of adult neurodegenerative disorders. As of 2012, there is limited clinical trial data in these areas, and, outside of paediatric epilepsy, use of the ketogenic diet <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> research stage.|$|E

Freedom to buy alcohol is restored and control of the FP is returned to the 248. JTRO and Stacy go to the pond together as ducks fly over them.|$|E
5|$|The {{estate was}} requisitioned by the War Ministry from 1940–1945 {{as a local}} command, training, and {{ordnance}} centre. Little <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> estate from World War II, except the hole created by a bomb dropped by the Luftwaffe. It was enlarged and is now used for swimming and canoeing.|$|E
5|$|This type of {{profile is}} common for dives at sites {{where there is a}} flat sea-bed or where the diver <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same place {{throughout}} the dive to work. It is the most demanding profile for decompression for a given maximum depth and time because inert gas absorption continues at maximum rate for most of the dive. Decompression tables are drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a square profile.|$|E

5|$|In Tarner Park, {{an area of}} {{open space}} formed from part of number 1 Tilbury Place's grounds, there is a {{circular}} tower which {{is believed to have}} been built by Edward Tilbury Tarner (son of the original occupants Edward and Laetitia Tarner) as an observation tower so he could see ships in the English Channel. The mid-19th-century structure has two storeys and about 70 steps; the upper level is recessed and has a walkway around it. The walls are of knapped flint with some brick and stonework. Part of an iron weather vane <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top. Both storeys have segmental-arched entrances, but these are now closed. The structure is in good condition but has some missing flints.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor of the home the rooms remain much the same as they were when Glidden lived in the house. An {{original}} multi-paneled wooden door <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> entry from the porch to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. The staircase is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E
5|$|The True Directions {{kids are}} {{encouraged}} to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), who take the campers to a local gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting homophobic abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.|$|E

5|$|The charred {{remains were}} {{found by the}} Soviets. By 11 May, Hitler's dentist, Hugo Blaschke, dental {{assistant}} Käthe Heusermann and dental technician Fritz Echtmann confirmed that the dental remains belonged to Hitler and Braun. The Soviets secretly buried the <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> SMERSH compound in Magdeburg, East Germany, along with the bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their six children. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team with detailed burial charts secretly exhumed five wooden boxes of remains. The remains were thoroughly burned and crushed, after which the ashes were thrown into the Biederitz river, {{a tributary of the}} nearby Elbe.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Cöln sank at 13:50 and was never raised for scrapping. Dresden also <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E

5|$|On January 1, 1953, {{as part of}} the 1953 {{state highway}} renumbering, State Highway Route 25-A was rechristened as Route 58. In 1954, the State Highway Department decided to find a state highway to include in the new Eisenhower Interstate System. Originally {{proposed}} to use the Route 3 alignment for Federal Aid Interstate Route 105, the upgrading of Route 3 for standards would be too great. After Route 3 was deemed unusable, they moved focus to short portion of Route 58 that was constructed. In 1958, the State Highway Department gave Route 58 its official new designation, Interstate 280, when construction began on an extended Essex Freeway. Although Interstate 280 was designated onto Route 58's alignment, the Route 58 designation persisted throughout maps and straight line diagrams until at least 1997, when the designation was removed. A short, unused concrete portion of Route 58 <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> northern end of Hecker Street, crossing over the New Jersey Transit tracks ending near Interstate 280.|$|E
5|$|Picking up {{immediately}} after , in which Link defeats Ganon who turns to stone and <b>remains</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of a}} now sealed away Hyrule, Link and Tetra travel over the flooded Hyrule called the Great Sea on board Tetra's pirate ship. Along the way, the pair discover the Ghost Ship and Tetra enters it; however, immediately after entering the Ghost Ship, she screams for help. While Link attempts to follow her, he slips and falls into the ocean. Washed ashore on an island, Link is awakened by Ciela, a fairy. Exploring the island, Link finds the Phantom Hourglass, filled with the Sands of Hours, and meets an old man named Oshus, who wants to help Link find the Ghost Ship and reunite with Tetra. To aid him in his quest, Link enlists the help of Captain Linebeck and his ship, the S.S. Linebeck, which Link, Ciela, and Linebeck use to visit islands across the Great Sea. While Linebeck was initially reluctant to team up with the two, Ciela makes mention of a huge treasure, prompting him to agree to help them.|$|E
