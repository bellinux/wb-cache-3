5000|$|Day was not {{the first}} to {{introduce}} the concept of <b>routing</b> <b>diagrams.</b> For example, James Bray Griffith in his 1905 book Systematizing already contained a section on [...] "Charting factory layout and routing" [...] which contained two simplified <b>routing</b> <b>diagrams</b> for handling lumber, that he called arrangements. Another contemporary, Oscar E. Perrigo, published on the design of machine shops in his Modern machine shop (1906), looking at machine shop lay out and arrangements of machinery. In contrast to this work, Day did take this design problem to a next level by putting the dynamic interaction first.|$|R

Public {{transport}} operators have realised that the Internet is currently the most powerful medium for the dissemination of up-to-date scheduling and timetabling information. Transportation information is now of vital interest in our daily lives. Journey planning systems are innovative uses of the WWW providing geospatial information about transportation with maps and schematic <b>routing</b> <b>diagrams</b> being used in these systems. Transportation maps are now amongst {{the most important and}} influential cartographic works in the world [Thrower]. A public transport journey planning system ptInfo [Mooney] has been developed to allow users to plan journeys on public transport systems. The system returns detailed journey itinerary specifications including interchange points. ptInfo uses digital maps as its principal means of journey specification and user interaction...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{this clear}} presentation, neither Charles Day nor anybody else is {{generally}} credited {{for making a}} seminal contribution to the <b>routing</b> <b>diagram</b> or route diagram. For example, {{in one of the}} first seminal works in the field, the 1923 book Industrial Management by Richard H. Lansburgh, there is a separate chapter [...] "Factory Building and Plant Lay out." [...] This chapter discussed the matter with the similar three types of views, and some more, without any reference to the work of Charles Day. Instead of perspective <b>routing</b> <b>diagram,</b> Lansburgh speaks of vertical layout, and the detail <b>routing</b> <b>diagram</b> is named a flow chart.|$|E

5000|$|Another feature Griffith {{demonstrated}} {{in his work}} Systematizing and later works is the charting of factory layout and routing. In Systematizing he gave one example in the third section about [...] "The Stock Department," [...] where as example he illustrated two arrangements, or <b>routing</b> <b>diagrams,</b> for handling lumber: Griffith explained, that {{the arrangement of the}} stock should be such that all unnecessary handling will be avoided. The references in Section Whether it be the store house of a country store or the supply room of an immense factory, the stock most often required should be placed where it can be readily removed, while that seldom called for may be stored in the more inaccessible corners. Where the concern is large enough to require several storage places, these storage places for the different classes of stock should be located with special reference to the departments in which the stock is used.|$|R
40|$|Developed {{during our}} recent six-month {{engagement}} at Dell-a leading computer manufacturer and services provider {{with one of}} the world's leading supply chains [...] we discuss a network flow-based mixed-integer linear program (MILP) model to identify the critical factors in optimizing reverse supply chain design decisions to optimize profit. The model is fast, intuitive, flexible, and robust to uncertainty. Its outputs include specific design recommendations, financial impact estimates, dynamically generated product <b>routing</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and multi-scenario sensitivity analysis. Through two case studies, the first in U. S. smartphone returns and the second in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Alienware-branded computer returns, we show how our model fosters standardized, robust strategic decision-making and serves as a platform upon which to build management systems for continuous improvement. We then discuss two such systems: a simulation-based reusable packaging cost-benefit analysis (CBA) calculator, and an automated dashboard for managing disassembly-for-parts decisions. by Timothy J.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to <b>routing</b> schematic <b>diagrams.</b> Heuristic global and local algorithms are presented which focus on congestion and crossover issues in the development of aesthetically-pleasing diagrams. Congestion is the basis for the global, and crossover for the local router. This algorithm can work on a completed schematic, but also can be applied to schematics that are incrementally developed. 1 Introduction Schematics are a widespread method of creating and documenting designs. With the increasing use of hardware description languages, {{there is a need to}} automatically-generate diagrams that represent these graphical representations of the design. The manual construction of a good schematic demands special skills, and is an error-prone process[SH 90], due to the difficulties in producing a schematic that is useful to the designer. In this same manner, the automatic generation of schematic diagrams has proven to be difficult. One of the uses of schematics as docume [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the problem on how to lay out practical graphs where nodes vary in shape and size. Applying classical graph drawing algorithms to practical graphs may result in overlapping nodes and/or edge-node intersections. This is because such algorithms were often originally designed for abstract graphs where nodes take up little or no space. To make use of such algorithms for practical graphs, we need some post-processes to adjust a layout by avoiding overlapping nodes and edge-node intersections. A technique for disjoint node images has been developed. We analyse several criteria and present a method for <b>routing</b> drawings in <b>diagram</b> displays. Our method has proved to be quite successfully in practice. 1...|$|R
