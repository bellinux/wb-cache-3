Here we show that a CRE mutation results in a significant reduction of adrenergically induced reactivationin vivoin the rabbit eye model. Spontaneous reactivation frequencies were also reduced. In addition, we demonstrate that this mutation {{has no effect on}} the amount of LAT expressed during latency when compared with the parent, 17 syn+, and the rescuant.

40|$|Neutrophils express {{different}} chemoattractant receptors {{of importance}} for guiding the cells from the blood stream to sites of inflammation. These receptors communicate with one another, a cross talk manifested as hierarchical, heterologous receptor desensitization. We describe a new receptor cross talk mechanism, by which desensitized formyl peptide receptors (FPRdes) can be reactivated. FPR desensitization is induced through binding of specific FPR agonists and is reached after {{a short period of}} active signaling. The mechanism that transfers the receptor to a non-signaling desensitized state is not known, and a signaling pathway has so far not been described, that transfers FPRdes back to an active signaling state. The <b>reactivation</b> <b>signal</b> was generated by PAF stimulation of its receptor (PAFR) and the cross talk was uni-directional. LatrunculinA, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, induced a similar reactivation of FPRdes as PAF while the phosphatase inhibitor CalyculinA inhibited reactivation, suggesting a role for the actin cytoskeleton in receptor desensitization and reactivation. The activated PAFR could, however, reactivate FPRdes also when the cytoskeleton was disrupted prior to activation. The receptor cross talk model presented prophesies that the contact on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane that blocks signaling between the G-protein and the FPR is not a point of no return; the receptor cross-talk from the PAFRs to the FPRdes initiates an actin-independent signaling pathway that turns desensitized receptors back t...|$|E

There {{are many}} {{unanswered}} {{questions in the}} B cell field, but one of paramount importance is how B cells are tolerized to avoid autoimmunity. The majority of developing B cells are probably self-reactive, and many that make it through B cell development to the periphery show evidence of receptor editing. The question remains {{as to how the}} B cells signal to re-induce the editing machinery, whether it is a positive <b>reactivation</b> <b>signal</b> or the release of an inhibitory tonic signal. We propose that it is the release of a tonic signal through the B cell receptor that inhibits recombination when the BCR is present on the surface, but when the BCR binds self-antigen it is internalized, the inhibitory signal is abrogated, and the recombination machinery is reactivated. We tested this hypothesis using several transgenic models, including RAG 2 -GFP mice, HEL Ig mice, and anti-κ mice. We also used several mice deficient in BCR signaling to test this hypothesis, and found that reduced BCR signaling induces more receptor editing. When we tested mice with excessive BCR signaling or pharmacologically mimicked the BCR signal, we found a decrease in receptor editing. These experiments provide compelling evidence for the inhibitory tonic signaling hypothesis and against the activation signaling hypothesis. Another question unanswered in the B cell field is how B cells are transformed into leukemia and lymphoma. There have been whole genome analysis studies to show that genes involved in the BCR signaling pathway are involved in many B cell malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Our studies in mice provide evidence that in combination with constitutive STAT 5 activation, a loss of genes involved in B cell development (ebf 1 and pax 5) or pre-BCR signaling (blnk, PKCβ, and btk) results in leukemia. These are genes that {{have been shown to be}} deleted in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also demonstrate an increase the phospho-STAT 5 levels in adult BCR-ABL + ALL patients.

Although the mechanisms governing reactivation from the latent state remain unknown, the regulated expression of the viral immediate early genes represents a critical point in this process. These genes are controlled by transcription enhancer complexes whose assembly requires and is coordinated by the cellular C 1 factor (host cell factor). In contrast to other tissues, the C 1 factor is not detected in the nuclei of sensory neurons. Experimental conditions that induce the reactivation of herpes simplex virus in mouse model systems result in rapid nuclear localization of the protein, indicating that the C 1 factor is sequestered in these cells until <b>reactivation</b> <b>signals</b> induce a redistribution of the protein.

40|$|Rivers may {{dramatically}} {{change course}} on a fluvial plain. Such an avulsion temporarily leads to two active channels connected at a bifurcation. Here we study {{the effect of}} dynamic meandering at the bifurcation {{and the effect of}} channel width adjustment to changing discharge in both downstream branches on the evolution of a bifurcation and coexisting channels. As an example, we reconstructed the last major avulsion at the Rhine delta apex. We combined historical and geological data to reconstruct a slowly developing avulsion process spanning 2000 years and involving channel width adjustment and meandering at the bifurcation. Based on earlier idealised models, we developed a onedimensional model for long-term morphodynamic prediction of upstream channel and bifurcates connected at the bifurcation node. The model predicts flow and sediment partitioning at the node, including the effect of migrating meanders at the bifurcation and channel width adjustment. Bifurcate channel width adaptation to changing discharge partitioning dramatically slows the pacing of bifurcation evolution because the sediment balance for width adjustment and bed evolution are coupled. The model further shows that meandering at the bifurcation modulates channel abandonment or enlargement periodically. This explains hitherto unrecognised <b>reactivation</b> <b>signals</b> in the sedimentary record of the studied bifurcation meander belts, newly identified in our geological reconstruction. Historical maps show that bifurcation migration due to meander bend dynamics increases the bifurcation angle, which increases the rate of closure of one bifurcate. The combination of model and reconstruction identifies the relevant timescales for bifurcation evolution and avulsion duration. These are the time required to fill one downstream channel over one backwater length, the time to translate one meander wavelength downstream and, for strong river banks, the adaptation timescale to adjust channel width. The findings have relevance for all avulsions where channel width can adjust to changing discharge and where meandering occurs...|$|R

In particular, PI 3 K blockade {{leads to the}} inhibition of AKT, a major downstream effector responsible for the oncogenic activity of PI 3 K. However, we report here that small molecule inhibitors of PI 3 K only transiently block AKT signaling. Indeed, treatment of cancer cells with PI 3 K inhibitors results in a rapid inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and signaling which {{is followed by the}} <b>reactivation</b> of AKT <b>signaling</b> after 48 h as observed by Western blot. <b>Reactivation</b> of AKT <b>signaling</b> occurs despite effective inhibition of PI 3 K activity by PI 3 K inhibitors.

In a therapeutical perspective, combining AKT and PI 3 K inhibitors exhibit stronger anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects compared to AKT or PI 3 K inhibitors alone. Similarly, in a tumor xenograft mouse model, concomitant PI 3 K and AKT blockade results in stronger anti-cancer activity compared with either blockade alone.

In this report, we applied whole-genome expression analyses to reveal that oncogenic B-RAF V 600 E regulates genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in normal cutaneous human melanocytes. Most prominent was the B-RAF-mediated transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, a keratinocyte-melanoma adhesion molecule whose loss is intimately associated with melanoma invasion and metastasis. Here we identify a link between oncogenic B-RAF, the transcriptional repressor Tbx 3, and E-cadherin. We show that B-RAF V 600 E induces the expression of Tbx 3, which potently represses E-cadherin expression in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Tbx 3 expression is normally restricted to developmental embryonic tissues and promoting cell motility, but it is also aberrantly increased in various cancers and has been linked to tumor cell invasion and metastasis.

To determine whether the signals are present in the developing testis as well as the ovary, we examined the expression of X-linked genes in germ cells from XXY male mice. To facilitate this analysis, we generated XXY and XX fetuses carrying X chromosomes that were differentially marked and subject to nonrandom inactivation. This pattern of nonrandom inactivation was maintained in somatic cells but, in XX as well as XXY fetuses, both parental alleles were expressed in germ cell-enriched cell populations. Because testis differentiation is temporally and morphologically normal in the XXY testis and because all germ cells embark upon a male pathway of development, these results provide compelling evidence that X chromosome reactivation in fetal germ cells is independent of the somatic events of sexual differentiation. Proper X chromosome dosage is essential for the normal fertility of male mammals, and abnormalities in germ cell development are apparent in the XXY testis within several days of X reactivation. Studies of exceptional germ cells that survive in the postnatal XXY testis demonstrated that surviving germ cells are exclusively XY and result from rare nondisjunctional events that give rise to clones of XY cells...|$|R

Under our conditions, GlnB was necessary for DraT activity in the presence of Mg-ADP. The PII effector 2 -oxoglutarate, in the presence of Mg-ATP, inhibited DraT-GlnB activity, possibly by inducing complex dissociation.

FXS is caused by loss of FMR 1 gene expression, resulting in the lack of the protein product, Fragile X protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein thought to regulate synaptic plasticity by controlling the localization and translation of specific mRNAs in neurons. To determine whether FMRP is also required in early brain development we examined the distribution of cell cycle markers in Drosophila FMR 1 (dFmr 1) mutant brains compared to wild-type brains. Our results indicate that the loss of dFmr 1 leads to a significant increase in the number of mitotic neuroblasts and BrdU incorporation in the brain, consistent with the notion that FMRP controls proliferation in neural stem cells. To determine the role of FMRP in neuroblast division and differentiation, we used Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Marker (MARCM) approaches in the developing larval brain and found that single dFmr 1 neuroblasts generate significantly more neurons than controls. Developmental studies suggest that FMRP also inhibits neuroblast exit from quiescence, or reactivation, in early larval brains, as indicated by misexpression of the G 1 to S phase transition marker Cyclin E. We have also identified a novel role for FMRP in the glia surrounding the neuroblasts, indicating that FMRP in these cells contributes to the regulation of neuroblast <b>reactivation</b> via <b>signaling</b> from the supporting glial cells.

The characteristics of haemodynamic shear forces, namely, steady laminar (∂τ/∂t =  0), pulsatile shear stress (PSS: unidirectional forward flow) and oscillatory shear stress (bidirectional with a near net 0 forward flow), modulate mechano-signal transduction to influence metabolic effects on vascular endothelial function. Atheroprotective PSS promotes antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic responses, whereas atherogenic oscillatory shear stress induces {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} oxidase–JNK signalling to increase mitochondrial superoxide production, protein degradation of manganese superoxide dismutase and post-translational protein modifications of LDL particles in the disturbed flow-exposed regions of vasculature.

Remarkably, outgrowths derived from dormant malignancy could be serially propagated in vivo and retained the potential to undergo lobuloalveolar differentiation in response to hormones of pregnancy. Matching somatic H-Ras mutations shared by antecedent tumors and descendant mammary ductal outgrowths confirmed their clonal relatedness. Thus, propagation of epithelium that possesses a latent malignant growth program reveals impressive regenerative and developmental potential, supporting the notion that dormant mammary cancers harbor transformed mammary progenitor cells. Our results define an experimental paradigm for elucidating biological properties of dormant malignancy...|$|R
40|$|Most mammals use {{changing}} annual day-length cycles {{to regulate}} pineal melatonin secretion and thereby drive many physiological rhythms including reproduction, metabolism, immune function, and pelage. Prolonged exposure to short winter day lengths results in refractoriness, a spontaneous reversion to long-day physiological status. Despite its {{critical role in}} the timing of seasonal rhythms, refractoriness remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was therefore to describe cellular and molecular mechanisms driving the seasonal secretion of a key hormone, prolactin, in refractory Syrian hamsters. We used recently developed single cell hybridization and reporter assays to show that this process is initiated by timed <b>reactivation</b> of endocrine <b>signaling</b> from the pars tuberalis (PT) region of the pituitary gland, a well-defined melatonin target site, causing renewed activation of prolactin gene expression. This timed signaling is independent of per 1 clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and PT and of melatonin secretion, which continue to track day length. Within the PT, there is also a continued short day-like profile of ICER expression, suggesting that the change in hormone secretion is independent of cAMP signaling. Our data thus identify the PT as a key anatomical structure involved in endogenous seasonal timing mechanisms, which breaks from prevailing day length-induced gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Activating {{transcription}} factor 4 (Atf 4) is a leucine-zipper-containing protein of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) family. Ablation of Atf 4 (Atf 4 −/−) in mice leads to severe skeletal defects, including delayed ossification and low bone mass, short stature and short limbs. Atf 4 {{is expressed in}} proliferative and prehypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes, suggesting an autonomous function of Atf 4 in chondrocytes during endochondral ossification. In Atf 4 −/− growth plate, the typical columnar structure of proliferative chondrocytes is disturbed. The proliferative zone is shortened, whereas the hypertrophic zone is transiently expanded. The expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is markedly decreased, whereas the expression of other chondrocyte marker genes, such as type II collagen (Col 2 a 1), PTH/PTHrP receptor (Pth 1 r) and type X collagen (Col 10 a 1), is normal. Furthermore, forced expression of Atf 4 in chondrocytes induces endogenous Ihh mRNA, and Atf 4 directly binds to the Ihh promoter and activates its transcription. Supporting these findings, <b>reactivation</b> of Hh <b>signaling</b> pharmacologically in mouse limb explants corrects the Atf 4 −/− chondrocyte proliferation and short limb phenotypes. This study thus identifies Atf 4 as a novel transcriptional activator of Ihh in chondrocytes that paces longitudinal bone growth by controlling growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Objective To analyse the {{function}} of nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase (NPP 1), {{a member of the}} pyrophosphate pathway, in osteoarthritis (OA). Methods mRNA expression of NPP 1, ANK ankylosing protein and tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase was assessed by quantitative PCR. NPP 1 protein levels were analysed in mouse and human cartilage samples. Bone metabolism was analysed by F 18 -positron emission tomography-scanning and µCT in ttw/ttw mice. Ttw/ttw mice are mice carrying a loss-of-function mutation in NPP 1. Calcification of articular cartilage was assessed using von Kossa staining and OA severity using the Mankin score. Cartilage remodelling was investigated by type X collagen immunohistochemistry. Results Expression of NPP 1, but not the other members of this pathway, inversely correlated with cartilage calcification and OA severity in mouse and humans. Proinflammatory cytokines downregulated the expression of NPP 1, demonstrating an influence of inflammation on matrix calcification. Ttw/ttw mutant mice, carrying a loss-of-function mutation in NPP 1, exhibit increased bone formation process in joints compared with wild types. Ttw/ttw mice also developed spontaneous OA-like changes, evaluated by histological analysis and in vivo imaging. Ectopic calcifications were associated with increased expression of collagen X in the cartilage. Conclusion The authors conclude that OA is characterised by the <b>reactivation</b> of molecular <b>signalling</b> cascades involving proinflammatory cytokines, thereby regulating the pyrophosphate pathway which consequently leads to cartilage ossification, at least in part resembling endochondral ossification...|$|R
40|$|Oncogenic {{transformation}} {{depends on}} the activation of membrane-associated NADPH oxidase. The resultant extracellular superoxide anions control the proliferation of malignant cells, but they also drive two intercellular signaling pathways that cause selective apoptosis induction in malignant cells, i. e. the HOCl and the NO/peroxynitrite pathway. Tumor progression requires the establishment of resistance against these apoptosis-inducing pathways through expression of membrane-associated catalase that interferes with HOCl signaling through decomposition of H 2 O 2 and with NO/peroxynitrite through oxidation of NO and decomposition of peroxynitrite. Aims: We aimed to establish the biochemical basis for novel therapeutic approaches that target tumor cell protective catalase and thus cause reactivation of intercellular reactive oxygen/nitrogen species-dependent apoptotic signaling of tumor cells. Methods: We used cells from defined stages of multistep oncogenesis, i. e. nontransformed, transformed and bona vide tumor cells. Intercellular apoptosis-inducing ROS/RNS signaling was studied using defined inhibitors/scavengers, reconstitution experiments and small interfering RNA directed against relevant targets. Results: Direct inhibition of tumor cell catalase by neutralizing antibodies or its direct inactivation by extracellular singlet oxygen caused efficient <b>reactivation</b> of apoptosis-inducing <b>signaling.</b> Interestingly, the increase in cell-derived NO through addition of arginine, inhibition of arginase, inhibition of NO dioxygenase or induction of NO synthase by interferon led to the generation of extracellular singlet oxygen that triggered a complex self-amplificatory system. As a result, high concentrations of cell-derived singlet oxygen inactivated catalase and reactivated apoptosis inducing intercellular signaling. Conclusions: Modulation of the cellular NO concentration causes extracellular singlet oxygen generation and inactivation of tumor cell protective catalase...|$|R
40|$|Background: Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease, characterized by distorted lung architecture {{and loss of}} respiratory function. Alveolar epithelial cell injury and hyperplasia, enhanced extracellular matrix deposition, and (myo) fibroblast activation are features of IPF. Wnt/b-catenin signaling {{has been shown to}} determine epithelial cell fate during development. As aberrant <b>reactivation</b> of developmental <b>signaling</b> pathways has been suggested to contribute to IPF pathogenesis, we hypothesized that Wnt/b-catenin signaling is activated in epithelial cells in IPF. Thus, we quantified and localized the expression and activity of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway in IPF. Methodology/Principal Findings: The expression of Wnt 1, 3 a, 7 b, and 10 b, the Wnt receptors Fzd 1 - 4, Lrp 5 - 6, as well as the intracellular signal transducers Gsk- 3 b, b-catenin, Tcf 1, 3, 4, and Lef 1 was analyzed in IPF and transplant donor lungs by quantitative real-time (q) RT-PCR. Wnt 1, 7 b and 10 b, Fzd 2 and 3, b-catenin, and Lef 1 expression was significantly increased in IPF. Immunohistochemical analysis localized Wnt 1, Wnt 3 a, b-catenin, and Gsk- 3 b expression largely to alveolar and bronchial epithelium. This was confirmed by qRT-PCR of primary alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells, demonstrating a significant increase of Wnt signaling in ATII cells derived from IPF patients. In addition, Western blot analysis of phospho-Gsk- 3 b, phospho-Lrp 6, and b-catenin, and qRT-PCR of the Wnt target genes cyclin D 1, Mmp 7, or Fibronectin 1 demonstrated increased functional Wnt/b-catenin signaling in IPF compared with controls.
