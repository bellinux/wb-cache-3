5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that <b>risk-taking</b> by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood {{with the group}} of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, <b>risk-taking</b> men {{included}} his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually {{many of the young}} men in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.|$|E
5|$|Tulip mania {{reached its}} peak {{during the winter of}} 1636â€“37, when some bulbs were {{reportedly}} changing hands ten times in a day. No deliveries were ever made to fulfil any of these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of tulips ground to a halt. The collapse began in Haarlem, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused to show up at a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then at the height of an outbreak of bubonic plague. While the existence of the plague may have helped create a culture of fatalistic <b>risk-taking</b> that allowed the speculation to skyrocket in the first place, this outbreak might also have helped to burst the bubble.|$|E

25|$|Dopamine is {{associated}} with pleasure and attuning to the environment during decision-making. During adolescence, dopamine levels in the limbic system increase and input of dopamine to the prefrontal cortex increases. The balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitters and increased dopamine activity in adolescence may have implications for adolescent <b>risk-taking</b> and vulnerability to boredom (see Cognitive development below).|$|E
25|$|Cuttell {{was a slow}} right-arm bowler who {{possessed the}} unusual ability to turn the ball from leg without {{throwing}} it up enough to encourage <b>risk-taking</b> batsmen to attack him. He was very accurate in length and also possessed the characteristic break-back of most bowlers of his time, which made him as unplayable as any bowler when the pitch helped him.|$|E
25|$|Most tobacco smokers begin during {{adolescence}} or early adulthood. Smoking has elements of <b>risk-taking</b> and rebellion, which often appeal to young people. The presence of high-status models and peers may also encourage smoking. Because teenagers are influenced more {{by their peers}} than by adults, attempts by parents, schools, and health professionals at preventing people from trying cigarettes are not always successful.|$|E
25|$|In recent times, {{humans have}} become {{increasingly}} mobile {{as a consequence of}} improved technology, domestication, environmental change, strong curiosity, and <b>risk-taking.</b> Migrations over the last 4000 years, and especially the last 400 years, have been the fastest in human history and have led to many people settling in places far away from their ancestral homelands. This means that skin colors today are not as confined to geographical location as they were previously.|$|E

Heroic <b>risk-taking</b> has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.|$|E
25|$|Most smokers begin smoking during {{adolescence}} or early adulthood. Some studies {{also show that}} smoking can also be linked to various mental health complications. Smoking has elements of <b>risk-taking</b> and rebellion, which often appeal to young people.

Because teenagers are influenced more by their peers than by adults, attempts by parents, schools, and health professionals at preventing people from trying cigarettes are often unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Vadilal Industries {{has come}} a long way since its {{inception}} in 1926, when Vadilal Gandhi started a soda fountain in 1926. He passed on the business to his son, Ranchod Lal, who ran a one-man operation. Eventually, Ranchod Lal's sons, Ramchandra and Lakshman, inherited the business and they were instrumental in giving a new direction to the company. The duo imparted a new vision to the venture and infused a spirit of calculated <b>risk-taking</b> into the firm. As a result, by the 1970s, the Vadilal Company had already evolved into a modern corporate entity.|$|E
25|$|According to Dr. Chris Ford, former {{clinical}} {{director of}} Substance Misuse Management in General Practice, among drugs of abuse, benzodiazepines are {{often seen as}} the 'bad guys' by drug and alcohol workers. Illicit users of benzodiazepines {{have been found to}} take higher methadone doses, as well as showing more HIV/HCV <b>risk-taking</b> behavior, greater poly-drug use, higher levels of psychopathology and social dysfunction. However, there is only limited research into the adverse effects of benzodiazepines in drug misusers and {{further research is needed to}} demonstrate whether this is the result of cause or effect.|$|E
25|$|Early in the AIDS crisis, {{widespread}} use of poppers among AIDS patients led to the later disproved hypothesis that poppers contributed {{to the development of}} Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare form of cancer, which occurs in AIDS patients. Modest, short-term reductions in immune function were observed in animal studies, but direct support for a role of nitrites in development of AIDS-associated diseases has not found broad agreement. A study examining {{men who have sex with}} men, and who also take recreational drugs, suggested poppers, when used in a pattern of recreational drug taking could be associated with increase in sexual <b>risk-taking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Latent T. gondii {{infection}} in humans {{has been associated}} with a higher incidence of automobile accidents, potentially due to impaired psychomotor performance or enhanced <b>risk-taking</b> personality profiles. Moreover, correlations have been found between positive antibody titers to T. gondii and OCD, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, suicide in people with mood disorders, and bipolar disorder. Positive antibody titers to T. gondii {{have been shown to be}} not correlative with major depression or dysthymia. Although there is a correlation between T. gondii infection and many psychological disorders, scientists are still trying to find the cause on a cellular level.|$|E
25|$|Related {{to their}} {{increased}} tendency for <b>risk-taking,</b> adolescents show impaired behavioral inhibition, including deficits in extinction learning. This {{has important implications}} for engaging in risky behavior such as unsafe sex or illicit drug use, as adolescents are less likely to inhibit actions that may have negative outcomes in the future. This phenomenon also has consequences for behavioral treatments based on the principle of extinction, such as cue exposure therapy for anxiety or drug addiction. It has been suggested that impaired inhibition, specifically extinction, may help to explain adolescent propensity to relapse to drug-seeking even following behavioral treatment for addiction.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} excesses {{in the banking}} sector that precipitated the crisis, Obama signed the 2010 Doddâ€“Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This law limited bank <b>risk-taking</b> and {{overhauled}} the outdated regulatory regime that was ineffective in monitoring the non-depository or shadow banking sector {{at the core of}} the crisis, which had outgrown the traditional depository banking sector. It also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. However, it did not breakup the largest banks (which had grown even larger due to forced mergers during the crisis) or separate investment and depository banking, as the Glass-Steagal Act had done. Only a few Republicans in Congress voted for the law.|$|E
25|$|The {{anxiety of}} {{heterosexual}} individuals (particularly adolescents whose construction of heterosexual masculinity {{is based in}} part on not being seen as gay) that others may identify them as gay has also been identified by Michael Kimmel as an example of homophobia. The taunting of boys seen as eccentric (and who are not usually gay) is said to be endemic in rural and suburban American schools, and has been associated with <b>risk-taking</b> behavior and outbursts of violence (such as a spate of school shootings) by boys seeking revenge or trying to assert their masculinity. Homophobic bullying is also very common in schools in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} {{marked the}} beginning of an era in which the Supreme Court gave closer scrutiny to criminal justice cases and reviewed state actions against the Due Process Clause and the Bill of Rights. A decade later, the Supreme Court reviewed the case of the Scottsboro boys. The victory for the Elaine defendants gave the NAACP greater credibility as the champion of African Americans' rights. Walter F. White's <b>risk-taking</b> investigation and report contributed to his advancing in the organization. He later was selected as executive secretary of the NAACP, essentially the chief operating officer, and served in this position for decades, leading the organization in additional legal challenges and civil rights activism.|$|E
25|$|Competitors race either {{individually}} or in {{teams in the}} manner of a relay race. If the egg falls from the spoon then competitors may be required to stop, retrieve, and reposition their egg; or to start again; or may even be disqualified. Due to the lesser penalty imposed for dropping the egg, and consequent encouragement of greater <b>risk-taking,</b> the first penalty scenario may result in a race that is faster overall. Common methods of cheating include sticking the egg to the spoon, or holding onto the egg with one finger. For an extra challenge, contestants might carry the spoon with both hands, with their teeth, or have their hands tied behind their backs.|$|E
25|$|Note that Game Value is {{dependent}} {{not only on}} the cards held (including the Skat) but also on which game is being declared and the outcome of the play. Each holding can thus be evaluated differently by different players. A <b>risk-taking</b> player might be willing to declare Hand on a holding on which another player might not â€” these two players will therefore give different valuations to the same holding. However, after all tricks have been played, it is always possible to determine the exact Game Value by combining the actual holding with the type of game and outcome of the play. Only then it becomes apparent if declarer has won or lost (if he overbid).|$|E
25|$|Research on beer-commercial content by Lance Strate yielded results {{relevant}} to a study of masculinity. In beer commercials, masculine behavior (especially <b>risk-taking)</b> is encouraged. Commercials often focus on situations in which a man overcomes an obstacle in a group, working or playing hard (construction or farm workers or cowboys). Those involving play have central themes of mastery (of nature or each other), risk and adventure: fishing, camping, playing sports or socializing in bars. There is usually an element of danger and a focus on movement and speed (watching fast cars or driving fast). The bar is a setting for the measurement of masculinity in skills such as billiards, strength, and drinking ability.|$|E
25|$|The balloon {{analogue}} risk task (BART) {{was designed}} to assess <b>risk-taking</b> behavior. Subjects are presented with a computer depiction of a balloon that can be incrementally inflated by pressing a response key. As the balloon inflates, the subject accumulates rewards with each new key-press. The balloon is programmed with a constant probability of popping. If the balloon pops, all rewards for that balloon are lost, or the subject may choose to stop inflating and 'bank' the reward for that balloon at any time. Therefore, more key-presses equate to greater reward, but also greater probability of popping and cancelling rewards for that trial. The BART assumes that those with an affinity for 'risk-taking' {{are more likely to}} pop the balloon, earning less reward overall than the typical population.|$|E

25|$|Fed chair Ben Bernanke {{explained}} in 2010 that vulnerabilities {{in the global}} financial system built up {{over a long period}} of time, and then specific triggering events set the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis into motion. For example, vulnerabilities included failure to regulate the <b>risk-taking</b> of the non-depository banking sector, the so-called shadow banks such as investment banks and mortgage companies. These companies had outgrown the regulated depository banking sector, but did not have the same safeguards. Further, financial connections were established between the depository banks and shadow banks (e.g., via securitization and special purpose entities) that created dependencies that were not well understood by regulators. Certain types of derivatives, essentially bets on the performance of other securities, remained largely unregulated and were another opaque source of dependencies.|$|E
25|$|Techno-liberals {{look for}} change. By their nature, they're not {{satisfied}} with the way things are and want {{to find new ways to}} do things. Liberals in technology arena move a society forward as the opportunists. Technoliberalism is actually more about civil liberties and individual rights such as Free Internet, Net neutrality for landline Internet not for mobile or satellites, gun control and Pro abortion, etc. Techno-liberalism represents socio-cultural perspectives that imply all human endeavors. This includes how we develop and use technology, especially computer technology. In the technology arena, liberalism normally points to innovation and <b>risk-taking.</b> Furthermore, if you're a techno-liberal in information technology, the future can't come soon enough. For those who see the true promise of the web for multi-media and as a general platform for application software, the Internet is still far too slow and primitive.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the short}} term the fiasco led Bill Cosby to end his {{advertising}} for Coke, saying his commercials that praised the superiority of the new formula had hurt his credibility, no one at Coca-Cola was fired or otherwise held responsible for what is still widely perceived as a misstep, {{for the simple reason that}} it ultimately wasn't. When Goizueta died in 1997, the company's share price was at a level well above what it was when he had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time Roger Enrico, then head of Pepsi's American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel. Later, when he became PepsiCo's CEO, he modified his assessment of the situation, saying that had people been fired or demoted over New Coke, it would have sent a message that <b>risk-taking</b> was strongly discouraged at the company.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli economy {{withstood}} the late-2000s recession, registering positive GDP {{growth in}} 2009 and ending the decade with an unemployment rate {{lower than that}} of many western countries. There are several reasons behind this economic resilience, for example, the fact, as stated above, that the country is a net lender rather than a borrower nation and the government and the Bank of Israel's generally conservative macro-economic policies. Two policies in particular can be cited, one is the refusal of the government to succumb to pressure by the banks to appropriate large sums of public money to aid them early in the crisis, thus limiting their risky behavior. The second is the implementation of the recommendations of the Bach'ar commission in the early to mid-2000s which recommended decoupling the banks' depository and investment banking activities, contrary to the then-opposite trend, particularly in the United States, of easing such restrictions which had the effect of encouraging more <b>risk-taking</b> in the financial systems of those countries.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine abuse {{increases}} <b>risk-taking</b> {{behaviors such}} as unprotected sex and sharing of needles amongst intravenous abusers of benzodiazepines. Abuse is also associated with blackouts, memory loss, aggression, violence, and chaotic behavior associated with paranoia. There is little support for long-term maintenance of benzodiazepine abusers and thus a withdrawal regime is indicated when benzodiazepine abuse becomes a dependence. The main source of illicit benzodiazepines are diverted benzodiazepines obtained originally on prescription; other sources include thefts from pharmacies and pharmaceutical warehouses. Benzodiazepine abuse is steadily increasing {{and is now a}} major public health problem. Benzodiazepine abuse is mostly limited to individuals who abuse other drugs, i.e. poly-drug abusers. Most prescribed users do not abuse their medication, however, some high dose prescribed users do become involved with the illicit drug scene. Abuse of benzodiazepines occurs in a wide age range of people and includes teenagers and the old. The abuse potential or drug-liking effects appears to be dose related, with low doses of benzodiazepines having limited drug liking effects but higher doses increasing the abuse potential/drug-liking properties.|$|E
25|$|Trauma is {{the sixth}} {{leading cause of}} death worldwide, {{resulting}} in five million or 10% of all deaths annually. It is the fifth leading cause of significant disability. About half of trauma deaths are in people aged between 15 and 45 years and trauma is the {{leading cause of death}} in this age group. Injury affects more males; 68% of injuries occur in males and death from trauma is twice as common in males as it is in females, this is believed to be because males are much more willing to engage in <b>risk-taking</b> activities. Teenagers and young adults are more likely to need hospitalization from injuries than other age groups. While elderly persons are less likely to be injured, they are more likely to die from injuries sustained due to various physiological differences that make it more difficult for the body to compensate for the injuries. The primary causes of traumatic death are central nervous system injuries and substantial blood loss. Various classification scales exist for use with trauma to determine the severity of injuries, which are used to determine the resources used and, for statistical collection.|$|E
25|$|Berger's media project, Revolution of the Eye: Modern Art and the Birth of American Television, {{organized}} for the Jewish Museum, New York, and the Center for Art, Design, and Visual Culture, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, {{is the first}} exhibition to explore how avant-garde art influenced and shaped the look and content of network television in its formative years, from the late-1940s to the mid-1970s. During this period, the pioneers of American televisionâ€”many of them young, Jewish, and aesthetically adventurousâ€”had adopted modernism {{as a source of}} inspiration. Revolution of the Eye looks at how the dynamic new medium, in its <b>risk-taking</b> and aesthetic experimentation, paralleled and embraced cutting-edge art and design. It examines televisionâ€™s promotion of avant-garde ideals and aesthetics; its facility as a promotional platform for modern artists, designers, and critics; its role as a committed patron of the work of modern artists and designers; and as a medium whose relevance in contemporary culture was validated by the Museum of Modern Artâ€™s historic Television Project (1952-55). In addition to the Jewish Museum and CADVC, the exhibition traveled to the NSU Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale and the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, MA.|$|E
