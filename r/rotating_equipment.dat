40|$|Abstract. The paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to detect the fault of bearing based on wavelet grey moment vector and hidden Markov modeling (HMM). Because of non-stationary characteristics of vibration signals of faulty bearings, we propose a new method to extract the wavelet grey moment vectors from these signals. The grey moment vectors are used as feature parameters to train HMMs to establish the database. Fault modes of bearings can be identified by select the HMM with the highest probability. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and accurate to detect the faulty bearing for every single fault.

40|$|Many {{production}} machines {{have high}} energy consumption {{due to the}} large number of electrical motors used to <b>rotate</b> <b>equipment,</b> such as tools, fans and pumps. Moreover, in different industrial sectors production is not continuous but intermittent, where working times alternate with idle times. During idle times continuous switch off is not always possible due to technical limitations, and if it is possible, it can cause higher energy consumption due to peak current at the start-up of the electrical motors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce the possibility of managing intermittent production using inverter technology. The inverter provides power control by managing the frequency and voltage of the power supplied to the alternating current motors. The study analyses the potential energy consumption reduction as a function of the production parameters (number of daily stops, average working time, etc.) and develops a feasibility analysis, its related investment cost and its potential energy consumption reduction. As a result, the proposed feasibility study defines the set of production parameters and the types of equipment for which this technology is suitable, bringing rapid investment payback.

In {{order to}} improve {{accuracy}} of measuring motor speed in precision motor control systems, a method of precise measurement of speed with CPLD is proposed, which measures the truncated parts of the measured pulse {{on the basis of}} measuring raster count pulse within the equal period, and takes them as compensation, thus improving accuracy of measuring the raster pulse. In this paper, a speed measuring formula is given. Measuring system is provided with parallel and serial communication interfaces for output of measurement results. Foreword Precision <b>rotating</b> <b>equipments</b> such as high-accuracy CNC machine and precision centrifuge require very high precision and stability of motor speed, and they control speed with high precision through closed-loop system, therefore, the results of precision measurement of speed shall be input as feedback on closed-loop control. A very high precision of measurement can be achieved by high-precision speed detection of raster encoder and increasing number of raster rules in the encoder. The encoder converts the variable angular signals or displacement signals into electric signals that will undergo periodic variation. After amplification, regeneration and counting of the electric signals or F/V conversion, such signals can be used for calculation of speed. In the actua...|$|R
