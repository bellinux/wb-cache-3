50|$|Again in 1956 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Oldsmobile 98 series had an {{exclusive}} 126.0 in wheelbase, 4.0 in longer than the 88. Power came from the 240 horsepower Rocket V8 shared with the Super 88.

5000|$|The 1993 Cobra R was {{the first}} of three Cobra R models produced, and it was an {{extremely}} exclusive vehicle. As the [...] "R" [...] designation in its name stood for [...] "Race", the car did not have a radio, speakers, wiring and antenna, air conditioner, foglights, sound deadener, rear seat, rear safety belts, <b>rear</b> <b>carpeting,</b> and roll-up cargo cover, among other items. There were no power options; the car had power steering, roll-up windows, manual door locks, and manual-adjustable mirrors. Also, manually-adjustable Opal Gray cloth bucket seats from the Mustang LX were lighter than the GT/Cobra sport seats, and a piece of thin gray carpeting secured by Velcro covered the bare hatch and rear seat area. The deletion of all this equipment shed some 450 pounds, but it was somewhat offset by the necessary addition of heavy-duty hardware to enable the car to handle the rigors of competition.|$|R
50|$|In {{line with}} the first-generation Escort, the EXP was {{produced}} in a version from 1982 to 1985, undergoing a facelift during the 1985 model year. The model was dropped after the 1988 model year. Although not intended to replace the EXP (as it was originally designed to become the 1989 Ford Mustang), the 1989 Ford Probe would become the next front-wheel drive sports coupe sold by Ford. After the EXP, the next two-seat Ford marketed in North America would be the 2002 Ford Thunderbird. Then in 1998 the Escort of the time was marketed as a ZX2, to help reel in consumers that favored the XR2 and the EXP from the 1980s. Although it was a sports car, it was common to remove the <b>rear</b> <b>carpeting</b> to put in rear seats as the floor pans are identical between the 3-door Escorts, Escort GTs, and EXPs, however the lower roof line makes rear seating uncomfortable.|$|R
50|$|Executive Pack {{option is}} added to XJL Portfolio model, which {{includes}} provision of fold-down laptop trays and an electric <b>rear</b> sunblind, upgraded <b>carpeting,</b> combination wood and leather steering wheel, gloss wood veneer choices and chrome mirror housings.|$|R

5000|$|The Limited model, {{previously}} the [...] "top-of-the-line" [...] {{model of}} the first-generation, or previous-generation, 200, {{will serve as the}} volume seller. It adds a power front driver's seat, the Uconnect 5.0 AM/FM stereo with six speakers, Stereo Bluetooth, USB and auxiliary audio input jacks, a touch-screen, voice recognition, Uconnect hands-free Bluetooth telephone system with wireless A2DP stereo audio streaming capabilities, and more, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, a temporary spare tire with steel spare wheel, front and <b>rear</b> <b>carpeted</b> floor mats, power rear trunk release, more chrome exterior accents, upgrade interior trim, and more. A [...] "Spring Special Edition" [...] adds the Uconnect Access 8.4A infotainment system, eighteen-inch alloy wheels, dual power front bucket seats, dual heated front bucket seats, and SIRIUS-XM Satellite Radio. The 3.6 L V6 engine producing 295 HP (299 PS) and all-wheel-drive are also available on the Limited model, starting in late 2015. For the 2017 model year, the Limited has been replaced with the Limited Platinum, which is essentially the same vehicle as the Limited, but with a greater level of standard equipment: leather-trimmed seating surfaces and the UConnect 8.4A infotainment system come as standard equipment, for example. The Limited Platinum replaced the Limited in midyear 2016 (2016.5).|$|R

The latter {{featured}} a five-speed manual transmission, partial cloth seats, <b>carpet,</b> <b>rear</b> window defroster, intermittent wipers, and a cigarette lighter. The 1500 GL added radial tires, a rear window wiper/washer, tachometer, clock, and body side moldings. The Civic wagon {{came in a}} single version that {{was similar to the}} DX trim level. The rather underpowered 1300 was not available in California and in some mountainous areas. While still a CVCC design, the stratified charge design was muted and emissions control was assisted by a small two-way catalyst.|$|R

50|$|The main {{external}} {{change to}} the 1948 Super from its 1947 counterpart was the Super script on each front fender. Other series identification continued to be earned on the bumper guard crossbar.
