5|$|Rules are {{generally}} legal instruments such as <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> that regulate judicial or other procedure.|$|E
5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E
5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public body from doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|E

5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court.</b> In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for {{an order for}} review of detention differs from that for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court.</b> An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E
5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court.</b> The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of prerogative order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E

In other words, could it be said of the employee of a business that his [...] "place of business" [...] was the place of that business? The court held that it could not.

25|$|The {{procedure}} for bringing applications for prerogative orders is {{set out in}} Order53 of the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> ("O. 53"). It is a two-stage process.

Within a few short years he was able to secure complete control of the court, and eventually receive the submission of the Pungyang Jos while successfully disposing of the last of the Andong Kims, whose corruption, he believed, was responsible for ruining the country.|$|E

500|$|The Court {{preferred}} the position taken in Gouriet {{rather than the}} more flexible approach taken in Re S (Hospital Patient: Court's Jurisdiction) (1995) where, {{so long as there}} existed a [...] "real and present dispute between the parties as to the existence or extent of a legal right" [...] and each of the parties to the litigation [...] "would be affected by the determination of the issue", it was not necessary for the legal right to be vested in the parties. One of the reasons it came to this conclusion was that Re S is regarded by some scholars as more consistent with rule 40.20 of the Civil Procedure Rules, which states: [...] "The court may make binding declarations whether or not any other remedy is claimed." [...] On the other hand, the relevant Singaporean provision is Order 15, rule 16, of the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court,</b> which reads: [...] "No action or other proceedings shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed." [...] Hence, the Court concluded that its jurisdiction to make declarations is [...] "confined to declaring contested legal rights of the parties represented in the litigation".|$|E
