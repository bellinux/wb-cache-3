40|$|AbstractTenuazonic acid (TeA) is {{a natural}} {{phytotoxin}} produced by Alternaria alternata, the causal agent of <b>brown</b> <b>leaf</b> spot <b>disease</b> of Eupatorium adenophorum. Results from chlorophyll fluorescence revealed TeA can block electron flow from QA to QB at photosystem II acceptor side. Based on studies with D 1 -mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the No. 256 amino acid {{plays a key role}} in TeA binding to the QB-niche. The results of competitive replacement with [14 C]atrazine combined with JIP-test and D 1 -mutant showed that TeA should be considered as a new type of photosystem II inhibitor because it has a different binding behavior within QB-niche from other known photosystem II inhibitors. Bioassay of TeA and its analogues indicated 3 -acyl- 5 -alkyltetramic and even tetramic acid compounds may represent a new structural framework for photosynthetic inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|Because {{the corn}} vein and noise {{influence}} the contour extraction of the maize <b>leaf</b> <b>disease,</b> we {{put forward a}} new recognition algorithm based on Curvelet and Shape Context (SC).

Secondly, Curvelet Modulus Correlation (CMC) method is put forward to extract the effective contour of maize <b>leaf</b> <b>disease.</b> Thirdly, we combine CMC with the SC algorithm to obtain the histogram features and then use these features we obtain to calculate {{the similarities between the}} template image and the target image. Finally, we adopt n-fold cross-validation algorithm to recognize <b>diseases</b> on maize <b>leaf</b> <b>disease</b> database.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the polyphenol compounds (phenolic and flavonoid compounds), antioxidant activity [1, 1 -diphenylpicryl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity] and DNA damage inhibitory effect of fermented local <b>red</b> <b>brown</b> rice. Methods: DNA nicking assay {{was employed to}} {{determine the}} antioxidant activity of the fermented rice extract. Phytochemical screening was completed using standard methods and DPPH radical assays were used to confirm the antioxidant properties of the extracts. Results: After four days of fermentation, fermented <b>red</b> <b>brown</b> rice had more polyphenol compounds compared to unfermented counterpart. Fermented <b>red</b> <b>brown</b> rice showed greater antioxidant properties with EC 50 value of DPPH radical scavenging of 43. 00 mg extract/mL or 8 mg quercetin equivalent antioxidant activity. In addition, fermented rice extract showed DNA damage inhibitory effect to a certain extent. It protected DNA from reactive oxygen species; however, at high concentration it might induce reductive damage to DNA, whereas, unfermented <b>red</b> <b>brown</b> rice showed weak DNA damage inhibitory effect. Conclusions: Fermented <b>red</b> <b>brown</b> rice could protect DNA from oxidative damage but might induce reductive damage to DNA at high concentrations...|$|R
