If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground <b>ring)</b> <b>conductor,</b> cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground).

5000|$|In an idle circuit, {{the central}} office {{supplies}} -48V (nominally) on the <b>ring</b> <b>conductor</b> {{with respect to the}} tip side. A ground start PBX initiates an outgoing trunk seizure on an idle circuit by connecting of the ring lead to ground (maximum local resistance of 550 ohms). The central office senses this condition and grounds the tip lead. When the PBX senses this, it goes off-hook, then removes the ground on ring. The central office sends dial tone {{and the rest of the}} call proceeds normally.|$|E
50|$|Tip {{and ring}} are {{the names of}} the two {{conductors}} or sides of a telephone line. The terms originate in reference to the telephone plugs used for connecting telephone calls in manual switchboards. One side of the line is connected to the metal tip of the plug, and the second is connected to a metal ring behind the tip, separated and insulated from the tip by a non-conducting material. When inserted into a jack, the plug's tip conductor connects first, followed by the <b>ring</b> <b>conductor.</b> In many European countries tip and ring are referred to as the A and B wires.|$|E

This can result in a contact in the socket bridging (shorting) the ring and sleeve contacts on a phone connector, or where a phone plug is inserted into a two-conductor TS socket in some cases the intended 'sleeve' contact in the socket making contact with only the 'ring' portion of the plug.|$|E

Since any load on a ring is fed by the <b>ring</b> <b>conductors</b> {{on either side of}} it, it is desirable to avoid a concentrated load placed very near the feed, since the shorter conductors will have less impedance and carry a disproportionate share of the load.|$|R

50|$|Copper {{is vital}} to the {{electrical}} grounding system for wind turbine farms. Turbine masts attract lightning strikes, so they require lightning protection systems. When lightning strikes a turbine blade, current passes along the blade, through the blade hub in the nacelle (gearbox/ generator enclosure) and down the mast to a grounding system. The blade incorporates a large cross-section copper conductor that runs along its length and allows current to pass along the blade without deleterious heating effects. The nacelle is protected by a lightning conductor, often copper. The grounding system, {{at the base of the}} mast, consists of a thick copper <b>ring</b> <b>conductor</b> bonded to the base or located within a meter of the base. The ring is attached to two diametrically opposed points on the mast base. Copper leads extend outward from the ring and connect to copper grounding electrodes. The grounding rings at turbines on wind farms are inter-connected, providing a networked system with an extremely small aggregate resistance.|$|E
50|$|When the {{telephone}} is on-hook, {{the potential of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>conductor</b> of the local loop is held at a nominal level of -48V DC with respect to the tip conductor, provided by {{the telephone}} exchange or a foreign exchange station (FXS) interface. When the terminal initiates use of the line, it causes current to flow by closing the loop, and this signals the exchange to provide dial tone on the line and to expect dial signals, in form of DTMF digits or dial pulses, or a hook flash. When the loop is opened and current stops flowing for a certain period of time, the subscriber equipment signals that it has finished using the line; the telephone exchange resets the line to an idle state. For alerting an incoming call, the exchange rings the telephone by superimposing an alternating current (AC) signal onto the line of between 40 V and 90 V. The frequency of the signal is 20 Hz. In early exchanges, the ringing power was produced by a hand-cranked generator in the operator console of the exchange.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{electromagnetic}} field {{problems can be}} most elegantly formulated by integral equations. A common way {{to search for a}} solution to such an integral equation is the method of moments (MoM) where the equation is discretised by expanding the unknown function in basis functions and forcing the error in the approximation to be orthogonal to test functions. Many times, the method can be enhanced by exploiting wave functions together with addition theorems for them. The thesis treats three electromagnetic field problems formulated by integral equations: one electrostatic, one magnetostatic and one time-harmonic. The geometry in the static problems consists of <b>ring</b> <b>conductors,</b> and the solution can be constructed by using sophisticated entire-domain basis functions and Galerkin's method. The geometry in the time-harmonic problem is an extremely complex model of a pine tree, and therefore, the solution must be formed by using simple sub-domain basis functions and point matching. In each of the above solutions, wave functions together with addition theorems for them are exploited. In the static problems, the Green's function is expanded in cylindrical wave functions, the MoM matrix terms are formulated partly in the spectral domain using addition theorems for the cylindrical wave functions, and certain integral results are derived from addition theorems for ultra-spherical wave functions. In the time-harmonic problem, the discretised problem is solved by using an iterative scheme and the calculation is accelerated by using the Multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) which is based on addition theorems for spherical wave functions. The thesis is based upon five publications. The first two publications present an efficient and accurate method for calculating the capacitances and inductances of <b>ring</b> <b>conductors</b> in a layered medium. The third publication gives a unified and transparent derivation of translational addition theorems for spherical wave functions. The last two publications concern the MLFMA.

40|$|Background: We {{carried out}} a bench study of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) {{performance}} in order to investigate whether the right ventricular (RV) ring contributes to the occurrence of a high-voltage (HV) short circuit. Methods: A polycarbonate water bath with 0. 18 % saline was prepared. An ICD lead was connected to an ICD device and both were placed into the water bath. The impedance of each electrode and coil was measured. In the first experiment, the RV ring was shorted to the RV coil using an alligator clip. The impedance of each electrode and coil at shorting was measured. A maximum energy defibrillation shock was delivered. The therapy log confirmed the HV short circuit and the delivery conditions. In the second experiment, a short circuit was established between the RV ring and the superior vena cava coil and a similar procedure was followed. Results: No HV short circuit was observed in either experiment. Scheduled shock energies were delivered without problems. Some changes in pace–sense impedance or coil impedance were observed, but they remained within the normal range. Conclusions: The RV <b>ring</b> <b>conductor</b> {{is not related to}} HV short circuits, even if the RV ring and/or RV <b>ring</b> <b>conductor</b> is placed in contact with HV electrodes...|$|E

That is, by varying the three dimensions of the anti-corona ring: height (h), distance of the anti-corona <b>ring</b> <b>conductor</b> (r) and the diameter of the anti-corona <b>ring</b> <b>conductor</b> (d); it was possible to observe the electric field distribution in a polymeric isolator of the 500 kV voltage class. Such voltage class in currently applied to prevent loss of energy in long transmission lines. However it faces disadvantages, like the problem of the increased corona effect, which besides generating electromagnetic noise, increases the level of the electric field around the conductors and the isolator. The corona effect is responsible for an electric energy loss that is in the order of hundreds of kW/km in TLs and generates noises that reach up to 65 dBm. This effect occurs when the air’s critical value is exceeded, causing the electrons to collide with air resulting in the formation of ozone which is a major cause of corrosion in isolators. In this study, this issue is addressed and it is outlined sizing measures for manufactoring the anti-corona ring...|$|E

3000|$|To {{conclude}} {{the discussion of}} the results, a last remark is necessary about the protection level ensured by the earthing system according to international standards such as the IEC 62305 [54]. The earthing system usually comprises a single integrated structure that is suitable for several purposes, i.e., lightning protection, power and telecommunication systems earthing. The standard recommends that in dealing with the dispersion of the lightning current into the ground, the shape and dimensions of the earthing system are the important criteria to minimize any potentially dangerous overvoltages. In general, a low earthing resistance at industrial frequency is recommended, usually below 10 Ω. The standard, in the part number three [54, Section 5.4], suggests operative formulas for two basic types of earth electrode arrangements: type-A that comprises horizontal or vertical earth electrodes installed outside the structure and type-B that comprises either a <b>ring</b> <b>conductor</b> external to the structure to be protected, in contact with the soil for at least 80 [...]...|$|E

40|$|This essay’s aim is {{to observe}} the {{electric}} field lines between two parallel <b>ring</b> <b>conductors</b> by drawing the equipotential lines of the conductor via voltmeter. The experiment is done by using a silver pen for creating the conductor. On a carbon sheet two circles which have the same centre but different radius are drawn with silver pen. The equipotential lines between these circles are drawn and the electric field lines are drawn according to equipotential lines. The method is easy to apply. In this experiment, as much data as possible must be collected, because the deviations can be unexpectedly high. So to find the approximate result, the number of data must be very high. Using 4 different voltage values (40 V, 30 V, 20 V, 10 V) about 600 data is collected. The test results show that except some data the values are mostly close to each other. That means proper equipotential lines are drawn. Since the electric field lines are drawn according to equipotential lines, the electric field lines could be drawn. The field lines drawn are almost perfectly same with the theoric field lines between two parallel rings...|$|R

40|$|Electron {{motion in}} a CF 4 {{magnetic}} neutral loop discharge (NLD) plasma was simulated using a Monte Carlo method. The {{spatial distribution of}} electrons illustrated the fundamental structure of the NLD plasma, and its dynamics were depicted from the distributions of the mean electron energy, the electron energy gain and the azimuthal electron flux. The peak of mean electron energy appeared at the neutral loop (NL), which confirmed that electrons gain energy near this loop. High mean electron energy was observed not only near the NL but also along the separatrices of the quadrupole magnetic field. Energetic electrons were transported along the separatrices and induced ionization at those locations. However, the electron distribution had valleys along the separatrices, because electrons accelerated near the NL were likely to leave this region where the binding of the magnetic field is weak. The azimuthal electron flux representing the loop plasma current showed that the electron conduction path around the NL, which has conventionally been modelled as a <b>ring</b> <b>conductor,</b> has a particular directionality due to the rectification effect of antiparallel magnetic fields composing the quadrupole magnetic field. The directionality in {{the upper and lower}} regions of the quadrupole magnetic field was opposite to that in the inner and outer regions...|$|E

The magnitude of induced H/ sub theta / necessary for levi-tation is small in terms of field strengths normally desired for energetic pinches. In a 3 -in. glass-and-copper toroid of square cross section a 3 / 4 -in. hollow copper ring has been levitated with a 60 - cycle current of 3 kiloamperes. A 12 -in stainless steel tube of round cross section is being built. The stability of nearvacuum field hard-core configurations is best investigated in toroidal geometry. At high power levels and low plasma densities, the conventional toroidal stabilized pinch'' is subject to an anomalous plasma energy leakage to the wall, which cannot {{be explained by the}} observed ultraviolet radiation alone. A critical question is, therefore, whether the relative stability of some hard-core pinches, as reflected by the smoothness and reproducibility of magnetic probe traces, is reflected by an improved containment of the plasma en-ergy leading to high temperature. A toroidal hard-core tube is also useful in studying the nature of the nonhydromagnetic instabilities observed in the linear inverse stabilized pinch. '' The presence and condition of electrodes appear to have a substantial effect on the magnitude of these instabilities, as would be expected if they were, for instance, of electrostatic origin. In order to complement the plasma study of the hard-core pinch, we have developed an analogue method using sodium tubes to simulate the current-carrying layer. In this way the purely hydromagnetic aspect of the plasma behavior can be isolated. (auth...|$|E

This thesis provides comprehensive analysis on the lightning scenarios in 18 communication and broadcasting towers situated in similar and different isokeraunic contours in Sri Lanka. The results and observation show that most of the damages reported due to the indirect lightning flashes, power line surges and step voltage in the event of lightning strike to the tower. The property damages such as patches and cracks developed in their walls and floors, the damages to electrical and electronic equipment such as electrical switch gears, bulbs, socket outlets, televisions, and radios also reported. The personal injuries were in the form of temporary paralysis due to step potential or electric shock. In one case, the victims were sleeping on floor in his home which is located around 40 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. In another case the victims were sitting on the chair with legs on the ground in his home which is located around 30 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. The descriptions indicate that they have been subjected to step potential. The above scenarios with related to the lightning strikes to telecommunication tower going to explain with the geographical arrangement of tower surround, Earth resistance values measured, tower grounding arrangement, power line lightning protection system and the commercial power distribution to the area by Earth resistance tester, technical theories and simulation software.
