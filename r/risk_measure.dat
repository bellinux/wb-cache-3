40|$|The {{effect of}} {{financial}} reports on stock market behavior {{is a central}} issue of research in accounting and finance. A number of studies investigate how financial information becomes impounded in security prices and affects investment decisions. Prior studies on the determinants of the bid-ask spread investigate the effect of market <b>risk</b> <b>measures,</b> and provide evidence that the bid-ask spread is a positive function of risk. Other studies report on an association between market <b>risk</b> <b>measures</b> and accounting <b>risk</b> <b>measures.</b> The present study extends this line of research by examining the effect of risk, proxied by accounting <b>risk</b> <b>measures,</b> on the bid-ask spread. The results of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions provide evidence of a statistically significant association between certain accounting ratios and the bid-ask spread, and indicate that accounting <b>risk</b> <b>measures</b> account for more variability in the bid-ask spread than market <b>risk</b> <b>measures.</b> Most notably, {{the results indicate that}} a model which includes both accounting <b>risk</b> <b>measures</b> and market <b>risk</b> <b>measures</b> is a better fitted model that one which includes either accounting <b>risk</b> <b>measures</b> or market <b>risk</b> <b>measures</b> alone...|$|R
