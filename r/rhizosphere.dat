In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the <b>rhizosphere).</b>|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} A fast and {{reliable}} phenotyping system forms a major bottleneck in root exudation research. Our {{goal was to}} develop such a system to quantify genetic and environmental effects on root exudation. Another aim was characterizing non-sterile phenotyping. Methods We developed {{a system in which}} plants can be grown with non-sterile shoot environments and sterile <b>rhizospheres.</b> These sterile systems were compared with non-sterile controls. Results In non-sterile <b>rhizospheres</b> exogenous carbon disappeared quickly with a half-life of 2 to 3 h and root exudate concentrations remained below detection limit. In sterile <b>rhizospheres</b> exogenous carbon levels were relatively stable or depleted slower than in non-sterile <b>rhizospheres</b> and organic acid build-up occurred. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) could be grown with sterile roots for several months. Conclusions The differences in carbon depletion in sterile and non-sterile <b>rhizospheres</b> was most likely due to the absence of microbial catabolism in sterile <b>rhizospheres.</b> These results prove that using a sterile phenotyping system is essential to study the quantity and composition of root exudates. The sterile system described in this paper eliminates the obscuring effect caused by microbes on exudation levels. It offers a stable, reliable and easy phenotyping method and can be used to investigate genetic and environmental effects on exudation...|$|R

5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the <b>rhizosphere</b> (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown P.semilanceata to {{suppress}} {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the <b>rhizosphere</b> of grasses from its habitat, P.semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the <b>rhizosphere,</b> and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of AM fungi on plant root and shoot growth {{may also have}} indirect effect on the <b>rhizosphere</b> bacteria.

40|$|Soil {{bacteria}} are important contributors to primary productivity and nutrient cycling in arid land ecosystems, and their populations may be greatly affected {{by changes in}} environmental conditions.

Bacterial communities associated with the <b>rhizospheres</b> of the native bunchgrasses Stipa hymenoides and Hilaria jamesii, the invading annual grass Bromus tectorum, and the interspaces colonized by cyanobacterial soil crusts were compared at three depths.

The <b>rhizospheres</b> of two populations of S. anglica with differing plant morphology growing in different sediment types were investigated in situ using a novel multifiber optode system with 100 oxygen probes. No oxygen was detected inside the <b>rhizospheres</b> at any depth in either location, indicating a limited impact of plant-mediated sediment oxygenation on the bulk anoxic sediment. Subsequent planar optode studies imaging the oxygen content around the roots substantiated these findings showing that sediment oxygenation was present in both locations, but it was confined only to the immediate vicinity of the root tips. The size of the oxic zones surrounding the root tips differed between sediment-types: in S. anglica growing in permeable sandy sediment, oxic root zones extended 1. 5 mm away from the roots surface compared to only 0. 4 mm in muddy tidal flat deposit, which had a substantially higher oxygen demand. The oxygen concentration inside the oxic root zones remained stable during continuous light and air-exposure of the aboveground biomass.

DNA of bacterial cells from the <b>rhizospheres</b> was directly extracted, and partial sequences of the 16 S rRNA genes were PCR amplified with primers targeting the following phylogenetic groups: Bacteria, α-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Pseudomonas, respectively.

Neither the tolerant nor the sensitive plants, the latter with visible above-ground damage, showed ozone-induced differences {{in any of the}} SSCP profiles, with the single exception of Actinobacteria-targeted profiles from S. asper. To increase the stress, S. asper was germinated and raised in the continuous presence of an elevated level of ozone. SSCP profiles with Bacteria-specific primers combined with gene probe hybridizations indicated an ozone-related increase in a Xanthomonas-related 16 S rRNA gene and a decrease in the respective gene from the plant plastids.

A total of 106 strains were isolated and identified as P. azotofixans with an API 50 CH kit, by classical biochemical tests, and via the use of specific primers based on the 16 S rRNA gene in PCRs. To compare the isolated strains, phenotypic characteristics were determined and three different probes were used in hybridization experiments: two nif probes and one probe comprising a 0. 58 -kb fragment cloned from the P. azotofixans C 3 L 4 genome. These results were used to construct a dendrogram, in which two main clusters could be observed.
