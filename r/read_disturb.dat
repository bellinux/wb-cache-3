25|$|The {{method used}} to read NANDflash memory can cause nearby cells in the same memory block to change over time (become programmed). This is known as <b>read</b> <b>disturb.</b> The {{threshold}} number of reads is generally {{in the hundreds of}} thousands of reads between intervening erase operations. If reading continually from one cell, that cell will not fail but rather one of the surrounding cells on a subsequent read. To avoid the <b>read</b> <b>disturb</b> problem the flash controller will typically count the total number of reads to a block since the last erase. When the count exceeds a target limit, the affected block is copied over to a new block, erased, then released to the block pool. The original block is as good as new after the erase. If the flash controller does not intervene in time, however, a <b>read</b> <b>disturb</b> error will occur with possible data loss if the errors are too numerous to correct with an error-correcting code.|$|E

50|$|Usually, Flash Memory Controller {{also include}} the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) a layer below the file system that maps host side or file system logical block {{addresses}} (LBAs) to the physical address of the Flash memory (logical-to-physical mapping). The LBAs refer to sector numbers and to a mapping unit of 512 bytes. All LBAs that represent the logical size visible to and managed by the file system are mapped to a physical location (block ID, page ID and sector ID) of the Flash. As part of the wear leveling and other Flash management algorithms (bad block management, <b>read</b> <b>disturb</b> management, safe flash handling etc.), the physical location of an LBA might dynamically change frequently. The mapping units of an FTL can differ so that LBAs are mapped block-, page- or even sub-page-based. Depending on the usage pattern, a finer mapping granularity can significantly reduce the flash wear out and maximize the endurance of a flash based storage media.|$|E

A key contributor to this reduced reliability is <b>read</b> <b>disturb,</b> where a read to one row of cells impacts the threshold voltages of unread flash cells in different rows {{of the same}} block. Such disturbances may shift the threshold voltages of these unread cells to different logical states than originally programmed, leading to read errors that hurt endurance. For {{the first time in}} open literature, this paper experimentally characterizes <b>read</b> <b>disturb</b> errors on state-of-the-art 2 Y-nm (i. e., 20 - 24 nm) MLC NAND flash memory chips. Our findings (1) correlate the magnitude of threshold voltage shifts with read operation counts, (2) demonstrate how program/erase cycle count and retention age affect the read-disturb-induced error rate, and (3) identify that lowering pass-through voltage levels reduces the impact of <b>read</b> <b>disturb</b> and extend flash lifetime.
