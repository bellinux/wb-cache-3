40|$|Abstract — We {{are given}} a {{collection}} of m <b>received</b> <b>strings</b> or traces that have been independently generated by randomly inserting and deleting bits from a common string t of length n. Our goal is to reconstruct the string t from these observed traces. This paper considers both the algorithms for doing this reconstruction and seeks to understand the error rates at which reconstruction is possible. Note the difference from the typical coding theory scenario- {{rather than trying to}} infer a codeword from a single received word, we are interested in inferring an arbitrary (or near arbitrary) word from multiple, independently generated received words. We present two main results. Firstly we show that for almost all transmitted strings, if the deletion/insertion error probability is O(1 / log 2 n) then with m = O(log n) traces we can exactly reconstruct the transmitted string with high probability. Furthermore we can still reconstruct in the presence of additional noise that flips each bit with constant probability. Secondly, for arbitrary strings (with no run of length>n ɛ) we show that with a constant number of <b>received</b> <b>strings</b> we can reconstruct when the deletion/insertion probability is O(1 /n 1 / 2 +ɛ). This paper continues work initiated in Batu et. al. (2004) which considered only deletion errors. Our setting can be viewed as the study of an idealized biological evolutionary process where the DNA string undergoes point mutations, deletions and insertions. Our goal is to understand at what mutation rates, a small number of observed samples can be correctly aligned to reconstruct the parent string. I...|$|R

We then define the generic interpolation polynomial for list decoding such a code. The generic interpolation polynomial should specialize to the interpolation polynomial for most <b>received</b> <b>strings.</b> We give an example of a family of Reed–Solomon 1 -error correcting codes for which a single error can be decoded by a very simple process involving substituting into the generic interpolation polynomial...|$|R

We will go beyond the supergravity approximation in the AdS by using the fact that strings have an extended structure.

40|$|Standard {{models of}} {{language}} learning {{are concerned with}} weak learning: the learner, receiving as input only information about the strings in the language, must learn to generalise and to generate the correct, potentially infinite, set of strings generated by some target grammar. Here we define the corresponding notion of strong learning: the learner, again only <b>receiving</b> <b>strings</b> as input, must learn a grammar that generates the correct set of structures or parse trees. We formalise this using a modification of Gold’s identification in the limit model, requiring convergence to a grammar that is isomorphic to the target grammar. We take as our starting point a simple learning algorithm for substitutable context-free languages, based on principles of distributional learning, and modify {{it so that it}} will converge to a canonical grammar for each language. We prove a corresponding strong learning result for a subclass of context-free grammars...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} one-loop vacuum {{structure}} {{of an effective}} theory of gaugino condensation coupled to the dilaton for string models in which the gauge coupling constant does not <b>receive</b> <b>string</b> threshold corrections. The new ingredients in our treatment are that we {{take into account the}} one-loop correction to the dilaton Kähler potential and we use a formulation which includes a chiral field H corresponding to the gaugino bilinear. We find through explicit calculation that supersymmetry in the Yang-Mills sector is broken by gaugino condensation. The dilaton and H field have masses on the order of the gaugino condensation scale independently of the dilaton VEV. Although the calculation performed here is at best a model of the full gaugino condensation dynamics, the result shows that the one-loop correction to the dilaton Kähler potential as well as the detailed dynamics at the gaugino condensation scale may {{play an important role in}} solving th...|$|R
40|$|A Turing machine (TM) can {{be adapted}} to {{simulate}} the logic of any computer algorithm, and is particularly useful in explaining the functions of a CPU inside a computer. Membrane computing aims to develop models and paradigms that are biologically motivated. It identifies an unconventional computing model, namely a P system, which abstracts from the way living cells process chemical compounds in their compartmental structure. These systems are a class of distributed systems, maximally parallel computing devices of a biochemical type. In this research, the research tries investigating a new view to show Membrane computing is a multi TM that communicate with each other. The main idea is that each membrane is a TM itself and each TM can communicate with other TM through communication channels under the structure of membranes (tree membranes structure) where membrane (TM) can send and <b>receive</b> <b>string</b> (multiset) to or from other membrane (TM).

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{estimating}} a transmitted string X, from the corresponding <b>received</b> <b>string</b> Y, which is a noisy version of X,. We assume that Y contains*any number of substitution, insertion, and deletion errors, and that no two consecutive symbols of X, were deleted in transmission. We have shown that for channels which cause independent errors, and whose error probabilities exceed those of noisy strings studied in the literature [121, at least 99. 5 % of the erroneous strings will not contain two consecutive deletion errors. The best estimate X * of X, is defined as that element of H which minimizes the generalized Levenshtein distance D (X/Y) between X and Y. Using dynamic programming principles, an algorithm is presented which yields X+ without computing individually the distances between every word of H and Y. Though this algorithm requires more memory, it can be shown that it is, in general, computationally less complex than all other existing algorithms which perform the same task...|$|R
40|$|The present paper investigates {{identification}} of indexed families of recursively enumerable languages from good examples. In {{the context of}} class preserving learning from good text examples, it is shown that the notions of finite and limit identification coincide. On the other hand, these two criteria are different {{in the context of}} class comprising learning from good text examples. In the context of learning from good informant examples, finite and limit identification criteria differ for both class preserving and class comprising cases. The above results resolve an open question posed by Lange, Nessel and Wiehagen in a similar study about indexed families of recursive languages. 1 Introduction Consider the {{identification of}} formal languages from positive data.
