Transcription termination signals were {{introduced into the}} lac genes of these fusions by Tn 9 and IS 1 insertions. Measurement of lac enzymes from upstream and downstream of the insertions showed that termination signals resulting from these insertions are very efficient when transcription begins at lac or ara promoters but are very inefficient when transcription begins at the rrnC promoter-leader region. The rrnC promoter-leader region must, therefore, modify RNA polymerase to enable it to <b>read</b> <b>through</b> <b>transcription</b> termination signals...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{generations of}} {{biofuels}} basically revolve around non-agricultural energy crops. Among those, microalgae owing to its unique characteristics i. e. natural tolerance to waste and saline water, sustainable biomass production and high lipid content (LC), is regarded {{by many as}} the ultimate choice for the production of various biofuels such as biodiesel. In the present study, manipulation of carbon flux into fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in Dunaliella salina was achieved using pGH plasmid harboring AccD and ME genes to enhance lipid content and to improve produced biodiesel quality. The stability of transformation was confirmed by PCR after several passages. Southern hybridization of AccD probe with genomic DNA revealed stable integration of the cassette in the specific positions in the chloroplast genome with no <b>read</b> <b>through</b> <b>transcription</b> by indigenous promoters. Comparison of the LC and fatty acid profile of the transformed algal cell line and the control revealed the over-expression of the ME/AccD genes in the transformants leading to 12 % increase in total LC and significant improvements in biodiesel properties especially by increasing algal oil oxidation stability. The whole process successfully implemented herein for transforming algal cells by genes involved in lipid production pathway could be helpful for large scale biodiesel production from microalgae...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} mitochondrial transcription termination factor mTERF binds {{with high}} affinity {{to a site}} within the tRNALeu(UUR) gene and regulates the amount of <b>read</b> <b>through</b> <b>transcription</b> from the ribosomal DNA into the remaining genes of the major coding strand of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and SELEX, using mitochondrial protein extracts from cells induced to overexpress mTERF, revealed novel, weaker mTERF-binding sites, clustered in several regions of mtDNA, notably in the major non-coding region (NCR). Such binding in vivo was supported by mtDNA immunoprecipitation. Two-dimensional neutral agarose gel electrophoresis (2 DNAGE) and 5 ′ end mapping by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) identified {{the region of the}} canonical mTERF-binding site as a replication pause site. The strength of pausing was modulated by the expression level of mTERF. mTERF overexpression also affected replication pausing in other regions of the genome in which mTERF binding was found. These results indicate a role for TERF in mtDNA replication, in addition to its role in transcription. We suggest that mTERF could provide a system for coordinating the passage of replication and transcription complexes, analogous with replication pause-region binding proteins in other systems, whose main role is to safeguard the integrity of the genome whilst facilitating its efficient expression...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The acreage for genetically {{modified}} crops (GMOs) —particularly soybean—has steadily increased since 1996, when the first crop of Roundup Ready soy-bean (intended for food production) was grown. The Roundup Ready soybean varieties derive from a soybean line into which a glyphosate-resistant enolpyruvylshiki-mate- 3 -phosphate-synthase (EPSPS) gene was intro-duced. The inserted and the flanking regions in Roundup Ready soybean have recently been characterized. It was shown that a further 250 -bp fragment of the epsps gene is localized downstream of the introduced nos terminator of transcription, derived from the nopaline synthase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We examined whether this 250 -bp fragment could be of functional importance. Our data demonstrate that at least 150 bp of this DNA region are transcribed in Roundup Ready soybean. Transcription of the fragment depends on whether read-through events ignore the nos terminator signal located upstream. Our data also indicate that the read-through product is further processed, resulting in four different RNA variants from which the transcribed region of the nos terminator is completely deleted. Deletion results in the generation of open reading frames which might code for (as yet unknown) EPSPS fusion proteins. The nos terminator {{is used as a}} regulatory element in several other GMOs used for food production. This implies that <b>read</b> <b>through</b> products and <b>transcription</b> of RNA variants might be a common feature in these GMOs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A common element among {{cancer cells}} is the {{presence}} of improperly controlled transcription. In these cells, the degree of specific activation of some genes is abnormal, and altering the aberrant transcription may therefore directly target cancer. TFIIS is a transcription elongation factor, which directly binds the transcription motor, RNA Polymerase II and allows it to <b>read</b> <b>through</b> various <b>transcription</b> arrest sites. We report on RNA interference of TFIIS, a transcription elongation factor, and its affect on proliferation of cancer cells in culture. Methods RNA interference was performed by transfecting siRNA to specifically knock down TFIIS expression in MCF 7, MCF 10 A, PL 45 and A 549 cells. Levels of TFIIS expression were determined by the Quantigene method, and relative protein levels of TFIIS, c-myc and p 53 were determined by C-ELISA. Induction of apoptosis was determined by an enzymatic Caspase 3 / 7 assay, as well as a non-enzymatic assay detecting cytoplasmic mono- and oligonucleosomes. A gene array analysis was conducted for effects of TFIIS siRNA on MCF 7 and MCF 10 A cell lines. Results Knockdown of TFIIS reduced cancer cell proliferation in breast, lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines. More specifically, TFIIS knockdown in the MCF 7 breast cancer cell line induced cancer cell death and increased c-myc and p 53 expression whereas TFIIS knockdown in the non-cancerous breast cell line MCF 10 A was less affected. Differential effects of TFIIS knockdown in MCF 7 and MCF 10 A cells included the estrogenic, c-myc and p 53 pathways, as observed by C-ELISA and gene array, and were likely involved in MCF 7 cell-death. Conclusion Although transcription is a fundamental process, targeting select core transcription factors may provide for a new and potent avenue for cancer therapeutics. In the present study, knockdown of TFIIS inhibited cancer cell proliferation, suggesting that TFIIS could be studied as a potential cancer target within the transcription machinery. </p...|$|R

40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a cellular}} mechanism where small RNAs (20 to 35 nucleotides in length) pair with proteins to build effector complexes guiding them to RNA targets through homologous base pairing. The piRNA pathway is a germ line specific RNAi pathway {{that protects the}} gonads of animals from harmful genetic sequences, termed transposable elements (TEs). TEs are viral DNA remnants that can autonomously mobilize within genomes and cause damage through insertion into new genomic loci and double-strand breaks in DNA. TE activity in germline cells ultimately leads to sterility and its suppression through the piRNA pathway is therefore essential for propagation. While the piRNA pathway shares common characteristics with the two major RNAi pathways (miRNAs and siRNAs), it additionally exhibits several unique features, particularly during biogenesis. piRNAs originate from large non-genic regions, so called piRNA clusters, or from mRNAs of transposable elements. Neither of these RNA transcripts contain the requisite structural features capable of triggering small RNA production, seen in both siRNAs and miRNAs. Consequently, piRNAs are produced in a Dicer independent manner. Therefore, {{it is not yet}} understood, how target transcript are recognized by the piRNA pathway. Furthermore, the extent of piRNA functionality in vivo are not well defined, as they seem to act on multiple levels to protect the germline genome from the propagation of transposable elements. piRNAs lead to direct cleavage of TE mRNAs, but also seem to change the chromatin landscape of regions expressing RNA targets. Additionally, the effect of piRNAs reaches into the next generation through a transgenerational epigenetic mechanism. This study focuses on the characterization of the early stages in piRNA biogenesis, starting at their transcription through the first processing steps. The data presented suggest that the two different piRNA cluster types, uni-stranded and double-stranded clusters, differ greatly in the properties of their transcription. Uni-stranded clusters exhibit a defined transcription start site, giving rise to 5 ' capped piRNA precursor molecules that resemble canonical mRNAs. Whereas, double-stranded clusters do not show a distinct start site and can be transcribed through internal initiation or <b>read</b> <b>through</b> <b>transcription</b> from neighboring genes. The work furthermore reveals the existence of piRNA intermediates: they are over 200 nucleotides long, which contain a 5 ' monophosphorylated terminus and already exhibit the nucleotide biases similar to mature piRNAs. After processing of piRNA precursors into mature piRNAs, their effects can reach into subsequent generations. To investigate the trans-generational aspect of piRNAs, I utilized transgenic fly models. The results reveal that piRNAs are epigenetic factors influencing a plethora of mechanisms in the piRNA pathway: ensuring a strong piRNA production in the next generation through maintenance of both piRNA production pathways (primary and secondary piRNA production). Furthermore, they maintain the characteristic structural chromatin features of piRNA clusters in the next generation. However, most strikingly piRNAs are capable of transforming regions expressing targeted transcripts into loci producing primary piRNAs. Therefore, the latter result informs a revision to the current definition of piRNA sources and their subsequent targets. piRNA sources and targets might not be strictly distinct, but any piRNA target acquires piRNA cluster signatures and starts producing piRNAs. The discovery that inherited piRNAs transform a piRNA target into a source, allowed the investigation of the molecular changes at loci targeted by the piRNA pathway. These newly established piRNA clusters acquire a specific chromatin configuration consisting of the histone mark H 3 K 9 me 3 and two piRNA protein factors Rhino and Cutoff. Together, these factors correlate with increased transcription of their targeted loci. Cutoff appears to be the key factor in piRNA production, through both promotion of read-through transcription beyond stop signals and protection of RNA termini against exonucleolytic degradation. Overall, the presented data contribute {{to an understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms in piRNA biogenesis, from the initial processing steps through the trans-generational effect of piRNAs. It suggests that the piRNA system is organized as a giant feed-forward loop, where piRNAs themselves reach into the next generation to ensures reliable propagation of the system and effective silencing of deleterious TE sequences...|$|E

Utilising a quantitative and qualitative research design, 28 English teachers from several schools in Dungun, Terengganu were chosen as respondents for the study. Four research objectives for the study were (i) English teachers' knowledge and understanding on phonics approach, (ii) English teachers' perception on students' knowledge and ability in phonics {{in the teaching of}} <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonics approach, (iii) English teachers' challenges in teaching <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonics approach in early reading and (iv) suggestion in implementing teaching English <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonics approach. Two instruments namely Teacher Knowledge Assessment: Structure of Language (TKA:SL) questionnaire adapted from Mather, Bos & Babur (2001) and Teacher Perceptions towards Early Reading and Spelling (TPERS) Deford (1985) were used for the study. In addition, semi-structured interview were conducted in getting further information from the teachers. The findings of the study showed that (i) the teachers have moderate level of knowledge and understanding in teaching <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonic approach (ii) it is also revealed that phonological awareness knowledge and spelling skills are important for the emergent readers. Based on the study, it can be concluded that English teachers' knowledge and understanding in teaching <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonics approach is inadequate.
