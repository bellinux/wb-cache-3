5000|$|Silver {{molybdate}} (Ag2MoO4) presents {{two types}} of electronic structure, depending on the pressure conditions to which the crystal is subjected. At room temperature, Ag2MoO4 exhibits a spinel-type cubic structure related to beta (β-Ag2MoO4) phase, which is more stable in nature. However, when exposed to high hydrostatic pressure, these crystals have a tetragonal structure associated to alpha (α-Ag2MoO4) metastable phase. Recently, the literature [...] has reported the formation of α-Ag2MoO4 metastable phase by the solution-phase precipitation method under environment condition, and using 3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine (dpp) as doping. The influence of pH at starting solution on the growth and formation processes of distinct heterostructures (brooms, flowers and rods) was investigated by Singh et al. and Fodjo et al., in which the sodium borohydride was employed to induce the reduction of silver nanoparticles {{on the surface of}} Ag2MoO4 crystals in order to enhance the Raman scattering. In other studies, Ag-Ag2MoO4 composites prepared by microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis presented interesting photocatalytic activity for the degradation of <b>Rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> under visible light. In addition, Ag2MoO4 mixed with graphite acts as a good lubricant for Ni-based composites, improving the tribological properties of this system. Different synthesis methods have been employed to obtain pure β-Ag2MoO4 crystals, including solid-state reaction or oxide mixture at high temperature, melt-quenching [...] and Czochralski growth. Particularly, high temperatures, long processing times, and/or sophisticated equipment are necessary in these synthetic routes. Moreover, the final products may be composed of irregular particle shapes with nonhomogeneous size distribution as well as contain the presence of secondary phases. In recent years, pure β-Ag2MoO4 crystals have been synthesized by the co-precipitation, microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis, dynamic template route using polymerization of the acrylamide assisted templates [...] and impregnation/calcination method.|$|E

40|$|The USDA/APHIS/Wildlife Services (WS) oral rabies {{vaccination}} program uses tetracycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic and relatively reliable biomarker, to quantify vaccinebait uptake by raccoons (Procyon lotor). However, obtaining samples (e. g., bone or teeth) to assess tetracycline uptake is highly invasive, and sample preparation can be expensive. By contrast, <b>rhodamine</b> <b>B,</b> a commercially available dye, is absorbed systemically in growing tissues, including hair and whiskers, {{and can be}} observed under ultraviolet (UV) light as fluorescent orange bands. Our goal was to evaluate whether <b>rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> {{can be used as}} a biomarker to monitor bait uptake by raccoons. We began by orally administering a solution containing 100 mg, 150 mg, or 200 mg of <b>rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> to captive raccoons. We monitored whisker and hair samples for fluorescence using a hand-held UV lamp and a fluorescent microscope for 13 -weeks post-treatment. All raccoons that were administered <b>rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> exhibited fluorescence in their whisker and hair samples during the course of the study. Our ability to detect fluorescing whiskers varied based on the method of detection and time interval, but not with <b>rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> dosage level. We detected <b>rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> in 81 % of marked individuals using the fluorescent microscope and 58 % of marked subjects using the UV lamp. We were able to detect <b>rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> when doses as low as 1 mg/kg were given.

40|$|<b>Rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> base is {{employed}} as a photoactive redox system in a liquid I liquid I electrode triple phase boundary electrochemical experiment. Microdroplets of the water-immiscible 3 -(4 -phenylpropyl) -pyridine (PPP) containing <b>rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> are deposited onto a basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode surface which is then immersed into an aqueous solution containing 0. 5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 12). In cyclic voltammetry experiments, it is shown that dark reduction of <b>rhodamine</b> <b>B</b> to leuco-rhodamine B in PPP occurs in two steps-both one electron processes-and the re-oxidation occurs in a single two-electron process. Voltammetric signals are consistent with Na+ transfer (for the first reduction step) and proton transfer (for the second reduction step) coupled to the electron transfer. A proton-driven disproportionation reaction (with k(dis) = 3 mol(- 1) dm(3) s(- 1) at pH 12) is observed for the one-electron reduced intermediate.
