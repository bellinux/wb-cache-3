5|$|Alcohol is {{the most}} available, widely {{consumed}}, and widely abused <b>recreational</b> <b>drug.</b> Beer alone is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage; it is the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea. It is thought {{by some to be}} the oldest fermented beverage.|$|E
5|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a <b>recreational</b> <b>drug</b> with {{euphoriant}} and stimulant properties. The effects {{produced by}} BZP {{are comparable to}} those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, {{although there have been}} at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania and other parts of Europe.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that pre-Columbian Mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen, but more likely they used substances secreted by the Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius). These contain bufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), a psychoactive compound {{that has been used}} in modern times as a <b>recreational</b> <b>drug.</b> Typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked. Illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an urban myth.|$|E
40|$|<b>Recreational</b> <b>drugs</b> are {{commonly}} used amongst those frequenting nightclubs. In addition to established <b>recreational</b> <b>drugs</b> such as amphetamine, MDMA (Ecstasy), ketamine and cocaine, there are novel/emerging <b>recreational</b> <b>drugs</b> entering the ‘club scene’. These drugs often have similar clinical features in toxicity, although {{they may not be}} controlled under the same legislation as established <b>recreational</b> <b>drugs.</b> In this article we will review how these novel/emerging <b>recreational</b> <b>drugs</b> can be detected/identified, and compare the clinical features of toxicity seen with them to established <b>recreational</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{illegality}} of many <b>recreational</b> <b>drugs</b> may be dissuading {{research into}} new, {{more effective and}} perhaps safer <b>recreational</b> <b>drugs.</b> For example, it has been proposed that a drug {{with many of the}} same desired effects as alcohol could be created with fewer adverse health effects.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{movements}} and organizations are advocating {{for or against}} the liberalization {{of the use of}} <b>recreational</b> <b>drugs,</b> notably cannabis legalization. Subcultures have emerged among users of <b>recreational</b> <b>drugs,</b> as well as among those who abstain from them, such as teetotalism and [...] "straight edge".|$|R
5|$|Maxinquaye was {{produced}} by Tricky with assistance from Mark Saunders, who helped him utilize dub production techniques and heavily altered samples taken {{from a variety of}} musical sources. The record's groove-oriented and low-tempo sound incorporates elements from hip hop, soul, rock, ambient techno, reggae, and experimental music. The songs explore themes of cultural decline, dysfunctional sexual relationships, fear of intimacy, and <b>recreational</b> <b>drug</b> use. In writing them, Tricky drew on his experiences in the British drug culture and the influence of his deceased mother Maxine Quaye, after whom the album is titled.|$|E
5|$|Born in Huyton, Merseyside, Barton is {{the oldest}} of four brothers. His parents {{separated}} when he was 14 years old and consequently {{he lived with his}} father at his grandmother's house on a different estate. He has said that his grandmother's influence helped him to avoid getting caught up in a <b>recreational</b> <b>drug</b> culture and attributes his work ethic to his father. His father, also named Joseph, worked as a roofer and played football semi-professionally for Northwich Victoria. Barton enjoyed physical education at his school, St Thomas Becket, which he represented in various sports and was a talented rugby league prospect. He left school with ten GCSEs.|$|E
5|$|Electric Music for the Mind and Body was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all facets of the members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, <b>recreational</b> <b>drug</b> use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music for the Mind and Body {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E

5|$|The Party for Freedom's {{political}} platform often overlaps {{those of the}} assassinated Rotterdam politician Pim Fortuyn and his Pim Fortuyn List. After his death, Fortuyn's impact remained, {{as more and more}} politicians sought to gain political mileage by directly confronting topics such as a ban on immigration that were, from a politically correct point of view, considered unmentionable in the Netherlands until Fortuyn came on the scene and upended the Dutch tradition of consensus politics with an anti-immigration stance. Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn's constituency. The Party for Freedom called for a €16billion tax reduction, a far stricter policy toward <b>recreational</b> <b>drug</b> use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution. In the 2006 Dutch parliamentary election, their first parliamentary election, the Party for Freedom won 9 out of the 150 open seats.|$|E
