Four sand-clay mixes representative of real <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> <b>foundation</b> materials were investigated. It was found that moderate additions of clay (up to ~ 14 % by weight) increased the cyclic shear stress threshold at which significant excess pore pressures started to accumulate. After the cyclic shear stress threshold had been exceeded, the rate of pore pressure increase with the logarithm of the axial strain was greatest for the material having a clay content of 11 %. Excess pore pressure generation reduced with increasing intergranular and global void ratio, with the global void ratio being perhaps the more useful indicator because of the reduced amount of scatter and higher correlation of the idealized relationship...|$|E
40|$|Railway {{foundations}} play {{an integral}} role in controlling {{the stability of}} the overlying track structure and the maintenance of the overall track geometry. Premature failures of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> <b>foundation</b> are likely to result in frequent maintenance, which may entail significant costs since railway track foundations are less easily accessible than the other layers of railway track. Premature failures of track foundations may arise if the service loads exceed the design specifications, but may also develop {{as a result of the}} shortcomings of the design codes to simulate in situ stress paths, which involve cyclic stress changes in the horizontal as well as vertical direction, which result in principal stress rotation (PSR). Laboratory investigations have suggested that cyclic changes in the horizontal as well as vertical direction may result in a higher rate of plastic strain accumulation than cycling the vertical stress only. The effect of PSR on the soil stiffness is less certain however. Furthermore little consideration has been given to how the gradation of different soils may affect in situ drainage conditions and therefore influence the rate of railway track deterioration during PSR. A knowledge gap exists as to how cyclic changes in the directions of principal stresses may affect the pore pressure and stiffness of soils under different drainage conditions. In order to improve our understanding of the effects of PSR on the long term performance of railway track foundations, a series of laboratory tests were conducted which investigated the effects of cyclic changes in the direction of principal stresses on the pore pressure, stiffness and susceptibility to failure of saturated <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> <b>foundation</b> soils under different drainage conditions. The investigated sand-clay mixes were selected so as to replicate the gradation of an in situ <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> <b>foundation.</b> It was found that even small additions of clay to the volume of a sand significantly affected the response of the mixes during cyclic changes in principal stress direction. Moderate additions of clay in the pore space of a sand reduced the susceptibility to principal stress rotation by reducing the tendency for excess pore pressure generation and by increasing the cyclic shear stress the mixes were able to sustain before rapid plastic strain accumulation occurred. Increases in principal stress rotation below the cyclic shear threshold increased the resilient stiffness of the sand-clay mixes, however once this threshold was exceeded rapid stiffness degradation occurred. Below the cyclic shear threshold, the response of the mixes was stable over a high number of loading cycles and no abrupt fatigue failures were observed. The sand-clay mixes were sensitive to even small changes in the magnitude of PSR near the cyclic shear threshold. Small increases in PSR could trigger the sudden collapse of a previously stable sand-clay mix. Under conditions where the rate of pore pressure dissipation was regulated by the permeability and the volumetric compressibility of the soil, the sand clay mixes with moderate additions of fines were stable over a range of cyclic increases in PSR which correspond to the maximum expected changes in magnitude within the depth of a ballasted <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> <b>foundation...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>track</b> <b>foundation</b> with {{fine-grained}} subgrade, under {{loading of}} cyclic nature, can build up excess pore pressure {{and results in}} progressive shear failure at a stress level less than its static undrained strength. It is widely accepted a threshold stress level exists, where loading above such level causes large deformation; otherwise stability of vertical track profile will be assured. This paper described the theoretical model that predicts the threshold stress of clay soil. The threshold stress so determined represents the lower-bound solution for bearing strength capacity of clay subgrade which normally exists in an unsaturated state. Developed from the “original Cam-clay” model and validated by series of undrained cyclic triaxial test data on reconstituted kaolin clay, the proposed theoretical model enables the prediction of threshold stress to be made from the fundamental properties of the soil, based on current state of stress and stress history of the sub-grade soil.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of hollow cylinder tests carried out to investigate the role of drainage conditions on the response of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> <b>foundation</b> materials during cyclic loading. Three sand–clay mixes were tested. It was found that, below a certain cyclic shear stress threshold, and depending on the drainage conditions, changes in principal stress direction should not adversely affect the cyclic stability of a railway foundation. However, significant stiffness degradation and failure may occur if this cyclic shear stress threshold is exceeded. The cyclic shear stress threshold increased with moderate additions of clay per unit volume of sand, and reduced significantly when specimen drainage was prevented. For the materials tested, the cyclic shear stress threshold in free-to-drain conditions was generally similar to the cyclic shear stress in the soil immediately below a 0 · 3 m deep ballast bed, but comfortably greater than the cyclic stress at a depth of 1 m below the sleeper base. In undrained conditions, the cyclic shear stress threshold was generally similar to the cyclic shear stress at a depth of 1 m below the sleeper base. This has implications for the suitability of such materials for railway track foundations...|$|E
40|$|The <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> <b>foundation</b> of {{fine-grained}} soil subgrade, under repeated loading of cyclic nature, can gradually build up excess pore pressure {{and result in}} progressive shear failure at a stress level {{much lower than the}} monotonic loading strength of the soil. It is widely accepted that a threshold stress exists, above which, the induced stress generates large shear deformation and; below which, the soil deformation become stabilized irrespective of the number of loading applications. Previous studies into the behaviour of fine-grained subgrade under cyclic loading had mainly involved slow loading rate. The advance in transportation technology and the required efficiency of transporting goods and commuting passengers demands higher train speed and heavier loads. Consequently, better understanding on the behaviour of fine-grained subgrade under higher rate of loading (i. e. cyclic frequency) will be necessary as it influences the build-up of excess pore water pressure and strain accumulation of subgrade soil, hence the stability of the railway track. In addition, current design approaches to the railway tracks foundation of fine-grained subgrade have largely been empirical or semi-empirical unique to a range of geological characteristic, operating and traffic condition. The rationalization and reformulation of design approach may be required if general design means will to be devised. In this research, an in-depth study of undrained triaxial testing on the behaviour of a typical fine-grained reconstituted kaolinite clay soil, simulating the characteristic subgrade responses exhibit under the passing axles / wheel load of the contemporary train speed was performed and discussed. Four series of both static and cyclic undrained triaxial test were conducted. The static undrained triaxial test provides the behavioural benchmark and a prior indication on the maximum stress level from which the cyclic stress level can be apportioned. The cyclic undrained triaxial test simulates the behaviour of clay subgrade under a large number of passing axles/wheel load. The results of the testing described and characterized the stress / strain behaviour for saturated kaolinite clay of various consolidated state and stress history. In particular, it described the general concept of cyclic stress equilibrium state and resilient state, and detailed the characteristic pattern of the line of cyclic stress equilibrium state which dictates the way in identifying the threshold stress (or critical level of cyclic stress). The study demonstrated that, using effective stress analysis, the threshold stress can be obtained for clay under high cyclic loading rate. In conjunction with the stress response, the deformation and resilient characteristics of various series of cyclic undrained triaxial tests carried out on the saturated clay was described. Apart from highlighting and confirming the influence of consolidated state and stress history on the threshold stress and deformation characteristics, influence of the cyclic loading frequency simulating higher train travelling speed was also investigated and examined. Using the framework of critical state soil mechanics, the study described the existence of cyclic stress equilibrium state surface CSESS within the stress state boundary surface SSBS for saturated clay under cyclic undrained compression. A form of analytical / theoretical model was established which enables threshold stress to be ascertained without resort to lengthy laboratory testing at the preliminary design stage of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> <b>foundation</b> design. Developed from the “original Cam-clay” model and validated by the cyclic triaxial test data on reconstituted kaolin clay, the theoretical model which described the CSESS enables the prediction of threshold stress (or critical level of cyclic stress) of general saturated clay soil under undrained cyclic compression to be made from the fundamental properties of the soil, based on the designed consolidated state and the stress history of subgrade soil. In addition, this study proposed a new approach which rationalized and reformulated the current state of design and management process of railway track substructure involved clay subgrade. The rational approach was developed based on the comprehension of “lower-bound threshold stress” and potential strengthening and densification of fine-grained subgrade soil through progressive and deliberate incremental loading of the track foundation. Concept of “Managing current lower-bound threshold stress” for clay subgrade was elaborated. The readily use of the developed theoretical model and design charts for predicting the threshold stress could offer a key advantage for the new approach over current practices...|$|E

High- speed trains and heavy train loads are normally accompanied with strong vibrations in the track-ground system, which increases the risk of train derailment and track damages.

Fasteners and the ballast layer were modelled using 1 -D massless discrete elements – springs and dampers. Sleepers were modelled as elastic beams. The embankment was reflected approximately by a rectangular prism with unmovable side and bottom boundary surfaces. Moving load was applied using simplified FE models of railway vehicles.
