The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|E
60|$|Is {{all this}} sentiment? <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> just now: by well-used sentiment, and well-used sorrow, great nations live.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good. I {{suppose you}} <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to you, one morning, {{when we were}} talking of Miss Silvester at Windygates?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou, Holly," [...] {{she said}} quickly, [...] "who art ever of a cavilling and {{suspicious}} mind, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> but now, believest that I lie to thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well! <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> to you, Countess. A rupture {{between your}} {{brother and the}} King will save Theos. You understand?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then I gave it up, and sat {{trying to}} <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> {{to her the}} evening before, and hoping I had not {{committed}} myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right. <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> about {{shooting}} the prisoner if he shows a disposition to turn rusty, {{and keep him}} in front of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to {{you about}} your report at Christmas, Mike?" [...] said Mr. Jackson, folding the lethal {{document}} and replacing it in its envelope.|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. How clever of you {{to guess}} it! [Takes up his hat and cane.] Good-bye, Lady Chiltern! You will <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to you, won’t you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I say that? <b>I</b> don't <b>remember</b> now <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>I</b> know {{he made me}} angry. Come, let us trot on. They {{can take}} the hounds home without us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he concluded, [...] "you {{must look}} after yourself, only <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said.</b> By the bye, Chetwode, I {{am going to}} repose {{a certain amount of}} {{confidence}} in you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{your back}} up again; I don't mean to offend you, I tell you; however, if you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> to you, it may prevent much trouble to you:"--and Ussher {{walked into the}} house.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} done with me yet," [...] she resumed with a smile. [...] "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> of my errand, when I first came in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} how I looked," [...] he answered, in a whisper. [...] "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{when you and}} the doctor were talking of the Dream?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> when I {{knocked at}} your door last night? About {{one who was}} your friend once, and who stood {{on the verge of}} destruction?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must excuse me," [...] he said. [...] "Harcutt would {{recognise}} me, and I do {{not wish}} to be pointed out everywhere as a would-be assassin. <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> and avoid Sabin and his parasites as you would the devil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Then <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tell you,” <b>said</b> Appleby, who {{laid his}} hand on the man’s shoulder, spoke softly and rapidly, until the latter nodded.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] she interrupted, [...] "and a very {{dangerous}} one. I do not wish you to meet him. The chances are {{that he would not}} notice you if he saw you, but it is better to run no risks. You will <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said?</b> A man of his strange views and principles is to be avoided--especially by an impressionable boy like you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear, don't you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before? Of course I-' 'But how can you?--the wash-up?' 'Do {{you think}} that worries? Anyway, I'll give the job to Father Roubeau, here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I saw her {{the morning}} {{following}} her marriage. I do not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> but I believe I spoke {{what was in}} my mind. She fainted, and I left her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to {{you when}} we parted at Tadmor? I said, 'Be comforted, Amelius, the end is not yet.' And I said again, 'You {{will come back to}} me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He laughed. [...] "My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "if {{anyone in}} the world ever needed sleep to-night, it is you. I am going to send you up to lie down at once. You must promise me, promise faithfully, that you will <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> that you will say this to {{yourself}}: 'The reprieve will come!' It is the truth, mind. Say that to yourself and sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} little would {{be gained by}} that, my love," [...] {{returned}} the smiling uncle, wiping his eyes at the same instant. [...] "The second thoughts of ladies usually confirm the first, in such matters. God bless you, Grace;--Templemore, may Heaven have you, too, in its holy keeping. <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> and to-morrow we will converse further on the subject. Does Eve know of this, my niece?" ...|$|R
60|$|Walter and I are engaged. It {{happened}} last night when we were sitting out in the moonlight under the silver maple on the lawn. I cannot write down what he said--the words are too sacred and beautiful to be kept anywhere but in my own heart forever and ever as long as I live. And <b>I</b> don't <b>remember</b> just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> But we understood each other perfectly at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never!" [...] {{his wife}} repeated. And {{she went on}} without pity. [...] "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to you long ago--that evening, just before their marriage, when Charlotte had so {{suddenly}} turned up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I am {{more afraid}} of his {{interference}} than I am of Sir Percival's violence. <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{to you in the}} library. Whatever you do, Laura, don't make an enemy of the Count!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll go," [...] said Jack, {{after a few}} whispered {{words to}} Randy. [...] "But you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> both of you. If this is a trick we'll {{see to it that}} you get the worst of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Oh yes, I {{had lots}} of talks with Berger about the war. You see, I might say that I knew Victor Berger before I was born, since he knew my mother and father. But <b>I</b> don't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> he <b>said</b> on those talks; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{distinctly}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> but his views did not impress me at all. I was far more interested in my views anyhow than I was in his." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Renounce her I do," [...] he cried, [...] "now and forevermore! Henceforth I am no countryman of yours. And if {{a day of}} repentance {{should come}} for this evil, <b>remember</b> well <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> to you." ...|$|R
60|$|And now <b>I</b> shall tell <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw happen. Please <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> of {{the huge}} paws of Mr. Pike, the fingers much longer than mine and twice as thick, the wrists massive-boned, the arm-bones and the shoulder-bones of the same massive order. With one flip of his right hand, with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> might call an open-handed, lifting, upward slap, save {{that it was the}} ends of the fingers only that touched Larry's face, he lifted Larry into the air, {{sprawling}} him backward on his back across his sea-bag.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to you--just as {{straight}} as my course always is--before we went up there, before our lovely drive? I stated to you that I felt--that I always feel--my great hearty hungry public behind me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young ladies, you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{to you a}} week ago. I {{am sorry}} this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I never break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Waltham, I'll {{be ready}} for you. But <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> We came out here {{to have a good}} time, and I am not going to allow you to spoil it for Miss Laning or for anybody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Brownlow in a mild way {{suggested}} that nothing {{should be said}} to Edith, and Sir Gregory gave half a promise {{that he would be}} silent. But it was against his nature not to speak. When the moment came the temptation to say something that could be easily said, and which would produce some mild excitement, was always too strong for him. [...] "My dear," [...] he said, one evening, when Edith was hovering round his chair, [...] "you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> once <b>said</b> to you about your cousin Walter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} will, Roger. Don't you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> once <b>said?</b> In {{some respects}} he is a worse chap than Nick Jasniff {{and a good}} deal worse than Gus Plum ever was." [...] And that Dave was correct will be proved in the next volume of this series, to be entitled, [...] "Dave Porter and His Classmates; or, For the Honor of Oak Hall." [...] In that volume we shall meet all our friends again, and also Laura Porter, and learn how Dave met the underhanded work of Link Merwell and what was the result.|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] he said, [...] "when {{they found}} the gates shut they <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said,</b> that <b>I</b> was going to warn Count Charles and his friends, {{and went back to}} observe what these were doing; and the sight of their {{retainers}} going towards the gate must have told them which way they intended to leave; and they, no doubt, went down and hid up near the gate to watch the conflict, and to take advantage of it, if a chance offered, to get off themselves." ...|$|R
