5|$|Iwata's {{proficiency}} with programming quickly {{placed him}} in high esteem among fellow programmers and gamers alike. He would often {{continue to work on}} weekends and holidays because of his passion. With the company on the verge of bankruptcy, Iwata was promoted to president of HAL in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo's then-President, Hiroshi Yamauchi. With assistance from Nintendo, Iwata helped turn the company around from its ¥1.5billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years. Lacking experience in management, Iwata put a lot of effort into learning how to better himself, often <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> on the topic and seeking advice from others.|$|E
5|$|The college's {{students}} {{became known}} as free spirited outsiders within the university for their different dress, apathetic demeanor, and greater interest in <b>reading</b> <b>books.</b> The college's demographics were {{unlike the rest of}} the university, with students largely not from Wisconsin and disproportionately of Jewish and East Coast families. The college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy, especially within Wisconsin. The students lived and worked with their teachers, called advisers, in Adams Hall, away from the heart of the university. They had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades, though they read from a common syllabus. The advisers taught primarily through tutorial instead of lectures. Extracurricular groups, including philosophy, law, and theater clubs, were entirely student-led.|$|E
5|$|The player character's {{proficiency}} with a {{skill is}} increased by practice, training, and study. Practice involves performing the specific actions {{associated with a}} given skill, which gradually raises the character's proficiency in that skill. Raising weapon skills requires striking an enemy with the appropriate weapon; raising armor skills requires being struck while wearing the appropriate type of armor; etc. Training involves paying cash to non-player characters (NPCs) in exchange for immediate proficiency increases in that skill. Study requires <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> found in the game, some of which will immediately raise a skill when read. Weaponry skills affect the character's chance to hit. Armor skills affect the defensive strength of the armor. Other skills affect proficiency at other actions such as potion-making, running, lockpicking, etc.|$|E

5|$|The {{program was}} {{initially}} proposed in 1964. The first version {{was produced by}} William Peters, with production supervised by executive producer Fred W. Friendly. Upon accepting the assignment, Peters began his research by <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> and consulting with experts in the field. Peters suggested that the program focus exclusively on gay men and that he cover lesbians in a second program, and Friendly agreed. Principal filming took place starting {{in the fall of}} 1964 and continued through early 1965. Peters interviewed men in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Charlotte and New York City, accumulating 30 hours of footage.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1890, Bronisława — who {{a few months earlier}} had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist — invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her {{a year and a half}} longer to gather the necessary funds. She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again. All that time she continued to educate herself, <b>reading</b> <b>books,</b> exchanging letters, and being tutored herself. In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw. She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891. She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw's Old Town. The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of his}} life, Rimsky-Korsakov {{combined}} his {{composition and}} teaching with {{a career in the}} Russian military—at first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. This love of the sea might have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical tableau Sadko (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) and Scheherazade. Through his service as Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law, Maximilian Steinberg.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper explores {{how people}} <b>read</b> <b>books</b> online. Instead of observing individuals, we analyze usage of an online digital library of children’s books (the International Children’s Digital Library). We go beyond typical webpage-centric {{analysis}} {{to focus on}} <b>book</b> <b>reading</b> {{in an attempt to}} understand how people <b>read</b> <b>books</b> from websites. We propose a definition of <b>reading</b> a <b>book</b> (in comparison to others who visit the website), and report a number of observations about the use of the library in question...|$|R
5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by <b>reading</b> <b>books.</b> It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{localized}} for the West by Atlus USA. The project leader was Bill Alexander, the lead translator was Sammy Matsushima, while dialogue editing was handled by Mike Meeker. As with their other localizations such {{as for the}} Persona series, the team tried to stay faithful to the original text. This proved easier than for the Persona series as its fictional setting meant there were no cultural in-jokes {{that would not be}} understood outside Japan. The localization took place from 2006 to 2007: the project was an unusual one for Atlus, as it was an entirely new intellectual property from a studio that was still little known in the West. When tasked with localizing the game for Western markets, the team were told that the game had a Shakespearean feel, so Matsushima created a script that reflected that: with the concept of a play in mind, the dialogue was written to give a noble feel to the characters, in addition to fairy tale elements fitting in with its frame story of a girl <b>reading</b> <b>books.</b> For his part, Meeker read King Lear and A Midsummer Night's Dream to find the correct style for his writing, in addition to reading Beowulf to properly capture the narrative's darker elements.|$|E

25|$|Although Torishima {{grew up in}} Niigata Prefecture, he did {{not like}} the people there as they had nothing in common to talk about, so he spent his youth alone <b>reading</b> <b>books.</b> He said that because he could not get into a university, he moved to Tokyo to enter a prep school, where he was liberated having found people that were smarter than himself and shared his interests.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Marc Brown was {{approached}} by WGBH and PBS {{about the possibility of}} adapting the Arthur books into a television series.

25|$|William {{had little}} formal {{education}} {{in his early}} years, relying heavily on <b>reading</b> <b>books.</b> At the age of 13, he left home {{to work as a}} store clerk in Utica, and later Mansfield, Ohio.

First Sergeant Williams recognized Gavin's potential and made him his assistant; Gavin was promoted to corporal six months later.|$|E
25|$|London {{stayed in}} the Klondike for almost a year, living {{temporarily}} in the frontier town of Dawson City, before moving to a nearby winter camp, where he spent the winter in a temporary shelter <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> he had brought: Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species and John Milton's Paradise Lost. In the winter of 1898, Dawson City (today mostly deserted) was a city comprising about 30,000 miners, a saloon, an opera house, and a street of brothels.|$|E
60|$|Rob Fletcher {{always came}} {{and listened to}} the letters in silence while the others buzzed and commented. Rob, so the Harbour folk said, was much changed.

There was something wrong with a man who <b>read</b> <b>books</b> when there was a plenty of other amusements. Jacob Radnor had <b>read</b> <b>books</b> all one winter and had drowned himself in the spring--jumped overboard from his dory at the herring nets. And that was what came of books, mark you.|$|R

25|$|Little {{is known}} with {{certainty}} concerning the Classic Maya priesthood. Iconographically, {{there can be}} no serious doubt but that the aged, ascetic figures depicted as writing and <b>reading</b> <b>books,</b> aspersing and inaugurating dignitaries and kings, and overseeing human sacrifice, represent professional priests and high priests at court. Certain hieroglyphic titles of noblemen have been interpreted as priestly ones (e.g., ajk'uhuun, possibly 'worshipper', yajaw k'ahk 'master of fire'). The king (k'uhul ajaw or 'holy lord'), too, acted ex officio as a priest.|$|E
