5|$|Another document, {{this one}} {{preserved}} in an Irish memoranda roll {{dating to the}} reign of King Henry VI (reigned 1422–1461), records that after John's Irish expedition of 1210, Donnchadh controlled extensive territory in County Antrim, namely the settlements of Larne and Glenarm with 50 carucates of land in between, a territory similar to the later barony of Glenarm Upper.

40|$|Adults and 6 -year-old and 11 -year-old {{children}} {{were presented with}} informa-tion about situations in which one child either helped someone (kindness) or gave something to someone (altruism), with subjects allocating <b>rewards</b> <b>for</b> dif-ferent actors. Younger children used an additive principle by allocating greater <b>rewards</b> <b>for</b> behavior which led to positive consequences for the actor or avoided negative consequences. Older children and adults utilized a discounting princi-ple by allocating greater <b>rewards</b> <b>for</b> behavior which initially led to no reward or which occurred under the threat of harm. Younger and older children allocated greater <b>rewards</b> <b>for</b> altruistic behavior following a previous obligation (facilitory obligation) to {{the recipient of the}} act, whereas adults allocated greater <b>rewards</b> <b>for</b> behavior toward a recipient who previously denied a favor to the actor (inhibitory obligation). Subjects at all ages allocated greater <b>rewards</b> <b>for</b> actors whose previous behavior was consistently kind or altruistic (high consistency) or who were kind or altruistic to persons other than the recipient described in the stories (low distinctiveness). These results were discussed in terms of causal schemes underlying preconventional and conven-tional moral judgments and the use of covariation principles in inferences of causality.
