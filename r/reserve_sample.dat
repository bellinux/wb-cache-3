40|$|High-resolution {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass {{spectrometry}} (HR-ICP-MS) {{can be used to}} measure metal ion levels in whole blood, al-though the accuracy and repeatability of this method is not yet known in the clinical setting. In this study, chromium, cobalt and titanium ion levels were measured in three whole blood samples, each collected at the same moment from 101 patients undergoing total hip arthro-plasty with a metal-on-metal (MoM) bearing. The first sample (purge sample) had direct contact with the metal needle used during inser-tion of the catheter, whereas the second sample (reference sample) and the third sample (<b>reserve</b> <b>sample)</b> did not. The absolute difference between reference samples and reserve samples was greater than the limit of quantification of the HR-ICP-MS device for all three ions (0. 84 versus 0. 35 mg/L for chromium, 0. 74 versus 0. 07 for cobalt, and 0. 88 versus 0. 70 mg/L for titanium), although the levels were very small in most cases, they exceeded the clinical significant threshold in 19 to 31 % of the cases. No clinically significant difference was observed between reference samples and purge samples. Therefore, HR-ICP-MS is a clinically acceptable method to evaluate metal ion levels in blood following hip replacement with an MoM prosthesis, and {{it is not necessary to}} discard the purge sample to obtain repeat-able results...|$|E

In this study, the back-calculation of traffic-related PM 10 emission factors based on roadside concentration measurements was analyzed. Experimental conditions were considered to ensure the success of back-calculation. Roadside measurements were taken in a street canyon in Shanghai, China. Concentrations from a background site were often found to exceed the measured concentrations at the roadside on polluted days as more errors occurred in the background concentrations. On clean days, these impacts were negligible. Thus, only samples collected on clean days were used in back-calculation. The mean value from back-calculation was 0. 138 g/km, which was {{much smaller than the}} results obtained using official emission models. Emission factors for light-duty vehicles (LDV), medium-duty vehicles (MDV), heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), and motorcycles were approximately 0. 121, 0. 427, 0. 445, and 0. 096 g/km, respectively.

40|$|Plantation and {{secondary}} forests form increasingly important {{components of the}} global forest cover, but our current knowledge about their potential contribution to biodiversity conservation is limited. We surveyed understory plant and carabid species assemblages at three distinct regions in temperate northeastern China, dominated by mature forest (Changbaishan Nature <b>Reserve,</b> <b>sampled</b> in 2011 and 2012), secondary forest (Dongling Mountain, sampled in 2011 and 2012), and forest plantation habitats (Bashang Plateau, sampled in 2006 and 2007), respectively. The α-diversity of both taxonomic groups was highest in plantation forests of the Bashang Plateau. Beetle α-diversity was lowest, but plant and beetle species turnover peaked in the secondary forests of Dongling Mountain, while habitats in the Changbaishan Nature Reserve showed the lowest turnover rates for both taxa. Changbaishan Nature Reserve harbored the highest proportion of forest specialists. Our results suggest that in temperate regions of northern China, the protected larch plantation forest established over extensive areas might play a considerable role in maintaining a high biodiversity in relation to understory herbaceous plant species and carabid assemblages, which {{can be seen as}} indicators of forest disturbance. The high proportion of phytophagous carabids and the rarity of forest specialists reflect the relatively homogenous, immature status of the forest ecosystems on the Bashang Plateau.

30|$|The {{analyses}} revealed that at all three sampling sites (I–III) maize pollen was collected by honey-bees. Site I and II were located within the nature <b>reserve.</b> <b>Sampling</b> site III was surrounded by maize fields and, thus, reflects a maximum input of maize pollen. Although there was a rich supply of competitive flowering plants, especially in the nature reserve, the bees chose maize blossoms and collected pollen. The amount of collected pollen varied by day and by bee colony. There were pollen pellets containing 100  % maize pollen as well as pollen pellets without any maize pollen, and samples that ranged between these extremes. The daily course of pollen sampling indicates that maize pollen was collected by honey-bees especially during bad weather conditions when no other pollen was available. In 2007, the maximum percentage of maize pollen in a daily sample (20  %) was found at sampling location III on July 26 th {{at the end of}} a cold, damp weather period. In some of the pollen pellets no maize pollen was found, especially during the middle of August when a lot of plants other than maize were flowering intensely and the maize bloom decreased. Accordingly, in these days the amount of maize pollen was very low. The relative portion of maize pollen to total pollen varied between < 0.1  % up to 20  % in the daily samples and between 0.1  % and 0.3  % in the overall samples. At site I, the overall sample of pellets contained 1.77 million maize pollen resulting in an amount of 4.0 million maize pollen for the seasonal collection in 2007. At site II, 3.76 million maize pollen were found in the overall sample resulting in an amount of 8.5 million maize pollen for the season.

We examined trends in combined fish abundance and biomass (catch per unit effort), species richness and diversity, size structure, trophic level and species composition of the community. Our results showed the CIMR fish community continued to change throughout the study period as (1) abundance and biomass increased, (2) mean body size and trophic level increased and (3) species composition changed according to a linear model. Relative to nearby fished areas the CIMR fish community had (1) higher abundance and biomass, (2) lower species diversity and higher taxonomic distinctness, (3) larger relative body size and (4) no difference in mean trophic level. We found clear evidence of spillover of fish from the CIMR to the adjacent fishery as commercial fish yields at the MPA border (< 0. 5 km from the boundary) increased continuously during the study period, despite being locally depleted due to fishing effort concentration (fishing the line). Furthermore, fish size and diversity at the border were intermediate between the CIMR and other fished zones, suggesting that this is a transitional zone influenced by this MPA. Our results show that changes in community abundance, biomass, size structure and species composition provide a clear and interpretable view of MPA recovery. Diversity indices are also useful; however, their interpretation is more difficult. We conclude that the creation of the CIMR has had a positive effect on the exploitable fish community and that there is evidence of exportation of biomass to the surrounding fishery. We highlight the advantage of using multiple community metrics to study changes in fish communities, yet recommend the need for caution when interpreting them...|$|R

DDT use is restricted/banned under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Passive air sampling using polyurethane foam was conducted in South Africa to evaluate the presence and trends of DDT and its metabolites. Three sampling sites were used, namely, Barberspan Nature Reserve (rural agricultural), Vanderbijlpark (urban industrial) and Molopo Nature Reserve (isolated nature <b>reserve).</b> <b>Sampling</b> was conducted for a period of one year in 2008. Back trajectories from the three sampling sites were generated using HYSPILT to determine the sources of DDT metabolites to the sampling areas. Forward trajectories were also generated to determine the movement, distribution, and fate of DDT from the areas under Indoor residual spray of DDT for malaria control in South Africa and Swaziland. Chemical analysis was conducted by the RECETOX (Mazaryk University) in the Czech Republic. DDT metabolites (o,p’-DDE, p’p’-DDE, o. p’-DDD, p,p’-DDD, o,p’-DDT p,p’-DDT) were analysed using a GC-ECD (HP 5890). Vanderbijlpark had the highest concentrations of DDT metabolites throughout the year. Barberspan had the second highest concentration and Molopo the least. Seasonal changes in concentration were much the same at the three sites. %p,p’-DDT of ΣDDT is consistent with IRS spraying months in South Africa and Swaziland. A combinations of backward and forward trajectories, together with the temporal pattern of change of the %p,p’-DDT of ΣDDT support the deduction that DDT sampled from the three study sites (to some degree) came from IRS areas in South Africa and Swaziland. The presence of DDT in Molopo Nature Reserve and Barberspan is evidence of long-range transportation over dry semi-desert areas. Back-trajectories indicate the possible source of DDT were the IRS areas in the provinces of Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal. Some air masses to the sampling sites came from the sprayed areas. The forward trajectories also revealed that the DDT sprayed during IRS could undergo LRT. The DDT metabolites were able to travel to neighbouring countries such as Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Master...|$|R
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} <b>reserved</b> areas. Taking <b>samples</b> from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|R
