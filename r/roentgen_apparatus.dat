This was necessary, owing {{to the fact that}} there was no <b>Roentgen</b> <b>apparatus</b> in the colony, and it was found {{impossible}} to discover and extract the slugs with which the great proportion were wounded.|$|E
50|$|In 1901, the Christie Management Committee {{agreed to}} the request of Dr Robert Biggs Wild to spend £50 on the {{equipment}} necessary to test the efficacy of X ray treatment, after promising results reported from London and from three patients treated in the Physics Laboratory of Professor Schuster locally in Owens College. The <b>Roentgen</b> <b>apparatus</b> was purchased, but no records survive of treatment, and by 1907 the equipment was no longer being used (it {{was given to the}} Skin Hospital in 1910). By 1905, Dr Wild had become interested in the therapeutic use of the newly discovered radium and experimented, once more with aid from Professor Schuster, on three patients. Radium was expensive, however, and the management refused to purchase any more until the results of tests from London hospitals were available. By 1914, a leading local doctor, Sir William Milligan, had begun a campaign in the 'Manchester Guardian' to raise funds for radium treatment. Appealing to a mixture of local pride and the contemporary enthusiasm for the curative powers of radium, an appeal was launched, on the advice of Ernest Rutherford, for £25,000. An initial contribution of £2000 from local brewer Edward Holt was not initially much emulated, but following the intervention of the Mayor, a series of 'Radium days' were organized which eventually raised enough money to start a small Radium Institute, initially housed in the Manchester Royal Infirmary. In 1921 it moved to new premises in Nelson Street donated by Sir Edward and Lady Holt, and became the Manchester and District Radium Institute.By contrast with the dispersed and competitive provision of London radiotherapy, Manchester became the first provider of a centralised radiotherapy service, which would have long-lasting effects on the patterns of British cancer care.|$|E
40|$|The present article {{concerns}} {{an investigation}} of the effects on different species of bacteria of X-rays produced at 50 kv. The object of the investigation was threefold: (1) to determine the rate of destruction of the bacteria by the X-rays, (2) to determine the effect of different initial concentrations of bacteria on the rate of destruction, and (3) to determine the dosage of X-rays necessary to destroy 63 per cent of the bacteria (or, conversely, the dosage permitting 37 per cent sur-vival). This dosage is known as the " 37 per cent dose " or the "mean lethal dose. " MATERIALS AND METHODS Equipment. A Wappler <b>Roentgen</b> <b>apparatus,</b> Bellevue model, utilizing a Machlett 3 berillium window X-ray tube and operating at a peak voltage of 50 kv, was used in this study. To cut off the longer wave-length portions of the spectrum, filtration with four sheets of aluminum foil (each 0. 00065 of an inch thick, i. e., 0. 0026 of an inch in total thickness) was used. Measurements of dosage were made according to the procedure described by Proctor and Goldblith (1949). Organisms. The following organisms were exposed to X-ray irradiation: (a...|$|E

40|$|In 1932, Zinsser and Castaneda (1) {{described}} {{a method of}} obtaining large amounts of Mexican typhus Rickettsiae, utilizing the peritoneal suspension obtained by washing the scraped peritoneum of white male rats with a 0. 2 per cent formalinized citrate solution. In order to lower {{the resistance of the}} animals, they were irradiated previous to inoculation, using a high voltage <b>Roentgen</b> therapy <b>apparatus.</b> The following factors were employed: 170 kv. peak constant potential (equivalent to 190 kv. peak pulsating current); 80 cm. distance; ~ ram. copper filter; 8 ma. With this setting, 10 Roentgen units per minute, measured in air, was obtained. The most suitable exposure for the rats was found to be 600 r; that is, a 60 minute treatment time. Immediately after irradiation, the rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with a suspension of Mexican typhus virus from a guinea pig's infected tunica vaginalis, which was not richer in Rickettsiae than the average obtained in routine transfer. By this technique, the authors mentioned developed a sure and practical method of obtaining a highly concentrated suspension of specific Mexican typhus Rickettsiae which they used principally in the preparation of typhus vaccine and specific immune horse serum. The use of this vaccine in Mexico by Varela and Parada (2) and by Sanchez Casco (3) and the study of the therapeutic value of the serum by the Mexican Commission headed by Dr. Landa have given such promising results that it would seem advisable to recommend the extension of this method to those countries affected by the disease. * At the time of doing this work, Dr. MacchiaveUo held a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation...|$|R
5000|$|According to his {{biography}} in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition of 1911, Roentgen {{was not a}} great cabinetmaker: [...] "His forms were often clumsy, ungraceful, and commonplace; his furniture lacked the artistry of the French and the English cabinetmakers of the great period which {{came to an end}} about 1790. His bronzes were poor in design and coarse in execution; his work, in short, is tainted by commercialism. As an inlayer, however, he holds a position of high distinction. His marquetry is bolder and more vigorous than that of Riesener, who in other respects soared far above him. As an adroit devisor of mechanism he fully earned a reputation which former generations rated more highly than the modern critic, with his facilities for comparison, is prepared to accept. On the mechanical side he produced, with the help of Kintzing, many long-cased and other clocks with ingenious indicating and registering <b>apparatus.</b> <b>Roentgen</b> delighted in architectural forms, and his marquetry more often than not represents those scenes from classical mythology which were the dear delight of the 18th century." [...] He is well represented at the V&A Museum in London, and other collections.|$|R
