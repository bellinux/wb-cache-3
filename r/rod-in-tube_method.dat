In this study we report on surface crystallization phenomena and propose a solution for the fabrication of long and robust tellurite glass fibers. The bulk tellurite glasses of interest were prepared by melting and quenching techniques. Tellurite glass preforms and fibers were fabricated by suction casting and <b>rod-in-tube</b> drawing <b>methods,</b> respectively. The surfaces of the tellurite bulk glass samples and of the drawn fibers prepared under different controlled atmospheres were examined by X-ray diffraction. When the tellurite glass fibers were drawn in ambient air containing water vapor, four primary kinds of small crystals were found to appear on the fiber surface, alpha-TeO(2), gamma-TeO(2), Zn(2) Te(3) O(8) and Na(2) Zn(3) (CO(3)) (4) center dot 3 H(2) O. A mechanism for this surface crystallization is proposed and a solution described, using an ultra-dry oxygen gas atmosphere to effectively prevent surface crystallization during fiber drawing.

40|$|We {{report on}} germania and alumina dopant profile shift effects at {{preparation}} of compact optical fibers using packaging <b>methods</b> (Stack-and-Draw <b>method,</b> <b>Rod-in-Tube</b> (RiT) technique). The sintering of package hollow volume by viscous flow {{results in a}} shift of the core-pitch ratio in all-solid microstructured fibers. The ratio is increased by about 5 % {{in the case of}} a hexagonal package. The shift by diffusion effects of both dopants is simulated for typical slow speed drawing parameters. Thermodynamic approximations of surface dissociation of germania doped silica suggest the need of an adequate undoped silica barrier layer to prevent an undesired bubble formation at fiber drawing. In contrast, alumina doping does not estimate critical dissociation effects with vaporous aluminium oxide components. We report guide values of diffusion length of germania and alumina for the drawing process by kinetic approximation. The germania diffusion involves a small core enlargement, typically in the sub-micrometer scale. Though, the alumina diffusion enlarges it by a few micrometers. A drawn pure alumina preform core rod transforms to an amorphous aluminosilicate core with a molar alumina concentration of only about 50 % and a non-gaussian concentration profile...|$|R
40|$|A {{glass-ceramic}} {{optical fiber}} containing Ba 2 TiSi 2 O 8 nanocrystals fabricated using a novel {{combination of the}} melt-in-tube method and successive heat treatment is reported for the first time. For the melt-in-tube method, fibers act as a precursor at the drawing temperature for which the cladding glass is softened while the core glass is melted. It is demonstrated experimentally that following heat treatment, Ba 2 TiSi 2 O 8 nanocrystals with diameters below 10 nm are evenly distributed throughout the fiber core. Comparing to the conventional <b>rod-in-tube</b> <b>method,</b> the melt-in-tube method is superior in terms of controllability of crystallization {{to allow for the}} fabrication of low loss glass-ceramic fibers. When irradiated using a 1030 nm femtosecond laser, an enhanced green emission at a wavelength of 515 nm is observed in the glass-ceramic fiber, which demonstrates second harmonic generation of a laser action in the fabricated glass-ceramic fibers. Therefore, this new glass-ceramic fiber not only provides a highly promising development for frequency conversion of lasers in all optical fiber based networks, but the melt-in-tube fabrication method also offers excellent opportunities for fabricating a wide range of novel glass-ceramic optical fibers for multiple future applications including fiber telecommunications and lasers. </p...|$|E

The performance of these glasses was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC), visible/near-infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy and infrared transmission spectroscopy. These glasses appeared to have excellent thermal stability and transmission properties. There was no crystallization peak on the DSC curve for the two glass compositions, namely, Ge 23 Te 65 Se 12 and Ge 24 Te 65 Se 11, indicating a notably enhanced resistance to crystallization and a maximum value of Tg at 188 for the glass composition Ge 24 Te 65 Se 11. The optical transmission window was from 1. 8 μm in the bandgap region to 18 μm in the phonon region. A distillation process that could effectively eliminate the absorption bands in the IR region was used for these glasses. The fabrication (<b>rod-in-tube</b> <b>method)</b> and fiber drawing were both conducted with glass compositions of Ge 23 Te 65 Se 12 and Ge 24 Te 65 Se 11 as cladding and core, respectively.
