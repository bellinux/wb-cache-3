Because these variables, {{with the exception of}} future exchange rates, can be known with almost complete certainty {{at the time of the}} decision, it is argued that a risk-adverse corporate treasurer should eliminate the <b>remaining</b> <b>currency</b> risk by systematically covering foreign currency loans or deposits. © 1980 JIBS.

40|$|Brazilian {{community}} development banks (CDBs) have established various coordinated financial mechanisms aiming to restructure poor and peripheral local economies. Their development strategy includes {{an instrument to}} facilitate access to microfinance and a community <b>currency,</b> <b>combined</b> with the definition of vocational training programmes and support for business start- ups. Put together, these different activities constitute the endogenous and resilient territorial development strategy defined by CDBs. Little scientific literature {{has been devoted to}} the study of community currencies in this process. This article presents an overview of the symbolic meanings conveyed by the currency of Banco Palmas, the first and most prominent CDB. First, we present some historical and territorial characteristics of Banco Palmas. Second, we analyse the symbolic role of its currency: money as a bond/link (the building of the community on its territory); money as a medium for institutionalisation (of the community itself and to the exogenous actors, as to define a federative project); and finally money as a vector-catalyst (when the plasticity of money allows to explore its different formats and so, to adapt it to the new perspectives of community and territorial development) ...|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s, {{along the}} change in the system of {{functioning}} of the Polish economy a way of functioning of innovative mechanism has also been changed. Unfortunately, the market system had no impact on the increase of interest in technical progress. To the contrary; regress in that sphere has been noted. It has been caused i. a. by macroeconomic factors. The State policy, oriented at fighting inflation, creating the market, strengthening domestic <b>currency,</b> <b>combined</b> with the inefficient economy unable to adapt to the requirements of the market has resulted in deep recession. It proves that enterprises are unable to adapt to changed circumstances; {{one of the reasons for}} such a situation is insufficient innovative capacity. Some causes of regress in innovativeness of the economy are of microeconomica 1 nature. Among such factors the most detrimental is the shortage of money for developmental ventures. Among the determinants of technical progress one should mention organizational, legal and informational infrastructure. Despite the fact that in Wielkopolska region the infrastructure is well grounded and diversified, it is insufficient in view of economic requirements.

50|$|Unlike the Trizone, where {{rationing}} of food {{had ended}} since June 1948 {{with the introduction}} of a currency issued only in refinancing operations whereby the central bank only credited business operations really stipulated by businesses, the Soviet zone and succeeding East Germany continued rationing (for food till May 1958) and delivery compulsions. The new currency of the Soviet zone continued to be deliberately issued by authorities following communist prerogatives of rather wishful growth phantasies. Thus the authoritative over-issuance made the currency supply not reflecting the real level of business operations. The authorities' preferring communist-controlled production entities when distributing funds empowering them to buy a bigger share of the domestic product without having performed better. This arbitrary character of the <b>currency</b> <b>combined</b> with high taxation and authoritatively fixed maximum prices made it impossible for private enterprises to compensate for the defective quality of the currency by increasing margins and prices. So the remaining private sector was systematically disencouraged to increase efforts and remained thus under government compulsion, whereas shortages of consumer goods and government rationing of primary products and means of production perpetuated throughout the East German period.|$|R

40|$|I {{begin with}} a puzzle. It must {{certainly}} strike one as odd that the subject of postmodern constitutional law arises {{at a time when}} the actual arbiters of the Constitution - the federal judiciary and in particular the Supreme Court of the United States - appear to be more conservative than they have been for many years, and indeed, are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Postmodernism is often associated with what is new, innovative, and on the cutting edge of cultural development. Yet if we were to define the elements of a postmodern constitutional culture, it would be clear that one of the most central features of the present period - if the expression 2 ̆ 2 central 2 ̆ 2 still has any <b>remaining</b> <b>currency</b> in an era of postmodernism - is a judiciary which has no intention of being new or innovative in anything. Its intellectual leader, Justice Scalia, has even called for a constitutional jurisprudence of tradition, coupled with a return to an interpretive theory of plain meanings for statutes and original intention with respect to the Constitution...|$|R

50|$|A {{currency}} board enables governments {{to manage their}} external credibility problems and discipline their central banks by “tying their hands” with binding arrangements.
