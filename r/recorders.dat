5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice <b>recorders</b> {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight <b>recorders,</b> or the information they contain, before the <b>recorders</b> sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight <b>recorders</b> which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E

50|$|A train event <b>recorder</b> (also called On-Train Monitoring <b>Recorder</b> OTMR or On-Train Data <b>Recorder</b> OTDR in the United Kingdom, Event <b>Recorder</b> System ERS, Event <b>Recorder</b> Unit ERU, {{or simply}} Event <b>Recorder</b> ER) is {{a device that}} records data about the {{operation}} of train controls and performance in response to those controls and other train control systems. It {{is similar to the}} flight data <b>recorder</b> found on aircraft.|$|R
5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight <b>recorders</b> on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the <b>recorders</b> ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight <b>recorders</b> be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E

Presley asked Moore about using Music City <b>Recorders</b> in Nashville, but that suggestion never came to fruition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{contrabass}} <b>recorder</b> {{plays an}} octave {{lower than the}} ordinary bass (or [...] "basset") <b>recorder.</b> Until recently, {{it was the largest}} instrument in the <b>recorder</b> family, but since 1975 has been exceeded by the sub-great bass <b>recorder</b> (also called [...] "contra-great bass" [...] or simply [...] "contrabass" [...] <b>recorder)</b> in C2 and the sub-contrabass <b>recorder</b> in F1.|$|R
5|$|The altos and tenors {{are joined}} after seven bars by the fugue {{subject in the}} soprano voice. After a further seven bars the basses sing the last {{statement}} of the subject, accompanied by the full orchestra playing colla parte except for the two alto <b>recorders,</b> bringing the first fugato section to a close. The alto <b>recorders</b> play fragmented quaver figures in unison {{some of which are}} derived from the angular three-note continuo motif, leading into the first seven bar homophonic choral passage.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{movement}} {{is the second}} aria of the cantata, scored for soprano with an obbligato accompaniment provided by the two <b>recorders</b> playing in unison.|$|E

5|$|The orchestral ritornello punctuates the {{movement}} for a third and last time, the upper strings playing the semiquaver figures, with the detached quavers on the beat in the oboes and off the beat in the alto <b>recorders.</b> It leads directly into the homophonic coda {{in the last seven}} bars of {{the movement}}. With the same orchestral pairings as the fugato episode, the sopranos joyously sing out the beginning of the second fugue theme below trilling <b>recorders</b> before joining the polyphony of the other voices—with a last emphatic sospirans figure in the basses—for the final exultant rendition of the text.|$|E
5|$|The {{satellite}} {{also carried}} two wide-band video tape <b>recorders</b> (WBVTR) capable of storing up to 30 minutes of scanner or camera data, giving the spacecraft's sensors a near-global coverage capability.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of all 239 people on board, Flight 370 is the second deadliest {{incident}} involving a Boeing 777 and the second deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines' history, behind Flight 17 in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after the disappearance of Flight 370 and the downing of Flight 17; the airline was re-nationalised {{by the end of}} 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information promptly during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight <b>recorders,</b> including several issues raised four years earlier—but never mandated—following {{the loss of}} Air France Flight 447. In response to Flight 370's disappearance, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted new standards for aircraft position reporting over open ocean, extended recording time for cockpit voice <b>recorders,</b> and, from 2020, will require new aircraft designs to have a means to recover the flight <b>recorders,</b> or the information they contain, before the <b>recorders</b> sink below water.|$|E

5|$|At the Leipzig {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria. The cantata was transposed from C major to E-flat major at Leipzig, where the <b>recorders</b> may {{have been replaced by}} transverse flutes.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{scored the}} cantata for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)) and a chamber {{ensemble}} of Baroque instruments: two alto <b>recorders</b> (Fl), two violas da gamba (Vg), basso continuo. The duration is given as 23 minutes.|$|E

5|$|For the 1733 version, Bach used a {{somewhat}} more extended orchestra: the <b>recorders</b> are replaced by traversos (Fl) and they get separate parts in all four choral movements. In movements three and four the oboes are replaced by oboes d'amore (Oa). In the 10th movement (Suscepit Israel) the oboes replace the trumpet for the obbligato instrumental part.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a Hierarchical Scheduling Framework (HSF) <b>recorder</b> for Linux-based operating systems. The HSF <b>recorder</b> is a loadable kernel module that {{is capable of}} recording tasks and servers without requiring any kernel modifications. Hence, it complies with the reliability and stability requirements in the area of embedded systems where proven versions of Linux are preferred. The <b>recorder</b> is built upon the loadable real-time scheduler framework RESCH (REal-time SCHeduler). We evaluate our <b>recorder</b> by comparing the overhead of this solution against another (patched) <b>recorder.</b> Also, the tracing accuracy of the HSF <b>recorder</b> is tested by running a media-processing task together with periodic real-time Linux tasks in combination with servers. The tests are recorded with the HSF <b>recorder,</b> and the Ftrace <b>recorder,</b> in order to show the correctness of the experiments and the HSF <b>recorder</b> itself.
