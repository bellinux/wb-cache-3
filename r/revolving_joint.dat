40|$|We study an {{elementary}} problem of topological robotics: rotation of a line, which is fixed by a <b>revolving</b> <b>joint</b> at a base point: {{one wants to}} bring the line from its initial position to a final position by a continuous motion in the space. The final goal is to construct an algorithm which will perform this task once the initial and final positions are given. Any such motion planning algorithm will have instabilities, which are caused by topological reasons. A general approach to study instabilities of robot motion was suggested recently by the first named author. With any path-connected topological space X one associates a number TC(X), called the topological complexity of X. This number is of fundamental importance for the motion planning problem: TC(X) determines character of instabilities which have all motion planning algorithms in X. In the present paper we study the topological complexity of real projective spaces. In particular we compute TC(RP^n) for all n< 24. Our main result is that (for n distinct from 1, 3, 7) the problem of calculating of TC(RP^n) is equivalent to finding the smallest k such that RP^n can be immersed into the Euclidean space R^{k- 1 }.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel moveable mixed reality system with video-based tracking. The system {{consists of a}} high resolution video display which is mounted on the end effector of a passive kinematics chain with <b>revolving</b> <b>joints.</b> The monitor shows the live video stream with additional information superimposed in correct perspective onto the live scene. The user can freely move the system within a large work envelope and observe the target object from different viewpoints. Video and modelbased object tracking is applied to accurately recover metric information approximately in real time. Experimental {{results show that the}} system can be efficiently used for a number of applications including maintenance and repair, product design, and entertainment...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} modeling, {{simulating}} (transient), and designing controllers for turbocharged engine systems is presented. The method is specific to spark ignition (SI) engines equipped with pneumatic, spring diaphragm, wastegate actuators, with solenoid valve active boost control. The method <b>revolves</b> around the <b>joint</b> simulation {{of the engine}} with Ricardo WAVE software and the control algorithm with Simulink®. A component by component modeling approach is outlined using WAVE, including an experimental approach for modeling the solenoid valve. Controls are designed in MATLAB® using the Zeigler-Nichols’s PID tuning method, and a new approach that uses system identification and state-space techniques. Simulink® is then used to produce a transient simulation of the turbocharged engine system. Mechanical EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico. Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringRussell, John J.

30|$|The {{flexibility}} and ubiquity of wireless communication solutions {{played a very}} {{significant role in the}} tremendous growth of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet PCs and as such has been an important driver for technology breakthroughs in the last decade. The next, fifth generation of communication solutions (5 G) and the Internet-of-Things will require a radical rethinking of the wireless communication landscape to keep improving the spectral and energy efficiency at acceptable cost. State-of-the-art communication solutions already operate close to Shannon capacity. Therefore, in order to support ever-increasing throughput requirements, modern solutions mainly employ two strategies. The first strategy is to use more frequencies which requires increased flexibility at the radio layer, enabled by software radio. The other strategy is to use a more distributed approach; this means that networks are built using many very small cells that cooperate. This, naturally, requires complex networking protocols. Future 5 G communication innovations will hence <b>revolve</b> around <b>joint</b> innovation across all layers of the protocol stack, strongly requiring a robust approach for performance evaluation of such complex cross-layer designs. By their very nature, cross-layer communication solutions require mixing different disciplines. As a result, modeling, design, and testing should jointly consider analog, digital, baseband, RF, hardware, and software, resulting in high system complexity even at the level of a single radio. Comparing cross-layer solutions is often achieved by comparing algorithm A on hardware X with algorithm B on hardware Y in non-real-time ideal lab settings. Consequently, performance comparisons are confusing and only hold as far as the calibration methods and assumptions hold. In addition to that, implementation of full communication systems requires a very broad expertise, and it becomes impossible for a single researcher to know sufficiently well all aspects relevant for cross-layer design and implementation.|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} thought that when democratic states act wrongly, they should bear {{the costs of}} the harm they cause. However, since states are collective agents, their financial burdens pass on to their individual citizens. This fact raises important questions about the proper distribution of the state’s collective responsibility for its unjust policies. This article identifies two opposing models for sharing this collective responsibility in democracies: first, in proportion to citizens’ personal association with the unjust policy; second, by giving each citizen an equal share of the costs. Proportional distribution is compatible with the principle of fairness. And yet, both in the literature and in political praxis we find many supporters for the equal sharing of the costs of unjust policies in democracies. How can equal distribution be defended on normative grounds? This article develops a defense that is grounded in citizens’ associative obligations. I argue that, at least in some democracies, one of the intrinsic values of the civic bond <b>revolves</b> around the <b>joint</b> formation and execution of worthy political goals. This social good generates the political associative obligation to accept an equal distribution of the costs of unjust policies...|$|R
50|$|The movie <b>revolves</b> {{around a}} <b>Joint</b> family with its many {{problems}} and advantages and explicitly show how some people {{take advantage of}} the situation to create confusion. But Unity is Strength is the principle motivating factor. Lawyer Kutumba Rao (S.V.Ranga Rao) and his wife Annapurna (Kannamba) are eldest members of the family, his brother Ramanaiah (Relangi) his wife Anasuya (Suryakantham) live in the village. The duo treats their cousin brother Satyam (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) an idealist as their own sibling. Annapurna is a chronic patient so Satyam’s wife Susheela (Savitri) takes care of the family. Jealous of the bonding between Annapurna and Susheela, Anasuya creates a rift between them. Satyam & Susheela move to the village. Satyam propounds cooperative farming and prospers. Vaikuntham (Jaggaiah), the family’s rice mill manager, and their distant relative start spreading his evil influence over the family by taking the gullible Ramanaiah into the bad company which leads Anasuya to repent for her deeds. Satyam fights for the family and brings about the evil-doings of Vaikuntam to the notice of Kutumba Rao. The story ends on a happy note with Satyam and Susheela return to the joint family.|$|R
30|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult, even impossible, to repair or replace these malfunctioning devices on orbit. Therefore, fault tolerance {{is critical for}} space manipulators. Because each joint is generally controlled and driven independently, {{we can deal with}} the problem respectively when a joint fails. There are mainly two types of joint failure: locked [4, 5] and free-swinging [5, 6] failures. The former refers to a malfunctioning joint that is constrained mechanically, whereas with the latter, actuator torque is lost, and the <b>joint</b> <b>revolves</b> according to the coupling torques of the other joints. In fact, the most common joint failures are joint locked failures. So this paper focuses on the fault-tolerant planning under single joint locked failures. This failure covers two cases: active locking, in which a joint can be locked by fail-safe brakes, and passive locking, in which a joint is locked unexpectedly due to mechanical failure. For previous works [7, 8], the scholars studied the fault-tolerant planning and control methods for redundant manipulators. The redundancy is used to compensate for the motions of the failed joint to continue the designed tasks. However, for a non-redundant manipulator, such as a 6 -DOF (degree of freedom) space manipulator, these methods can not be directly applied.|$|R
40|$|The paper aims at {{presenting}} the main results {{emerging from a}} multi-dimensional analysis developed by a cross-curricular research group, properly focused on the competitiveness factors of two main Mediterranean islands: Sicily and Sardinia. Since 2009 the partnership {{has been involved in}} the annual RCAU competitiveness Report (Rapporto di Competitività delle Aree Urbane Italiane) to support investment strategies related to the JESSICA <b>revolving</b> funds (<b>Joint</b> European Support for Sustainable Investments in City Areas), thanks to the operative contribution of the European Bank for Investments and the "CDP- Italian Deposits and Loans Bank". Due to the strong dependence on air and sea connections, both Regions, since 1948, have a special status that let them to rule some fiscal facilities, such as to grant tax benefits. However, despite this facility and other local territorial opportunities, the two islands suffer from both structural and cyclical weaknesses. They are in fact facing a lack of material and immaterial resources, useful to improve their competitiveness within and beyond their own shore lines. The strategic value of the analysis {{can be summed up in}} three main points: the collected data consistency (77 indicators covering demography, economy, environment, real estate, social and infrastructural issues), the opportunity of comparing territorial performances at different aggregation scales (moving from the Italian 110 Provinces level -NUTs- up to the national one), and the chance to process geo-referred maps representing systemic and specific risks of each urban area (both according to present and 2030 predictions). Thanks to the time series collected, the data can detect the impacts of the current financial turmoil on the two regions, trying to suggest which urban areas are majorly hit by the decreasing of resources and trustiness, needing, and at the same time, public and private interventions. Sicily and Sardinia, although presenting different critical situations, can challenge for a more dynamic future. Some examples can refer to the empowerment of sustainable green buildings, tourism seasonality mitigation, service sector enhancement, in order to make them more attractive and dynamic. In other words these actions can have a positive impact on youth employment, household income and real estate values. From this point of view the analysis can improve a strategic vision on Sicily and Sardinia, enabling institutional stakeholders to convey demographic, social, economic and real estate dynamics towards urban regeneration and growt...|$|R
