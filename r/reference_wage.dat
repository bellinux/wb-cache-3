40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide a micro-foundation for wage {{rigidity}} {{in a simple}} and tractable model of wage setting behavior, inspired by a synthesis of recent convergent insights from anthropological and experimental research, and drawing on concepts advanced in the behavioral economics literature. The core principles underlying our theory are contractual incompleteness, fairness, reciprocity, and reference dependence and loss aversion {{in the evaluation of}} wage contracts by workers. The model establishes a wage effort relationship that captures a worker's asymmetric reference-dependent reciprocity, in which loss aversion implies effort responds more strongly to wage changes below the <b>reference</b> <b>wage</b> than above it. This basic relationship gives rise to wage rigidity around a worker's <b>reference</b> <b>wage.</b> We explore these implications further in a simple dynamic stochastic environment in which a worker adapts their feelings of entitlement once they become employed.

30|$|If {{the process}} {{set out in}} this paper were to adopted, i.e. that the maximum {{contribution}} cap grows at the same pace as productivity and the upper benefit cap remains constant in real terms, {{it would have a}} significant effect on pension expenditure. However, it would also take place at a cost, since it would have important distributional consequences. Regarding the generosity of the system (defined as the ratio between average pension and productivity), 26 the maximum would be reached in 2051 in all scenarios, but in the more extreme scenario there would be a lower level of generosity across the system. Within four decades, generosity would be the 24.2 % in scenario 2, 23.2 % in scenario 3 and 21.2 % in scenario 4 or extreme, versus 24.6 % in a neutral scenario (Table 9 in Appendix B). Generosity would decline over time in all scenarios from 2051 onwards, when the number of pensioners affected increases, and would be most pronounced in the extreme scenario (see Fig. 7). This sort of pension reform could become a powerful mechanism to avoid the transfer of growth in productivity to pensions. Note that if no such changes were made, growth in productivity would transfer to the contribution bases (or wages), then to the <b>Reference</b> <b>Wages,</b> and finally to pensions.|$|R
40|$|This article makes {{three main}} {{contributions}} to the economics of happiness literature. First, using a novel data set of about 90, 000 Japanese workers surveyed in annual cross-sections between 1990 and 2004, it demonstrates that individuals experience strong disutility when they perceive that their coworkers earn relatively higher wages. In contrast with other tests of the relative utility hypothesis in the literature, our estimation relies on workers' self-reported beliefs of their peers' wages, which we argue are more closely aligned to the "true" reference-group benchmark than the assumed comparison income measures employed in other studies. Second, the article shows important heterogeneous effects of both absolute and relative income on happiness. In particular, workers who {{are better able to}} accurately predict their peers' wages seem to experience both greater utility of higher own income and greater disutility of higher relative income. Third, we assess the validity of different methodologies that the literature has employed to construct comparison income measures and find significant discrepancies, particularly when reference income is derived from Mincer equations [...] a common approach in other studies. We demonstrate that such discrepancies stem from the difficulty in finding valid exclusion restrictions that help identify the relative income effect on happiness. In the absence of self-reported <b>reference</b> <b>wages,</b> we propose a simple IV strategy that does not eliminate the lack of consistency but delivers a lower bound of the "true" effect. ...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{the general}} {{institutional}} setting should also play a major {{role in determining}} wages of subsidized workers: During 2007 – in spite of a declining importance of collective contracts – still around   80 % of workers in the German private sector were employed in firms at least applying collectively negotiated contracts in West Germany, while   62 % were so employed in East Germany (Kohaut and Ellguth 2008). Unions try to standardize and compress wages between as well as within firms, in particular by attaching wages to job-grades (Freeman and Medoff 1984; Agell 1999, 2002). Importantly, German firms applying collective contracts usually do not differentiate between workers with and without union membership (although they are not obliged to pay union wages to non-union members). Furthermore, because collective wage contracts are much more important in Germany than in North America, they constitute <b>reference</b> <b>wages</b> which might be perceived as fair by many workers and might invigorate workers' sense of entitlement (Holden 1994; Gerlach et  al. 2008). Franz and Pfeiffer (2003) surveyed managers from about 800 firms and found that wage rigidities in German labor markets for less qualified workers seem to arise mainly due to collective contracts. To conclude, the ubiquity of collective contracts implies that lower or higher wages for subsidized workers than for unsubsidized workers within similar jobs might also be supposed to be less acceptable in Germany than for instance in North America – by workers and firms {{as well as by}} caseworkers.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new theory of wage adjustment, based on worker loss aversion. In line with {{prospect}} theory, the workers' perceived utility losses from wage decreases are weighted more heavily than the perceived utility gains from wage increases of equal magnitude. Wage changes are evaluated relative to an endogenous <b>reference</b> <b>wage,</b> which depends on the workers' rational wage expectations from the recent past. By implication, employment responses are more elastic for wage decreases than for wage increases and thus firms face an upward-sloping labor supply curve that is convexly kinked at the workers' reference price. Firms adjust wages flexibly in response to variations in labor demand. The resulting theory of wage adjustment is starkly at variance with past theories. In line with the empirical evidence, we find that (1) wages are completely rigid in response to small labor demand shocks, (2) wages are downward rigid but upward flexible for medium sized labor demand shocks, and (3) wages are relatively downward sluggish for large shocks...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{on the effects of}} specific employer characteristics on wages and wage rigidity and how these characteristics enter the wage-setting process. The dissertation includes an introductory chapter and five separate essays. The introduction provides motivation, background on the main keywords and an overview of the thesis. Chapters two and three study how internal <b>references</b> affect <b>wages</b> and wage rigidity from a theoretical perspective. The fourth chapter estimates the effect of firm size on wages in the Finnish labor market. Chapter five develops on the preceding and analyses how profit sharing schemes affect the firm size premium. Chapter six studies how internal references can induce profit sharing and wage rigidity from an empirical perspective. Chapter two analyses how fairness considerations of workers affect the union wagesetting process and ultimately on wages, employment and wage rigidity. Fairness is modeled as internal reference where workers compare wages to firm productivity respectively profitability. If the internal reference is high relative to the outside option, wage pressure results through a productivity/profitability premium as well as real wage rigidity. The third chapter reviews the core research on internal <b>references</b> and <b>wage</b> rigidity. With one exception it suggests that internal <b>references</b> unambiguously increase <b>wage</b> rigidity. In contrast, this chapter provides analytical proofs, calibration results and impulse response functions which show that the effect is ambiguous. The effect of the internal reference relative to the external <b>reference</b> determines whether <b>wage</b> rigidity increases or decreases. Chapter four explores the relationship between wages and firm size in the Finnish labor market. Using a large register data set the effect of firm size is found to be negligible after controlling for a large set of worker and firm characteristics and across different identification strategies. Chapter five analyzes the interaction of the firm size wage premium and profit sharing schemes. A simple theoretical analysis shows that the firm-size wage premium decreases in the presence of profit sharing. Using a rich linked employer-employee data set the empirical analysis shows that besides profit sharing, assortative matching and monopsony behavior decrease the firm size premium. The sixth chapter analyses the connection between profit sharing and wage rigidity where profits per worker are measured directly through the balance sheet panel. Profit endogeneity is accounted for by instrumentation as well as the self-selection of firms in different categories of profitability. Profits are shared if positive or increasing while there is no downward adjustment of wages if profits are negative or decreasing. This finding suggests that profits per worker function as internal reference...|$|R

In this paper we formalize {{a theory of}} wage setting behavior in a simple and tractable model that explicitly considers these behavioral aspects. A worker is assumed to have reference-dependent preferences and displays loss aversion when evaluating the fairness of a wage contract. The theory establishes a wage-effort relationship that captures the worker's reference-dependent reciprocity, which in turn in uences the firm's optimal wage policy. The paper makes two key contributions: it identifies loss aversion as an explanation for a worker's asymmetric reciprocity; and it provides realistic and generalized microfoundation for downward wage rigidity. We further illustrate the implications of our theory for both wage setting and hiring behavior. Downward wage rigidity generates several implications for {{the outcome of the}} initial employment contract.

40|$|I study a gift-exchange game, {{in which}} a profit-maximizing firm offers a wage to a {{fair-minded}} worker, who then chooses how much effort to exert.

Multilevel correlations of non-adherence were assessed (macro, meso, micro and patient level). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was applied to assess the correlates of non-adherence.
