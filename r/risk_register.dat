40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate how risk management in a healthcare organisation can be supported by knowledge management. The subject of research is the development and management of existing logs called "risk registers", through specific risk management processes employed in a N. H. S. (Foundation) Trust in England, in the U. K. Existing literature on organisational risk management stresses the importance of knowledge for the effective implementation of risk management programmes, claiming that knowledge used to perceive risk is biased by the beliefs of individuals and groups involved in risk management and therefore is considered incomplete. Further, literature on organisational knowledge management presents several definitions and categorisations of knowledge and approaches for knowledge manipulation in the organisational context as a whole. However, there is no specific approach regarding "how to deal" with knowledge in the course of organisational risk management. The research is based on a single case study, on a N. H. S. (Foundation) Trust, is influenced by principles of interpretivism and the frame of mind of Soft Systems Methodology (S. S. M.) to investigate the management of <b>risk</b> <b>registers,</b> from the viewpoint of people involved in the situation. Data revealed that knowledge about risks and about the existing risk management policy and procedures is situated in several locations in the Trust and is neither consolidated nor present where and when required. This study proposes a framework that identifies required knowledge for each of the risk management processes and outlines methods for conversion of this knowledge, based on the SECI knowledge conversion model, and activities to facilitate knowledge conversion so that knowledge is effectively used for the development of <b>risk</b> <b>registers</b> and the monitoring of risks throughout the whole Trust under study. This study has theoretical impact in the management science literature as it addresses the issue of incomplete knowledge raised in the risk management literature using concepts of the knowledge management literature, such as the knowledge conversion model. In essence, the combination of required risk and risk management related knowledge with the required type of communication for risk management creates the proposed methods for the support of each risk management process for the <b>risk</b> <b>registers.</b> Further, the indication of the importance of knowledge in risk management and the presentation of a framework that consolidates knowledge required for the risk management processes and proposes way(s) for the communication of this knowledge within a healthcare organisation have practical impact in the management of healthcare organisations.

Limited studies have focused on assessing supply chain risks within the interdependent network setting. We adapt the detectability feature from the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and integrate it within the theoretically grounded framework of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) for prioritizing supply chain risks. Detectability represents the effectiveness of early warning system in detecting a risk before its complete realization. We introduce two new risk measures and a process for prioritizing risks within a probabilistic network of interacting risks. We demonstrate application of our method through a simple example and compare results of different ranking schemes treating risks as independent or interdependent factors. The results clearly reveal importance of considering interdependency between risks and incorporating detectability within the modelling framework...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCurrently {{there is}} no {{standard}} for risk assessment tools in Carbon Capture and Storage. Existing projects use a range of tools from the very simple to the sophisticated and probabilistic. It is likely that no standard will ever be appropriate for all uses and all stakeholders within CCS. A key component of risk assessment is to effectively communicate to stakeholders whether the risks have been thoroughly investigated and any potential risk is well understood. Using a suite of risk assessment tools across the lifecycle of a project will provide the best estimates of the risk and enable communicating this knowledge in the most effective manner. A key component in designing a risk assessment protocol is in selecting an expert elicitation method that is appropriate for the level of detail required by the tool. By using a structured elicitation to match the detail of the risk assessment tool, the best possible estimate of the risk will be obtained. Finally, we recommend a staged suite of risk assessment tools including brainstorming, bow tie diagrams, <b>risk</b> <b>registers</b> and Bayesian Belief Networks...|$|R
5|$|Isambard Kingdom Brunel and {{his family}} lived in Weston, at Swiss Villa (towards {{the north end of}} Trevelyan road), while he was supervising the {{construction}} of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in the area. With the opening of the railway in 1841, thousands of visitors came to the town from Bristol, the Midlands and further afield, on works outings and bank holidays. Mining families also came across the Bristol Channel from South Wales by paddle steamer. To cater for them, Birnbeck Pier was completed in 1867, offering in its heyday amusement arcades, tea rooms, amusement rides and a photographic studio. It is now in a derelict state and has been added to English Heritage's Buildings at <b>Risk</b> <b>Register,</b> but visitors can still admire its structure from behind barbed wire. It was designed by Eugenius Birch with ironwork by the Isca Foundry of Newport, Monmouthshire. It is a grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Formal gardens {{were laid}} out around the house by W. A. Nesfield in around 1840–50 for Hungerford Crewe. Nesfield's design {{included}} statuary, gravelled walks and elaborate parterres realised using low box hedges and coloured minerals. Balustraded terraces were also constructed on {{the north and south}} sides of the hall, probably designed by E. M. Barry, and incorporating statues of lions, griffins and other heraldic beasts, echoing the interior staircase. Military usage during the Second World War, however, destroyed parts of the gardens; army buildings were erected near the house, and the area in front of the hall served as a parade ground and later was ploughed up to grow potatoes. The grounds were further neglected while the house was used as offices, and little has survived except the terraces, gates and statues. In 2009, English Heritage placed the hall on the Heritage at <b>Risk</b> <b>Register</b> as highly vulnerable, considering that the historic character of the gardens and park is compromised by recent developments to the hotel complex, in particular the conference centre, spa and associated parking area.|$|E

40|$|In 2000, the Higher Education Funding Council of England {{required}} all {{universities to}} implement risk management as a governance tool since it expected {{an increase in}} efficiency in decision making. While the regulatory regime has been described in literature, the response of universities remained greatly unknown. This paper outlines a first attempt to investigate the identification strategies of academic risks. Based on a limited set of <b>risk</b> <b>registers</b> developed by universities covering {{the entire range of}} English universities, this discussion paper presents three major findings. Firstly, universities could not capture the core functions of universities, teaching and research, with organisational means. Secondly, universities had to find proxies that they could link up with organisational decisions. In this context, the emerging concept of reputational risk provides an all-purpose tool for risk management allowing universities to capture all possible challenges and problems in terms of risk. Thirdly, when universities identify academic risks, structural features such size, international and research orientation or the degree of collegiality in decision making shape the way academic risks are defined. These initial findings could direct further research that seems essential for better understanding of academic risk management and its effect on universities...|$|R

40|$|Performance of the {{institutions}} {{in the public sector}} has always been among the main drivers that determine how the country is ultimately perceived by its citizens and the world, it is the policies and regulations established by these institutions that governs the private sector. The objectives of these public institutions can only be achieved through well formulated, well implemented and a continuous review of the strategies being pursued to achieve the stated objectives. At the core of setting strategies is Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), being an organisational procedure enabling the identification, assessment and action plans for the organisational risks linking to the achievement of objectives. The action plans formulated through the ERM should translate into strategic objectives mainly in the public sector where resources are chronically limited. Even with good intentions, government may spend badly because it has either chosen the wrong projects to fund or planned badly for good projects if the strategies are not continually and systematically reviewed. The objective of this research was to gain an understanding of how risk management is conducted at an enterprise-wide level within public sector institutions to ensure that the institution complies with all the relevant requirements within its ambit. It was a qualitative study that was conducted using a case study methodology wherein a public sector institution was identified and the executives involved in the risk management were interviewed individually. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and the results were analysed through the themes that were identified. The study identified that more understanding is required by public sector organisations to be able to realise the benefits of ERM. A clear distinction of what the objectives of the institution are, the related strategies, strategic objectives and risks to the strategic objectives, need to be made clear. The use of <b>risk</b> <b>registers</b> at different levels of the organisation is a tool to draw the relevant risks from deep in operations to a strategic level and this has to be understood at all levels. More importantly the correct action plans in reaction to identified risks can greatly turn risks into opportunities but this is not currently the case as <b>risk</b> <b>registers</b> are still not well implemented and utilized. Risk identification should not be a brainstorming session when the strategy is created but a continuous well operated system within operations throughout the period. The risk culture, roles and relevant systems are still lacking in public institutions.
