5|$|Following {{the debacle}} of The <b>Road</b> <b>Back,</b> Charles Rogers {{tried to get}} out of his {{contract}} with Whale; Whale refused. Rogers then assigned him to a string of B movies to run out his contractual obligation.

5|$|During {{the rest}} of the morning, an {{infantry}} battalion from the 22nd Armoured Brigade group, took up defensive positions in the town; the troops at Point 213 had been cut off and a force was assembled to extricate them. The relief force was unable to advance on the ridge, and when more German forces arrived between 11:00 and 13:00 the trapped squadron surrendered. More German troops had arrived, and engaged the 22nd Armoured Brigade group along the <b>road</b> <b>back</b> to Livry.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{changed the}} {{routings}} and designations of the highways around Cooks, Thompson and Manistique in the mid-1930s. The agency rerouted US2 between Cooks and M‑149 in Thompson, turning the old <b>road</b> <b>back</b> to county control. The section between M‑149 and M‑125 was redesignated {{as an extension}} of M‑149 to Thompson, and M‑125 was replaced by a further extension of M‑149. The last change was to route US2 along its current alignment in the area, completing the changes on August 2, 1936.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was {{originally}} signposted in 1919, the north–south highway through Grayling {{was part of}} the original M-14. At that time, M-93 was only a spur from downtown Grayling to the future Camp Grayling. It was later redesignated as part of US Highway27 (US27) in 1926. By 1932, M-93 was extended northward through Grayling to the state park. In 1940, M-72 was extended through the Grayling area. I-75 in the Grayling area opened in 1961 and, the former routing of US27 through Grayling northward to Hartwick Pines <b>Road</b> <b>back</b> to I-75 was redesignated BL I-75.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his career as a {{director}} Whale directed The <b>Road</b> <b>Back</b> (1937), a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|The 17th Infantry Brigade was {{the last}} to land in Greece, {{arriving}} at Piraeus on 12April. Savige was placed in charge of Savige Force, consisting of the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/11thInfantry Battalions, with armour, artillery, engineer and other support. He was given the mission of covering the Allied flank around Kalabaka. On 17April, Savige received orders to withdraw from Kalabaka, leaving only a rearguard behind. The road behind him, however, was packed with vehicles, and a crucial bridge on the only reasonably good <b>road</b> <b>back</b> had accidentally been demolished. Savige elected to disregard his orders and hold his position until the road was clear. He then managed to withdraw, although his driver's foot was broken in an air raid. Savige arrived back in Palestine on 1May 1941 and began the task of rebuilding his brigade. For the campaign in Greece, he received his fourth mention in despatches.|$|E

5|$|The {{business}} loop {{follows the}} former routing of US12. This routing was first designated as M-14 in 1956 when US12 {{was moved to}} a freeway bypass {{to the south of}} town. I-94 was first designated by the middle of 1960 along the US12 freeway, and a new BL I-94 designation was created {{by the middle of the}} next year. BL I-94 followed M-14 from the Jackson Road interchange to Main Street along Jackson Road and Huron Street. At Main Street, BL I-94 turned along US23 on Huron Street, Washtenaw Avenue and Carpenter <b>Road</b> <b>back</b> to I-94/US12. The US23 freeway was finished on November 2, 1962. BL I-94 was rerouted on the east end to follow the new US23 freeway, returning the Carpenter Road alignment to local control. Bus. US23 replaced US23 along Huron Street and Washtenaw Avenue in the city of Ann Arbor at this time. A new M-14 freeway opened on November 16, 1965, removing the M-14 concurrency from the routing.|$|E
5|$|What is now Route 147 was an {{unimproved}} <b>road</b> <b>back</b> in 1927. When the 500-series county routes {{were established}} in the 1950s, this road {{became a part of}} County Route 585, a route that ran from Route 109 (then a part of U.S. Route 9) in Lower Township north to U.S. Route 30 and Route 157 in Absecon. The route was also designated as part of County Route 18, which continued west past U.S. Route 9 to Route 47. In 1971, Route 147 was designated to replace the portion of County Route 18/County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 in Burleigh and the North Wildwood border. As a result of a bridge replacement over the Grassy Sound, Route 147 was realigned off its former drawbridge, and the former alignment became Cape May County Route 665. The southern terminus of County Route 585 was eventually truncated its current location at Route 52 in Somers Point. By the 1990s, Route 147 was extended to its current terminus at New York Avenue in North Wildwood.|$|E
5|$|As North Korean {{soldiers}} advanced, {{they began}} to envelop both A and B Companies, and 30 minutes after the first shots were fired, both companies were ordered to withdraw, one platoon at a time. C Company, kept in reserve during the engagement, retreated without coming in contact with North Korean forces. A Company, under the heaviest attack, attempted a gradual withdrawal which quickly became disorderly, as men ran from the hill, some without weapons and ammunition, being strafed by North Korean machine guns the entire time. Panic quickly overtook {{many of the men}} of the battalion, and they started running past the designated rally points, all the way to Pyongtaek. Others, too scared to retreat, remained in their foxholes and were captured by the North Korean forces. One officer attempted to stay behind and search for survivors, before he and three others were allegedly captured and executed by North Korean forces. Company commanders gathered what men they could and began moving south, though one-fourth of 1st Battalion was killed, missing or captured immediately after the brief fight. The retreating elements left a trail of equipment behind, littering the <b>road</b> <b>back</b> to Pyongtaek with ammunition, helmets, and rain gear. In the disorderly retreat one platoon from A Company was left behind, and had to retreat through a railway for cover.|$|E

25|$|Yahya ibn Muhammad's forces, meanwhile, {{had been}} {{progressively}} weakened since his {{withdrawal from the}} Nahr Maqil; an engagement with the forces of Asghajun, the governor of al-Ahwaz, had left many of his men injured, and he was lacking in cavalry after he granted his horsemen leave to return to 'Ali ibn Muhammad's camp. After learning of Abu Ahmad's movements, he abandoned his march toward the Tigris and attempted to withdraw through a swamp, {{but many of the}} Zanj fell sick during the journey. After emerging from the swamp, the Zanj vanguard under the command of Sulayman ibn Jami' found their path blocked by barges and troops sent by Asghajun, so they abandoned their own boats and decided to head for the <b>road</b> <b>back</b> 'Ali's camp.|$|E

25|$|Biggs was {{nominated}} {{to run for}} Governor in 1886, and fortunately for him, {{it was the last}} year such a disparity existed between the parties. For the last time there was no Republicans candidate, and he received only the token opposition of the Temperance Reform Party candidate, James R. Hoffecker, whom he defeated easily. Biggs served from January 18, 1887 until January 20, 1891. Two years later the Republicans began their long <b>road</b> <b>back</b> and took advantage of splits in the Democratic leadership to elect a small majority in the State House. Meanwhile, Biggs did as countless governors before him, and pleaded with the General Assembly for all kinds of reform, including better representation for New Castle County, and reform of the voting procedures. And as usual, he was largely ignored, except for a provision to establish a State Hospital for the Insane, now the Delaware State Hospital at Farnhurst.|$|E
25|$|With {{the sounds}} of battle echoing in the distance, Lt. Col. Manuel Chaves of the 2nd New Mexico Infantry, {{commander}} of the New Mexican volunteers, informed Maj. Chivington that his scouts had located the Confederate supply train at Johnson's Ranch. After watching the supply train for an hour, Chivington's force descended the slope and attacked, driving off or capturing the small guard with few casualties on either side. They then looted and burned 80 supply wagons and spiked the cannon, either killing or driving off about 500 horses and mules before returning with their prisoners to Kozlowski's Ranch. With no supplies to sustain his advance, Scurry had to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step on the long <b>road</b> <b>back</b> to San Antonio, Texas. Thanks to Chaves' assistance, the Federals had turned a defeat into victory and stopped further Confederate advances in the Southwest. Glorieta Pass was therefore the turning point {{of the war in}} the New Mexico Territory.|$|E
