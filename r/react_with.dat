5|$|Iron {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{reactive}} element in its group; it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe2+. However, it does not <b>react</b> <b>with</b> concentrated nitric acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless <b>react</b> <b>with</b> hydrochloric acid.|$|E
40|$|Several {{recently}} isolated monoclonal antibodies which <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> {{simian virus}} 40 T antigens also <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> proteins found in uninfected and untransformed cells. The proteins {{were different from}} each other, PAb 419 <b>reacting</b> <b>with</b> a 35, 000 -molecular-weight protein, PAb 427 <b>reacting</b> <b>with</b> a 75, 000 -molecular-weight phosphoprotein, PAb 405 <b>reacting</b> <b>with</b> a 150, 000 -molecular-weight phosphoprotein, and PAb 204 <b>reacting</b> <b>with</b> a 68, 000 -molecular-weight protein. It is suggested that although some of these cross-reactions may be fortuitous, they may, as an alternative, reflect similarities of shape and perhaps function between domains of the viral T antigen and the relevant host proteins...|$|R

Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass.|$|E

Because of the lanthanide contraction of the elements in the fifth period, zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii. The ionic radius of Zr4+ is 79picometers and that of Hf4+ is 78pm.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{does not}} <b>react</b> <b>with</b> water, {{but it does}} slowly <b>react</b> <b>with</b> {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
