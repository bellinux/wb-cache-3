5000|$|April 25 - Lehi fighters {{attacked}} a Tel Aviv car park {{that was being}} used by the British Army's 6th Airborne Division, killing seven British soldiers and looting the <b>arms</b> <b>racks</b> they found. They then laid mines and retreated. Some British soldiers retaliated by damaging Jewish property.|$|R
50|$|In the Guardhouse at Fort Scott National Historic Site, typical {{furnishings}} for guard quarters included benches, tables, shelves, {{a platform}} {{bed for the}} men resting between assignments, <b>arms</b> <b>racks,</b> a fireplace or stove, and leather buckets (used for firefighting - another duty of guards). Prison cells were unfurnished, containing simply a slop bucket and iron rings on walls for the attachment of shackles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Racks</b> carry, <b>arm,</b> {{and release}} stores. Racks are either part of, {{or can be}} {{inserted}} into, the modular bay of a support structure such as a pylon. A rack can mount a store or another piece of suspension equipment, for example, numerous bombs being mounted onto a single pylon, such as was done on F-105 Thunderchief missions over Vietnam, or the large external pylons on the B-52 Stratofortress, which can carry 12 unguided bombs in four triple ejector racks mounted to a single pylon. Alternatively, using the same pylon, but different racks and adapters, 9 air-launched cruise missiles can be carried. Using modular racks and universal adapters makes {{it much easier to}} configure the desired load.|$|R
25|$|On 25 April 1946, a Lehi unit {{attacked}} a car park in Tel Aviv {{occupied by the}} British 6th Airborne Division. Under a barrage of heavy covering fire, Lehi fighters broke into the car park, shot soldiers they encountered at close range, stole rifles from <b>arms</b> <b>racks,</b> laid mines to cover the retreat, and withdrew. Seven soldiers {{were killed in the}} attack, which caused widespread outrage among the British security forces in Palestine. It resulted in retaliatory anti-Jewish violence by British troops and a punitive curfew imposed on Tel Aviv's roads and a closure of places of entertainment in the city by the British Army.|$|R
40|$|The chosen {{project is}} based on the {{redesign}} of the steering and suspension system for the University of Southern Queensland’s 2008 Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) or FSAE vehicle. In 2008 USQ’s FSAE team was forced to abandon the competition due to a crash into a barrier which was thought to have been caused by the car’s suspension and steering system. If USQ plans to enter a car into future FSAE competition it seemed appropriate that the current suspension and steering system be revised. The project aimed to uncover any problems with the 2008 vehicle and then use these findings, coupled with appropriate research, to create a new steering and suspension system that possesses improved performance. Although there is no team for the competition this year it is intended that all work completed will be able to be utilised by future groups in years to come. Completion of the project has seen the design of geometry for the suspension arms, suspension actuation mechanisms, uprights as well as the steering <b>rack</b> and <b>arms.</b> Additionally, concepts in the way of 3 d models have been established for the suspension and steering systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Systems that {{deteriorate}} {{over time}} {{can result in}} increased operational costs. Reduced efficiency, increased fuel consumption, increased failure rate that induces increased downtime costs, {{are some of the}} consequences due to deterioration. Analysis of systems and equipment that deteriorate over time is an important aspect of ageing management. In this thesis, the available literature from maintenance and life cycle theory has been mapped. The goal was to develop a model for Odfjell Drilling, which could be used to estimate the life cycle costs for optimal repair intervals for systems and equipment. Two models were derived. The first model was based on reliability theory, using Barlow & Hunter´s fixed age interval. Several parameters have been identified as necessary input values. The idea was to collect the input parameters from the operational database that Odfjell Drilling posses, and use these for optimizing optimal repair intervals, by means of the common Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) methodology. When the optimal intervals are found, the reduction of costs can be calculated for the remaining system life. A major problem with the reliability model is that a probability density function (PDF) must be obtained. Obtaining this, in practice, is very difficult; systems are subject to maintenance, which prevents their history to become available to the analyst. Use of subjective expert opinions for how they think the system will behave, is one approach to obtain the PDF. However this is considered as inefficient, time-consuming and inaccurate. The model approach was hence rejected. The second model is an availability-based model, which purpose is to identify systems that are main contributors to downtime. When these are found, diagnosis can be developed and evaluated in order to increase the system availability. Thus reducing the costs of downtime, which goes directly on the bottom-line of the budget. Due to significant lack of data, the availability-based model could never be tested properly. The main idea was to test it on a <b>racking</b> <b>arm</b> on a platform that is in Odfjell Drillings portfolio. The few results that were obtained will be in a separate report as the data is sensitive. Use of condition-based maintenance (CBM) {{is considered to be a}} strategy that offers more flexibility to the user, in terms of planning multiple actions. It is recognized that many systems, such as pumps and piping, could be subject to condition monitoring (CM) to a greater extent than they are today. CBM will require the development of a database for storage of system history. Trend analysis can be evaluated and used as a tool for decision making in maintenance planning. As for Odfjell Drilling, it is recommended that they investigate the potential that CBM offers, and put a single model for optimizing equipment and systems at rest...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to {{evaluate}} the low-back compression force and users feedback in loading ladders from vans using a hydraulic ladder rack and a tradition fixed ladder rack. Simulated ladder lifting task {{was used to evaluate}} the differences in peak compression force while workers load ladder from vans using the fixed ladder rack and the hydraulic ladder rack. Usability questionnaires were also distributed to workers who were invited to use the hydraulic ladder rack for three months to evaluate their preferences and perception of effort when working with the fixed and the hydraulic ladder rack. Significantly (p< 0. 1) higher peak compression force was found when participants used the fixed ladder <b>racks.</b> The upper <b>arm</b> angles for both of the left and right arms was also significantly (p< 0. 05) higher when workers worked with the fixed ladder rack. The majority of responses in the usability questionnaires significantly (p< 0. 05) favored working with the hydraulic ladder rack...|$|R
40|$|Transporting {{a bicycle}} after riding somewhere and then {{needing to be}} pickup can be problematic. Bicycles will not fit in most {{vehicles}} without removing components. There is also the risk of damaging {{the inside of the}} vehicle. Expecting everyone to have a bike rack for their vehicle is unrealistic because the bike rack could be considered unappealing visually, take up to much space in the trunk, or limit the vehicle owner’s access to the trunk. The solution to this problem is a bike rack that mounts onto your car and then mounts your bike onto the rack. Most people don’t drive around with a bike rack connected to their vehicle, it’s unappealing and they are unable to use their trunks due to the bicycle rack being too big and bulky to carry around while you’re riding your bike. A bicycle rack was designed to fits inside the bicycle frame and unfolds to attach to the vehicles trunk for transportation. The designed <b>rack</b> has three <b>arms</b> that fold inside the frame, two arms {{on the top of the}} frame that rotate out, and one arm on the bottom that folds down in the shape of a T. The rack also has six straps two on the top bar, two straps on the bottom, and one on the both sides left and right. After analysis of the weight of the bike and the length of the arms, the thickness required was calculated, for the arms to support the weight of the bike...|$|R
