The mean size of the crystallites determined by XRD data is in the range 27 ÷ 68 nm. The presence of Mn 2 + and Cu 2 + ions into the ZnO matrix was established by EPR.

The sample’s X-ray diffraction pattern shows a face-centered cubic crystalline phase of silver with the lattice constant 4. 0838 nm. The average size of silver nanoclusters, as obtained from the scanning electron microscopy analysis is about 30 nm which is consistent with the X-ray diffraction results. The temperature dependent catalytic activity of prepared composites is demonstrated for two model reactions such as reduction of 4 -nitrophenol (4 -NP) and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Apparent constant rates and activation energy as well as reusability of catalysts were determined. The developed composite catalyst could be used consecutively for several runs without any damages for 4 -NP reduction. For hydrogen peroxide <b>reaction</b> <b>decomposition</b> the reaction rate of the second cycle is reduced 2. 4 times.

In addition, the process and mechanism of the <b>decomposition</b> <b>reaction</b> of AER and the reaction kinetics were investigated. The results revealed that the <b>decomposition</b> <b>reaction</b> of AER started from the outer surface of the AER particles. The reaction kinetics corresponded with shrinking unreacted core models. Furthermore, the <b>decomposition</b> <b>reaction</b> rate of AER could be enhanced obviously by decreasing the particle size because the effect of product layer diffusion was weakened when the particle size of AER was decreased.

D-Amino acid oxidase and hydroxyacid oxidase activities were demonstrated in unfixed cryostat sections with the cerium-diaminobenzidine-cobalt-hydrogen peroxide procedure, in which cerium ions capture hydrogen peroxide, the product of both enzymes. In a second step <b>reaction</b> <b>decomposition</b> of cerium perhydroxide gives rise to a diaminobenzidine polymer complexed with cobalt ions.

The activities of these enzymes were not detectable in livers and kidneys of Zellweger patients. It is concluded that the cerium-diaminobenzidine-cobalt-hydrogen peroxide procedure enables the demonstration of peroxisomal enzyme activities in human tissues at the light-microscopical level and is an important tool in detecting patients with Zellweger syndrom...|$|E
