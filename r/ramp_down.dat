There is no ticket office, and no self-service ticket machines {{which can be used}} to buy or collect tickets. The station car park is {{to the north of the}} platforms, with 40 spaces. There is step-free access to the northern platform from the car park, and a set of steps from the footbridge.

25|$|The tracks from Glasgow {{enter at}} {{the east end of}} the wide {{concourse}} which is flanked to the north and south by high stone walls, each capped {{at the east}} end by a castellated turret. A glazed roof between these walls sheltered the concourse until recently, but it has been removed and small shelters introduced. The northernmost line stops as a bay platform and is not in use, and platform 1 serving eastbound trains opens directly to the top of Station Avenue which slopes down to Cathcart Street through stone archways marking the station entrance. The two tracks in use continue westwards through a tunnel which is capped by the parapet wall to Terrace Road, which leaves Cathcart Street further to the west and rises steeply towards the station before turning south over the tunnel entrance and continuing to {{rise to the level of}} the Well Park. Doorways in the parapet wall lead to staircases down to each platform, and to a steel <b>ramp</b> <b>down</b> to Platform 2 serving westbound trains. Originally, there was only one doorway, which led to a sloping passageway which in turn connected with the (now removed) station's internal steel lattice footbridge.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, before electrification, {{this bridge}} had both stairs and a ramp for porters' {{trolleys}} {{on the up}} (westbound) platform, and from the landing above the eastbound platform there was the passageway to the door onto Terrace Road, a staircase down to the platform, and an archway through to an external, stone-flagged <b>ramp</b> <b>down</b> to another archway back into the building and platform area.

40|$|AbstractWith {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in the cumulative installations around the world, solar PV technology has started playing {{a major role in}} the global clean energy scenario. One of the major challenges for the large scale integration of solar energy with the power grids is its intermittent nature. In this paper, temporal variations in the power output of six different solar PV technologies are quantified and modeled. The solar cells considered are single crystalline, poly crystalline, micro crystalline amorphous silicon, copper Indium Selenium (CIS) and hetero-junction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT). Three years of performance data from a 1. 2 MW experimental solar PV farm in Brunei Darussalam were used for the modeling. It was found that the variations in the PV output follow the Cauchy's probability distribution. <b>Ramping</b> <b>down</b> behaviour of the solar panel was critically analyzed and expected <b>ramp</b> <b>downs</b> at 95 % confidence level are presented. HIT modules showed the highest ramp rate among the panels, whereas CIS showed the lowest fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|Cold {{ensembles}} and Bose-Einstein condensates of alkali {{atoms in}} optical dipole potentials have been intensely studied in recent years. Most of these BEC experiments rely on producing the condensate by evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap with subsequent {{transfer to the}} optical potential. A smaller number of groups have also succeeded in achieving quantum degeneracy directly in a CO 2 -laser trap. In optical traps, the evaporative cooling is done by <b>ramping</b> <b>down</b> the laser power of the trap lasers instead of using an RF-knife. In our approach, we perform evaporative cooling in a simple two-stage process with atoms collected and pre-cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and then directly transferred to a dipole trap whose intensity is <b>ramped</b> <b>down</b> in order to induce evaporation. We use a solid state laser to create a far-detuned trap for 87 Rb at a wavelength of 1030 nm instead of a CO 2 -laser The dipole trap is realised by crossing two focused laser beams at an angle of 90 &# 176;. This represents {{a simple way to}} create a nearly isotropic trap with tight confinement in all three dimensions...|$|R
40|$|The main magnets of the LHC are series-connected {{electrically}} {{in different}} excitation circuits {{by means of}} superconducting bus-bars, carrying a maximum current of 13 kA. These superconducting bus-bars consist of a superconducting cable thermally and electrically coupled to a copper section all along length. The function of the copper section is essentially to provide an alternative path for the magnet current in case the superconducting cable loses its superconductivity and returns to normal state because of a transient system disturbance or normal zone propagation coming from the neighboring magnets. When a superconducting bus-bar quenches to normal state its temperature must always stay below a safe values of about 100 Â° C while the copper is conducting. With regard to that, a quench signal is initiated, which in turn triggers the <b>ramping</b> <b>down</b> of the current from 13000 A to 0. The <b>ramping</b> <b>down</b> rate must not exceed a maximum value to avoid the transition of still superconducting state magnets series-connected with the quenched ones. This paper concerns the design and the manufacture of the high current superconducting bus-bars needed to interconnect the magnetic elements of the main dipoles of the LHC...|$|R
