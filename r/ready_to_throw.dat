5|$|In 1875, {{the same}} year in which her husband's body was reburied, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Gill's story {{was reported in the}} Boston Herald twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the sexton Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The same man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.|$|E
25|$|The mosaic Neptune and {{the pirates}} {{originates}} {{from the same}} peristyle as the preceding work. It depicts the punishment of pirates on the Tyrrhenian Sea, merging themes linked to Dionysus and more common marine themes. The god is standing, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> his spear. He {{is supported by a}} maenad, a satyr and aged Silenus, who is holding the ship’s rudder. A leopard is attacking one of the pirates, who are transformed into dolphins as soon as they recognise the divine nature of their adversary. To the left, genii have boarded another ship, while to the right, fishermen are attempting to catch an octopus with a net.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{appointed}} {{his brother}} Louis Bonaparte to the Kingdom of Holland in May 1806. However, on 9 July 1810, the French emperor extinguished the kingdom and annexed the Netherlands to the First French Empire. The Dutch contributed only 17,300 soldiers to Napoleon's armies in 1811–1813, but their severe {{casualties in the}} French invasion of Russia shocked the population. Since their trade was badly damaged by Napoleon's Continental System, the Dutch people were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> off the French yoke. In early November, Russian corps commander Ferdinand von Wintzingerode sent a 3,500-man Streifkorps led by Alexander Khristoforovich Benckendorff into Holland. Benckendorff's force of Don Cossacks, regular cavalry and infantry was soon joined by eight additional Cossack regiments. The Dutch rebellion first broke out in Amsterdam on 14–15 November. Depressed {{by the loss of}} his son in Russia, the French civil leader Charles-François Lebrun, duc de Plaisance responded ineffectively to the crisis. By 19 November the revolt leaders formed a provisional government until the House of Orange-Nassau could be restored to power.|$|E

50|$|The {{class was}} {{undergoing}} {{a series of}} confidence-building exercises before their graduation in late October when Cramer {{was involved in a}} training accident on October 21, 1957. During an ambush drill, a Vietnamese soldier near Cramer was <b>readying</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a lit block of melinite (French military explosive)when it prematurely detonated. The melinite was later determined to have deteriorated in storage and was unstable. Cramer died instantly {{and other members of the}} team and their students were wounded.|$|R
60|$|Don't be hard {{upon the}} Swiss. They are {{a thorn in}} the sides of European despots, and a good {{wholesome}} people to live near Jesuit-ridden kings on the brighter side of the mountains. My hat shall ever be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>thrown</b> up, and my glove ever <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>thrown</b> down for Switzerland. If you were the man I took you for, when I took you (as a godfather) for better and for worse, you would come to Paris and amaze the weak walls of the house I haven't found yet with that steady snore of yours, which I once heard piercing the door of your bedroom in Devonshire Terrace, reverberating along the bell-wire in the hall, so getting outside into the street, playing Eolian harps among the area railings, and going down the New Road like the blast of a trumpet.|$|R
500|$|O'Hara began 1941 by {{appearing}} in They Met in Argentina, RKO's answer to Down Argentine Way (1940). O'Hara later declared that she [...] "knew {{it was going}} to be a stinker; terrible script, bad director, preposterous plot, forgettable music". She grew increasingly frustrated with the direction of her career at this time. Ida Zeitlin wrote that O'Hara had [...] "reached a pitch of despair where she was about <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> in the towel, to break her contract, to collapse against the stone wall of indifference and howl like a baby wolf". She pleaded with her agent for a role, however small, in John Ford's upcoming film How Green Was My Valley (1941), at 20th Century Fox, a film about a close, hard-working Welsh mining family living in the heart of the South Wales Valleys in the 19th century. The film, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, began an artistic collaboration with Ford that would span 20 years and five feature films.|$|E

2500|$|The Creatures' {{most famous}} and long-standing chant {{is known as the}} roll call. In the top of the first inning, when the Yankees are on the field and their {{starting}} pitcher is getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> the first pitch, everyone in the section stands and begins clapping. After the pitch is thrown, Creature [...] "Bald" [...] Vinny Milano gestures for the crowd to calm down, then cups his hands around his mouth and shouts out the name of the center fielder (e.g.: [...] "Yo, Aaron!", for Aaron Hicks). The whole group proceeds to chant the name until there is a response, usually {{in the form of a}} wave or a point; some Yankees respond with extra enthusiasm, such as Johnny Damon (who typically dropped to one knee and pointed at the Creatures with both hands) and Nick Swisher (who came to attention, faced the Creatures, and saluted). The Creatures move through the lineup, going from the center fielder to the left fielder, right fielder, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop and third baseman, in that order. (With the exception of a few rare instances, the pitcher and the catcher are not a part of the roll call.) Anti-obscenity laws were exercised in 2007, but are not always strictly enforced; if they are able, the Creatures will turn to the right field box seats at the completion of the Roll Call and chant [...] "Box seats suck!" [...] During the days of the bleachers' no-alcohol-sales policy, fans in the right-field box seats occasionally replied with a chant of [...] "We've got beer!" [...] If the Yankees are playing the Red Sox, the intensity of the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry takes hold; the Creatures then cut the 'box seats' chant short and instead chant [...] "Boston sucks!" [...] until that dissipates. If police cut this short, the Creatures resort to chanting [...] "No fun allowed!", or nothing at all. If a non-pitcher is replaced in a defensive position, the replacement is given the same chant. Sometimes, after a long rain delay, the Creatures will start another Roll Call just for fun. Also, until the Red Sox won the World Series in , the Creatures would chant [...] "1918!" [...] and hold up signs saying [...] "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO!" [...] and pictures of Babe Ruth to remind the Red Sox of the last time they won a championship.|$|E
5000|$|Nakoruru, alone over {{a ravine}} and {{desiring}} {{to live in}} peace, <b>readies</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> Chichiushi away until she remembers her mother -who had {{tried to do the}} same. Her mother, who hears her daughter refer to the head priest as [...] "Father", tells her to not refer to him in that way. Nakoruru -a child in this memory- asks why she can't. Briefly remembering her real love who had died earlier, she explains to Nakoruru that priestesses cannot marry. The memory moves the present Nakoruru to remember her duty as a priestess: one who fights for others not for herself. The climax of the episode has Nakoruru protecting a deer from a rock slide, implied to be caused by evil entities. It is unknown what happens next as the screen fades black.|$|R

A pontoon bridge (B) was arranged <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>thrown</b> below the falls of the river, {{not far from the}} still intact Boer bridge. Hildyard's English Brigade stood fast on the advanced low kopjes forming the extreme left of the line. Hart's command held its position about the slopes of Inniskilling Hill and in the gorge of the river. Barton's Fusilier Brigade, Kitchener's Lancashire Brigade, and the two remaining battalions of Norcott's (formerly Lyttelton's) Brigade crossed the old bridge to the Hlangwani plateau.|$|R

He was the second such teenager killed by IDF live fire in the West Bank in 8 days, the 10th {{since the beginning of}} 2014, adding to the total of 34 Palestinian victims of IDF gunfire at civilians in the West Bank since mid-June. In various reports IDF sources state he was shot when he threw a bomb, or that an adult was shot when he lit a molotov cocktail fuse and was <b>readying</b> himself <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> it on Route 60.

6000|$|... "The work of men"--and what is that? Well, we may {{any of us}} {{know very}} quickly, on the {{condition}} of being wholly <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> do it. But many of us are for the most part thinking, not of what we are to do, but of what we are to get; and the best of us are sunk into the sin of Ananias, and it is a mortal one--we want to keep back part of the price; and we continually talk of taking up our cross, as if the only harm in a cross was the WEIGHT of it--as if it was only a thing to be carried, instead of to be--crucified upon. [...] "They that are His have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts." [...] Does that mean, think you, that in time of national distress, of religious trial, of crisis for every interest and hope of humanity--none of us will cease jesting, none cease idling, none put themselves to any wholesome work, none take so much as a tag of lace off their footmen's coats, to save the world?

Stars of anemone, smiling bunches of primrose, and azure clouds of bluebell made the young hearts leap as at that first memorable sight.

Shaking the water from his head and shoulders, the bull at once caught sight of the man who had thus {{suddenly}} appeared. At that instant the Eskimo threw up his left arm. This action, instead of frightening the brutes away, caused them to raise themselves high out of the water, in order to have a good look at the strange creature who had thus dared to disturb them in their watery home. This was just what the native wanted. It gave him a chance of driving the harpoon under the flipper of the male. The instant this was done he caught up the end of his coil and ran quickly back to the full length of the line.|$|R
