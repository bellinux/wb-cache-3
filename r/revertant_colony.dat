40|$|Abstract: 2 -Phenylbenzimidazole (PBI) is an {{ingredient}} found in sunscreen agents. PBI can absorb the UV {{portion of the}} solar light and undergo a series of light-induced reactions to cause adverse effects in humans. Therefore, chemical and photochemical toxicity of PBI were investigated in the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium TA 102 and human skin keratinocyte cells. There is no appreciable bacteria death due to the exposure to PBI alone, indicating that PBI is not chemically toxic to the bacteria at a dose as high as 625 µM. However, exposure to PBI and a solar simulator light (300 -W Xe/Hg lamp, 30 min, 18. 6 J/cm 2, equivalent to 30 min outdoor sunlight) causes significant bacteria death: 35 % at 25 µM and 55 % at 625 µM PBI. Exposure of the bacteria to light and PBI at doses 5 - 25 µM causes the bacteria to revert, an indication of mutation. In the presence of PBI but without light irradiation, the number of <b>revertant</b> bacteria <b>colonies</b> is around 200 due to spontaneous mutation. Combination of light irradiation and PBI causes the number of <b>revertant</b> TA 102 <b>colonies</b> to increase in a dose dependent manner, reaching a maximum of around 1700 <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies</b> at 25 µM PBI.

Replica impressions of the resulting colonies were transferred to Vogel Bonner minimal agar plates and incubated for 48 hr at 37 degrees C. It was then observed that considerable numbers of "false" <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies</b> were obtained at those Cr(VI) doses which resulted in a pronounced toxic effect, albeit with an acceptable level of the bacterial background lawn.

Thus there is raised a serious question concerning the reliability of quantitative data published in bacterial mutagenicity testing where replica testing of the histidine requirement of the resulting "revertant" colonies is not routinely made.

This revertant frequency (104) is 104 -fold highe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the ability of liver S 9 and hepatocyte preparations from noninbred Syrian golden ham-sters and noninbred Sprague-Dawley rats to metabolically activate a number of nitroso compounds in the Salmonella mutagenesis assay. The liver S 9 and hepatocyte preparations from hamsters were consistently more effective than were preparations from rats in metabolizing nitrosodimethylamine (NDM). nitrosodiethylamine. nitrosodiallylamine, nitrosopyrrolidine (NP), nitrosomorpholine (NM). nitrosodiethylmethylurea (NDEMU), and nitrosodimethyl-ethylurea (NDMEU) to mutagenic forms. The use of hamster S 9 preparations with NP and NM resulted in up to 14 times the number of <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies</b> obtained with rat preparations; in the presence of hamster hepatocytes, up to 32 times the number of revertants were obtained. The S 9 preparations from male hamsters not treated with the enzyme inducers phenobarbital an...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of clinical strains of enterococci requiring vancomycin for growth {{has only recently}} been reported. We describe the {{isolation of}} Enterococcus faecium requiring vancomycin for growth from the stool of a patient who had completed oral vancomycin therapy. Growth of the vancomycin-dependent E. faecium was supported by ristocetin and D-alanyl-D-alanine but not by daptomycin, teicoplanin, or D,L-alanine. Spontaneous revertants not requiring vancomycin occurred {{at a rate of}} 1 in 10 (6). Both the vancomycin-dependent E. faecium and the revertant hybridized with a vanB gene probe and had identical contour-clamped homogeneous electrophoresis patterns. The majority of <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies</b> were resistant to teicoplanin, suggesting constitutive production of the vanB ligase. We believe the vancomycin-dependent E. faecium evolved from a vancomycin-resistant, vancomycin-independent E. faecium in the presence of high concentrations of vancomycin in the intestine...|$|R
40|$|Chalcones present several {{biological}} {{activities and}} sulfonamide chalcone derivatives have shown important biological applications, including antitumor activity. In this study, genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic {{activities of the}} sulfonamide chalcone N-{ 4 -[3 -(4 -nitrophenyl) prop- 2 -enoyl]phenyl} benzenesulfonamide (CPN) were assessed using the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test (Ames test) and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. The results showed that CPN caused a small {{increase in the number}} of histidine <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies</b> in S. typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100, but not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). The antimutagenicity test showed that CPN significantly decreased the number of His+ revertants in strain TA 98 at all doses tested (p 0. 05). Additionally, CPN co-administered with MMC significantly increased PCE/NCE ratio at all doses tested, demonstrating its anticytotoxic effect. In summary, CPN presented genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic properties...|$|R
40|$|Reversion to Lys(+) {{prototrophy}} in a haploid yeast strain {{containing a}} defined lys 2 frameshift mutation has been examined. When cells were plated on synthetic complete medium lacking only lysine, {{the numbers of}} Lys(+) <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies</b> accumulated in a time-dependent manner {{in the absence of}} any detectable increase in cell number. An examination of the distribution of the numbers of early appearing Lys(+) colonies from independent cultures suggests that the mutations to prototrophy occurred randomly during nonselective growth. In contrast, an examination of the distribution of late appearing Lys(+) colonies indicates that the underlying reversion events occurred after selective plating. No accumulation of Lys(+) revertants occurred when cells were starved for tryptophan, leucine or both lysine and tryptophan prior to plating selectively for Lys(+) revertants. These results indicate that mutations accumulate more frequently when they confer a selective advantage, and are thus consistent with the occurrence of adaptive mutations in yeast...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} 3, 4 -secoisopimar- 4 (18), 7, 15 -trien- 3 -oic acid, a diterpenoid {{isolated}} from Salvia cinnabarina, were evaluated in the Ames test on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 and on Escherichia coli WP 2 uvrA, in presence and in {{absence of the}} metabolic activation system. The secoisopimarane diterpenoid not only showed to be devoid of mutagenic activity, but significantly inhibited the effect of some known mutagens, in all strains tested. The reduction {{of the number of}} chemically- induced <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies</b> reached the value of 92. 2 % against 2 -aminoanthracene, 59. 6 % against 2 -nitrofluorene, 50. 9 % against sodium azide and 39. 9 % against methyl methane sulfonate. It is hypothesized that the secoisopimarane diterpenoid acts by aspecific mechanisms, by alterating the cell permeability thus blocking the mutagen adsorption across the bacterial membrane, or by chemical or enzymatic inhibition of the mutagens...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} amount of the total organically bound chlorine found in the marine environment has not been identified. A large portion of this unidentified organochlorine {{has been found to}} be associated with the lipids of marine organisms. If these unknown compounds are biologically active, then their presence may have negative consequences for the animal. Extracts from the blubber of seals from Newfoundland and from the blubber of seals and beluga whales from St. Lawrence River were tested for mutagenic activity using the Ames test before and after GPC fractionation in order to attempt to identify fractions containing mutagenic activity. However, no significant mutagenic activity was present in either case, although the whole lipid extracts were able to cause a higher number of <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies</b> than the fractionated samples. The presence of known organochlorine compounds were confirmed in the beluga whale samples by acid hydrolysis followed by GCI EI MS analysis. Details of methodologies and results of this work will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Mistlero C {{was shown}} to be non-genotoxic {{in a series of}} {{genotoxicity}} tests, including a bacterial reverse mutation test and a combined in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, no significant increases in the number of <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies,</b> compared to the negative control, was detected in 5, 000 ㎍/plate of Mistlero C. In addition, with Mistlero C, no changes were shown in the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) among 2, 000 polychromatic erythrocytes compared to the negative control. Mistlero C was administered orally in rats to investigate acute toxicity. The LD 50 values in rats were above 2, 000 ㎎/㎏. In a repeated dose, 13 -week, oral toxicity study conducted in rats, no compound-related adverse effects were shown at doses of Mistlero C of up to 1, 000 ㎎/ ㎏ body weight/day. The results of these studies support the safe use of Mistlero C in food for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|Blood {{samples were}} {{obtained}} from a population of refinery workers representing different age groups. Sixty six men with low average exposure to benzene and 33 male controls were investigated. An examination of cell cycle kinetics and sister chromatid exchange was carried out on control and exposed individuals. No {{significant differences were found}} between groups of individuals varying in their drinking and smoking habits or their exposure to diagnostic x rays. Individuals with the lowest and highest phenol values were examined for urine mutagenicity, with urinary phenol used here as an indicator of benzene exposure. There was no difference in the number of <b>revertant</b> <b>colonies</b> in strains TA 98 and 100 between the high and low urinary phenol groups. There were also no differences in any of the biochemical measures or haematological parameters investigated in all the individuals except that higher values for mean corpuscular volume were found in exposed than in control individuals. These values, however, were within the normal clinical range...|$|R
