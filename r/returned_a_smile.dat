Psychology students from universities in the cities surveyed, found that 70 out of every 100 Bristolians <b>returned</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> from Comic Relief researchers. This put Bristol first in their [...] "smiles per hour" [...] census, the table makes interesting reading with Londoners only returning a smile 18% of the time. Bristol comedian Tony Robinson said: [...] "We do smile {{a lot in the}} city, but sometimes it is not really a smile - we are just a little bit constipated." ...|$|E

60|$|Brace uttered an oath, and {{ran back}} in the {{direction}} signified by his companion. Presently he <b>returned</b> with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> of triumph.|$|R
60|$|Iduna trembled. She was agreeably {{surprised}} when the prince <b>returned</b> with <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> countenance, and joined in the meal, with many cheerful words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. Should {{you think}} so?" [...] he <b>returned,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> that out-measured the morsels {{on the plate}} before her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} out for a little while, Miss Oliver," [...] Victoria answered, and the nurse <b>returned</b> <b>a</b> gentle <b>smile</b> of understanding.|$|R
50|$|A {{suggestion}} may {{direct the}} thoughts to notice a new concept, {{focus on a}} specific area within the world, offer new perspectives that later may influence action-choices, offer triggers for automatic behaviour (such as <b>returning</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile),</b> or indicate specific action types. In hypnotherapy the portrayed realistic experience of the client's requested outcome is suggested with flattery or urgency, as well as personalised to the client's own motivations, drives, and tastes.|$|R
60|$|Leonard {{tried to}} smile, but only succeeded in keeping back a sob; and the Doctor {{discharged}} his {{memory of the}} messages of love {{of which he had}} been the depositary. Leonard recovered his composure during these, and was able to <b>return</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> on hearing of Ella's conquest of Tom, of their Bible prints on Sunday, and their unwearied French billiards in the week. Then he asked after little Mab.|$|R
6000|$|Such a {{challenge}} Fleda was obliged in some manner to take up. [...] "You may be settling Mona," [...] she <b>returned</b> with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "but I can hardly {{regard it as}} sufficient evidence that you're settling Mona's lover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{depends on}} one's point of view," [...] Hodder <b>returned,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "I {{do not know}} how you have come to suspect that I am going to disturb Mr. Parr, but what I have to say to him is between him and me." ...|$|R
60|$|The Honorable Erastus gave a roar {{like a wild}} bull, but Uncle John {{had walked}} quietly out and climbed into his buggy. He looked back, and seeing Mr. Hopkins's scowling face at the window <b>returned</b> <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} <b>smile</b> as he drove away.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, but he who cannot hit <b>a</b> bull's-eye," [...] <b>returned</b> Ian, with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "can {{scarcely}} {{be expected}} to touch a maiden's--I mean a grizzly's heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Except that I'm {{keeping you}} all waiting," [...] she <b>returned,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> letting the eyes in {{question}} fall with a half-parting salutation on Guest as she rose. It {{was the first}} exchange of a common instinct between them, and left them as conscious {{as if they had}} pressed hands.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear boy!' <b>returned</b> Eugene with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> 'we both {{thank you}} heartily. Lizzie, {{tell them how}} welcome they are, and that I would be eloquent if I could.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "How did {{you find}} out that?" [...] he <b>returned</b> with <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Why, guardian," [...] I explained, not without {{reddening}} a little at hazarding what was in my thoughts, [...] "there is something so tender in his manner, after all, and he is so very courtly and gentle to us, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. But {{talk to me}} first," [...] she <b>returned,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "You'll find {{me better}} company than that crowd upstairs. Tell me about yourself.... Oh, I know {{soldiers}} hate to talk about themselves and the war. Never mind the war. Are you well? Did you get hurt? You look so--so frail, Daren." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘It is a {{visit that}} I purpose to delay,’ <b>returned</b> Somerset, with <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> ‘My fortune has {{definite}} limits. It consists, or rather this morning it consisted, {{of one hundred}} pounds.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By all means, Dick," [...] <b>returned</b> Dora, with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> {{that made}} him pinch her arm. [...] "But listen, dear," [...] she added, in a whisper. [...] "Did you--did you notice Tom?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; only starved!" [...] <b>returned</b> Tom, <b>a</b> slight <b>smile</b> of humour {{flickering}} for {{a second}} on his pale face even in that hour of his extremity.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{visit that}} I purpose to delay," [...] <b>returned</b> Somerset, with <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "My fortune has {{definite}} limits. It consists, or rather this morning it consisted, {{of one hundred}} pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{truth in}} what you say, Disco," [...] <b>returned</b> Harold, with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "but come, you must admit that there is {{something}} savage in the custom they have of wearing these hideous lip-rings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I, man," [...] <b>returned</b> Biarne, with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> and <b>a</b> {{shake of}} the head. [...] "It is long since {{my heart was}} buried in Iceland. I am doomed {{to be an old}} {{bachelor}} now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} {{puts you in}} mind of the South at home," [...] <b>returned</b> Ben, with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "It is nice, certainly. But I fancy this continual heat would make one mighty lazy in time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have practiced so much, and so successfully, Major Dunwoodie, {{that it is}} {{no wonder}} you excel in deceiving the credulity of my sex," [...] <b>returned</b> Frances, {{attempting}} <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> which the tremulousness of her muscles smothered at birth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Grahame <b>returned</b> with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "I haven't much to tell. I have {{no family}} {{business}} {{to fall back}} on. As my means were not large enough to let me live as I liked at home, I went abroad to increase them. So far I haven't succeeded; but, on the whole, I've {{had a pretty good}} time, and I don't see much reason for grumbling about my luck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know that, old fellow," [...] <b>returned</b> Stanley, with <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Franklin is {{not done}} with his discoveries yet; there's a talk of sending off another {{expedition}} some of these days, I hear, so {{you may have a}} chance yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I mean to," [...] <b>returned</b> Biarne, with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "for {{the weather}} is pleasanter outside than in; but I must first presume to put the {{question}} that brought me here. Do you chance to know where Leif is this morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>returned</b> Maud with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "I wouldn't {{think of}} {{retreating}} if I felt that our services were really needed, {{but there are}} so many women coming here for Red Cross work--English, French, Swiss, Dutch and Italian--that they seem able to cover the field thoroughly." ...|$|R
40|$|Social {{interaction}} {{is a key}} driving force behind any team activity. Real time closely coupled interaction where we quickly see the effect of our actions on others is an important feature of social interaction. For example, <b>smiling</b> and <b>returning</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> shaking hands and passing a gift or business card {{are some of the}} most important interactions in the real world. Collaborative Virtual Environments offers the potential for social interaction between geographically distributed groups. Closely coupled {{interaction is}}, however, very difficult in present CVE systems. This is because this medium lags behind real world communication in terms of representation, consistency and responsiveness. This paper takes a psychological perspective describing how the primary forms of human communication in the real world map to those in the virtual. We discuss how each form of communication relates to the feeling of co-presence giving real examples of behaviour observed an example application. We present detailed results from user evaluation focusing on the perceived importance of these influences on collaboration...|$|R
