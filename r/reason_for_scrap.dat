40|$|The {{most common}} <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>scrapping</b> a wind turbine in Denmark {{is to make}} room for a newer turbine. The {{decision}} to scrap a wind turbine is then highly dependent on an opportunity cost that comes from the interaction of scarce land resources, technological change and changes in subsidy policy. Using a Cox regression model I show that turbines that are located in areas with better wind resources are at a higher risk of being scrapped. Policies put in place in order to encourage the scrapping of older, poorly placed turbines actually have a larger effect on well-placed turbine...|$|R
50|$|The {{shooting}} {{began in}} Trivandrum on 6 June 2011. Mammootty joined the set on 13 June. After one round of shooting in Trivandrum, the shooting shifted to Kochi {{and then to}} Delhi. Some scenes were also shot in Kozhikode. It is reported that the shooting of the film {{was going on in}} Kochi, when the income tax raids at Mammootty's residence took place. Mammootty had to be present before the investigators and the filming was delayed to a few days. It is also reported that the ill-health of Suresh Gopi was another <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>scrapping</b> the shooting of the film. He is said to have reduced 15 kilos to look thinner, which led him to face health problems and take a leave from filming.|$|R

40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{experimentation}} which took place at a cable manufacturing company. The thesis describes and summarizes the various strategies and techniques that has been applied and practiced <b>for</b> <b>scrap</b> reduction. DMAIC and Six Sigma Technology has been proven very help full {{in order to reduce}} scrap to a major extent. DMAIC help to identify areas in process where extra expense exist, identify the biggest impact factor related production expenses, introduce appropriate measurement system, optimize process and reduce production cost and time. Many issues were detected by the production, such as a lack of a unified procedure <b>for</b> documenting <b>scrap,</b> as well as cable manufacturing concerns suggested by new and experienced operators. Another concern was how best to focus on insulated wire <b>scraps,</b> the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>scraps</b> and how to correct such things and prevention. The research task of accurately measuring the scrap by improving scrap logistic proved to be very successful in order to measure scrap accurately. A statistical approach has been taken to find the factors affecting the scrap. ^ The results indicate a precise way <b>for</b> <b>scrap</b> reduction. The results starts from the plant level scrap, in comparison with the scrap in previous months in this year. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{focussed}} on improving the material yield in closed-die forging and rolling. The former {{is restricted to}} the manufacturing of heavy crown wheels and front axle beams and the latter to the hot rolling of steel slabs. To enhance the yield the commercial FE-codes Form 2 D and Dyna 3 D are used. Results from forging simulations are strengthened by full scale experiments. The research is carried out in near contact with the Swedish steel and engineering industry. In closed die forging, two bulk forming problems are treated: How to improve the tool design and how to change the pre-form geometry for decreasing the amount of material exiting the flash gap? In slab rolling, two problems related to material defects are considered: How to eliminate existing surface cracks and how to prevent the formation of voids around macro-inclusions embedded in the steel matrix? Internal voids might be the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>scrapping</b> the whole workpiece. Considering the forging of crown wheels, a new concept is proposed. For making the central hole of the product, the traditional method was forging a thin circular plate which was then sheared off and scrapped. Using the new technique this operation is replaced by forging a conical tap in the centre, which is then discarded. Doing so, the inner scrap material decreased with about 15 %. The idea {{has been used in}} production for seven years. – Regarding the forging of front axle beams, a quasi- 3 D method is used comprising full scale measurements of the axial material flow. Here the theoretical material yield increased 2 - 7 %. Regarding rolling, the initial surface cracks in the simulations are V-shaped with a crack angle of 6 o and of depth 5 - 20 mm. The inclusions are cylindrical and either three times harder or three times softer than the matrix. The behaviour of the cracks and the inclusions are studied as influenced by process parameters. Current industrial input data are used as a reference. – It is concluded that longitudinal cracks cannot be totally eliminated. During rolling their V-shape gradually changes to Y-shape and a remaining oxide flake separates the crack bottom surfaces. For minimizing the detrimental influence of the entrapped oxide, an early closure of the crack bottom is important. Throughout the remaining rolling schedule the entrapped oxide is then torn to pieces with large areas of virgin metal in between ensuring a strong bond. The following recommendations are given for the longitudinal cracks: Light drafts/pass {{at the beginning of the}} rolling schedule followed by heavy ones. – Contradictory to longitudinal cracks it is concluded that transversal cracks are possible to eliminate. When eliminated, the initial bottom of the crack coincides with the slab surface. No folds are formed. For the transversal cracks light drafts/pass are proposed together with reversal rolling, the latter for avoiding crack folding. – Voids are easiest formed around hard macro-inclusions in the centre of the slab. Large rolls and heavy drafts are recommended to avoid this. QC 2010072...|$|R
50|$|The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> {{discarding}} the windmill {{technology for}} cane juice extraction was {{the introduction of}} steam.
