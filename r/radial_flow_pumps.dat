40|$|Pump-pipeline {{systems are}} a common feature of every {{industry}} and account for about 20 % of the worldâ€™s electrical energy demand. Pump and pipe selection should happen simultaneously in pump-pipe system design rather than first sizing the pipe and then finding the pump {{to go with the}} pipe. Further, proper selection of systems should go beyond just considering only the initial cost but the total cost of ownership- the life cycle cost (LCC). In this paper a spreadsheet tool is developed for pump-pipe system technical analysis with the output design parameters facilitating LCC analysis. The program can calculate the operating point of any size of pump, at any given speed and with any pipe size and by use of appropriate cost models determine the unit cost of pumping for each system. Dimensionless pump characteristic curves that are generic for all <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pumps</b> are modelled by multi-polynomial equations. Dimensional similitude can then be used to determine the actual characteristic curves for any pump of given impeller diameter and rotational speed. The system resistance curve is calculated from well-known hydraulic formulae and represented by a quadratic equation. The operating point of the pump-pipe system is obtained from a simultaneous solution of the quadratic equations representing the pump and the pipe resistance curves. Best practice technical constraints, like maximum deviation from best-efficiency point (BEP), allowable net positive suction head and maximum allowable operating hours, can be set by the designer. Operating the pump-pipe system near best efficiency point is desirable since it reduces both energy and pump maintenance costs. A pump-pipe system is selected only if it falls within designer-specified best practice constraints. The life cycle cost of each system that passes the first test is then calculated using discounting techniques and the pump-pipe system with the least LCC is adopted.,Zimbabwe Institution of Engineer...|$|E

Investigation {{of the behavior of}} the above impeller for a wide flow rate range and for various rotational speeds was carried out and the obtained experimental results were validated with available measurements of the same impeller within spiral casing. The flow field through the impeller was also simulated by a 2 -dimensional approach. For the numerical simulation, the viscous Navier-Stokes equations are solved with the control volume approach and the k-ε turbulence model. The flow domain is discretized with a polar, unstructured, Cartesian mesh that covers a periodically symmetric section of the impeller. Advanced numerical techniques for adaptive grid refinement and for the partially blocked cells are also implemented at the irregular boundaries of the blades. The numerical results are compared to the measurements, showing good agreement and encouraging the extension of the developed computation methodology for performance prediction and for design optimization of such impeller geometries.

40|$|A {{study of}} the core flow {{instability}} in the radial vaneless diffusers is performed {{for the purpose of}} better understanding of the rotating stall mechanism. In this paper the numerical results are compared with the experimental results. A commercial code with the standard incompressible viscous flow solver is applied, to model the vaneless diffuser core flow in the plane parallel to the diffuser walls. Since the analysis is restricted to the core flow region, the influence of the wall boundary layers is neglected. Therefore, this model is only applicable to the wide vaneless radial diffusers. Using this numerical model a twodimensional rotating flow instability, similar to rotating stall, is found to exist. The numerical results are compared with the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements performed in the vaneless diffuser behind a <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> impeller. The measurements are performed at low mass flow rates, when the unsteady flow phenomena like rotating stall occur.

40|$|The non-shrinking {{property}} of silicon-infiltrated silicon carbide (SiSiC) makes it ideal {{for the production}} of larger and complex shaped ceramic components. However, its industrial realisation often fails due to the high level of manufacturing expenditure, based on process-related uncertainties and high device-related expenses. The focus of this thesis is the creation of scientific and technical requirements for the development of innovative manufacturing processes for such structural ceramics. These have to guarantee a high degree of process reliability and reproductibility as well as to hold its ground in the economic competition with other technologies. The crucial issue is the implementation of polymer concrete casting techniques on ceramic moulding during the manufacturing process. Hereby, a polymer concrete formation consisting of a mixture of SiC powders and a special binding agent was developed. This formation can be casted in an open mold without pressure followed by a curing stage. After curing, the polymer concrete can be converted into SiSiC by a pyrolisis and a reaction bonding process with liquid silicon. This casting technique enables the easy production of large and complex shaped components especially with undercuts and wall thickness differences.

The present study refers to new experiments combining pressure measurements and 2 D/ 3 C High Speed PIV at partial flow rates within a vaneless diffuser with a large outlet radius. Four Brüel & Kjaer condenser microphones are used for the unsteady pressure measurements. They were flush mounted on the shroud side of the diffuser wall and on the suction pipe of the pump.
