5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> it was over to me.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} album, Listen, {{includes}} much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material. Pritchard described the band's most recent album Listen as “percussion sonnets”. “The first couple albums I made I never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about rhythms, I {{focused on the}} recording and the lyrics”, Pritchard said.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set {{in the living room}} was the typical way of {{listening}} to radio. Stations tried to {{be all things to all}} people, and specialised programming was not <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same.|$|E

25|$|Lopez {{was growing}} {{surrounded}} by shoes and everything related to shoe production. Her observations {{and attention to}} the techniques gave her deep knowledge of the shoe construction and design concepts. Later, in the interview for the Spanish Magazine Surrealista, Lopez admitted that she was always attracted by art and creative process but she never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> to work neither in the shoe industry nor in fashion.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{after the}} release of the American {{animation}} movie Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and other DreamWorks members visited the city of Chengdu. In addition to seeing live pandas, crew members learned about the local culture. Katzenberg has stated that Kung Fu Panda 2 incorporates many elements of Chengdu in the film. The film's landscape and architecture also found inspiration from those found at Mount Qingcheng, a renowned Taoist mountain. In an interview with Movieline, Berger stated that ‘we never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> of this as a movie set in China for Americans; it's a movie set in a mythical, universalized China for everyone in the world'.|$|E
25|$|At the War Policy Committee (3 October) in Robertson’s absence, Lloyd George urged greater {{effort to}} advance into Syria {{with a view}} to {{knocking}} Turkey out of the war altogether, and the ministers decided to redeploy 2 divisions from France. Robertson angered the Prime Minister (5 October) by arguing against this, claiming that these troops would be needed in France. He also asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the Gaza–Beersheba line (30 miles wide) to the Jaffa–Jerusalem line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a German-reinforced threat (although neither Allenby nor Robertson <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> there was much chance of this happening), but urging Maude not to exaggerate his needs in Mesopotamia.|$|E

25|$|Akira Yamanaka {{was born}} in Yokohama, Japan, on September 2, 1946. He {{grew up in a}} family of seven children, though the only one of mixed descent as his father was a US Army soldier of Caribbean descent. In his autobiography, he {{mentions}} that he never met his biological father and that he came from a poor family in ruined Yokohama; being born in a brothel as his mother was a prostitute for the Recreation and Amusement Association. The only knowledge of his father was that he was a US soldier from either Cuba or Jamaica. Joe grew up in an orphanage after his mother and stepfather died. During an interview with Mainichi Shimbun, Akira stated that he was born with tuberculosis and that he never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about his biological father, believing those who raise you are your real parents.|$|E
500|$|The fight scene, {{according}} to Jared Harris, was Lane discovering what Pete <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> of him. Harris saw the boxing match as [...] "a mix {{of so many}} different styles" [...] with Lane carrying an [...] "old school and traditional" [...] stance. Harris saw it as Lane getting a chance to [...] "fight for his dignity".|$|E
500|$|Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Harry's other {{best friend}} and the trio's brains. Watson's Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents {{and she had to}} do over five {{interviews}} before she got the part. Watson took her audition seriously, but [...] "never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> [...] had any chance of getting the role." [...] The producers were impressed by Watson's self-confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who had applied.|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{you will}} {{allow me to}} have the honour!" [...] he cried; and then seeing {{that we were all}} laughing, he began to laugh also, but I am sure that there was <b>really</b> no <b>thought</b> of a joke in his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my friend," [...] I answered; [...] "but you {{and another}} have lost your best cow." [...] And {{word for word}} I {{repeated}} to him Mameena's message. When I had finished <b>really</b> I <b>thought</b> that Umbezi was about to faint.|$|R
500|$|After these rescued emigrants made {{it safely}} into Bear Valley, William Hook, Jacob Donner's stepson, broke into food stores and fatally gorged himself. The others {{continued}} on to Sutter's Fort, where Virginia Reed wrote [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> I had stepped over into paradise". She was amused {{to note that}} one of the young men asked her to marry him, although she was only 12 years old and recovering from starvation, but she turned him down.|$|E
500|$|Moa {{stated that}} [...] "this {{is the first}} album that I <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about what I wanted ... I wanted to keep [...] simple in structure, concentrating on the {{layering}} of vocals and guitars." [...] With Love in Motion, Moa moved away from her traditional pop and country pop sound to a pop rock environment. She intentionally changed the sound, through alterations in production and engineering, rather than the writing style. Moa told co-producer Andre Upston that she wanted the album to sound [...] "dirty and gritty." ...|$|E
500|$|Asashōryū gave a {{press conference}} in Mongolia on 11 March, and denied {{committing}} any [...] "act of violence," [...] but said he did not regret his decision to retire. He claimed it was [...] "an undeniable fact" [...] that there were people within the Sumo Association [...] "trying to push me out of sumo" [...] and that he could have gone on to win 30 or more tournament titles. Asked about rumours that he would enter mixed martial arts, he replied, [...] "I haven't <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about what to do next." [...] He refused to take any questions from Japanese reporters.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> have <b>thought</b> {{nothing about}} that," [...] I replied; [...] "but I expect I mean {{to get at}} the bottom of it, and if the bogus Captain Trent is to be found on the earth's surface, I guess I mean to find him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{speak for}} your own!"--and {{as he moved}} back I might <b>really</b> have <b>thought</b> him uneasy. There was {{a hint of the}} same note in the way he went on: [...] "I assure you I decline all {{responsibility}}. I see the responsibility as quite beautifully yours." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Really,</b> he <b>thought</b> {{they had}} now talked enough about fairies, and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. 'I can't think {{where she has}} gone to,' he said, rising, and he called Tink by name. Wendy's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.|$|R
500|$|In 1904, Edwin S. Porter {{directed}} a film entitled Capture of the [...] "Yegg" [...] Bank Burglars, distributed by Edison Studios. Filmed in August and September of that year, the film features {{a group of}} robbers who execute a heist. Porter had been motivated to produce it by The Bold Bank Robbery. A man from Belleville, Ontario, who held screenings of The Bold Bank Robbery and paired it with other films in the crime genre, once screened the films at a fair. The man {{was surprised by the}} ovation received from the audience, writing that [...] "The applause was something amazing. I <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> the grandstand had collapsed." ...|$|E
500|$|Winehouse told a {{magazine}} that the drugs were to blame for her hospitalisation and that [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> that it was over for me then." [...] Soon afterward, Winehouse's father commented that when he had made public statements regarding her problems he was using the media because it seemed {{the only way to}} get through to her. In an interview with The Album Chart Show on British television, Winehouse said she was manic depressive and not alcoholic, adding that that sounded like [...] "an alcoholic in denial." [...] A US reporter writes that Winehouse was a [...] "victim of mental illness in a society that doesn't understand or respond to mental illness with great effectiveness." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{made his}} debut for the Trinidad and Tobago {{national}} team on 29 January 2003 in a match against Finland. Jones scored his first goal on 25 May 2005 in a 4–0 win against Bermuda. He was later selected by Trinidad and Tobago for their 2006 World Cup campaign, {{where he made}} his first appearance in the competition in a 2–0 defeat against England on 15 June 2006 at Frankenstadion, Nuremberg. Jones was named as Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation's Player of the Year for 2007. Jones said, [...] "A lot of big names have won this before and I never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about something like this happening to me". Jones was named as captain of the Soca Warriors in August 2011 by manager Otto Pfister.|$|E
60|$|Gwendolen laughed. All {{that seemed}} kind and natural enough: Grandcourt's fastidiousness {{enhanced}} the kindness.

500|$|The {{concept of}} Aquaman {{stemmed from a}} fifth season episode of Smallville, [...] "Aqua". The episode {{featured}} Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) coming to Smallville to stop an underwater weapons project being developed by LuthorCorp. [...] "Aqua" [...] became the highest rated episode for Smallville that season, {{but it was never}} meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman series. However, as work progressed on [...] "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, the creators of Smallville, also considered a series featuring Lois Lane, but felt more confident about Aquaman. Millar said," [...] was the first idea where we <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> we had a franchise where we could see 100 episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Tolkien's own {{translation}} of Beowulf, published posthumously in 2014 as , {{has been linked}} to the essay. Shippey has argued that the translation throws light on [...] "what Tolkien <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> in 1936". Tolkien stated, for instance, that Beowulf was not an actual picture of Scandinavia around 500 AD, but was a self-consistent picture with the marks of design and thought. This might leave the reader wondering, commented Shippey, what exactly Tolkien meant by that. Shippey argued that there was evidence from the chronology given in the 2014 book, supported by the work of scholars such as Martin Rundkvist, that there was serious trouble among the eastern Geats, with migration and the taking over of mead-halls by new leaders, at that time, just as portrayed in the poem.|$|E
500|$|With a {{collection}} of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch, Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension. Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> I'd be seeing Elvis soon." [...] He {{was back on the}} road by mid-year, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric [...] "Blowin' in the Wind".|$|E

How do you reconcile those two? ...|$|R
