40|$|Abstract:- A curve with a {{monotone}} <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature {{distribution is}} {{considered as a}} fair curve {{in the area of}} Computer Aided Aesthetic Design (CAAD). But no official standards have been established. Therefore, a criterion for a fair curve is proposed. A quintic NURBS curve, the first derivative of a quintic NURBS curve, curvature vector, curvature, and <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature are expressed. The concept <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature specification to modify the shape of a NURBS curve is illustrated. The difference between the NURBS curve <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature and the specified <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature is minimized by introducing the least-squares method to modify the shape of the NURBS curve. Algebraic functions such as linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, and six degrees are applied to the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution of the designed curve as the specified <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature. The <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distributions given by these six algebraic functions are considered monotone, because the independent variable of these algebraic functions is monotone to the corresponding dependent variable of these functions. Similarity is evaluated using the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution according to six algebraic functions as references and the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution of the designed curves as matches by using correlation matching. Curve shape similarity evaluation is tried using an example. Considering that a curve with a monotone variation <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution is fair, the similarity of the designed curve to a fair curve is evaluated. This measured similarity expresses fairness to the fair curve. Using this technique, the fairness of a curve is evaluated by using the similarity <b>of</b> the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution.
