50|$|The {{propellant}} {{particle size}} distribution has {{a profound impact on}} APCP rocket motor performance. Smaller AP and Al particles lead to higher combustion efficiency but also lead to increased linear burn rate. The burn rate is heavily dependent on mean AP particle size as the AP absorbs heat to decompose into a gas before it can oxidize the fuel components. This process may be a rate-limiting step in the overall combustion rate of APCP. The phenomenon can be explained by considering the heat flux to mass ratio: As the particle radius increases the volume (and, therefore, mass and heat capacity) increase as the cube of the radius. However, the surface area increases as the square of the radius, which is roughly proportional to the heat flux into the particle. Therefore, a particle's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> is maximized when the particle size is minimized.|$|E
5000|$|Ni-Cd {{batteries}} can {{be charged}} at several different rates, {{depending on how}} the cell was manufactured. The charge rate is measured based on the percentage of the amp-hour capacity the battery is fed as a [...] current over the duration of the charge. Regardless of the charge speed, more energy must be supplied to the battery than its actual capacity, to account for energy loss during charging, with faster charges being more efficient. For example, an [...] "overnight" [...] charge, might consist of supplying a current equal to one tenth the amperehour rating (C/10) for 14-16 hours; that is, a 100 mAh battery takes 10 mA for 14 hours, for a total of 140 mAh to charge at this rate. At the rapid-charge rate, done at 100% of the rated capacity of the battery in 1 hour (1C), the battery holds roughly 80% of the charge, so a 100 mAh battery takes 125 mAh to charge (that is, approximately 1 hour and fifteen minutes). Some specialized batteries can be charged in as little as 10-15 minutes at a 4C or 6C charge rate, but this is very uncommon. It also greatly increases the risk of the cells overheating and venting due to an internal overpressure condition: the cell's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> is governed by its internal resistance and the square of the charging rate. At a 4C rate, the amount of heat generated in the cell is sixteen times higher than the heat at the 1C rate. The downside to faster charging is the higher risk of overcharging, which can damage the battery. and the increased temperatures the cell has to endure (which potentially shortens its life).|$|E

Remote sensing technologies can assist to improve the estimation accuracy also providing means for computing evapotranspiration geographical distribution. In the present study, the daily actual evapotranspiration was calculated for 21 days uniformly distributed during the 2001 summer season over Thessaly plain. Three different methods were accordingly adapted and applied: the remote-sensing methods by Granger (Granger, 2000) and Carlson-Buffum (Carlson & Buffum, 1989) using satellite data together with ground meteorological measurements and an adapted FAO Penman-Monteith method, used as reference method.

40|$|Competing in {{a global}} market place forces {{chemical}} industry to be flexible and cost-effective in production. To optimize production the processes are modeled before they are built. Normally these models show the steady-state behavior. This, however, will be insufficient to show {{the flexibility of the}} process and guarantee safety and environmental constraints are met under all circumstances. Dynamic models are useful to give extra insight in the operability, flexibility and profitability of a process. The goals of this project are to build a model that will describe startup and shutdown behavior of a process and perform a simplified optimization of a specific startup procedure. For these goals a model has been constructed in gPROMS, which gives a representation of the dynamic behavior of a glycolether process. This process consists of a reactor, distillation column and recycle. The model consists of over 15 000 equations, which include the physical properties of the system. Further features of the model are the use of an equilibrium tray model, inclusion of liquid flows over the weir and dumping through the holes, inclusion of vapor flows through the holes and through the downcomer, addition and purge of inert, and a dynamic, single phase, plug-flow reactor of the shell-and-tube-type operating under turbulent flow conditions. All trends in the profiles of the model and ASPEN follow each other nicely and the steady state is estimated to be 5 - 10 % accurate compared to ASPEN. The model is capable of describing a shutdown, as long as vapor escapes through the downcomer from the reboiler. It is also capable of describing a startup in which the column is heated, inerts are purged, the reactor is heated and the steady-state is reached. All this is done without an external heat source, using only the heat generated by the reboiler. The results have not been verified experimentally. Several errors were made in modeling the process, such as an incorrect excess of MeOH in the reactor, incorrect surface areas for heat loss on the tray and in the reboiler, small reset rates for controllers in the condenser, large setpoint changes and high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> in the system. Their influences, however, are small, or can be corrected with longer calculation times. Drawbacks of the model are the long calculation times (2. 5 hours) and numerical instabilities. Also, the model developed is not completely generic, but could be adapted for other systems. During a simplified optimization by factorial design of the startup-schedule used, only four optimization steps were needed to reduce the loss at the end-point by 28 %, while only considering three variables. Though the absolute gain is only Hfl. 781, this demonstrates that optimization can lead to significant increases in profitability. Overall the model provides valuable insight in the processes that take place during dynamic operation of an interconnected reactor and distillation system.

The catalyst activity is inhibited by increasing carbon dioxide partial pressure. A microkinetic model of the reaction kinetics was developed. The model indicated that catalyst performance could be improved by decreasing the strength of surface oxygen bonds. Literature data indicated that adding either ceria or copper to the catalyst as a promoter might impart this desired effect. Ceria-promoted ferrochrome catalysts did not perform any better than unpromoted catalyst at the conditions tested, but copper-promoted ferrochrome catalysts did offer an improvement over the base ferrochrome material. A different class of water-gas shift catalyst, sulfided CoMo/Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } is not affected by carbon dioxide and may be a good alternative to the ferrochrome system, provided other constraints, notably the requisite sulfur level and maximum temperature, are not too limiting.

Peak steady-state power density in the target is about 640 MW/m{sup 3 } for 1 MW, whereas the pulse instantaneous peak power density {{is as high as}} 22, 000 GW/m{sup 3 }. The local peak <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> for a single pulse over it`s time-averaged value is only 6 {degrees}C, but the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> this <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> during the pulse is extremely fast ({approximately} 12 million {degrees}C/s). In addition to the resulting thermal shock and materials compatibility concerns, key feasibility issues for the target are related to its thermal-hydraulic performance. These include proper flow distribution, flow reversals and stagnation zones, possible {open_quotes}hot spots{close_quotes}, cooling of the beam {open_quotes}window{close_quotes}, and the challenge of mitigating the effects of thermal shock through possible injection of helium bubbles. An analytic approach was used on the PC spreadsheet EXCEL to evaluate target design options and to determine the global T/H parameters in the current concept. The general computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code CFX was used to simulate the detailed time-averaged two-dimensional thermal and flow distributions in the liquid mercury. In this paper, an overview of the project and the results of this preliminary work are presented. Heat transfer characteristics of liquid mercury under wetting and non-wetting conditions are discussed, and future directions of the program in T/H analysis and R&D are outlined...|$|R
