40|$|Elastomer seals {{are widely}} used in {{the oil and gas}} {{industry}} and form small but crucial parts of critical mechanical and electronic components. Ideally, to prevent damage to such components, the seals should act as impermeable barriers. However, under the high pressures and temperatures found downhole, they are liable to suffer two main types of permeation-driven failure, either by gases permeating through the entire seal, or by dissolved gases causing swelling and rupture, in a process known as explosive decompression. Neither failure mode is particularly well understood, and experimental approaches have encountered difficulties in replicating service conditions and providing insight into the mechanisms responsible. In this work, I use a molecular-simulation-based approach to investigate the drivers of and trends in the permeation of gases as a function of the underlying polymer chemistry and the environmental conditions. I focus on two elastomers in particular that {{are widely used}} in {{the oil and gas industry}} due to their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and to thermal degradation: nitrile butadiene rubber, or NBR, which is a statistical copolymer of acrylonitrile and butadiene, and hydrogenated-NBR, or HNBR, which is a polymer derived from the cross-linking and saturation of NBR. For NBR, I first develop a fully atomistic model using the OPLS-AA force-field. I demonstrate that solubility increases with acrylonitrile content, the cyano group plays a crucial role in the enhanced solubility of polar gases, and that the effects of pressure and temperature are heavily gas-dependent. In contrast, the diffusivity is found to decrease with increasing acrylonitrile content. For HNBR, I show that, while the diffusivity decreases with increasing cross-link fraction, counter-intuitively, the solubility increases. The work in this thesis provides a set of molecular-level design principles for the future development of corrosion- and decompression-resistant elastomers. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{fabrication}} of high-toughness nylon {{with a wide}} range of vinyl-acetate content offers opportunities for high-performance mater-ial design. Nylon is one of the most important engineering plastics. It is charac-terized by high stiffness and good <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> solvents. However, as a pseudoductile polymer, it usually has high unnotched but low notched impact strength. (This refers <b>to</b> its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> frac-ture using standard tests without and with preset notches carved into the material.)

Carboxylated polymers, and particularly carboxylated rubbers, are regarded as {{a new class of}} polymers with superior physical and mechanical properties over non-carboxy-lated counterparts. Upon introducing carboxyl groups, the properties such as elasticity range, strength, compatibility towards functional fillers and polymers, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> solvents enhance and cross-linking by non-sulfur reagents becomes possible. The XSBR latex benefits from excellent mechanical and chemical stability, excellent liquidity, high bond and conjunction strength, high toughness and the strength after molding, low water absorption and air shrinkage, excellent durability, abrasion, oil and corrosion resistance of cement products. Due to the polarity offered by carboxyl groups, fiber, and particulate composites of XSBR exhibit improved physical and mechanical properties.

This paper describes drug transporters of the filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans (Eidam) Winter, Botrytis cinerea Pers and Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fu¿ckel) Schroter that function in fungicide sensitivity and resistance. The fungi possess ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters that mediate MDR to fungicides in laboratory mutants.

Seven Indian strains of Ae. aegypti were found to be tolerant to DDT and highly susceptible to certain organophosphorus compounds such as Abate, Dursban, fenthion and fenitrothion. Hence selection studies were started with these organophosphorus compounds. Laboratory selections on these strains for 20 generations with Abate, Dursban, malathion, fenthion and fenitrothion increased the tolerance of the F 20 larvae to these insecticides by 2. 4 times, 3. 7 times, 3 times, 5. 6 times and 2 times, respectively. The dosage—mortality lines of the successive generations were steep and parallel, suggesting these were instances of tolerance and not of resistance. In contrast, DDT selection showed rapid changes in dosage—mortality lines, indicating the development of resistance.

40|$|In vitro ammonia-oxidizing {{bacteria}} {{are capable of}} oxidizing hydrocarbons incompletely. This transformation is accompanied by competitive inhibition of ammonia monooxygenase, the first key enzyme in nitrification. The effect of hydrocarbon pollution on soil nitrification was examined in situ. In a microcosm study, adding diesel fuel <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>to</b> an uncontaminated soil (agricultural unfertilized soil) treated with ammonium sulfate dramatically reduced the amount of KCl-extractable nitrate but stimulated ammonium consumption. In a soil with long history of pollution that was treated with ammonium sulfate, 90 % of the ammonium was transformed into nitrate after 3 weeks of incubation. Nitrate production was twofold higher in the contaminated soil than in the agricultural soil <b>to</b> which <b>hydrocarbon</b> was not added. To assess if ammonia-oxidizing bacteria acquired <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> inhibition by <b>hydrocarbon,</b> the contaminated soil was reexposed to diesel fuel. Ammonium consumption was not affected, but nitrate production was 30 % lower than nitrate production {{in the absence of}} hydrocarbon. The apparent reduction in nitrification resulted from immobilization of ammonium by hydrocarbon-stimulated microbial activity. These results indicated that the hydrocarbon inhibited nitrification in the noncontaminated soil (agricultural soil) and that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in the polluted soil acquired <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> inhibition by the hydrocarbon, possibly by increasing the affinity of nitrifying bacteria for ammonium in the soil.

In this study we show the rational design of a series of novel dendritic peptide bolaamphiphile vectors that demonstrate high efficiency for the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) while exhibiting low cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity. Systematic investigation into structure−property relationships revealed an important correlation between molecular design, self-assembled nanostructure, and biological activity. The unique bolaamphiphile architecture proved a key factor for improved complex stability and transfection efficiency. The optimal vector contains a fluorocarbon core and exhibited enhanced delivery efficiency to a variety of cell lines and improved serum <b>resistance</b> when compared <b>to</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> analogues and lipofectamine RNAiMAX. In addition to introducing a promising new vector system for siRNA delivery, the structure− property relationships and “fluorocarbon effect ” revealed herein offer critical insight for further development of novel materials for nucleic acid delivery and other biomaterial applications.
