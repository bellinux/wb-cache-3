40|$|Abstract. Object-oriented {{technologies}} are frequently used {{to design and}} implement distributed applications. Object replication is a well-established approach to increase the dependability for such applications. Generic replication infrastructures often fail to meet non-standard application-specific requirements such as support for client-side computing. Our FTflex replication infrastructure combines the fragmented object model with semantic annotations in order to customize and optimize replication mechanisms, and thus provides a more flexible replication infrastructure. This paper presents DiGit, a replicated version control system based on the architecture of Git. DiGit is implemented {{with the help of}} the FTflex infrastructure for object replication. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the paper evaluates the fitness of our replication framework for a specific, complex application. We identify two advantages of the replication infrastructure: the ability to provide client-side code as a conceptually integral part of a <b>remote</b> <b>service,</b> and <b>support</b> for an optimized protocol for remote interaction. As a second contribution, the paper presents a powerful replicated version control system and shows the lessons learned from using object replication in such a system. ...|$|R

The research programme was commissioned and funded by the Knowledge Foundation (KK Stiftelsen) of Sweden and the British Council’s UK ‘Overseas Student Scholarship Scheme’. The research investigates pioneering approaches to supporting the maintenance and servicing complex machine systems in remote physical and geographical locations., Virtual engineering models had been used previously {{in the design and}} development lifecycle of manufacturing machine systems; this study pioneered the use of such tools in the operational phase of machinery (including service and maintenance). However, the key innovation was tight integration between these virtual engineering tools and Internet-based support tools. The system architecture was verified by implementations using different toolsets and various Internet technologies. A case study approach was used in the implementation forms of the testbeds, which include a prototype cylinder head (Volvo), an assembly cell at Euromaint and a robotic multiple press line at AP&T. This novel approach to <b>remote</b> machine <b>service</b> <b>support</b> devised in this collaborative study informed the strategies and investments made by Euromaint, a special purpose machine systems builder, for the remote support of clients’ systems (in Sweden and worldwide).

40|$|The {{formulation}} of a Personal Area Network (PAN), {{consisting of a}} wireless infrastructure of medical sensors, attached to patient's body, and a supervising device carried by them, lays the path for continuous and real-time monitoring of vital signs without discomforting the person in question. This infrastructure enhances the context of <b>remote</b> Healthcare <b>services</b> by <b>supporting</b> flexible acquisition of crucial vital signs, {{while at the same}} time it provides more convenience to the patient. Aiming at the exploitation of the inherent features and requirements of wireless medical sensor networks, in this paper we focus on the main design guidelines of a low power Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, designated to support a patient PAN. The proposed protocol intends to improve energy efficiency in such applications and thus is oriented towards the prevention of main energy wastage sources, such as collision, idle listening and power outspending. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Both DE and {{telehealth}} systems provide <b>remote</b> {{access to}} <b>services,</b> <b>supported</b> by digital technology infrastructure. Both systems aim {{to enhance the}} quality of <b>service</b> for <b>remote</b> communities that may otherwise not have access to expert knowledge or support. Unlike DE, which has been employing technology to support and teach students remotely for some time, telehealth is relatively new, with no standard technological tools. This paper describes opportunities for re-use of IT systems employed in DE into telehealth applications, where the “student ” and “educator” in the DE domain may be replaced by the “patient ” and “remote health care provider ” respectively in the telehealth domain. We consider similarities and differences between the requirements of patients vs. students, and the requirements of the remote health care provider vs. the educator. This investigation into the similarities of DE and telehealth exposes potential for the exploitation of DE systems and expertise that already exists and is readily available. Such resources may speed the employment of such technological tools for supporting patients remotely, increasing the options available for both health care professionals and patients...|$|R
