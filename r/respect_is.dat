5|$|The NBA All-Rookie Team is {{an annual}} National Basketball Association (NBA) honor given since the 1962–63 NBA season {{to the top}} rookies during the regular season. Voting is {{conducted}} by the NBA head coaches; who {{are not allowed to}} vote for players on their own team. The All-Rookie Team is generally composed of two five-man lineups, a first team and a second team. The players each receive two points for each first team vote and one point for each second team vote. The top five players with the highest point total make the first team, with the next five making the second team. In the case of a tie at the fifth position of either team, the roster is expanded. If the first team consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players with the potential for more expansion in the event of additional ties. Ties have occurred several times, most recently in 2012, when Kawhi Leonard, Iman Shumpert, and Brandon Knight tied in votes received. No <b>respect</b> <b>is</b> given to positions. For example, the first team had four forwards, and one guard in 2008, while the first team had four centers (two of which were forward-centers) and one guard in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Adana is terrorized by 4,000 soldiers, who are looting, shooting, and burning. No <b>respect</b> <b>is</b> paid {{to foreign}} properties.

25|$|Throughout the Code, <b>respect</b> <b>is</b> paid to evidence. Suspicion was not enough. The {{criminal}} must {{be taken}} in the act, e.g. the adulterer, etc. A man could not be convicted of theft unless the goods were found in his possession.|$|E

25|$|<b>Respect</b> <b>is</b> not {{something}} {{based solely on}} personal or professional qualifications, {{but also on the}} position that God has given that person. In 1 Samuel 26 David spares Saul’s life, even at the risk of losing his own, submitting to the authority God had placed over him as anointed king.|$|E
25|$|One {{definition}} is that peace {{is a state}} of balance and understanding in yourself and between others, where <b>respect</b> <b>is</b> gained by the acceptance of differences, tolerance persists, conflicts are resolved through dialog, people's rights are respected and their voices are heard, and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension.|$|E

25|$|Akha society lacks {{a strict}} system of social class and is {{considered}} egalitarian. <b>Respect</b> <b>is</b> typically accorded with age and experience. Ties of patrilineal kinship and marriage alliance bind the Akha within and between communities. Village structures may vary widely from the strictly traditional to Westernized, depending on their proximity to modern towns. Like many of the hill tribes, the Akha build their villages at higher elevations in the mountains.|$|E
25|$|Respect: Willingness to show {{consideration}} or appreciation. Respect can be {{a specific}} feeling of regard for the actual qualities of a person or feeling being and also specific actions and conduct representative of that esteem. Relationships and contacts that are built without the presence of respect are seldom long term or sustainable. The lack of <b>respect</b> <b>is</b> {{at the very heart}} of most conflict in families, communities, and nations.|$|E

Factors such as transcription may or may not be needed if the virus is able to integrate its genomic information in the cell's nucleus, or if the virus can replicate itself directly within the cell's cytoplasm.|$|E

40|$|Unconditional <b>respect</b> {{for persons}} <b>is</b> an {{orientation}} that {{rests on the}} assumption that all people have intrinsic worth and deserve respect simply by their being human. This paper reports three cross-sectional studies concerning unconditional respect in intergroup relations in three very different contexts. In all three studies, unconditional <b>respect</b> <b>was</b> positively related to positive action tendencies, and negatively related to negative action tendencies, toward other groups. Regression analyses showed that <b>respect</b> <b>was</b> a significant predictor of negative action tendencies even when attitude to the other group, social dominance orientation, empathy, and {{the quality and quantity of}} intergroup contact were statistically controlled. Moderation analyses showed that <b>respect</b> <b>was</b> particularly important under conditions of high threat. The implications of unconditional respect for intergroup relations are discussed.

25|$|Nonetheless, {{the image}} he builds of Tiberius {{throughout}} {{the first six}} books of the Annals is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly positive in the first books, and predominantly negative after the intrigues of Sejanus. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book {{is dominated by the}} hypocrisy of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, some <b>respect</b> <b>is</b> evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.|$|E
25|$|The {{exemptions}} lead {{to internal}} {{problems in the}} case of acquisition of Japanese or South Korean citizenship since neither Japan nor South Korea allows its nationals to hold foreign citizenships in their adult years. (See Japanese and South Korean nationality laws.) Of course, they are strictly Japanese/South Korean internal affairs and have to be solved by Japanese/South Korean citizens themselves, according to the laws of their own country. They are not problems of the Dutch state, and all that the Dutch laws say in this <b>respect</b> <b>is</b> that such Dutch subjects with dual nationality are allowed to renounce to their Dutch nationality.|$|E
25|$|As {{usual in}} medieval art, {{the figures are}} not individualized, but repeat a few stylised types. They have the disproportionately large, oval faces which are {{characteristic}} of Pre-Romanesque sculpture. Their very large, almond-shaped eyes sit in flat sockets with sharply delineated eyebrows. The hair is composed of parallel strands from a central parting. Nevertheless, the facial expressions of some figures are very individuated and match the figures' gestures. Especially relevant in this <b>respect</b> <b>is</b> the figure of Cain who looks up to the Hand of God in heaven with fearful, terror-stricken eyes and pulls his cloak tight around his body.|$|E

Equally, those who hold that the intuitions behind functionalism need not <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> <b>are</b> free to say that they see no reason why the Martian's 'pain' should be accepted as real pain.|$|R
40|$|<b>Respect</b> has <b>been</b> {{considered}} {{as an important}} psychological construct in educational contexts, {{yet there is no}} common definition of “respect. ” Li & Fischer (2007) suggested that respect as a positive self-conscious emotion, rather than as an attitude, could lead one to emulate the superior target as a role model, and eventually to become such a person, a function they referred to as the “self-Pygmalion process. ” However, this process has never been demonstrated empirically. Here, both the attitudinal and emotional sides of <b>respect</b> <b>are</b> considered briefly, and the potential educational functions of <b>respect</b> <b>are</b> discussed. I argue that the self-Pygmalion process is likely to occur in schools, especially in Japan, and I hypothesize that feeling emotional respect, rather than showing attitudinal respect, for a superior may have the educational function of maximizing the quality of learning. Future directions for studying (emotional) <b>respect</b> <b>are</b> also discussed...|$|R

25|$|Kenta {{made his}} return to Ring of Honor on May 11 {{of the next year}} against Delirious in a winning effort. Ring of Honor made its pay per view debut with the show, <b>Respect</b> <b>is</b> Earned, teaming with Nigel McGuinness against Danielson and Takeshi Morishima in a losing effort, after which Kenta spent several months with the company {{competing}} against rival, Davey Richards and his contingency, the No Remorse Corps. Kenta made his next appearance on the Glory By Honor VI tour; the first night had him team with the GHC Heavyweight Champion Mitsuharu Misawa against Takeshi Morishima and Naomichi Marufuji, with the match ending in a thirty-minute time limit draw. The following night, Kenta wrestled Misawa for the GHC Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort.|$|E
25|$|Of note is the Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB), with {{locations}} at Camp Del Mar and Camp Johnson, where sailors {{bound for}} service with USMC operating forces earn the NEC HM-8404, Field Medical Service Technician. FMTB provides specialized training in advanced emergency {{medicine and the}} fundamentals of Marine Corps life, while emphasizing physical conditioning, small arms familiarity, and basic battlefield tactics. , this rigorous training is 8 weeks. Training for the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) familiarizes navy corpsmen with the Marines. A bond and mutual <b>respect</b> <b>is</b> often formed between Marines and their assigned hospital corpsmen, earning respect apart from their Navy shipmates. FMF hospital corpsmen are issued the Marine Corps service uniforms and camouflage uniforms (MARPAT) while assigned to the Marine Corps and also {{have the option to}} go Marine Corps Regulations. They are then issued a new seabag containing the Marine uniforms (except dress blues) with uniform matching Navy rate chevrons instead of the Marine rank chevrons, and collar rank insignias, and wear those instead of traditional Navy uniforms. The Navy's new digitized camouflage working uniform are worn by sailors stationed at other naval facilities.|$|E
25|$|On February 17, 2007, Steen {{returned}} to Ring of Honor, teaming with El Generico in a losing effort to the Briscoe Brothers. On April 14, Mark Briscoe returned {{in the middle}} of a match between Steen and Generico and his brother Jay and Erick Stevens. Mark was attacked by the duo, however, and was pinned by Steen after a package piledriver. On May 11, Steen (as a heel) and Generico (as a face) defeated Jason Blade and Eddie Edwards. At <b>Respect</b> <b>is</b> Earned, Steen and El Generico defeated The Irish Airborne (Jake and Dave Crist), Pelle Primeau and Mitch Franklin, and Jimmy Rave and Adam Pearce in a Tag Team Scramble dark match. That same night, Steen and El Generico brawled with the Briscoe Brothers, ending with Mark Briscoe suffering a mild concussion from a steel chair shot. At Driven, the Briscoe Brothers defeated Steen and El Generico to retain the ROH World Tag Team Championship. Steen and Generico then suffered three consecutive losses to the Briscoes at Caged Rage in a Steel Cage match, Manhattan Mayhem II in a two out of three falls match, and Man Up in a ladder match. Their only tag team win over the Briscoes was at Death Before Dishonor V Night 1 in a non-title Boston Street Fight.|$|E
