40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} high {{temperature}} exposure simulating service conditions on stress rupture properties were studied {{for the second}} generation single crystal superalloy DD 6. The specimens with [001] orientation were exposed in air at temperatures of 980 °C and 1070 °C for 100 h to 1000 h. They were then tested using conventional mechanical tests at 1070 °C/ 140 MPa {{to determine the effects}} of exposure on stress rupture properties. The analysis indicated that stress <b>rupture</b> <b>life</b> decreased with increasing exposure time.

When the test temperature increased to 1070 °C, the stress <b>rupture</b> <b>life</b> exceeds 100 h after 800 h exposure. The morphology of γ prime phase after exposure was observed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
