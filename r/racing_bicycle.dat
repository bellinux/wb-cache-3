25|$|Honda {{has also}} built a {{downhill}} <b>racing</b> <b>bicycle</b> {{known as the}} Honda RN-01. It is not available for sale to the public. The bike has a gearbox, which replaces the standard derailleur found on most bikes.|$|E

25|$|The {{down tube}} connects the head tube {{to the bottom}} bracket shell. On <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles</b> and some {{mountain}} and hybrid bikes, the derailleur cables run along the down tube, or inside the down tube. On older <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles,</b> the shift levers were mounted on the down tube. On newer ones, they are mounted with the brake levers on the handlebars.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA three {{dimensional}} multibody dynamic {{numerical model}} using LifeMOD and ADAMS {{is presented to}} simulate and analyze the load of wrists, shoulders, leg muscles, knees, and ankles of bicycle riding. Applications of ADAMS/LifeMOD are widely used, for example, rifle shot stress to the human body, golf swing, Tae Kwon Do side kick simulation, rowers paddle boat. Applications are even in the medical research including dynamic stability of human spine simulation, and thoracic and lumbar dynamic simulation. Vertical (height) and horizontal position of bicycle saddle are adjusted in the three dimensional multibody model to simulate muscles force for city <b>bicycle</b> riding and <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> riding. Besides, loads of shoulders, wrists, knees, and ankles are analyzed between postures of city <b>bicycle</b> riding and <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> riding. The objective {{of this research is}} to obtain a suitable posture either for city <b>bicycle</b> riding or <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> riding to prevent sports injuries. ADAMS/LifeMOD simulation of riding city <b>bicycle</b> and <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> with different riding postures is presented in this paper. Several main findings include: (1) If the bicycle saddle is too high, soleus force would be increased. (2) If the bicycle saddle is too low, biceps femoris and iliacus forces would be increased. (3) The influence on muscles force caused by a little adjustment of distance between saddle and handlebars may be ignored. (4) Posture of riding <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> bends upper body more and increases iliacus forces but decreases soleus force. (5) Because <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> riding posture bends upper body, the joints loads on lumbar, shoulders and elbows are greatly increased...|$|R

25|$|The Union Cycliste Internationale finally {{modified}} the regulations, mandating {{use of a}} traditional <b>racing</b> <b>bicycle,</b> {{similar to the one}} used by Eddy Merckx to establish the Hour Record in the 1970s. Boardman made his attempt at the Hour Record using this new ruling and succeeded in 2000 riding 49.441km, just 10 m further than Merckx's 28-year-old record.|$|E

2500|$|In Britain, {{the utility}} {{roadster}} declined noticeably in popularity {{during the early}} 1970s, as a boom in recreational cycling caused manufacturers to concentrate on lightweight (...) , affordable derailleur sport bikes, actually slightly-modified versions of the <b>racing</b> <b>bicycle</b> of the era.|$|E

2500|$|Frame {{size was}} {{traditionally}} measured along the seat tube {{from the center}} of the bottom bracket to the center of the top tube. Typical [...] "medium" [...] sizes are 54 or 56cm (approximately 21.2 or 22inches) for a European men's <b>racing</b> <b>bicycle</b> or 46cm (about 18.5inches) for a men's mountain bike. The wider range of frame geometries that now exist has also led to other methods of measuring frame size. Touring frames tend to be longer, while racing frames are more compact.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{started his}} cycling {{career as a}} time trial specialist, he turned {{professional}} with the GAN team, later renamed the Crédit Agricole team, of manager Roger Legeay. His first race as a professional was the 1993 Grand Prix Eddy Merckx, a 66km time trial which he won. [...] He further won several stages of the Midi Libre and Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré stage races, including the final road stage. In 1993 Boardman established the fastest time for a bicycle around the 37.73 mile Snaefell Mountain Course, the course used for the Isle of Man TT Races. Riding a specially modified bicycle, Boardman recorded a time of 1hr 23min 54secs. The time recorded {{would prove to be}} the longest standing cycling record on the Isle of Man, until it was beaten by Peter Kennaugh in 2015. Kennaugh, riding a standard <b>racing</b> <b>bicycle,</b> beat the record by six seconds.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{left the}} Hay and Willits shop in 1892 or early 1893 {{to take a}} job as head trainer for Harry T. Hearsey's bicycle shop in Indianapolis, {{teaching}} local residents how to ride. About two years later, while working at Hearsey's shop, Taylor met Louis D. [...] "Birdie" [...] Munger, a former high-wheel bicycle racer who owned the Munger Cycle Manufacturing Company, a <b>racing</b> <b>bicycle</b> factory in Indianapolis. (Munger later established the Worcester Cycle Manufacturing Company factory in Worcester, Massachusetts.) With a shared interest in bicycle racing, the two became friends and Munger hired the teenaged Taylor to work odd jobs that included sending Taylor to area high schools and colleges to train cyclists and promote Munger's line of racing bicycles. Munger had also [...] "made up his mind to make Taylor a champion" [...] and coached him to become a racer. While working for Munger, Taylor joined the See-Saw Cycling Club, an all-black cycling club in Indianapolis.|$|E
2500|$|He also {{invented the}} {{inverted}} BMX <b>racing</b> <b>bicycle</b> stem (also {{known as a}} [...] "gooseneck"). Unlike the standard [...] "quill gooseneck" [...] stem, BMX bicycles {{in need of a}} stem with a much tighter clamping force on the bars to eliminate movement forward or back. That could be caused by the more violent physical abuse racers put upon it like pulling with maximum force during racing and jumping their bicycles, these stems were four-point block clamps secured with Allen bolts, unlike the single point quill gooseneck that had a single [...] "pinchbolt" [...] configuration to clamp the bars. Most other stems of this type, like the standard gooseneck, raised the bottom level of the handlebars up, the inverted stem dropped them down. Breithaupt was heading to an NBA National in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1979 to race cruiser class a new division in BMX that at the time was made up of BMX bicycles (during this time most were converted Beach Cruisers with 26" [...] diameter wheels, built for the larger rider as opposed the standard 20" [...] vehicle). As he was fitting his handle bars onto the stem of the bicycle he noticed that it was to high for his liking and presumably it couldn't be lowered far enough down to get the feel and leverage he desired. he then removed the clamp the part that actually held fast to the handlebars, from the stem, that was inserted into the head tube and into the fork's neck. He flipped it over and reattached it. He was able then to drop the bottom of the bars another few millimeters to his liking. He later won his Cruiser class at this national using that configuration. He would then persuade [...] "Tuff Neck", a leading manufacturer of BMX bicycle parts at the time, to mass-produce the new component.|$|E
