50|$|Microsoft {{executives}} {{have stated that}} the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> patches is often what causes the spread of exploits against those very same flaws, as crackers figure out what problems the patches fix and then launch attacks against unpatched systems. For example, in August 2003 the Blaster worm exploited a vulnerability present in every unpatched installation of Windows XP, and was capable of compromising a system even without user action. In May 2004 the Sasser worm spread by using a buffer overflow in a remote service present on every installation. Patches to prevent both of these well-known worms had already been released by Microsoft. Increasingly widespread use of Service Pack 2 and greater use of personal firewalls may also contribute to making worms like these less common.|$|R

50|$|In January 2010, Google {{security}} researcher Tavis Ormandy {{revealed a}} serious security flaw in Windows NT's VDM implementation that allowed unprivileged users to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level, noted as {{applicable to the}} <b>security</b> <b>of</b> all x86 versions of the Windows NT kernel since 1993. This included all 32-bit versions of Windows NT, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Windows 7. Ormandy did publish a proof-of-concept exploit for the vulnerability. Prior to Microsoft's <b>release</b> <b>of</b> a <b>security</b> patch, the workaround for this issue was to turn off 16-bit application support, which prevented older programs (those written for DOS and Windows 3.1) from running. 64-bit versions of Windows were not affected since they {{do not include the}} NTVDM subsystem. Once the Microsoft security patches had been applied to the affected operating systems the VDM could be safely reenabled.|$|R

50|$|Throughout 1929 Germany and the Entente {{worked on}} {{achieving}} a final settlement {{on the issue}} of German war debts. The proposed final settlement, known as the Young Plan, was considered relatively favourable to Germany. The Young Plan allowed for the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> all <b>securities</b> by the Allies and the removal of creditors' financial and economic control. In addition to this loosening of the economic burden of Versailles, France also agreed to evacuate the Rhineland in 1930, five years ahead of schedule. Although the Young Plan was certainly more advantageous to Germany than the original Treaty of Versailles, many German nationalists opposed it. They believed that accepting the Young Plan meant accepting Versailles. It meant confessing to the 'war guilt clause', which had not been modified under the Young Plan. More practically they also believed that favourable settlements such as this undermined the will of the German people to defeat Versailles.|$|R
