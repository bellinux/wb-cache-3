40|$|For {{the design}} of {{hydraulic}} structures for flood conveyance and discharge, or protection of territory against flood is fundamental {{the knowledge of the}} "extreme rainfall regime" in the area where the hydraulic structures must be set up. Indeed the design flood is commonly evaluated as output of rainfall-runoff models that receive as input the quantitative description of a rainfall extreme event with a given exceedance probability. This dissertation assesses the performance of different statistical approaches in characterizing extreme rainfall in the island of Sardinia (Italy). After a detailed review of the theoretical bases of existing methodologies, we compare the results obtained from the use of: a) a Generalized Extreme value (GEV) distribution model, and a Two component Extreme Value (TCEV) distribution model, both applied to yearly maxima of daily rainfall, and b) a Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution model applied to <b>rainfall</b> <b>excesses</b> above a properly specified threshold. For the latter purpose, we use the Multiple Threshold Method (MTM) developed by Deidda(2010), which demonstrate good performance also in the case of quantized records. In order to describe the spatial variation of TCEV, GEV and GP model parameters a regional approach based on homogeneous regions, and two versions of Kriging (a commonly used geostatistical approach) i. e. ordinary Kriging (OK), and Kriging for uncertain Data (KUD), are compared. The obtained results are very promising, pointing towards the use of: a) a GEV distribution model for yearly rainfall maxima, and a KUD model to describe the spatial variation of model parameters, and b) a GP model for <b>rainfall</b> <b>excesses</b> and either an OK or a KUD model for the spatial variation of model parameters.

40|$|Abstract. A {{nonlinear}} {{optimization model}} is developed to transmute a unit hydrograph into a {{probability distribution function}} (PDF). The objective function is to minimize {{the sum of the}} square of the deviation between predicted and actual direct runoff hydrograph of a watershed. The predicted runoff hydrograph is esti-mated by using a PDF. In a unit hydrograph, the depth of <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess</b> must be unity and the ordinates must be positive. Incorporation of a PDF ensures that the depth of <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess</b> for the unit hydrograph is unity, and the ordinates are also positive. Unit hydrograph ordinates are in terms of intensity of <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess</b> on a discharge per unit catchment area basis, the unit area thus representing the unit <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess.</b> The proposed method does not have any constraint. The nonlinear optimization formulation is solved using binary-coded genetic algorithms. The number of variables to be estimated by optimization {{is the same as the}} number of probability distribution parameters; gamma and log-normal probability distribu-tions are used. The existing nonlinear programming model for obtaining optimal unit hydrograph has also been solved using genetic algorithms, where the con-strained nonlinear optimization problem is converted to an unconstrained problem using penalty parameter approach.

Optimal precipitation for early potato was calculated according to the Klatt indexes for medium cohesive and light soils in the successive months of the vegetation period. <b>Rainfall</b> deficit and <b>excess</b> <b>rainfall</b> were determined based on differences between monthly precipitation totals recorded in {{the years of the}} study and values considered to be optimal. It was found that the frequency of rainfall deficit during vegetation of early potato in each analysed location both for medium cohesive soil and for light soil exceeded the frequency of its excess. The greatest mean monthly rainfall deficit from the multiannual period in the vegetation season of early potato in all the analysed locations and for both soil types was recorded in June, while <b>excess</b> <b>rainfall</b> was observed in July.

40|$|Design flood {{estimation}} techniques {{currently used}} in Australia only partially {{account for the}} joint probability interactions between flood producing variables. The joint probability problem associated with initial loss estimation is particularly important. Failure {{to deal with it}} can introduce considerable bias into estimated flood frequency distributions for ungauged catchments. One solution to this problem is to use continuous simulation whereby a rainfall generation model is linked to a catchment water balance and flood routing model. This technique has been used to explore less complicated ways of overcoming the joint probability problem by allowing design rainfall obtained from Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) to be directly converted into <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess.</b> This eliminates the need for assumptions regarding initial loss. A continuous simulation approach has been utilised here by means of a stochastic point rainfall model, coupled with a stochastic evaporation model and modified AWBM model. This enables the determination of the scaling required for the conversion of rainfall into <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess.</b> The technique is validated using a kinematic wave catchment runoff model and comparison with observed flood frequency curves. Through this method, the simplicity of the design flood estimation approach is retained by the use of <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess</b> frequency duration (REFD) curves instead of rainfall IFD curves. The REFD method has been calibrated and tested on a number of catchments in Australia. Presented here are the results from the Boggy Creek catchment in Victoria. The scaling of the ARR design rainfall required has been very similar across all average recurrence intervals and event durations. This should allow the approach to be extended to other catchments.

40|$|International audienceThe {{construction}} of design flood hydrographs for ungauged drainage areas {{has traditionally been}} approached by regionalisation, i. e. the transfer of information from the gauged to the ungauged catchments in a region. Such approaches invariably depend upon {{the use of multiple}} linear regression analysis to relate unit hydrograph parameters to catchment characteristics and generalised rainfall statistics. The concept of the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH), in relating the shape and scale of the catchment transfer function to stream network topology and channel characteristics, offers an alternative methodology. GIUH derivation depends upon a series of assumptions, including that of estimating a "characteristic velocity"; these continue to attract attention and debate. However, if this velocity is expressed in terms of the kinematic wave approximation, the peak and time-to-peak of the IUH may be expressed in terms of a group of catchment and channel characteristics and the intensity of <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess,</b> giving the so-called geomorphoclimatic IUH (GCIUH). Previous studies involving the GCIUH have developed a single IUH relating to the total duration of <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess.</b> In this study, the <b>rainfall</b> <b>excess</b> duration was divided into several (equal) time increments, with separate IUHs being generated for each interval. This quasi-linear approach was applied to 105 storm events from nine catchments in the south-west of England, ranging in size from 6 to 420 (km) 2. The results showed that, providing the time interval chosen is fine enough to capture the shape of the runoff hydrographs, a comparable level of goodness-of-fit can be obtained for catchments covering a range of about 1 : 75 in area. The modified GCIUH approach as described is therefore recommended for further investigation and intercomparison with regression-based regionalisation methods.
