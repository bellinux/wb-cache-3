50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, the {{construction}} of a new <b>road</b> <b>on</b> an <b>embankment</b> <b>on</b> the marshes of Loch allowed direct access to the town from Vannes. In 1950, the Vannes-Lorient route nationale bypassed the centre of Auray to the north. In 1989, the four-carriageway Kerplouz viaduct was built on the RN165 over the Auray river downstream from St. Goustan. This rid the town of transit traffic, and created an industrial area south of the city centre.|$|R
5000|$|Brentford {{railway station}} opened in 1860 on the Brentford Branch Line (the only {{line of the}} Great Western and Brentford Railway Company) which had opened in 1859 from [...] to Brentford Dock. It stood {{immediately}} north of Brentford High Street (the A315 <b>road)</b> <b>on</b> the <b>embankment</b> leading to the viaduct into the dock. The station closed on 22 March 1915 as a wartime economy measure, re-opened on 12 April 1920 and closed permanently in 1942.The station was demolished in 1957.|$|R
50|$|The Wormke rises {{north of}} Schierke above the Jakobsbruch at about 848 m {{above sea level}} in the Harz National Park and flows {{initially}} eastwards. After turning towards the southeast, it crosses the Glashüttenweg footpath on the Harzer Hexenstieg trail, where a weir diverts almost all its water into the Wormsgraben ditch. Next the Wormke is crossed by the tracks of the Brocken Railway, the Hagenstraße (L 100) <b>road,</b> <b>on</b> an <b>embankment,</b> and the tracks of the Harz Railway. Near Mandelholz the river finally discharges into the Kalte Bode.|$|R
50|$|The highway diverges from Tai Po Road near Sha Tin Racecourse. The {{following}} 7.3 km of the <b>road</b> runs <b>on</b> an <b>embankment</b> <b>on</b> {{the west}} coast of Tolo Harbour towards Yuen Chau Tsai (Island House). This section is built alongside the East Rail Line. Construction began in March 1999 to expand the section to a dual four-lane carriageway and was finished in August 2003. This section has a speed limit of 100 km/h.|$|R
50|$|In 1921, Tiefenbach {{was linked}} to the railway network, {{complete}} with a station. This line, running between Simmern and Gemünden, was abandoned in 1963; by 1965, all the tracks had been torn up. Until 2006, there was still a viaduct on the former line, but this had by then fallen into such disrepair that it was decided to demolish it with explosives. The old railway embankment northeast of Tiefenbach has, however, been preserved. The last <b>road</b> underpass <b>on</b> this <b>embankment</b> was demolished in 2009.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} ongoing activities to increase control of the subsoil related performance of the Dutch highway network. Differential settlement of <b>road</b> <b>embankments</b> <b>on</b> soft soil is causing an estimated 35 million Euros {{to be spent on}} maintenance annually. A back analysis of experiences allows the identification of critical elements in the process of construction and maintenance. Rijkswaterstaat, the Dutch road administrator, research institutes and construction industry are cooperating to improve these critical elements...|$|R
40|$|Lifelines and Transportation Networks, which convey food, water, fuel, energy, information, {{and other}} {{materials}} necessary for human existence and functioning, {{are among the most}} crucial development indicators for any nation. Roadways, being element of such systems, are often fundamental infrastructures to reach places struck by strong earthquakes. During earthquakes, {{there are a number of}} ways in which these systems can be affected. Besides the ground shaking hazard that causes major damage typologies, there are other earthquake related hazards that can affect the vulnerability of the system such as landslides. Vulnerability assessment is essential to the understanding of potential impacts of seismic hazards on lifelines, infrastructures and other key components of the system. The scope of the thesis is to study the vulnerability of transportation network elements with varying geometrical characteristics and configurations during earthquakes. In the present study <b>road</b> <b>on</b> <b>embankments,</b> cut slopes (Trenches) and retaining walls subject to different earthquake sizes each placed under three typical soil profiles corresponding to ground types C, D and E in the Eurocode 8 are considered. Unlike the many common practices which are based on either the Pseudo-static analyses approach or the Newmark’s sliding block procedures, in the current study vulnerability in terms of fragility functions are evaluated using 2 D dynamic analyses implemented in FEM-PLAXIS program. The effects from ground conditions and geometric features of the system components are evaluated and finally a relationship between the input ground motion (as PGA) and the resulting damages (as PGD) from the dynamic analyses results are formulated. Fragility curves, which the express the probability of reaching or exceeding different levels of damages for a given level of ground motion, are developed as a function of PGA unlike the standard fragility curves which are based on PGD values. The initiation is that the PGA is more commonly known parameters for earthquake than the PGD. </p...|$|R
50|$|The railway was <b>on</b> an <b>embankment</b> {{here and}} crossed over Lower Addiscombe Road and Bingham <b>Road</b> <b>on</b> bridges. The <b>embankment</b> {{has been removed}} and Tramlink crosses both these roads at grade. The station was just south of Bingham Road. Addiscombe tram stop is between Lower Addiscombe Road and Bingham Road. (Addiscombe railway station was about 500 m to the west - East India Way has been built on its site.) About 200 m east of Sandilands tram stop the Tramlink route from central Croydon divides and both {{branches}} follow {{the route of the}} W&SC. The northern line takes a sharp turn under Addiscombe Road to join the route of the railway to Woodside, Elmers End and Beckenham Junction. The other line turns southward into the Park Hill tunnels towards Coombe Road and to New Addington.|$|R
25|$|The Najafgarh drain {{has been}} much widened {{over the years to}} drain all the water which in earlier decades used to collect in the Nagafgarh lake or Jheel basin. This was {{supposedly}} done to remove the threat of flooding in Delhi, and now the drain itself acts as an elongated water body or lake. It has trees planted <b>on</b> both its <b>embankments</b> and an inspection <b>road</b> running <b>on</b> one <b>embankment.</b> During the winter months it attracts vast quantities of migratory birds, and supports local wildlife year-round. Due to the rich wildlife observed in and around the less polluted stretch of the drain outside of congested populated areas, it has been proposed as a bird sanctuary for Delhi.|$|R
40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>embankments</b> <b>on</b> {{organic soil}} {{deposits}} cause stability issues during the construction stage and consolidation settlement problems during the post construction stage. As the conservative approach, which designs road embankments using unfavourable or prismatic ground conditions, becomes uneconomical or not feasible {{for construction of}} <b>road</b> <b>embankments</b> <b>on</b> organic soil deposits observational approach is very often used for such design and construction. In the observational approach, the most probable or more optimistic ground conditions are considered in the initial design. The risks associated with using most probable soil properties are managed by reviewing the initial design through {{the analysis of the}} observational data obtained during the construction stage. In this regards, analysis tools to assess the stability of the embankment during construction stage and the estimation of the degree of consolidation during ground improvement phase are extremely important. Even though there is large number of analytical methods available to use for the data analysis, not much research is done to identify the tools relevant to the organic soft soils found in Sri Lanka. This research is aimed at investigation of the analytical tools {{that can be used to}} analysis of settlement monitoring data obtained during the implementation of the observational approach for construction of the road embankments over the soft soil deposits in Sri Lanka...|$|R

The <b>road</b> runs <b>on</b> an <b>embankment,</b> the construction of which was traditionally attributed to Heracles in Strabo's time. This strip was reinforced with a sea wall, [...] "where the sea angrily dashes, but is thrust back with echoing roar" [...] and severed by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, {{in order to make}} a harbour of Lake Lucrinus, which he joined to Avernus by a canal, as mentioned in Virgil, Georgics ...|$|R
50|$|Eashing is now {{administered}} by Guildford Borough Council and {{is divided into}} Upper Eashing {{on top of the}} steep south-east bank and Lower Eashing set low, immediately below the A3 <b>road</b> <b>embankment</b> <b>on</b> the north-west bank. Lower Eashing has an ancient bridge over the River Wey which was constructed in the 14th century by monks from Waverley Abbey. Twenty buildings strewn across both parts are now architecturally listed buildings. Eashing also has two large-unit business parks, The Granary and The Wharf, which are on a large island accessed by a bridge behind the Stag public house and the Mill.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{incremental}} problem for consolidation analysis of elastoplastic saturated porous media is formulated and solved using second-order cone programming. This {{is achieved by}} {{the application of the}} Hellinger-Reissner variational theorem, which casts the governing equations of Biot’s consolidation theory as a min–max optimisation problem. The min–max problem is then discretised using the finite element method and converted into a standard second-order cone programming problem that can be solved efficiently using modern optimisation algorithms (such as the primal-dual interior-point method). The proposed computational formulation is verified against a number of benchmark examples and also applied to simulate the construction of a <b>road</b> <b>embankment</b> <b>on</b> soft clay...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGeotextiles {{have been}} {{increasingly}} applied as reinforcement in <b>road</b> <b>embankments</b> <b>on</b> soft soil. The {{purpose of this}} study is to determine the optimum tensile strength of geotextile as the reinforcement in road embankment considering the allowable factor of safety and displacement. The stability analysis of the road embankment has been done by finite element method using PLAXIS 2 D. In this study, three types of sequence modeling were conducted. First, the stability of road embankment without any reinforcement was analyzed. Second modeling was to determine the length of geotextile reinforcement considering the stability of the model road embankment. The last sequence was to investigate the stability of the model reinforced embankment with various tensile strength of geotextiles reinforcement. The result of this study showed that the optimum tensile strength of geotextiles was strongly influenced by the factor of safety...|$|R

50|$|Access to Kalabo by {{road was}} {{difficult}} but now {{after the completion}} of the mongu-kalabo road, it is now easier. Before the construction of the road, it was usually cut off by road in the rainy season. The dirt tracks across the floodplain from Mongu become flooded, and frequently in poor condition at other times. The tracks go to two ferries across the main channel of the Zambezi, a northern one near Libonda accessed from Mongu via Limulunga, and a southern one at Sandaula accessed via Lealui. In recent years dirt <b>roads</b> <b>on</b> raised earth <b>embankments</b> have been constructed from Mongu to Lealui and from Kalabo to Sandaula. This is part of an ambitious long-term regional plan to provide the first ever major link between the road networks of Zambia and Angola via a paved causeway across the floodplain and a bridge over the Zambezi, replacing the ferry. A paved highway would then be built from Kalabo north-west to the Angolan border and beyond. Although originally intended for completion in 2006, construction has proved more difficult than anticipated and large sections were washed away in floods in 2003/4, resulting in funding shortfalls.|$|R

In this chapter, we referred and mentioned results of reconnaissance investigations that {{are focused on}} the extent to avalanche and landslide meanwhile, rescue operation and countermeasure for aged people. At first, we scrutinized characteristics of earthquake in winter season based on field survey and interview. Secondly, we compared various earthquake events in Niigata Prefecture. Finally, we ponder over the correlation between the extent of damege, condition of meteorological elements and situation of the elder who are exposed by strong ground motion in order to establish earhtquake disaster mitigations and to alleviate social damege. According to results of survey, ground shaking may cause avalanche, ski lift falling down. It is not easy to discover cracking <b>on</b> <b>roads</b> or <b>embankment</b> under concealed below snow, and to disclose trouble with warmer equipments in this occasion.

50|$|The castle ruins in the {{southwest}} of the park area, are {{the remains of the}} old and once important Kalø Castle. It is situated strategically on the small island of Kalø and the route to the castle ruins includes a 500 m stretch of medieval <b>road</b> <b>on</b> a cobblestone <b>embankment.</b> The marina of Nappedam is located in the cove east of the <b>embankment</b> and <b>on</b> the shores of the mainland lie the Kalø woodlands of Hestehave Skov og Ringelmose Skov. Hestehave Skov presents opportunities for bird-watching and the Stone Age (Funnelbeaker culture) long barrow of Store Stenhøj. The coastal cliffs at Hestehave Skov supplied the clay for bricks, when Kalø Castle was built in the early 14th century and the forest here was probably planted later on in the 1500-1600's. Further inland, the former manor of Kalø Gods from the early 18th century and the hunting lodge of Jagslottet designed by architect Hack Kampmann in 1898 can be found. Jagtslottet was originally owned by the German Jenisch-family who used it for summer retreats. The Jenisch was well-liked in the region apparently, but after WW II German property in Denmark was confiscated in order to pay an estimated compensation claim of DK 11.6 billion. Now the secretariat of the national park takes residence at Jagtslottet, while Kalø Gods is owned by the state and holds several schools and an environmental administration.|$|R

40|$|While {{different}} kinds of compost have been tested for highway revegetation, sewage sludge has only been used for agricultural purposes. In this work, its application for helping vegetation establishment <b>on</b> <b>roads</b> <b>embankments</b> is studied. Testing areas measuring 4 ?? 5 m were constructed on a new highway embankment in an arid location. Several variables are analyzed: side slope (2); sludge dosage (4); vegetative species (4). Results are presented on growth, survival rate and germination of the plants; colonization of other species; cover crop for the plots; estimation of the erosion. The species planted manually showed satisfactory results although any variable was specially significant in this case. However, {{in relation to the}} species planted using hydroseeding, 2 : 1 side slope presented better results than 3 : 2 side slope. Using hydroseeding, the performance of different species was significantly different, thyme did not grow if sludge was not applied and the cover crop was higher in plots with 3 : 2 side slope than in plots with 2 : 1 side slope, essentially due to the presence of colonizing species. Finally, the costs of the proposed treatments are figured out, being concluded that, so much from the technical as the economic point of view, it is a viable proposal for sewage sludge management...|$|R
