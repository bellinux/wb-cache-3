50|$|The Model 28 {{printing}} units {{contain a}} sequential selector, {{known as the}} Stunt Box, which monitors the received line and the keyboard signals for receipt of single characters and sequences of characters. Forty-two functional control positions are provided, some of which as used for functions such as carriage return, line feed, figures shift, letters shift, unshift-on-space and the signal bell. The removable Electrical Service Unit (LESU) is an integrated chassis housing the line fuse, convenience <b>receptacle,</b> <b>terminal</b> blocks for wiring options and mounting facilities for optional sub-assemblies.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{extension}} cords also incorporate safety {{features such as}} a polarized plug and <b>receptacle,</b> grounded <b>terminals,</b> a [...] "power-on" [...] indicator, a fusible link, or even a residual-current device (also known as a ground-fault circuit interrupter or GFCI).|$|R
50|$|Pelvetia {{grows to}} a maximum length of 15 cm in dense tufts, the fronds being deeply {{channelled}} on one side: the channels and a mucus layer help prevent the seaweed drying (desiccation) when the tide is out. It is irregularly dichotomously branched with <b>terminal</b> <b>receptacles,</b> and is dark brown in colour. Each branch is of uniform width and without a midrib. The receptacles are forked at the tips.|$|R
5000|$|Like other spiders, {{the male}} {{of this species}} uses his pedipalps to insert sperm into the female's seminal <b>receptacles.</b> The <b>terminal</b> joint of the palps become {{detached}} and remains in the female during seventy-five to eighty percent of matings, especially when the female is aggressive. [...] It is surmised that the severed copulatory organs may function as plugs to prevent leakage of sperm and that abandoning them may be a sensible option for the male as otherwise his damaged palps might leak haemolymph. Although their loss effectively makes the male sterile, he usually stays with the female and fends off rival males, and this behaviour protects his reproductive investment. A subsequent study suggests that losing the extra weight of the pedipalps allows males to more effectively fend off rival males, guard their mate and thereby ensure paternity.|$|R
50|$|C. baccata is a tough, {{leathery}} seaweed of a yellowish or brownish colour. It is a perennial, {{each year}} growing new branches up to 50 cm long {{from a dark}} brown, cone-shaped base. The main axis is flattened and has {{a cross section of}} 1 cm x 0.5 cm. The side branches are alternate and cylindrical, being arranged in a pinnate fashion. The smallest branches are fine and wiry. There are small, lemon-shaped aerocysts or air bladders on the smaller branches. Usually these are single but sometimes there are several in a chain. When the lateral branches are shed in the winter, the base of the main axis can be seen to have a zigzag shape caused by the deciduous primary laterals. The <b>receptacles</b> are <b>terminal,</b> up to 5 cm long, cylindrical with knot-like swellings and covered with tiny threads. In the spring when new lateral shoots grow there are few if any aerocysts. By the autumn they are more numerous and noticeable.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to experimentally characterize factors that can cause electrical failures (i. e., overheating connections), to assess the damage and potential forensic signatures of these failures, and to characterize the similarities and differences between arcing and melting in receptacle components and wiring. Laboratory testing evaluated the impact {{of a wide range of}} variables on the formation of overheating connections in residential duplex <b>receptacles</b> including screw <b>terminal</b> torque, wiring method (back-wired, or side-wired), and primary receptacle materials. A total of 408 trials of <b>receptacles</b> with various <b>terminal</b> connections were tested in the laboratory setting; receptacles were powered for up to 16 months. A small portion of receptacles with loose connections overheated to the point of failure of the receptacle; some including flaming events. Failure events occurred between 5 and 365 days after tests were started. Four hundred and sixty eight (468) receptacles were placed in compartment fire tests and furnace fire tests. These tests were designed to evaluate the persistence after fire exposure of overheating/arcing evidence from failure events (i. e., from potential fire cause events). The fire exposure tests also served to analyze the characteristic traits of arcing and melting damage. The results indicated that only very loose connections (less than 0. 339 N-m [3 in-lb]) at moderately high currents (9 A or higher) tend to form significant overheating connections and receptacle failures, irrespective of other variables such as receptacle materials and installation. Characteristic indicators of overheating and glowing terminal connections were identified and were found to persist after fire exposure...|$|R

40|$|Thaxter 2 ̆ 7 s {{original}} {{description of}} Rhizopodomyces is emended to reflect new information gained {{from a study}} of not only the type species, R. merragatae, but also of six additional species described as new, R. basifurcatus, R. californicus, R. erectus, R. geniculatus, R. mexicanus, and R. polhemusii. All of the species have been found on semiaquatic bugs of the family Hebridae (Hemiptera). The female thallus of Rhizopodomyces spp. consists of a simple, two-celled receptacle, the suprabasal cell bearing a one-celled primary appendage and giving rise usually to a single, longstalked perithecium. The male thallus initially consists of three cells, a twocelled <b>receptacle</b> and a <b>terminal</b> cell which may form a simple antheridium directly or remain sterile and form a simple appendage, {{in which case the}} suprabasal cell of the receptacle divides and forms one or two simple antheridia directly. Rhizopodomyces is compared with several other dioecious genera of Laboulbeniales of similar morphology, Amorphomyces, Dioicomyces, Dicrandromyces, Triandromyces, and Tetrandromyces. Speculations regarding the possible relationship of Rhizopodomyces to these genera are presented...|$|R
