30|$|There {{are many}} kinds of Rubik’s Cube solutions. The “layer first law” was {{proposed}} by David Singmaster and {{is used by the}} most people. First, <b>restore</b> <b>the</b> top layer, and then <b>restore</b> <b>the</b> middle layer, and finally <b>restore</b> <b>the</b> bottom layer as well. Mathematician Conway [31] at Cambridge University proposed a six-stage reduction method {{from the bottom of the}} cube to the middle and then to the top, and from the edge pieces to the corner pieces gradually. Patrick [32] proposed a six-sided reduction method: first, <b>restore</b> <b>the</b> corner pieces and edge pieces of the top layer, then <b>restore</b> <b>the</b> bottom corner pieces, and finally the edge pieces of the middle and bottom are <b>restored.</b> Jessica invented <b>the</b> “Fridrich Method” which is used by most of the racing players to quickly <b>restore</b> <b>the</b> Rubik’s Cube. This method is used widely, inspires and influences cube researchers, and has played a critical role in the development of Rubik’s Cube [33].|$|R

40|$|Thoracic duct cells {{obtained}} from normal (unimmunized) donors <b>restored</b> <b>the</b> primary hemolysin response of lethally irradiated or neonatally thymectomized rats to sheep red blood cells.

The addition of peritoneal exudate cells or bone-marrow cells to inocula of thoracic duct cells also failed to <b>restore</b> <b>the</b> response of irradiated hosts to diphtheria toxoid, although normal spleen cells <b>restored</b> <b>the</b> response.
