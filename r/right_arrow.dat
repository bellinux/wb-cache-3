25|$|Once {{one or more}} {{units have}} been {{selected}}, the player can click {{on the ground to}} make them walk to the selected spot, or click on an enemy to make them attack. Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the right direction. This is accomplished by pressing the left or the <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> key or moving the mouse to rotate the direction of the units as they move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially important when using formations, of which there are nine available. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and then click on the ground where they want the units to form. The player can also order all selected units to scatter and to retreat. All formations, as well as commands such as stopping, guarding, scattering, retreating, and reversing direction, are also available via a single click in the Control Bar {{at the bottom of the}} screen.|$|E

Kanye West, {{represented}} by his head, attempts {{to enter the}} circle while repeatedly rapping [...] "Don't let me into my zone", and the player must hit him with the bumper—this causes him to disappear {{in a burst of}} dollar signs, and the player is rewarded with cash, added to a total displayed on the webpage. A silhouette of Kanye's head shows where he will next spawn, and an arrow inside it indicates what direction he will travel in. Play continues this way, with Kanye getting faster and the zone getting bigger, until the player fails to prevent Kanye from entering the zone, when they are presented with a message declaring they have lost; an image of rapper Jay-Z's head joins that of West, and the lyric [...] "I'm definitely in my zone" [...] is heard. If the player's cash score is high enough, it is added to a leaderboard on the right of the page.|$|E

[...] With the notable exception of exit-only signs, which are only expressed in Chinese (but with a <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> indicating an exit-only lane), exit notification and system route reminder signs in the ROC freeway system are almost identical to their US counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are four}} types of exit {{notification}} signs. The first notification sign appears two kilometers before the exit, providing the destination name and an Exit 2km notice. [...] The second sign appears one kilometer before the exit, providing the destination name and a Right Lane notice. The Right Lane notice warns the exiting driver to start switching to the right lane in preparation to exit and does not necessarily indicate that the right lane is an exit-only lane. The third sign appears a few hundred meters before the exit, providing the destination name and a right tilted arrow. The fourth sign {{is located at the}} exit and says Exit with a tilted <b>right</b> <b>arrow.</b>|$|E

Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the right direction. In The Fallen Lords, this is accomplished by [...] "gesture clicking" [...] - using the mouse to indicate which way the units will face when they reach their destination. In Soulblighter and The Wolf Age, it can be accomplished by either gesture clicking, or by pressing the left or <b>right</b> <b>arrow</b> key as the units move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially important when using formations. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and then click on the ground where they want the units to form.

These systems are characterized by high fluxes of thermal energy, highly reducing conditions, abundant and appropriate catalytic surface areas (Fe-Mg clay minerals), significant concentrations of CH sub(4), NH sub(3), H sub(2), metals, etc., and a continuous convective flow which removes products from the site of reaction upward through a mixing gradient of temperature and composition.
