40|$|Evidence is accumulating that <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> is {{impaired}} {{in individuals}} with ADHD. The study aims {{to investigate the}} contribution of brain laterality and effort allocation/state regulation to impaired <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> in adults with ADHD symptoms. Based on the scores on the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales, a group with high and one with low ADHD were formed. The groups performed a lateralized lexical decision task with short and long ISI tapping effort allocation. <b>Error</b> <b>monitoring</b> is measured by post-error adjustments. Results showed that after errors subjects with low ADHD slowed down and improved their response accuracy only for the right visual field stimuli during long ISI.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that speech {{production}} <b>errors</b> are <b>monitored</b> by the same neural system involved in monitoring other types of action errors. Behavioral evidence has shown that speech errors can be detected and corrected prior to articulation, yet the neural basis for such pre-articulatory speech <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> is poorly understood. The current study investigated speech <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> using a phoneme-substitution task known to elicit speech errors. Stimulus-locked event-related potential (ERP) analyses comparing correct and incorrect utterances were used to assess pre-articulatory <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> and response-locked ERP analyses were used to assess post-articulatory monitoring. Our novel finding in the stimulus-locked analysis revealed that words that ultimately led to a speech error were associated with a larger P 2 component at midline sites (FCz, Cz, and CPz). This early positivity may reflect the detection of an error in speech formulation, or a predictive mechanism to signal the potential for an upcoming speech error. The data also revealed that general conflict monitoring mechanisms are involved during this task as both correct and incorrect responses elicited an anterior N 2 component typically associated with conflict monitoring. The response-locked analyses corroborated previous observations that self-produced speech errors led to a fronto-central ERN. These results demonstrate that speech errors can be detected prior to articulation, and that speech <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> relies on a central <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> mechanism...|$|R

The authors used a unified paradigm, the lateralized lexical decision task, to assess hemispheric specialization in word recognition, hemispheric <b>error</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and interhemispheric transfer in male, right-handed participants with schizophrenia (n 34) compared with controls (n 20).

40|$|Abstract—The <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> and {{processing}} system, EMPS {{is the system}} located in the substantia nigra of the midbrain, basal ganglia and cortex of the forebrain, and plays {{a leading role in}} error detection and correction. The main components of EMPS are the dopaminergic system and anterior cingulate cortex. Although, recent studies show that alcohol disrupts the EMPS, the ways in which alcohol affects this system are poorly understood. Based on current literature data, here we suggest a hypothesis of alcohol-related glucose-dependent system of <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{and processing}}, which holds that the disruption of the EMPS is related to the competency of glucose homeostasis regulation, which in turn may determine the dopamine level as a major component of EMPS.

However, exploring the error-related potentials revealed that the error-related negativity (ERN) was the same for both groups, but that adults with ADHD showed a smaller error positivity (Pe). Based on these findings, we conclude that adults with ADHD are normal in early automatic error detection, but are deviant in later conscious evaluation of the error.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of emotion on response inhibition and <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> using event-related potentials. Participants performed an emotional stop-signal task that required response inhibition to briefly presented threatening and neutral visual stimuli. Negative, arousing pictures improved behavioral performance by decreasing the stop-signal reaction time and increasing the inhibitory rate, but had no enhancing effect on inhibitory processing at the electrophysiological level (N 2 -P 3 complex). The perceptual processing of threatening stop-signals resulted in a larger and earlier N 1 component. The Pe component, associated with conscious evaluation or affective processing of an error, was stronger in negative than in neutral trials. The stronger Pe correlated with superior task performance in the emotional condition. Prioritized perceptual processing of the stop-signal was associated with better conscious <b>error</b> <b>monitoring.</b> These results {{support the hypothesis that}} threatening, arousing stimuli improve behavioral inhibitory performance and <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> due to the enhancement of perceptual processing...|$|R
40|$|Aims Detection {{of errors}} {{is crucial for}} {{efficient}} goal-directed behaviour. The ability to monitor behaviour {{is found to be}} diminished in patients with substance dependence, as reflected in decreased error-related brain activity, i. e. error-related negativity (ERN). The ERN is also decreased in other psychiatric disorders with impaired response inhibition, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and borderline personality disorder, but increased in anxiety disorders. The objective of the current study was to assess <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> in alcohol-dependent patients in relation to psychiatric comorbidity. We expected decreased <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> in alcohol-dependent patients with impulse control disorders and increased <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> in anxious alcohol-dependent patients. Design In a case-control design alcohol-dependent patients were compared with healthy controls. Setting and participants A consecutive series of 29 male alcohol-dependent patients, between 18 and 55 years of age, applying for in-patient detoxification were recruited at Novadic Kentron Center for Addiction Treatment. Fifteen age-matched healthy controls were recruited through advertisements in regional newspapers. Measurements Event-related potentials were recorded while performing a speeded choice-reaction task, from which ERN amplitudes were calculated. Axis-I and -II psychiatric comorbidity were assessed using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality disorders. All participants completed the Temperament and Character Inventory and Profile of Mood States. Findings ERN amplitudes were increased for alcohol-dependent patients compared to healthy controls, particularly in patients with comorbid anxiety disorders. Conclusions Increased <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> in alcohol-dependent patients, particularly those with comorbid anxiety disorders, is in contrast with previous studies that suggested decreased <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> to be a general feature in substance use disorders.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{elaborate}} on <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using the ERP methodology. Method: Children with ADHD executed a visual Go/No-Go task with 25 percent No-Go trials; and a two stimulus reaction time task wherein a neutral warning signal (S 1) was presented to inform the child to prepare for an imperative stimulus (S 2). Results: In both tasks, children with ADHD responded as fast as controls but made twice as many errors. In addition, they failed to adjust their speed of responding after making an error. Exploring the error-related potentials revealed that the error-related negativity (ERN) was the same for the two groups, but that children with ADHD showed a diminished error positivity (Pe).

40|$|Research {{involving}} event-related brain potentials {{has revealed}} that anxiety is associated with enhanced <b>error</b> <b>monitoring,</b> as reflected in increased amplitude of the error-related negativity (ERN). The {{nature of the relationship}} between anxiety and <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> is unclear, however. Through meta-analysis and a critical review of the literature, we argue that anxious apprehension/worry is the dimension of anxiety most closely associated with <b>error</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Although, overall, anxiety demonstrated a robust, "small-to-medium" relationship with enhanced ERN (r = - 0. 25), studies employing measures of anxious apprehension show a threefold greater effect size estimate (r = - 0. 35) than those utilizing other measures of anxiety (r = - 0. 09). Our conceptual framework helps explain this more specific relationship between anxiety and enhanced ERN and delineates the unique roles of worry, conflict processing, and modes of cognitive control. Collectively, our analysis suggests that enhanced ERN in anxiety results from the interplay of a decrease in processes supporting active goal maintenance and a compensatory increase in processes dedicated to transient reactivation of task goals on an as-needed basis when salient events (i. e., errors) occur...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEvidence {{exists for}} deficits in <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> in autism. These deficits may be {{particularly}} important because they may contribute to excessive perseveration and repetitive behavior in autism. We examined the neural correlates of <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in 8 – 12 -year-old children with high functioning autism (HFA, n = 11) and typically developing children (TD, n = 15) during performance of a Go/No-Go task by comparing the neural correlates of commission errors versus correct response inhibition trials. Compared to TD children, children with HFA showed increased BOLD fMRI signal in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) and the left superior temporal gyrus (STempG) during commission error (versus correct inhibition) trials. A follow-up region-of-interest analysis also showed increased BOLD signal in the right insula in HFA compared to TD controls. Our findings of increased amPFC and STempG activity in HFA, together with the increased activity in the insula, suggest a greater attention towards the internally driven emotional state associated with making an error in children with HFA. Since <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> occurs across different cognitive tasks throughout daily life, an increased emotional reaction to errors may have important consequences for early learning processes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDeficits in {{self-regulation}} {{of behavior}} {{can play an}} important role in the initiation of substance use and progression to regular use and dependence. One of the distinct component processes of self-regulation is <b>error</b> <b>monitoring,</b> i. e. detection of a conflict between the intended and actually executed action. Here we examined whether a neural marker of <b>error</b> <b>monitoring,</b> Error-Related Negativity (ERN), predicts future initiation of tobacco use. ERN was assessed in a prospective longitudinal sample at ages 12, 14, and 16 using a flanker task. ERN amplitude showed a significant increase with age during adolescence. Reduced ERN amplitude at ages 14 and 16, as well as slower rate of its developmental changes significantly predicted initiation of tobacco use by age 18 but not transition to regular tobacco use or initiation of marijuana and alcohol use. The present results suggest that attenuated development of the neural mechanisms of <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> during adolescence can increase the risk for initiation of tobacco use. The present results also suggest that the role of distinct neurocognitive component processes involved in behavioral regulation may be limited to specific stages of addiction...|$|R
40|$|Detecting one’s own {{errors and}} {{appropriately}} correcting behavior are crucial for efficient goal-directed performance. A correlate of rapid evaluation of behavioral outcomes is the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) which emerges {{at the time}} of the erroneous response over frontal brain areas. However, whether the <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> system’s ability to distinguish between errors and correct responses at this early time point is a necessary precondition for the subsequent emergence of error awareness remains unclear. The present study investigated this question using error-related brain activity and vocal error signaling responses in seven human patients with lesions in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and adjoining ventromedial prefrontal cortex, while they performed a flanker task. The difference between errors and correct responses was severely attenuated in these patients indicating impaired rapid error monitong, but they showed no impairment in error signaling. However, impaired rapid <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> coincided with a failure to increase response accuracy on trials following errors. These results demonstrate that the <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> system’s ability to distinguish between errors and correct responses {{at the time of}} the response is crucial for adaptive post-error adjustments, but not a necessary precondition for error awareness...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for the detection and resolution of response conflicts versus its role in <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> remains under debate. One disputed issue is whether conflict detection and <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{can be viewed as}} unitary functions performed by the same region of the ACC, or whether these processes can be dissociated functionally and anatomically. We used a combination of electrophysiological and neuropsychological methods to assess these competing hypotheses. A neurological patient with a rare focal lesion of rostral-to-middorsal ACC was tested in an event-related potential study designed to track the time course of neural activity during conflicts and erroneous responses. Compared with controls, the error-related negativity component after incorrect responses was attenuated in the patient, accompanied by lower error-correction rates. Conversely, the stimulus-locked component on correct conflict trials, the N 450, was enhanced, and behavioral performance was impaired. We hypothesize that intact regions of lateral prefrontal cortex were able to detect response conflict, but damage to the dorsal ACC impaired response inhibition, which may be due to disconnection from cingulate and supplementary motor areas. The results implicate rostral-dorsal ACC in <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> and suggest this function can be dissociated from conflict-detection processes...|$|R

These behaviors are {{a public health}} concern and have become a poorly understood phenomenon in the community. It has been proposed that the commission of non-suicidal self-injury {{might be related to}} a failure in the brain network regulating executive functions. Previous studies have shown that BPD patients present an impairment in their capacity to monitor actions and conflicts associated with the performance of certain actions, which suppose an important aspect of cognitive control. Method: We used Event Related Potentials to examine the behavioral and electrophysiological indexes associated with the <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> in two BPD outpatients groups (17 patients each) differentiated according to {{the presence or absence of}} non-suicidal self-injury behaviors.

This study aimed to investigate deficits in specific executive functioning components, namely working memory and inhibition, in schizophrenia. In study 1, a set of neurocognitive function tests was administered to 41 patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls to capture specific components of executive functioning, including semantic inhibition (the Stroop-like paradigm and the Chinese Version of the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSC)), working memory (the spatial n-back), and response inhibition (the stop signal task (SST)). Results showed that schizophrenia patients did significantly worse than controls under both working memory and inhibition demands in the Stroop-like paradigm. In particular, patients were impaired when inhibiting a semantically associated response; and performance was correlated with negative symptoms. In study 2, we employed a modified semantic inhibitory <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> paradigm to examine whether patients with schizophrenia (n = 11) were impaired in semantic inhibitory <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> or not as compared to 11 healthy controls. The results suggested that patients with schizophrenia in this study remained intact in semantic inhibition <b>error</b> <b>monitoring.</b> There {{was no difference in}} the semantic inhibitory monitoring performance between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia.

In a 2 × 2 mixed-subjects design (n = 57), young and older adults performed a tea-making task under standard and dual-task conditions. Error rates were similar across age-groups and conditions.

In the standard condition, older adults engaged in more verbal checks than young adults, but this was not associated with improved task accuracy. Thus, both age-groups do engage in checking during an everyday task, but this checking had little impact on task accuracy. Consequently, checking may not be a necessary part of performance accuracy.

Here, we assessed the interplay between the two loops by investigating how visual feedback from the screen (responses either were or were not echoed on the screen) and the hands (the hands either were or were not covered with a box) influences the control of skilled typing. Our results indicated, first, that the reaction {{time of the first}} keystroke was longer when responses were no t echoed than when they were. Also, the interkeystroke interval (IKSI) was longer when the hands were covered than when they were visible, and the IKSI for responses that were not echoed was longer when explicit <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> was required (Exp. 2) than when it was not required (Exp. 1). Finally, explicit <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> was more accurate when response ech-oes were present than when they were absent, and implicit <b>error</b> <b>monitoring</b> (i. e., posterror slowing) was not influenced by visual feedback from the screen or the hands. These findings suggest that the outer loop adjusts the inner-loop timing parameters to compensate for reductions in visual feedback. We suggest that these adjustments are preemptive control strategies designed to execute keystrokes more cautiously when visual feed-back from the hands is absent, to generate more cau-tious motor programs when visual feedback from the screen is absent, and to enable enough time for the outer loop to monitor keystrokes when visual feedback from the screen is absent and explicit error reports are required...|$|R
