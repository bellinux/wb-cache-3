40|$|AbstractAnalyses of heme-attached {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} in known hemoprotein superfamilies {{provide a basis}} for prediction of such sequences in hemoproteins of unknown three-dimensional structure. Among 11 histidine residues conserved in subunit I of 3 mammalian and 2 fungal cytochrome oxidases the sequence around His- 233 (human) is the most conserved and shows remarkable similarity to the sequence of the oxygen binding site in globins. Furthermore, the gene coding for subunit I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the gene for leghemoglobin in soybean are both split by introns <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>these</b> similar histidine sequences. The predicted distal histidine sequence of subunit I provides for heme a 3 and Cua 3 binding and has an extraordinarily high content of aromatic residues.

Then, walking alone in token of her high rank, appeared Amada, the Royal Lady of Egypt, wonderfully arrayed.

[...] Schley sent the message by signal flag: “The enemy has surrendered” and “We have gained a great victory.” Against common practice {{at the end of a}} victorious battle, Sampson did not respond with the expected congratulatory remark, but rather, according to historian Joseph G. Dawson, [...] "the answering signal was terse and seemed needlessly brusque." [...] <b>After</b> <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> were exchanged, more tension grew between the two officers when Schley requested that he and his crew should [...] "have the honor of the surrender of the Cristobal Colon." [...] With disregard to Schley and the other commanding officers, Sampson cabled Secretary Long, [...] "The fleet under my command offers the nation as a Fourth of July present the whole of Cevera’s fleet," [...] invoking General William T. Sherman's message to Abraham Lincoln after taking Atlanta in 1864, but making no reference to Schley. A day after the news reached the United States, the New York Times published an article with the headline, [...] "Sampson's Fourth of July Victory," [...] expressing gratitude towards Sampson for his leadership during the Battle of Santiago. In Sampson's hometown of Palmyra, New York, a respectful one hundred shots were fired for his victory. Following the newspaper headlines were interviews and telegraphs from Sampson's wife, sister, and two sons. Each message displayed praise and congratulations for his accomplishments in the battle.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} salt iodization in Switzerland in the 1920 s and 1930 s on schooling outcomes. Iodine deficiency in utero causes mental retardation, and correcting the deficiency {{is expected to increase}} the productivity of a population by increasing its cognitive ability. The exogenous increase in cognitive ability brought about by the iodization program is also useful in the context of disentangling the effects of innate ability and education in later-life outcomes. I identify the impact of iodization in three ways: first, in a differences-in-differences framework, I exploit geographic variation in iodine deficiency, as well as the fact that the nationwide campaign to decrease iodine deficiency began in 1922. Second, I use spatial and temporal variation in the introduction of iodized salt across Swiss cantons, and examine whether the level of iodized salt sales at the time of one’s birth affected one’s educational attainment. Third, I employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design and use jumps in sales of iodized salt across Swiss cantons to identify the effect of iodization, by comparing outcomes for those born right before and <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>these</b> sudden changes in the treatment environment. These approaches indicate that the eradication of iodine deficiency in previously deficient areas increased the schooling of the population significantly. The effects are larger for females than for males, which is consistent with medical evidence showing that {{women are more likely to}} be affected by iodine deficiency disorders than men...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{different}} ways to signal participants when to take notes in their journal or fill-out a questionnaire, like using preprogrammed stopwatches. An observer can have an identically programmed stopwatch, so the observer can record specific events as the participants are recording their feelings or other behaviors. It is best to avoid letting subjects know in advance when they will record their feelings, so they can't anticipate the event, and will just be [...] "acting naturally" [...] when they stop and take notes on their current condition. Conversely, some statistical techniques require roughly equidistant time intervals, which has the limitation that assessments can be anticipated. Validity in these studies comes from repetition, so you can look for patterns, like participants reporting greater happiness <b>right</b> <b>after</b> meals. <b>These</b> correlations can then be tested by other means for cause and effect, such as vector autoregression, since ESM just shows correlation.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Corneal {{thinning}} disorders {{weaken the}} mechanical strength of affected corneas, suggesting that photorefractive procedures may be contraindicated in keratoconus. Few {{cases have been}} reported to confirm this hypothesis. METHODS: A 45 -year-old man had two laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) procedures and one photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) performed on his left eye, and three LASIK procedures on his <b>right</b> eye. <b>After</b> <b>these</b> surgeries, a dramatic corneal ectasia and grade III haze occurred in both eyes, with a clinical diagnosis of keratoconus. The changes in his corneas were followed with videokeratography and slit-lamp microscopy. RESULTS: Preoperative videokeratograph of both eyes suggested keratoconus. After multiple refractive procedures, the best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was as low as 20 / 1200 bilaterally. Both eyes displayed dramatic corneal protrusion with corneal scarring. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the need for preoperative corneal thickness measureme [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Childhood {{vaccination}} {{rates have}} steadily declined {{over the past}} decade and traditional educational strategies such as written resources and pediatrician recommendations have failed to produce immunization rates recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control. Starting the vaccination conversation with parents prior to the first pediatric visit could restore childhood immunization rates to their peak levels. This has strong implications for public health because it could prevent the re-emergence of infectious diseases and help maintain herd immunity. OB/GYN practitioners {{play a critical role in}} the timing of this conversation with parents prior to the birth of their child. To facilitate conversations between OB/GYN practitioners and expectant parents, micro-learning videos will be developed and used by the OB/GYN practitioners to improve their risk communication and shared-decision making skills. Once the program is implemented, they will report back upon their completion of video viewing, surveys and the number of women to whom they are communicating this knowledge. Pregnant women will also complete surveys <b>after</b> receiving <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> and take-home materials during program implementation. The goal of this program is to increase childhood vaccination rates in Allegheny County by providing information to pregnant women during prenatal visits. The target population is pregnant women receiving prenatal care at OB/GYN offices and clinics in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. With successful implementation of this program, parents will now have time to make this critically important decision, without feeling rushed or overwhelmed at their first pediatric visit and ultimately deciding to vaccinate their child(ren) ...|$|R
