40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion.</b> In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering assay is reasonable.

5000|$|A <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> is {{commonly}} found in the steering mechanism of cars or other wheeled, steered vehicles. <b>Rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> provides a less efficient mechanical advantage than other mechanisms such as recirculating ball, but less backlash and greater feedback, or steering [...] "feel".

50|$|<b>Rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> {{steering}} may be {{susceptible to}} kickback, as the steering rack transmits forces in either direction.

The objective {{function of the}} optimisation comprises of steering error. The length of the steering arm has been assumed as one-fifth of the wheel track for all cases. The steering error, transmission angle and mechanical advantages of these steering mechanisms have been compared. It {{has been found that}} the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> steering mechanism produces the least steering error. The transmission angle and mechanical advantage of the centre lever steering mechanism are most favourable. A suggestion has been made to replace the existing Ackermann steering mechanism for long wheelbase vehicles by a central outrigger type leading <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> steering mechanism.
