SUPERPAVE technology was used in new/reconstruction projects since 1994 and Cold In-place Recycling process was used since 1989 to rehabilitate asphalt pavements with severe and frequent thermal distresses associated with the use of conventional 85 / 100 penetration binder. Stone Mastic Asphalt technology was first used in 1997 on RMOC's bus only Transitway system (especially at the stations), transferred Provincial highways and a few major arterial truck routes to mitigate the rutting experienced by these roadways. The use of Novachip ultra-thin friction resurfacing, micro-surfacing and Hot In-place Recycling as an alternative to the conventional mill and overlay of urban road were evaluated between 1995 and 1997.

The isomorphic scenarios analysed were the recycling of drinks bottles and cans (including those with a single-use deposit or drink can deposit), second-hand clothing, and the return and recycling of waste oil in the mineral oil industry. In addition, the technical problems encountered in disposing of and reconditioning mobile telephones were discussed. The results obtained were compiled into an action framework for shaping the process of introducing recycling systems for IT terminal equipment. However the business foundation for the operative implementation was withdrawn following a change in the regulatory position (municipal 'notification requirement') in mid-2012.|$|R

Emission reduction, transportation, storage, <b>recycling,</b> handling <b>equipment,</b> and gas management are some of these important issues. Through the efforts of an internal resource team, SCE has effectively implemented several processes that have reaped substantial benefits. Replacing antiquated equipment and repairing known problem areas has minimized SF 6 emissions.
