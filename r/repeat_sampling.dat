While these can be seen as particularly relevant when the prior is diffuse, we argue that it is generally reasonable to consider such properties as part of our assessment of Bayesian inferences.

We develop optimal Bayesian <b>repeated</b> <b>sampling</b> inferences using a generalized idea of what it means for a credible region to contain a false value and discuss the practical use of this idea for error assessment and experimental design. We present results that connect Bayes factors with optimal inferences and develop a generalized concept of unbiasedness for credible regions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 59 - 61) Dams and reservoirs {{are vital}} for generating electricity and solving regional water problems. By storing and releasing water according operating rules, large reservoirs and dams can dramatically reform a hydrograph generated from large storm events. To model these systems, hydrodynamic models that include reservoir routing are needed. The Hillslope River Routing Model (HRR) is a hydrologic-hydraulic model, which simulates excess rainfall and routes surface and subsurface runoff, separately, using kinematic wave and channel flows using diffusion wave methodologies. As {{part of this}} research, the Green-Ampt infiltration and reservoir routing are incorporated into the HRR model. Although many reservoir routing models are available, they commonly require stage-discharge or storagedischarge relationships, which are difficult to obtain without in-situ data. The model developed here {{is intended to be}} parameterized using remote sensing to provide water surface elevations and surface areas (i. e., storage changes) measured from NASA's Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission which is tentatively scheduled to launch in 2019 and will measure reservoir areas ??? 1 ha and water surface elevations to ?? 10 cm with <b>repeat</b> <b>sampling</b> period varying from approximately 1 day to 2 weeks depending on the reservoir location.

Using the measured storage changes, generalized storage patterns are developed and used to modulate daily reservoir storage.
