2500|$|The Mauritian tomb bat {{is often}} found in groups of around five individuals. These groups are usually either made up of entirely male or female individuals; when they are found in mixed gender groups, the two sexes are {{separated}} by at least 100mm.

Unlike some species of bats, they do not roost close together in tight packs; instead they are found spaced out loosely, {{with the exception of}} a mother and her offspring.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of many years’ {{experience}} with writing and reviewing expert reports on <b>resources</b> and <b>reserves</b> of industrial and construction minerals, the author points out some mistakes which {{have been made by}} the authors of those reports while they were calculating <b>reserves</b> and <b>resources</b> of some of those minerals. Consequently, the reported <b>resources</b> and <b>reserves</b> of some exploration and exploitation areas were not realistic. The miscalculations were due to neglect of some correction coefficients, especially where cross-sections in which the calculations of <b>resources</b> and <b>reserves</b> were made were not perpendicular to beds, seams or batters in open-pits. As a result, the <b>resources</b> and <b>reserves</b> were rather exaggerated, which was misleading for the authors themselves, {{as well as for the}} investors. Personal responsibility in these cases is on the side of the authors of the expert reports, while objective responsibility lies with their employing companies and institutes, respectively. This article is aimed to promote the awareness of possible calculation mistakes in order to improve the quality of expert reports on <b>resources</b> and <b>reserves</b> of industrial and construction minerals in the future in such a way that they will be more realistically and responsibly elaborated, regardless of different authors, reviewers and producers of those reports...|$|R
