40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} work was to study {{the effect of the}} route of anti-IBDV vaccine {{administration}} on elevation of antibody titre and protective efficacy against Gumboro disease in addition the maternally derived antibodies titre (MDA) declining pattern was also studied. For this purpose 125 one day old progeny chicks from a known vaccinated dams were reared at an isolated pens and tested to determine anti IBDV antibody titre at day one (MDA) and day 17. At day 17 birds were divided into 5 groups; A, B, C and D based on the administration route of anti-IBDV vaccine while group E was not vaccinated and acted as negative control. Group A was vaccinated via intranasal (I/N) <b>route.</b> <b>Group</b> B was vaccinated via drinking water (oral) <b>route.</b> <b>Group</b> C was vaccinated via subcutaneous <b>route.</b> <b>Group</b> D was vaccinated via spraying (Inhalation) route. Each group was vaccinated twice at day 17 (Primary) and at day 24 (booster). Fifteen days post booster dose, sera samples were tested and birds were challenged to study the protective efficacy of the vaccine in each group. The mean antibody titre and coefficient of variation of group B were found to be superior to other groups. The protective efficacy parameters including mortality rate, gross lesions grading, bursa to body weight X 10 ratio and histopathologic changes grading were found to be better in group B than in other- 3 groups...|$|E

40|$|Background: Acetaminophen, {{a widely}} used {{analgesic}} and antipyretic {{is known to}} cause hepatic injury in humans and experimental animals when administered in high doses. It was reported that toxic effects of acetaminophen are due to oxidative reactions that take place during its metabolism. L-carnitine is a cofactor in the transfer of long-chain fatty acid allowing to the beta-oxidation of fatty acid in the mitochondria. It is a known antioxidant with protective effects against lipid peroxidation. This study aimed to investigate the possible beneficial effect of L-carnitine as an antioxidant agent against acetaminophen induced hepatic toxicity in rats. Material and Methods: Four rat groups (N= 7 in each group). Group I is the control, group II received 500 mg/kg/ body weight of L-carnitine for 7 days by oral <b>route,</b> <b>group</b> III received 640 /kg/ bw of acetaminophen by oral <b>route,</b> <b>group</b> IV acute acetaminophen group pretreated with L-carnitine for 7 days by gastric tube gavage tube. The liver of all rats were removed for investigation using light and electro microscopic studies. Results: Acetaminophen caused massive centrilobular necrosis and massive degenerative changes. The electron-microscopic study showed few mitochondria, increased fat droplets and scanty smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). These changes were reduced by L-carnitine pretreatment. Conclusion: those results suggest that acetaminophen results damage in the liver as an acute effect and L-carnitine ameliorated the adverse effects of acetaminophen via its antioxidant rol...|$|E

Two negative control animals were included in each group. Animals developed neutralizing antibody titers ranging between 1 : 10 - 1 : 2560 six days after the inoculation. This species showed an immune response to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus by increasing antibody titers after inoculation, and most individuals maintained their antibody titers over time. However, live virus and replication of the virus in the host could not be demonstrated by virus isolation attempts in tissue culture methods. Hyperactivity was the only clinical sign observed in the subcutaneous and oral abrasion groups. The intranasal group presented dyspnea, depression, and weight loss. In this group, 7 of the inoculated animals died 6 days post inoculation {{and the last one}} died on day 37 post inoculation. The necropsy of the animals in this group revealed pneumonia, hyperemia in the intranasal bone, and cerebral and hepatic congestion.

40|$|Background There are {{variations}} in remission rates following treatment of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) with cyclophosphamide. Objective To compare {{the efficacy of}} oral versus intravenous cyclophosphamide (CPA) {{in the management of}} pediatric SRNS. Methods This was a prospective study of 41 children with SRNS treated with CPA. One group received oral CPA at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight/day for 8 - 12 weeks, while the other group received intravenous CPA at a dose of 500 mg/m 2 body surface area (BSA) monthly for 6 months. All patients were concomitantly treated with prednisone on alternate days. The primary outcome was the number of patients attaining remission. Results The study was comprised of 20 children receiving oral CPA and 21 children receiving intravenous CPA. There were 29 boys and 12 girls. The mean age of children at the onset of nephrotic syndrome (NS) was 47 ± 40 months old (range 12 months – 13 years), and the mean duration of NS before initiation of CPA therapy was 15 ± 28 months (range 1 – 129 months). Remission was achieved in 29 (70. 7 %) patients, with no difference between oral and intravenous route of CPA administration. The mean time to achieve remission was 22. 7 weeks (about 5 months). The oral <b>route</b> <b>group</b> required less time in achieving remission than the intravenous <b>route</b> <b>group.</b> No association was found between remission and other factors, such as onset of steroid resistance, route of CPA, hypertension and hematuria. Side-effects included infection, anemia, nausea/vomiting, and alopecia. None of the patients required discontinuation of the medication. Conclusion Oral CPA was as effective as intravenous CPA for children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. [Paediatr Indones. 2011; 51 : 266 - 71]...|$|E

40|$|We outline a {{benchmark}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) intensity system with tradable permits for the aviation industry that will incent in-sector emission abatement opportunities that {{cost less than}} the social cost of carbon (SCC). The system sets benchmark emission intensities (CO 2 emissions per revenue ton kilometer) by <b>route</b> <b>group</b> and facilitates flexibility in meeting the benchmarks by allowing airlines to sell permits if they operate more efficiently than the benchmarks, and buy permits {{if they do not}} meet the benchmarks. The CO 2 benchmark system could operate concurrently with existing measures to mitigate aviation CO 2 emissions, will reduce the number of offsets needed to achieve carbon-neutral growth, and provide another (optional) lever to address fairness issues in climate regulations. Moreover, by providing a blueprint for other industries to price marginal emissions at the SCC, a CO 2 benchmark system could preserve the ‘carbon budget’ for use by high-cost abatement industries such as the aviation industry.

Fifty-four undergraduates (30 females, 24 males) learned a route through an urban virtual environment from either a map (survey perspective) or from virtual navigation (route perspective), with instructions to focus either on landmarks or on intersections. The survey group learned the environment by watching a dot moving through a map, whereas the <b>route</b> <b>group</b> learned by watching a virtual person walking through the virtual environment. While learning, participants were stopped at critical points and instructions focused their attention on either land- marks or intersections.

Methods: Thirty five adult male wistar rats {{were randomly assigned}} into 5 groups of 7 animals per group. Group I serves as the control, animals in Groups II, III, IV and V received 28  mg/kg body weight of lisinopril via oral <b>route.</b> <b>Group</b> III was co-treated with GAR at therapeutic dose of 250  mg/kg body weight per day. Group IV was co-treated with SACE at dose of 500  mg/kg body weight. Lastly, group V was co-treated with GAR and SACE at doses of 250 and 500  mg/kg body weight respectively, and the experiment last for 8 days. Results: Administration of lisinopril caused systemic toxicity in liver as well as adverse histopathologic changes in the tested tissue. While GAR and SACE significantly (P <  0. 05) reversed the toxic effects induced by lisinopril. Conclusions: Collectively, {{the results suggest that}} therapeutic dose of lisinopril elicits toxicity in male rats through induction of oxidative damage and depletion of cellular adenosine triphosphate.

40|$|Cadmium {{is known}} to exert toxic effects on {{multiple}} organs, including the testes. To determine if α-Tocopherol, an antioxidant, could protect testicular tissues and spermatogenesis from the toxic effects of cadmium, six-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive cadmium at doses of 0 (control), 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg by the intraperitoneal <b>route</b> (<b>Group</b> A) or α-tocopherol for 5 days before being challenged with cadmium (Group B) in an identical dose-dependent manner. When both groups received cadmium at 1 mg/kg, there were no changes in testicular histology relative to controls. When Group A received cadmium at 2 mg/kg, undifferentiated spermatids and dead Sertoli cells increased in the seminiferous tubules while interstitial cells decreased and inflammatory cells increased in the interstitial tissues. On flow cytometric analysis, the numbers of elongated spermatids (M 1) and round spermatids (M 2) decreased while 2 c stage cells (M 3, diploid) increased. In contrast, when Group B received cadmium at 2 mg/kg, the histological insults were reduced {{and the distribution of}} the germ cell population remained comparable to controls. However, α-tocopherol had no protective effects with higher cadmium doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg. These findings indicate that α-tocopherol treatment can protect testicular tissue and preserve spermatogenesis from the detrimental effects of cadmium but its effectiveness is dependent on the dose of cadmium exposed...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{compare the}} {{differences}} between medial and intercondylar infragenicular femoropopliteal prosthetic bypasses {{in terms of their}} midterm patency and limb salvage rates. Methods. Ninety-three consecutive patients with peripheral arterial disease who underwent a simple distal femoropopliteal bypass using a reinforced polytetrafluorethylene graft were included in this retrospective study. The bypass was constructed in the intercondylar route in 52 of the patients (group A) and in 41 in the medial <b>route</b> (<b>group</b> B). Results. Median observation time of the patients was 12. 7 (IQR 4. 6 – 18. 5) months. There were 22 and 24 interventional or surgical procedures (angioplasty, stenting, thrombolysis, thrombectomy, or correction of the anastomosis) performed to restore patency of the reconstruction in groups A and B, respectively (p= 0. 14). The 20 -month primary, assisted, and secondary patency rates and limb salvage rates were 57 %, 57 %, 81 %, and 80 % in group A compared to 21 %, 23 %, 55 %, and 82 % in group B (p= 0. 0012, 0. 0052, 0. 022, and 0. 44, resp.). Conclusion. Despite better primary, assisted, and secondary patency rates in patients with a prosthetic infragenicular femoropopliteal bypass embedded in the intercondylar fossa compared to patients with the medial approach, there is no benefit in terms of the limb salvage rate and the number of interventions required to maintain patency of the reconstruction...|$|E
