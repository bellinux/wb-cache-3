5|$|The 1947 {{season was}} another strong one for Speedie. In {{a game against}} the Buffalo Bills, he tied a {{professional}} football record by catching a throw from Graham and running 99 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship. His 67 catches and 1,146 receiving yards, in fact, were the second-best in pro football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers, who caught for 1,211 yards in 1940. Speedie was named by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro. Speedie's success in 1947 came as he, Graham and Lavelli gelled as a passing and <b>receiving</b> <b>unit,</b> having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination. Speedie studied how defensive backs moved their feet and tried to break into the open by exploiting mis-steps. They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses.|$|E
5|$|Despite his <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> being {{plagued by}} injuries, Jay Cutler ended {{the season with}} 3,629 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, 11 interceptions and career highs in passer rating (92.3) and {{completion}} percentage (64.4). The eleven interceptions were the lowest in his career and resulted in an interception percentage of 2.3, the lowest in a season when he has started at least 12 games. The 21 touchdowns were his second-most since 2011 and the 3,629 yards were the third-most in his career. On third down, Cutler had a 103.2 passer rating (fourth in the NFL) after completing 91 of 141 passes for 1,242 yards, seven touchdowns and two interceptions. With five lost fumbles, Cutler had a total of sixteen turnovers in 2015, eight fewer than in 2014. In his lone start against the Seahawks, Jimmy Clausen completed 9 of 17 passes for 63 yards, and including sacks, recorded 48 net passing yards, the second time since the 1990 season that the Bears had less than 50 net yards passing. The Bears ended the year with 228.9 passing yards per game, ranked 23rd in the league. The quarterbacking group ended {{the season with a}} combined 63.9 completion percentage and 2.3 interception percentage, both of which ranked third in team history, along with 3,843 gross passing yards and a 42.5 third down percentage (fourth), 3,660 net passing yards (fifth), along with 5,514 total net yards and a 89.7 passer rating (sixth).|$|E

50|$|The Air Force PUC {{was adopted}} from the Army Distinguished Unit Citation after the Air Force became a {{separate}} military branch in 1947. By Executive Order 10694, dated Jan. 10, 1957 the Air Force redesignated the Distinguished Unit Citation as the Presidential Unit Citation. The Air Force PUC {{is the same}} color and design as the Army PUC but slightly smaller, {{so that it can}} be worn in alignment with other Air Force ribbons on the left pocket following personal awards. As with the Army, all members of a <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> may wear the decoration while assigned to it, but only those assigned to the unit at the time of the action cited may wear the decoration as a permanent award or if any member of a <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> had it their last duty station prior to being either discharged or retired they may continue to wear the decoration as prescribed.|$|E

50|$|By {{encrypting}} {{the control}} signals, voice transmission can be secured against interception. Its primary {{use in this}} fashion is for secure radio communication. The advantage of this method of encryption {{is that none of}} the original signal is sent, only envelopes of the bandpass filters. The <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> needs to be set up in the same filter configuration to re-synthesize a version of the original signal spectrum.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of a}} low-frequency cave radio {{can also}} verify survey accuracy. A <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> on the surface can {{pinpoint}} the depth and location of a transmitter in a cave passage by measurement of the geometry of its radio waves. A survey over the surface from the receiver back to the cave entrance forms an artificial loop with the underground survey, whose loop-closure error can then be determined.|$|E
50|$|Robust XON is a {{technique}} to restart communication, just in case it was stopped by an accidentally received XOFF. The <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> sends periodic XON characters when it can receive data, and the line is idle. One common use is by serial printers (like HP LaserJet II) to indicate they are online and ready to receive data. The XON is sent every 1 to 30 seconds depending on the printer's firmware design.|$|E

This unit was extremely well decorated, <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> and numerous individual citations including Croix de Guerre and Légion d'honneur.

50|$|Ultrasonic is a {{technology}} used {{more frequently in}} the past for telecommand. Inventor Robert Adler is known for inventing the remote control which did not require batteries and used ultrasonic technology. There are four aluminum rods inside the transmitter that produce high frequency sounds when they are hit at one end. Each rod is a different length, which enables them to produce varying sound pitches, which control the <b>receiving</b> <b>unit.</b> This technology was widely used but had certain issues such as dogs being bothered by the high frequency sounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{basics of}} the {{protocol}} are well known. The handset contains a keypad and a transmitter integrated circuit (IC) driving an IR LED. The command data is a Manchester coded bitstream modulating a 36 kHz carrier. (Often the carrier used is 38 kHz or 40 kHz, apparently due to misinformation {{about the actual}} protocol.) The IR signal from the transmitter is detected by a specialized IC with an integral photo-diode, and is amplified, filtered, and demodulated so that the receiving device can act upon the received command. RC-5 only provides a one-way link, with information traveling from the handset to the <b>receiving</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
