5000|$|Lyrics in {{the song}} [...] "Undivided" [...] were {{influenced}} by the September 11 attacks. It simply states that No Man Is an Island and that all people {{are part of the}} greater world, that is humanity, that all people are stronger together, than being apart. Song [...] "Everyday" [...] was inspired also by September 11 attacks. It <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to live each day to its fullest and the lyrics acknowledge the harshness of life, but encourage listeners to [...] "brush themselves off", get back up on their feet and get on with life. [...] "The Distance" [...] is written in a cinematic style. The music serves as a score to the lyrics, which begins as an establishing shot and the [...] "camera" [...] draws closer into the story as the song progresses. The lyrics talk about the passion that person feels when there is a goal in sight and the determination shown when person is striving to reach that goal. Song [...] "Joey" [...] is influenced and inspired by Elton John's song Levon (1971) and talks about a character who befriends a simple-minded young man. [...] "Misunderstood" [...] is a song about every guy who's said the wrong thing or failed to say the right thing and had to face with the consequences. The song was written after Jon Bon Jovi came home after long period of time and when he realised there were portions of his personal life he had neglected and wrote this song to admit his guiltiness. Song [...] "All About Lovin' You" [...] is a love song that talks about appreciating the love of another. It was also influenced by September 11 events and how many people after that tragedy rediscovered that love is most important thing in life.|$|E
50|$|Many {{manufacturing}} {{industries in}} Africa are water-dependent. The share of jobs {{is lower than}} in agriculture, even though the industries cited are considered as water intensive. In 2011, Ghana’s economy grew at 14% {{with the onset of}} its first production of oil. However, in 2015 the growth rate was expected to be only 3.9%. This can be attributed to a great extent to the failure to provide the basic water and energy infrastructure {{to meet the needs of}} a rapidly growing economy. Ghana is mainly dependent on the Akosombo hydroelectric dam on the Volta River for electricity. Due to reduced inflows from low rainfall, the hydroelectric dam was operating merely at half of its capacity in 2015. This was exacerbated by disruptions mainly in geothermal plants. In June 2015, all electricity was being rationed at 12 hours on, and 24 hours off. Though this is extreme, it <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for water infrastructure to sustain production and jobs in the nascent African economies. Anecdotal evidence from trade unions and employers in Ghana indicate that tens of thousands of stable jobs were lost in 2015 and the investment climate has turned sour, forcing Ghana to seek International Monetary Fund macro-economic support again. These policy instruments are underpinned by strategies and programmes, including the New Partnership for African Development Program (NEPAD), Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) and many others, which include the integrated development of Africa’s water resources for socio-economic development and poverty alleviation and eradication. The AU Agenda 2063, for example, aspires to a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development. It specifically aims for an Africa that shall have equitable and sustainable use and management of water resources for socio-economic development, regional cooperation and the environment, and calls for the following action among others. ‘Support Young people as drivers of Africa’s renaissance, through investment in their health,education and access to technology, opportunities and capital, and concerted strategies to combat youth unemployment and underemployment. Encourage exchange and Pan-Africanism among young people through the formation of African Union Clubs in all schools, colleges and universities. Ensure faster movement on the harmonization of continental admissions, curricula, standards, programmes and qualifications and raising the standards of higher education to enhance the mobility of African youth and talent across the continent by 2025’.|$|E
