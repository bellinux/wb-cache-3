The magnetic {{activated carbon}} samples were characterized by N 2 adsorption, XRD, FTIR and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). It was found that the magnetic activated carbon had a high surface area of 993. 5 m 2 /g with 4 % Fe 3 O 4 and a saturation magnetization of 2. 4158 emu/g for magnetic separability. The results showed that the magnetic properties of MAC are provided by Fe 3 O 4 and Fe. In the presence of Fe 3 O 4, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbonization</b> and activation increase to form a large surface area and a high pore volume. Moreover, the addition of Fe 3 O 4 can greatly promote the number of both micro-pores and meso-pores in activated carbon. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of concretes on the corrosion of the reinforcing steel, {{at a variety of}} concrete samples the electric conductivity and current density-potential characteristica, the permeability and diffusion of oxygen, the cube strength and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbonization</b> have been measured. It is demonstrated that air humidity exhibits a much stronger influence on current densities than the kind and composition of the concrete. Under normal conditions the reinforcing steel corrosion must be regarded as an anodically controlled reaction. The corrosion process is only at a high level of air moisture (> 95 %) limited by the rate of oxygen diffusion. As oxygen is usually supplied at a sufficient rate by of diffusion, the anodic depassivation by carbonization has to be prevented either by the concrete properties (Ca(OH) _ 2 reserves, low cube strength) or by limiting the electrolyte conductivity or by cathodic protection of the reinforcing steel.

40|$|UV {{absorption}} spectra in the 200 - 400 run range and transient thermocouple measurements {{are used to}} characterize the process of nanoparticle formation and their carbonization to soot particles in slightly sooting premixed flames of ethylene. The UV absorption technique allows a quantitative determination of the concentration of both soot and nanoparticles. In the examined flame, the total particulate is initially present as nanoparticles, {{but even in the}} sooting region, where the yellow luminosity is dominant, soot particles represent less than 50 % of the total mass of particulate. This technique can be easily used for the determination of soot and nanoparticles at the exhaust of real combustion devices and in urban polluted areas. Time-resolved thermocouple measurements are used to follow the variation along the flame axis of the emissivity of the particulate deposited by thermophoresis on the thermocouple junction. These values are used for the evaluation of an apparent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbonization,</b> which has been compared with the coagulation rate of the particles evaluated by scattering and extinction measurements. Both processes, carbonization and coagulation, show a second-order kinetic with a constant of the order of 5 x 10 (12) cm(3) /s.
