60|$|As no {{variability}} {{of this kind}} can be detected in plants raised from seeds, the parents of which have grown during many successive generations in close proximity, we may infer that they cannot have intercrossed. What does occasionally occur {{is that in a}} <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> raised from seeds of one variety, another variety true of its kind appears; for instance, in a long row of Scarlets (the seeds of which had been carefully gathered from Scarlets for the sake of this experiment) two Purples and one Painted Lady appeared. Seeds from these three aberrant plants were saved and sown in separate beds. The seedlings from both the Purples were chiefly Purples, but with some Painted Ladies and some Scarlets. The seedlings from the aberrant Painted Lady were chiefly Painted Ladies with some Scarlets. Each variety, whatever its parentage may have been, retained all its characters perfect, and there was no streaking or blotching of the colours, as in the foregoing plants of crossed origin. Another variety, however, is often sold, which is striped and blotched with dark purple; and this is probably of crossed origin, for I found, as well as Mr. Masters, that it did not transmit its characters at all truly.|$|E
60|$|The {{original}} mother-plant, {{from which}} the five successive self-fertilised generations were raised, bore dingy purple flowers. At no time was any selection practised, and the plants were subjected in each generation to extremely uniform conditions. The result was, as in some previous cases, that the flowers on all the self-fertilised plants, both in the pots and open ground, were absolutely uniform in tint; this being a dull, rather peculiar flesh colour. This uniformity was very striking in the long <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> growing in the open ground, and these first attracted my attention. I did not notice in which generation the original colour began to change and to become uniform, but I {{have every reason to}} believe that the change was gradual. The flowers on the intercrossed plants were mostly of the same tint, but not nearly so uniform as those on the self-fertilised plants, and many of them were pale, approaching almost to white. The flowers on the plants from the cross with the purple-flowered Westerham stock were, as might have been expected, much more purple and not nearly so uniform in tint. The self-fertilised plants were also remarkably uniform in height, as judged by the eye; the intercrossed less so, whilst the Westerham-crossed plants varied much in height.|$|E

60|$|While strolling {{about the}} little walks of his garden, the {{appearance}} of verdure {{along the edge of}} the crater, or immediately beneath the cliff, caught Mark's eye. Going hastily to the spot, he found that there was a long <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> of a new sort, not only appearing above the ground, but already in leaf, and rising several inches in height. These were the results of the seeds of the oranges, lemons, limes, shaddocks, figs, and other fruits of the tropics, that he had planted there as an experiment, and forgotten. While his mind was occupied with other things, these seeds had sent forth their shoots, and the several trees were growing with the rapidity and luxuriance that distinguish vegetation within the tropics. As Mark's imagination pictured what might be the effects of cultivation and care on that singular spot, a sigh of regret mingled with his hopes for the future, as he recollected he was so soon to abandon the place for ever; while on the Summit, too, this feeling of regret was increased, rather than diminished. So much of the grass-seed had taken, and the roots had already so far extended, that acres were beginning to look verdant and smiling. Two or three months had brought everything forward prodigiously, and the frequency of the rains in showers, added to the genial warmth of the sun, gave to vegetation a quickness and force that surprised, as much as it delighted our young man.|$|E
6000|$|Washington Irving I [...] "met," [...] with infant promptitude, {{very much}} as I had met General Scott; only {{this time it was}} on a {{steamboat}} that I apprehended the great man; my father, under whose ever-patient protection I then was--during the summer afternoon's sail from New York to Fort Hamilton--having named him to me, for this long preservation, before they greeted and talked, and having a fact of still more moment to mention, with the greatest concern, afterwards: Mr. Irving had given him the news of the shipwreck of Margaret Fuller in those very waters (Fire Island at least was but just without our big Bay) during the great August storm that had within the day or two passed over us. The unfortunate lady was essentially of the Boston connection; but she must have been, and probably through Emerson, a friend of my parents--mustn't she have held [...] "conversations," [...] in the finest exotic Bostonese, in New York, Emerson himself lecturing there to admiration?--since the more I squeeze the sponge of memory the more its stored secretions flow, to remind me here again that, being with those elders late one evening at an exhibition of pictures, possibly that of the National Academy, then confined to scant quarters, I was shown a small full-length portrait of Miss Fuller, seated as now appears to me and wrapped in a long white shawl, the failure of which to do justice to its original my companions denounced with some emphasis. Was this work from the hand of Mr. Tom Hicks aforesaid, or was that artist concerned only with the life-sized, the enormous (as I took it to be) the full-length, the violently protruded accessories in which come back to me with my infant sense of the wonder and the beauty of them, as expressed above all in the image of a very long and lovely lady, the new bride of the artist, standing at a window before a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> or bulbs in tall coloured glasses. The light of the window playing over the figure and the [...] "treatment" [...] of its glass and of the flower-pots and the other furniture, passed, by my impression, for the sign of the master hand; and was it all brave and charming, or was it only very hard and stiff, quite ugly and helpless? I put these questions as to a vanished world and by way of pressing back into it only the more clingingly and tenderly--wholly regardless in other words of whether the answers to them at all matter. They matter doubtless but for fond evocation, and if one tries to evoke one must neglect none of the arts, one must do it with all the forms. Why I should so like to do it is another matter--and what [...] "outside interest" [...] I may suppose myself to create perhaps still another: I fatuously proceed at any rate, I make so far as I can the small warm dusky homogeneous New York world of the mid-century close about us.|$|E

5000|$|After planting, {{placing a}} {{circumference}} of mulch surrounding plants functions to lessen evaporation. To do this, firmly press {{two to four}} inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents water runoff. When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary. Additionally, to conserve {{the maximum amount of}} water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation. Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system. Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period. These systems use 30 - 50% less water than conventional methods. Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%. [...] They connect to a garden hose and lay along the <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> under a layer of mulch. A layer of organic material added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with compost.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginnings}} of the style {{may be seen in}} earlier tapestries. The famous Apocalypse Tapestry series (Paris, 1377-82) has several backgrounds covered in vegetal motifs, but these are springing from tendrils in the way of illuminated manuscript borders. In fact most of the very large sets do not fully use the style, with the meadow of flowers extending right {{to the top of the}} picture space. The early Devonshire Hunting Tapestries (1420s) have naturalistic landscape backgrounds, seen from a somewhat elevated viewpoint, so that the lower two-thirds or so of each scene has a millefleur background, but this gives way to forest or sea and sky at the top of the tapestry. The The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald (about 1450) and most of The Hunt of the Unicorn set (about 1500) are similar. From the main period, each tapestry in the The Lady and the Unicorn set has three distinct zones of millefleur background: the island containing the figures, where the plants are densely arranged, an upper background zone where they are arranged in vertical bands, and accompany animals at very varied scales, and a lower zone where a single <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> have slight gaps between them.|$|E
50|$|Furrow {{irrigation}} {{is conducted}} by creating small parallel channels along the field length {{in the direction}} of predominant slope. Water is applied to the top end of each furrow and flows down the field under the influence of gravity. Water may be supplied using gated pipe, siphon and head ditch, or bankless systems. The speed of water movement is determined by many factors such as slope, surface roughness and furrow shape but most importantly by the inflow rate and soil infiltration rate. The spacing between adjacent furrows is governed by the crop species, common spacings typically range from 0.75 to 2 metres. The crop is planted on the ridge between furrows which may contain a single <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> or several rows {{in the case of a}} bed type system. Furrows may range anywhere from less than 100 m to 2000 m long depending on the soil type, location and crop type. Shorter furrows are commonly associated with higher uniformity of application but result in increasing potential for runoff losses. Furrow irrigation is particularly suited to broad-acre row crops such as cotton, maize and sugar cane. It is also practiced in various horticultural industries such as citrus, stone fruit and tomatoes.|$|E

The experimental design was a factorial strip plot based on completely randomized block design with 3 replications. Planting pattern consisted of 3 levels (60 cm with 1 planted row, 75 cm and 90 cm with 2 planted rows) as vertical factor, a factorial of plant density (30, 40 and 50 plant/m 2) and genotypes (504, L 14 and DPX) was considered as horizontal factors. The means of planting pattern × density showed that the highest number of pods/plant (52. 85) belonged to 60 cm with single <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> and 40 plant m- 2. The lowest (28. 35) number of pods/plant was observed in 90 cm with double rows planted and 50 plant m- 2. The genotypes responded to planting density differently.

40|$|In the sunflower, in {{addition}} to seed yield, it is of interest to evaluate number of leaves plant- 1, head diameter, stem diameter and plant height, since these characteristics {{may be associated with}} seed yield or lodging. The objective of the work was to determine the optimal sample size (from which the experimental coefficient of variation, CV, can be established) for evaluation of these four characteristics. Fifteen cultivars were evaluated in an experimental design of randomized blocks with ten replications. The characteristics were evaluated using two sampling methods (in a single <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> or in the two rows from the useable area of each plot) and sample sizes of from two to 18 sampling units, with an interval of two plants. In the two sampling methods, the experimental accuracy, as measured by the CV, increased with increasing sample size. A sample made up of ten sampling units is suitable for assessing the number of leaves, the diameters of the head and stem, and the plant height in cultivars of the sunflower. From this sample size upwards, additional gains in experimental precision are not obtained. This sample size can be used to evaluate plants in a single row or in two rows taken from the useable area of each plot, since there was virtually no difference between sampling methods with regard to experimental accuracy. However, it is most practical and quick to sample in one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the possibility of harvesting raspberries with a pulsating air stream that causes the shoots of plants to vibrate. Two tractor-driven test devices were developed under this specific objective. The first one was a high capacity compressor, and the stream of air produced by it was directed onto one side of a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants.</b> The second one was a device producing two counter-flowing air streams colliding in the middle of a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants.</b> The frequency of the air pulses was adjusted steplessly by varying the rotational velocity of the shutters closing and opening the outlets of the fans. In the field trials with the device based on a compressor-generated air stream, two air pulse frequencies were used: 500 and 540 pulses per minute (8. 3 and 9 Hz). The mean detachment force was 0. 727 N. About 50 % of ripe raspberries were removed from the bushes. The results achieved during harvesting with the device operating on the principle of colliding two pulsating air streams were markedly better and put the harvesting effectiveness within the range achieved in the trials with combine harvesters with mechanical finger shakers conducted by other researchers. For two pulse frequencies (8 and 9 Hz), almost 62 % of fruits were harvested. Increasing the pulse frequency of the counter-flowing air streams above 9 Hz did not improve the effectiveness of detaching raspberry fruits from shoots...|$|E

As unidades básicas (UB) foram duplas de plantas, resultando em 36 UB por linha de cultivo, na estufa, e de 42 UB no túnel e a campo. Para cada linha de cultivo em cada colheita e agrupamento de colheitas, estimou-se a média, a variância e o coeficiente de variação (CV%). Quando as variâncias das linhas não foram heterogêneas, utilizou-se, para o cálculo do tamanho de amostra, o CV% do experimento, quando foram heterogêneas, utilizou-se o CV% da linha em que este foi maior. Foi possível concluir que a variabilidade produtiva da fitomassa fresca de vagens aumenta em condições meteorológicas adversas e que analisar a produção total possibilita a utilização de menores tamanhos de amostra. Nessa condição, para uma semi-amplitude do intervalo de confiança da média (D%) de 10 no outono/inverno, é necessário amostrar, na linha de cultivo, 28 plantas na estufa, 21 no túnel e 26 no campo. Na primavera/verão, para um D%= 10, é necessário amostrar, na linha de cultivo, 22 plantas em cultivos em túnel e 24 a campo. Aiming {{to estimate}} the sample size for the fresh weight of pods of bean pod, five experiments were performed with blank Macarrão at autumn / winter 2009 and spring / summer 2010, in greenhouse, tunnel and field.
