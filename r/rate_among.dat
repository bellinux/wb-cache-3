40|$|OBJECTIVE—To define US {{national}} sex specific {{rates of}} smoking initiation among Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and African American adolescents aged 12 - 17 years for each calendar year from 1940  through 1992.  METHODS—Adult survey {{data from the}} tobacco use supplement of the Current Population Survey in 1992 - 93  and 1995 - 96  were used to reconstruct {{the age at which}} individuals began to smoke and the calendar year in which they were that age. From these data, the number of individuals who began a calendar year as never smokers and who were aged 12 - 17 years during that year could be estimated and formed the denominator of the initiation rate. The number of these individuals who reported taking up smoking during that year formed the numerator of the initiation <b>rate.</b>  RESULTS—Initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> male adolescents {{in each of the three}} racial/ethnic groups have declined since 1945.  However, since 1983, initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> male adolescents overall have increased. Non-Hispanic white male adolescents generally initiated cigarette smoking at higher rates than Hispanic or African American male adolescents. Initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> Hispanic male adolescents have not been statistically different from initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> African American male adolescents. From 1978  to 1982, initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> Hispanic and African American male adolescents experienced a sharp decline, and the rate of decline was steeper than that experienced by non-Hispanic white male adolescents. Initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> female adolescents have increased since 1940, catching up to male adolescent initiation rates by the mid 1970 s. Initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> female adolescents appeared to level off or increased slightly again from the mid 1980 s to 1990.  Non-Hispanic white female adolescents generally initiate cigarette smoking at higher rates than Hispanic or African American female adolescents. Initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> non-Hispanic white and African American female adolescents equalled the initiation rates of their male counterparts by the mid 1970 s, but initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> Hispanic female adolescents did not overlap with initiation rates of Hispanic male adolescents until 1990.  From 1975  to 1980, initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> African American female adolescents decreased sharply, but, unlike initiation <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> the two other ethnic groups, rates continued to decline from 1984  to 1990.  CONCLUSIONS—Different patterns of increasing and decreasing smoking initiation among sex and ethnic adolescent groups suggest the effect of varying social and cultural influences. These findings support the importance of including ethnic factors in studies of smoking behaviour.    Keywords: smoking initiation; adolescents; ethnic group...|$|R

5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality <b>rate</b> <b>among</b> people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the United States, {{the rates}} and {{temporal}} trends of oesophageal cancer overall {{and for the}} two predominant histologic types – adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) – differ between Blacks and Whites, but little is known {{with regard to the}} patterns among Asians/Pacific Islanders or Hispanics. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programme data, we analysed oesophageal cancer incidence patterns by race, sex, and histologic type for the period 1977 – 2005. RESULTS: Total oesophageal cancer incidence has been increasing among Whites only; the <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> all other race groups have declined. Moreover, <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> White men surpassed those among Blacks in 2004. Oesophageal SCC rates have been decreasing among virtually all racial/ethnic groups; <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander men have been intermediate to those of Blacks and Whites, with <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> women being lower than those among Blacks or Whites. The ADC <b>rates</b> <b>among</b> Hispanic men may be rising, akin to the historical trends among Whites and Blacks. The sex ratios for these cancers also varied markedly.
