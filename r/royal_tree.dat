Their fathers both have ties to a powerful businessman who orders Jang-il's father to kill Sun-woo's father. One desperate crime begets another, and the boys' friendship derails in a shocking betrayal. The attack leaves Sun-woo blind and in a coma. Thirteen years later, their fates will come to a head when they meet again as adults. Jang-il (Lee Joon-hyuk) has become a prosecutor haunted by his past, while Sun-woo (Uhm Tae-woong), the young CEO of investment trust company <b>Royal</b> <b>Tree,</b> is plotting his revenge. Their fates are intertwined with the women they love—Ji-won (Lee Bo-young), a volunteer reader for visually impaired people who now works as a VIP party planner at a five-star hotel, and Soo-mi (Im Jung-eun), a hyper-realism painter. As Jang-il and Sun-woo vow to destroy each other, the truth unravels in a harrowing cycle of deception and revenge as the crimes and secrets of yesteryear come to light.|$|E
5000|$|From there, teams went to Thamalakane River to {{take one}} of the [...] "safari taxis" [...] to the <b>Royal</b> <b>Tree</b> Lodge Game Preserve for the Detour. In Brains, teams had to go on a horseback safari and spot ten wooden animal cutouts: (zebra, African buffalo, kudu, giraffe, meerkat, {{boomslang}} snake, leopard, warthog, ostrich, and hippopotamus with a heron). They then traveled to a nearby campsite and arranged a set of tiles featuring the silhouettes of the animals in the order they appeared. The were tiles for animals they did not see. There was no tile representing the hippopotamus, but there was one for the heron. Once they picked the right order, they received their next clue. If they werei ncorrect, they had to start again before being allowed another attempt to arrange the tiles. In Brawn, teams had to fill a traditional sand sledge with firewood and then, using a carrot dangling from a stick, coax a team of donkeys to pull the sledge to a campsite over a 1/2 mi away. Once the wood was unloaded from the sledge, teams received their next clue. Either task allowed teams to search the game preserve for the Pit Stop.|$|E

It is not obvious to write an appropriate grammar for a complex problem. Our proposed Bayesian Grammar-Based Genetic Programming with Hierarchical Learning (BGBGP-HL) aims at automatically designing new rules from existing relatively simple grammar rules during evolution to improve the grammar structure. The new grammar rules also reflects the new understanding of the existing grammar under the given fitness evaluation function.

40|$|Structure of a grammar can {{influence}} {{how well a}} Grammar-Based Genetic Programming system solves a given problem {{but it is not}} obvious to design the structure of a grammar, especially when the problem is large. In this paper, our proposed Bayesian Grammar-Based Genetic Programming with Hierarchical Learning (BGBGP-HL) examines the grammar and builds new rules on the existing grammar structure during evolution. Once our system successfully finds the good solution(s), the adapted grammar will provide a grammar-based probabilistic model to the generation process of optimal solution(s). Moreover, our system can automatically discover new hierarchical knowledge (i. e. how the rules are structurally combined) which composes of multiple production rules in the original grammar. In the case study using deceptive <b>royal</b> <b>tree</b> problem, our evaluation shows that BGBGP-HL achieves the best performance among the competitors while it is capable of composing hierarchical knowledge. Compared to other algorithms, search performance of BGBGP-HL is shown to be more robust against deceptiveness and complexity of the problem...|$|E

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{first step}} in the attempt to verify whether (and in which cases) fitness {{distance}} correlation can be a good tool for classifying problems {{on the basis of their}} difficulty for genetic programming. By analogy with the studies that have already been done on genetic algorithms, we define some notions of distance between genotypes. Then we choose one of these distances to calculate the fitness distance correlation coefficient and we use it to study the difficulty of some problems. First, we do this for a syntactically limited language. Then we extend the study to standard genetic programming. For the functions used here i. e., traps and <b>royal</b> <b>trees,</b> the results confirm that fitness distance correlation is a good predictor of genetic programming difficulty. ...|$|R
