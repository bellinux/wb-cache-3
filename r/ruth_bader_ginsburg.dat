25|$|The {{antecedents of}} the case were posed when Lilly Ledbetter, a {{production}} supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama, filed an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, six months before her early retirement in 1998. The courts gave opposite verdicts, first supporting the complaint and later opposing; in conclusion the complaint brought {{the case to the}} attention of the Supreme Court. The latter ruled in 2007 by a 5-4 majority vote that Ledbetter's complaint was time-barred because the discriminatory decisions relating to pay had been made more than 180 days prior to the date she filed her charge, as explained by Justice Samuel Alito. Justice <b>Ruth</b> <b>Bader</b> <b>Ginsburg's</b> dissenting opinion proposed an interpretation according to which the law runs from the date of any paycheck that contains an amount affected by a prior discriminatory pay decision.|$|R

Justice Ginsburg’s Coleman dissent shows how the Court and Congress acting together can enforce the Constitution’s promise of equal citizenship in ways the Court acting alone cannot...|$|R

Allegations that Totenberg obtained her scoops by untoward means were prevalent early in her career, a fact Bill Kovach, editor of The New York Times, attributed to sexism since {{she was one of the}} few women working in a predominantly male environment. Totenberg was criticized by some commentators for hugging her friend Lani Guinier during a press conference announcing Guinier's nomination by Bill Clinton to the post of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. [...] Media critic Howard Kurtz reported that while Totenberg said she did not intend to give special treatment to Guinier in her reporting, she had hugged her because she had not seen her in some time. Then in 2000, some journalists expressed concern that Justice <b>Ruth</b> <b>Bader</b> <b>Ginsburg's</b> officiating at Totenberg's marriage could be seen as a conflict of interest. Totenberg responded she did not consider it a conflict of interest since her friendship with the jurist was established long before Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court. She has made the same observation about her friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia.|$|R
40|$|As {{scholars}} have recently shown, Justice <b>Ruth</b> <b>Bader</b> <b>Ginsburg’s</b> earliest sex discrimination work was grounded in anti-stereotyping theory. The particular stereotype she challenged {{was that of}} males as breadwinners and females as homemakers. As Cary Franklin notes, Justice Ginsburg’s approach was grounded in “constitutional limits on the state’s power to enforce sex-role stereotypes. ” While Justice Ginsburg herself has {{come to realize that}} anti- stereotyping may not suffice to combat sex discrimination, her early focus on the ways in which stereotyping affects men, specifically men who did not fit the breadwinner stereotype, and her argument that only state-sanctioned stereotypes are constitutionally offensive, remains a compelling paradigm. This Article compares Justice Ginsburg’s notion of prohibited stereotypes with the much broader ban set out in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which requires states to: modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women[. ] Part I explains how the U. S. Constitution addresses gender stereotypes in the context of reproductive rights and reproductive work. Part II describes how CEDAW treats stereotypes in these contexts. Part III describes the “economic and cultural power shift from men to women” documented by Hannah Rosin in The End of Men, which makes gender stereotypes increasingly outdated, especially, as Justice Ginsburg insisted forty years ago, for American men...|$|R
40|$|Legislative {{lawsuits}} are a recurring by-product of divided government. Yet the Supreme Court has never definitively resolved whether Congress may sue {{the executive branch}} over its execution of the law. Some scholars argue that Congress {{should be able to}} establish Article III standing when its interests are harmed by executive action or inaction just like private parties. Others, including most prominently the late Justice Antonin Scalia, argue that intergovernmental disputes do not constitute Article III “cases” or “controversies” at all. Rather, the Framers envisioned the political branches resolving their differences through nonjudicial means. This Article proposes a different approach to congressional lawsuits loosely derived from Justice <b>Ruth</b> <b>Bader</b> <b>Ginsburg’s</b> majority opinion in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission and the “equitable discretion” doctrine once utilized in the D. C. Circuit. Under what this Article terms the “Legislative Exhaustion” principle, Congress would be barred from federal court whenever it has nonjudicial means to obtain the remedy it seeks against the Executive. Conversely, when Congress has no way to directly overrule the Executive, such as when the Executive refuses to enforce a law based on constitutional objections, federal courts could resolve the constitutional dispute. Not only is such an exhaustion principle consistent with prudential doctrines, preserving judicial resources for cases that demand adjudication, but it also encourages the most important normative benefit the Framers hoped to achieve from interbranch disputes—namely, enhanced legislative deliberation concerning the merits of government policy. Thus, there is no single answer to whether Congress may sue the Executive. Rather, it depends {{on the nature of the}} claim and the nonjudicial remedies available to Congress...|$|R
5|$|<b>Ruth</b> <b>Bader</b> <b>Ginsburg</b> (born Joan Ruth Bader; March 15, 1933) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Ginsburg was {{appointed}} by President Bill Clinton and took {{the oath of office}} on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice to be confirmed to the Court (after Sandra Day O'Connor), and one of four female justices to be confirmed (with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who are still serving). Following Justice O'Connor's retirement, and prior to Justice Sotomayor joining the Court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the Court. Notable majority opinions Ginsburg has authored include United States v. Virginia, Olmstead v. L.C., and Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.|$|E

40|$|Court’s {{ruling on}} the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is a {{landmark}} deci-sion — both for constitutional law and {{for health care}} law and policy. Others will study its implications for constitutional limits {{on a range of}} federal powers beyond health care. This article considers to what extent the decision is also about health care law, properly conceived. Under one view, health care law is the subdiscipline that inquires how courts and government actors take account of the special features of medicine that make legal or policy issues especially problematic — rather than regarding health care delivery and finance more generically, like most any other economic or social enterprise. Viewed this way, the opinions from the Court’s conservative justices are mainly about general constitutional law principles. In contrast, Justice <b>Ruth</b> <b>Bader</b> <b>Ginsburg’s</b> dissenting opinion for the four more liberal justices is just as much about health care law as it is about constitutional law. Her opinion gives detailed attention to the unique features of health care finance and delivery in order to inform her analysis of constitutional precedents and principles. Thus, the Court’s multiple opinions give a vivid depiction of the compelling contrasts between communal versus individualistic conceptions of caring for those in need, and between health care and health insur-ance as ordinary commodities versus ones that merit special economic, social, and legal status. I often remark that National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebel-ius may be the case of the decade for constitutional law, but for health care law and public policy it is the case of the century. For constitutional schol-ars and political observers, no case since Bush v. Gore (other than perhaps Citizen’s United v. Federal Election Commission) has been this closel...|$|R
40|$|The idea {{of legal}} {{pluralism}} is that law must always negotiate situations when multiple communities and legal authorities seek {{to regulate the}} same act or actor. These overlapping jurisdictional assertions may occur because of federalism, or because disputes often cross territorial borders, or because of complicated inter-jurisdictional arrangements, as with Indian tribes in the United States. In all of these situations, judges must develop strategies for determining how best to balance the competing claims of multiple communities: does the law of one community triumph, does {{the law of the}} other community triumph, or is there some hybrid solution available? This Essay surveys some of Justice <b>Ruth</b> <b>Bader</b> <b>Ginsburg’s</b> key writings on the interaction of legal systems, both in law journals and in judicial opinions. This analysis reveals a consistent theme in Ginsburg’s jurisprudence. Across a variety of substantive legal areas, Ginsburg often chooses a path that provides maximum play among the legal systems at issue. Beginning with her earliest scholarly writings, she has tended to oppose doctrines allowing one legal system to block another from adjudicating a dispute, and throughout her later career Ginsburg likewise tends to reject bright-line rules that choose one legal system over another. Instead, she often seems to prefer procedural arrangements that seek accommodation and flexibility {{in order to ensure that}} multiple legal systems and a variety of norms and processes are respected. These principles also carry over to Ginsburg’s views about international and transnational law. A committed internationalist, Ginsburg advocates the importance of seeking wisdom from others. This non-dogmatic, deferential approach to plural legal systems characterizes much of her jurisprudence on inter-systemic conflicts, though interestingly such deference does not always apply with as much force in Ginsburg’s opinions concerning tribal communities. By taking stock of Ginsburg’s navigation of legal pluralism in a set of representative writings, we can better theorize her contribution to a jurisprudential approach that seeks ongoing negotiation in an interlocking world of multiple jurisdictions and multiple legal norms. Just as important, this discussion provides an initial case study for thinking more broadly about possible judicial responses to the reality of legal pluralism...|$|R
