5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} ironically great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays <b>real</b> <b>ones</b> starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus Candide derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events {{with no apparent}} redeeming qualities.|$|E
5|$|Light Yagami, {{the true}} {{identity}} of Kira, discovers {{the location of}} Mello's hideout. An indirect result {{of this is that}} Mello meets the Shinigami Sidoh, the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him—in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate—that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of <b>real</b> <b>ones</b> specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent. However, Light launches a SWAT team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a scar on his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.|$|E
25|$|If {{religious}} liberty includes, as it must, {{the right to}} communicate such experiences to others, {{it seems to me}} an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from <b>real</b> <b>ones,</b> dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance. Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When one comes to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or representation, unbelievers among his judges are likely not to understand, and are almost certain not to believe, him.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though he}} sought to {{distinguish}} observed facts from myths and popular errors and {{was known for his}} accurate depiction of many animals in Historiae animalium, he also included many fictional animals such as the Unicorn and the Basilisk, which he had only heard about from medieval bestiaries. But when Gessner doubted the accuracy of the opinions he relayed in his own writings, or the validity of the illustrations he included, he clearly said so. Besides any plant or animal's potential advantage to people, Gessner was interested in learning about them because of the moral lessons they could teach and the divine truths they might tell. He went into as much detail about some unreal animals as he did about <b>real</b> <b>ones.</b> Later in 1556 he also combined real and fictional creatures in his edition of the works of Claudius Aelianus.|$|E
25|$|Alan and Dale Klapmeier {{grew up in}} DeKalb, Illinois. Their parents {{bought a}} second home in the early 1970s on a small farm near Baraboo, Wisconsin. Aviation {{was a part of}} the {{brothers}}' lives from a very early age; Alan told Airport Journals in 2006 that when he was a baby, the only way his mother could get him to stop crying at times was to bring him to an airport and park the car at the end of the runway so he could watch airplanes. The brothers constantly built model airplanes as infants and Dale was known to repeatedly pester their father into letting them build <b>real</b> <b>ones.</b> When Dale reached the age of 15, he learned to fly in a Cessna 140 before learning to drive a car. While still in high school, Alan joined the Civil Air Patrol at age 17 as a way of getting cheaper flying lessons. He would often go around visiting small airports to talk to pilots and even told his friends that he wanted to design aircraft, speaking about how he and his younger brother would one day compete with Cessna.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of <b>real</b> <b>ones</b> too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E

500|$|Theme Hospital was {{released}} in March 1997 (although it was originally due for release in November 1996), and is part of Bullfrog's Designer Series. The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the Houses of Parliament, and The Daily Telegraph, who published an article criticising the game as [...] "sick" [...] because the British Medical Association was using it to train management staff. The NHS argued that the game mocked hospital management. Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game {{to make light of}} real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than <b>real</b> <b>ones.</b> Theme Hospital was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared in the top five of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described Theme Hospital as [...] "a great game that I and many people remember".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} a {{tremendous}} critical success, with many reviewers hailing it as a genuine work of art, recommended for both children and adults. Although film histories often state that the animation of the human characters was criticized, more recent scholarship finds that most reviewers praised the realistic style of the human animation, with several stating that audiences will forget that they are watching animated humans rather than <b>real</b> <b>ones.</b> At the 11th Academy Awards, the film won an Academy Honorary Award for Walt Disney [...] "as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field". Disney received a full-size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones, presented to him by 10-year-old child actress Shirley Temple. The film was also nominated for Best Musical Score. [...] "Some Day My Prince Will Come" [...] has become a jazz standard that has been performed by numerous artists, including Buddy Rich, Lee Wiley, Oscar Peterson, Frank Churchill, and Oliver Jones. Albums by Miles Davis, by Wynton Kelly, and Alexis Cole.|$|E
500|$|Boyd has {{previously}} {{written about the}} 20th century through two characters: The New Confessions was a fictional memoir, and Nat Tate a spoof biography. In Any Human Heart, Boyd uses the journal form as a fresh angle to pursue the subject from: [...] "I wanted to invent my own exemplary figure who could seem almost as real as the <b>real</b> <b>ones</b> and whose life followed a similar pattern: boarding school, university, Paris in the 20s, the rise of Fascism, war, post-war neglect, disillusion, increasing decrepitude, and so on—a long, varied and rackety life that covered most of the century." [...] Boyd sets Mountstuart's life within its context, tracing the grand arc of events during the 20th century by depiciting Mountstuart as swept along {{in the flow of}} history - he serves in World War II, sees the cultural revolution in the 1950s and 60s, and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around the world. Rather than being re-told in hindsight, their importance in context, historical events are seen through the petty lens of every-day living. For example, in an entry from the 1920s, Mountstuart notes [...] "Coffee with Land Fothergill at the Cadena. She was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes. We talked a little stiffly about Mussolini and Italy and I was embarrassed to note how much better informed she was than I." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{effect of}} being {{shuttled}} {{into and out}} of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. [...] After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying [...] "I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. <b>Real</b> <b>ones.</b> Now we were going to be a real family." [...] However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{happened}} {{mostly in}} Los Angeles, including location shooting at Sunset Strip, Silver Lake, Pacific Palisades, the Hollywood Hills and the Biltmore Hotel. Id Club, the nightclub {{featured in the}} film, was built within Hollywood's Pantages Theater, while the hills above Dodger Stadium near Elysian Park {{were used for the}} car chase and crash where Sil fakes her death. For the opening scenes in Utah, the Tooele Army Depot dubbed as the outside of the research facility—the interiors were shot at the Rockwell International Corporation laboratory in California—and a Victorian-era train station in Brigham City was part of Sil's escape. Other locations included the [...] Santa Monica Pier and the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico. The most complex sets involved the sewer complex and a tar-filled granite cavern where the ending occurs. Donaldson wanted a maze quality for the sewers, which had traces of realism (such as tree roots breaking through from the ceiling) and artistic licenses. Production designer John Muto intentionally designed the sewers wider and taller than <b>real</b> <b>ones,</b> as well as with walkways, but nevertheless aiming for a claustrophobic and realistic atmosphere. The underground tunnels were built out of structural steel, metal rod, plaster and concrete to endure the fire effects, and had its design based on the La Brea Tar Pits, with Muto describing them as [...] "just the sort of place in which a creature from another planet might feel at home." ...|$|E
500|$|Serious art critics {{had less}} emotional, but also mixed, {{opinions}} of the work. It was received less favourably by Józef Szujski and Stanisław Tarnowski, but praised by painters Henryk Siemiradzki and Artur Grottger. Comments of Wojciech Korneli Stattler are interpreted by different authors as either praise, or critique. In Paris, displayed at Exposition Universelle, 1867 the painting received a gold medal. While in Poland the painting's context and message was clearly understood, the work, displayed in Paris, proved to be too obscure for the audience there, with few understanding the complex, historical context; some French critics interpreted it as {{a painting of a}} gambling hall. It is said, however, to have been well understood by the Russian visitors to the French gallery, some of whom are said to have been interested in acquiring the painting, which was commended by Poles as [...] "they bought the <b>real</b> <b>ones,</b> might as well buy the painted ones, too". Eventually, however, the painting was acquired by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria for 50,000 franks. It was shown at a gallery in Vienna, and eventually ended up at the Hofmuseum. Thanks to the efforts of minister Juliusz Twardowski it was purchased by the government of the Second Polish Republic in 1920. As part of the Wawel Royal Castle National Art Collection it has been on a public display in the Royal Castle in Warsaw since 1931, {{with the exception of the}} period of World War II, when it was briefly looted by the Nazis.|$|E

2500|$|Waterlow and Sons Limited printed 200,000 {{banknotes}} of 500 Portuguese escudos (which was {{equivalent to}} 0.88% of Portugal’s nominal GDP at the time) {{with an image}} of Vasco da Gama, with the date of 17 November 1922, to a total face value of 100 million escudos. [...] There were almost as many false 500 escudos banknotes as <b>real</b> <b>ones.</b> First delivery was made in February 1925, {{one year after the}} real 500 escudo banknotes with the image of Vasco da Gama began to circulate. The notes were transported from England to Portugal with the help of Reis's accomplices, José Bandeira, who would use the diplomatic advantages of his brother, and Karel Marang, who held a diplomatic passport issued by Liberia. Reis then proceeded to launder the bills into gold-backed foreign currencies and smaller denominations of Portuguese currency.|$|E
2500|$|A complex Lie {{group is}} defined {{in the same way}} using complex {{manifolds}} rather than <b>real</b> <b>ones</b> (example: SL(2, C)), and similarly, using an alternate metric completion of Q, one can define a p-adic Lie group over the p-adic numbers, a topological group in which each point has a p-adic neighborhood. Hilbert's fifth problem asked whether replacing differentiable manifolds with topological or analytic ones can yield new examples. The answer to this question turned out to be negative: in 1952, Gleason, Montgomery and Zippin showed that if G is a topological manifold with continuous group operations, then there exists exactly one analytic structure on G which turns it into a Lie group (see also HilbertSmith conjecture). If the underlying manifold is allowed to be infinite-dimensional (for example, a Hilbert manifold), then one arrives at the notion of an infinite-dimensional Lie group. [...] It is possible to define analogues of many Lie groups over finite fields, and these give most of the examples of finite simple groups.|$|E
2500|$|Canning's oratory, Hazlitt maintains, {{is entirely}} artificial, his [...] "reasoning a tissue of {{glittering}} sophistry ... his language a cento of florid commonplaces", elegantly constructed but trite and contrived. His speeches are [...] "not {{the growth of}} truth, of nature, and feeling, but of state policy, of art, and practice." [...] They are as unlike true eloquence as [...] "artificial flowers" [...] are unlike <b>real</b> <b>ones,</b> and are filled with such hollow and outworn phrases as the vessel of the state,' 'the torrent of popular fury,' 'the precipice of reform,' 'the thunderbolt of war,' 'the smile of peace,' etc." [...] Canning adds to this the conventional modes of address used in parliament, such as The Honourable and Learned Gentleman,' and 'his Honourable and Gallant Friend, which Hazlitt dubs [...] "House-of-Commons jargon". These speeches are delivered in a brilliant, witty, and elegant manner suggesting extemporaneity, yet, as Hazlitt claims, there are clues to indicate {{that they are in}} fact carefully worked up in advance and learned by rote. And the speeches are used often to conceal unpleasant truths for political ends.|$|E

2500|$|Vannevar Bush (and memex), John C. Lilly, Timothy Leary and his eight-circuit {{model of}} consciousness, Ted Nelson and Project Xanadu are cited as {{precursors}} to the Wired. Douglas Rushkoff and his book Cyberia were originally to be cited as such, and in Lain Cyberia became {{the name of}} a nightclub populated with hackers and techno-punk teenagers. Likewise, the series' deus ex machina lies in the conjunction of the Schumann resonances and Jung's collective unconscious (the authors chose this term over Kabbalah and Akashic Record). Majestic 12 and the Roswell UFO incident are used as examples of how a hoax might still affect history, even after having been exposed as such, by creating sub-cultures. This links again to Vannevar Bush, the alleged [...] "brains" [...] of MJ12.

2500|$|After {{the masks}} are shaped, they are painted and {{otherwise}} decorated. Facial features may be cut into or {{painted on the}} mask. Most masks are painted first {{with a layer of}} white with colors added. Traditionally the decorative paint was oil and enamel, but many have switched to acrylics and other commercial paints. [...] Although details such as beards, mustaches and eyebrows can be painted or sculpted on the mask, more realistic versions add ixtle, cotton, animal hair (such as horse or sheep) and even human hair, as well as other materials. Eyes can be imitated on the mask with the use of marbles, mica, flat or curve glass (painted behind) or glass eyes. Many tiger masks place mirrors for eyes. Teeth can be added with the use of <b>real</b> <b>ones</b> from animals or humans, as well as metal, cactus spines, corn or reeds. If the mask has a tongue, it is often of leather or tin. Horns on devil masks are commonly made from those from cows, goats or deer. Finished masks often receive further decoration with ribbons, gold accents, bells, sequins and more. Often this addition of decoration is done by the dancers themselves to personalize them, especially the addition of beards and fangs. In the town of Teloloapan, Guerrero, the local government holds a contest for the best decoration of devil masks.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 May 2017, Wikileaks posted {{links to}} e-mails {{purported to be}} from Emmanuel Macron's {{campaign}} in the French 2017 presidential election. The documents were first relayed on the 4chan forum (used by far-right American groups) and by pro-Trump Twitter accounts, and then by Wikileaks, who indicated they did not author the leaks. Experts have asserted that the Wikileaks Twitter account {{played a key role}} in publicising the leaks through the hashtag #MacronLeaks just some three-and-a-half hours after the first tweet with hashtag appeared. The campaign stated that false documents were mixed in with <b>real</b> <b>ones,</b> and that [...] "the ambition of the authors of this leak is obviously to harm the movement En Marche! in the final hours before the second round of the French presidential election". France's Electoral Commission described the action as a [...] "massive and coordinated piracy action". France's Electoral Commission urged journalists not to report on the contents of the leaks, but to heed [...] "the sense of responsibility they must demonstrate, as at stake are the free expression of voters and the sincerity of the election". Cybersecurity experts initially believed that groups linked to Russia were involved in this attack. The Kremlin denied any involvement.
