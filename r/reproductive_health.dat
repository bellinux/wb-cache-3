40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{help support}} and direct the Lions Club's {{construction}} of a Community Health Clinic specializing in <b>Reproductive</b> and Sexual <b>Health,</b> this descriptive study began in November of 2004 and was completed in May 2005. The sample consists of 552 {{high school students in}} Rumiñahui County, and surveys were used to study four principle themes: <b>reproductive</b> and sexual <b>health</b> education, family planning, sexually transmitted infections, and domestic violence. The results show a widespread lack of accurate and adequate information about <b>reproductive</b> and sexual <b>health.</b> Statistically significant variables studied include sex, age, monthly income, and age of first sexual experience. Female sex, younger age, lower monthly income, and younger age of first sexual experience all contribute to a lower quality of <b>reproductive</b> and sexual <b>health,</b> in terms of having less information about and access to these four aspects of <b>reproductive</b> and sexual <b>health...</b>|$|R

5|$|Three related {{targets of}} MDG5 were {{adolescent}} birth rate, contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning (where prevalence+unmet need = total need), which were {{monitored by the}} Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Contraceptive use was part of Goal 5B (universal access to <b>reproductive</b> <b>health),</b> as Indicator 5.3. The evaluation of MDG5 in 2015 showed that amongst couples usage had increased worldwide from 55% to 64%. {{with one of the}} largest increases in Subsaharan Africa (13 to 28%). The corollary, unmet need, declined slightly worldwide (15 to 12%). In 2015 these targets became part of SDG5 (gender equality and empowerment) under Target 5.6: Ensure universal access to sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> and reproductive rights, where Indicator 5.6.1 is the proportion of women aged 15–49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> care (p.31).|$|E

The respondents of this study consisted of 350 form four students with the used of stratified sampling method. The research instrument was a questionnaire developed by the researcher and the supervisor Dr Faizah Abdul Ghani that had obtained the Cronbach Alpha value of 0. 82. Descriptive analysis shown that 99. 7 percent of students achieved intermediate level of understanding towards the subject of Social <b>Reproductive</b> and <b>Health</b> Education whereas 0. 3 percent of students shown below average level of understanding towards the subject. Next, it is shown that 18. 52 percent shown that form four students in Pontian district were involved in sexual activities whereas 81. 48 percent shown that they have never involve with such activities. The correlation analysis shown that there is a significant relationship between level of understanding towards the subject of Social <b>Reproductive</b> and <b>Health</b> Education with their sexual behavior and also there is a significant relationship between preventive measures provided by the Social <b>Reproductive</b> and <b>Health</b> Education subject with the student’s sexual behavior.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate {{the first year of}} the Black Female Leadership Development Institute (BFLDI) program of the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh (ULPGH) and to provide the organization with program recommendations. The BFLDI aims to increase self-efficacy, knowledge about <b>reproductive</b> sexual <b>health</b> information, dating abuse recognition, how to reduce high-risk behaviors, increase social supports, and facilitate healthy psychosocial development through a variety of program activities conducted over eight months. Evaluation information was collected from 36 minority adolescent females. A pre and post survey measuring self-efficacy, self-image, gender norm beliefs, <b>reproductive</b> sexual <b>health</b> attitudes, dating abuse recognition, and <b>reproductive</b> sexual <b>health</b> knowledge was conducted with study participants. The analysis included calculating descriptive statistics, construct averages, and cross tabulations in order to evaluate the BFLDI program. Participants reported high levels of program satisfaction. There was no significant difference observed in knowledge, attitudes, or beliefs between the pre and post surveys. However, a positive association between self-efficacy and gender norm beliefs (p =. 023) was observed. Two trends were observed in the associations between age and <b>reproductive</b> sexual <b>health</b> attitudes and age and dating abuse recognition. Recommendations for year two include modifications in activities such as topics focused more directly on program goals and increased evaluation measurements such as collection of behavioral data. This program is relevant to public health as it serves as an intervention to reduce the health problems of sexually transmitted infection, teenage pregnancy, and dating abuse among minority adolescent females...|$|R

5|$|Women {{experience}} many unique {{health issues}} related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. <b>Reproductive</b> <b>health</b> includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic.

The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E

She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E
40|$|The <b>reproductive</b> {{and sexual}} <b>health</b> needs of {{adolescents}} {{differ from those}} of adults.

Achieving <b>reproductive</b> and sexual <b>health</b> requires more than preventing unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, it includes developing the ability to form and maintain meaningful relationships with others and with one's own body. Psychological, social, educational, environmental, and economic factors, among others, all play a role.

These significant factors underline the importance of meeting the <b>reproductive</b> and sexual <b>health</b> needs of this age group. <b>Reproductive</b> and sexual <b>health</b> – combined with mental health disorders and emotional problems, violence and unintentional injury, substance use, and poor nutrition – form part of a complex web of potential challenges to adolescents' healthy emotional and physical development...|$|R
