25|$|A {{ground fault}} circuit {{interrupter}} circuit breaker (GFCI breaker in USA and Canada) and residual-current breaker with overload (RCBO in Europe) are devices that combine {{the functions of}} a <b>residual-current</b> <b>device</b> with a circuit breaker. They detect both supply imbalance and overload current.|$|E
25|$|The diagram {{depicts the}} {{internal}} mechanism of a <b>residual-current</b> <b>device</b> (RCD). The device {{is designed to}} be wired in-line in an appliance power cord. It is rated to carry a maximal current of 13 A and is designed to trip on a leakage current of 30 mA. This is an active RCD; that is, it latches electrically and therefore trips on power failure, a useful feature for equipment that could be dangerous on unexpected re-energisation. Some early RCDs were entirely electromechanical and relied on finely balanced sprung over-centre mechanisms driven directly from the current transformer. As these are hard to manufacture to the required accuracy and prone to drift in sensitivity both from pivot wear and lubricant dry-out, the electronically amplified type with a more robust solenoid part as illustrated are now dominant.|$|E
5000|$|Some units {{can also}} test <b>Residual-current</b> <b>devices,</b> {{following}} the recommendation {{in the current}} IEE Code of Practice to test any RCD fitted on an extension lead or multiway adapter.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{recommended}} to install <b>residual-current</b> <b>devices</b> for protection against electrocution. The greater danger associated with electrical shock {{in the water}} is that the person may be rendered immobile and unable to rescue themselves or {{to call for help}} and then drown.|$|R
50|$|A {{distribution}} board (also known as panelboard, breaker panel, or electric panel) is {{a component of}} an electricity supply system that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits, while providing a protective fuse or circuit breaker for each circuit in a common enclosure. Normally, a main switch, and in recent boards, one or more <b>residual-current</b> <b>devices</b> (RCD) or residual current breakers with overcurrent protection (RCBO), are also incorporated.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>residual-current</b> <b>device</b> (RCD), or residual-current {{circuit breaker}} (RCCB), is a device that {{instantly}} breaks an electric circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock. Injury may still occur in some cases, for example if a human falls after receiving a shock. In the United States and Canada, the device is more commonly known as a {{ground fault circuit interrupter}} (GFCI), ground fault interrupter (GFI) or an appliance leakage current interrupter (ALCI). In the United Kingdom, these are better known by their initials RCD, and a combined RCD+MCB (miniature circuit breaker) is known as a RCBO ({{residual-current circuit breaker}} with overcurrent protection). In Australia, they are sometimes known as safety switches or an RCD. An earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) may be a <b>residual-current</b> <b>device,</b> although an older type of voltage-operated earth leakage circuit breaker also exists.|$|E

50|$|The {{distribution}} board (aka fusebox) contains {{one or more}} main switches and an individual fuse or miniature circuit breaker (MCB) for each final circuit. Modern installations may use <b>residual-current</b> <b>devices</b> (RCDs) or residual current breakers with overcurrent protection (RCBOs). The RCDs are used for earth leakage protection, while RCBOs combine earth leakage protection with overcurrent protection. In a UK-style board, breaker positions are numbered top to bottom in the left-hand column, then top to bottom in the right column.|$|R
5000|$|A High Resistance Connection (HRC) is {{a problem}} that results from loose or poor {{connections}} in traditional electrical accessories and switchgear which can cause heat to develop, capable of starting a fire. Safety devices such as fuses and <b>Residual-current</b> <b>devices</b> (RCDs) are unable to detect thermal rise and disconnect the electrical supply because they cannot sense HRC. A safety device [...] to prevent HRC operates by effectively monitoring for abnormal thermal rise and will prevent ignition, smoke or burning odour of the electrical accessory or electrical installation.|$|R
50|$|Solenoid {{voltmeters}} draw appreciable current when operating. This {{makes them}} useful for testing <b>residual-current</b> <b>devices</b> (GFCIs) because the current drawn will trip most RCDs when the solenoid voltmeter is connected between the live and earth conductors. Also, when testing power supply circuits, a high-impedance connection (that is, a nearly open-circuit fault {{such as a}} burned switch contact or wire joint) in the power path might still allow enough voltage/current through to register on a high-impedance digital voltmeter, but it probably will not actuate the solenoid voltmeter. For use with high impedance circuit applications, however, they are not so good, as they draw appreciable current and therefore alter the voltage being measured.|$|R

50|$|Most {{electrical}} {{items in}} domestic wiring are controlled from {{the consumer unit}} with its <b>residual-current</b> <b>device</b> (RCD), which since 2001 has to be installed. Homes are wired in a ring circuit.|$|E
25|$|Two- and four-pole {{breakers}} {{are used}} {{when there is}} a need to disconnect multiple phase AC, or to disconnect the neutral wire to ensure that no current flows through the neutral wire from other loads connected to the same network when workers may touch the wires during maintenance. Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some <b>residual-current</b> <b>devices</b> (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.|$|R
5000|$|The museum {{displays}} {{more than}} 4,000 goods that infringe trademarks, patents, and copyrights. One {{of the largest}} {{of its kind in}} the world, the museum is home to a collection of 14 broad categories of goods, including clothing, footwear, watches and eye wear, accessories, cosmetics and perfumes, food and household products, drugs, alcohol and cigarettes, copyright works, stationery and office supplies, automotive parts, tools, electrical devices, and miscellaneous products. According to CNN, the museum has [...] "an eye-opening display that shows just how much is counterfeited, how far crooks will go to manufacture fake products, and the very real dangers that the industry creates." [...] Other unexpected couterfeited goods are shown, such as automotive accessories, bearings, <b>residual-current</b> <b>devices,</b> pencils, glue, and food products.|$|R
2500|$|These {{versions}} of the 5-15R or 5-20R receptacle are <b>residual-current</b> <b>devices</b> and have Test and Reset buttons (and sometimes an indicator light). In the US and Canada they are required in many potentially wet locations, including outside outlets, bathrooms, some places in kitchens, basements, and crawl spaces. They work by comparing the current going out on the hot conductor to the current returning on the neutral conductor, and disconnect the circuit if the difference exceeds 4-6 milliamperes. They are cheaper than GFCI circuit breakers and can be wired to feed additional [...] "downstream" [...] receptacles so that putting one GFCI receptacle in a circuit protects all the plugs, lights, and switches downstream from it. They are also recommended for power tool outlets and locations where children might insert conductive objects into the receptacles.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{extension}} cords also incorporate safety {{features such as}} a polarized plug and receptacle, grounded terminals, a [...] "power-on" [...] indicator, a fusible link, or even a <b>residual-current</b> <b>device</b> (also known as a ground-fault circuit interrupter or GFCI).|$|E

An earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) may be a <b>residual-current</b> <b>device,</b> although an older type of voltage-operated earth leakage circuit breaker also exists. In German-speaking countries the device is sometimes known as FI where the F stands for fault (Fehler) and I for the symbol that represents electric current.|$|E
2500|$|The Wylex {{standard}} {{consumer unit}} was {{very popular in}} the United Kingdom until the wiring regulations started demanding <b>residual-current</b> <b>devices</b> (RCDs) for sockets that could feasibly supply equipment outside the equipotential zone. The design {{does not allow for}} fitting of RCDs or RCBOs. [...] Some Wylex standard models were made with an RCD instead of the main switch, but (for consumer units supplying the entire installation) this is no longer compliant with the wiring regulations as alarm systems should not be RCD-protected. [...] There are two styles of fuse base that can be screwed into these units: one designed for rewirable fusewire carriers and one designed for cartridge fuse carriers. Over the years MCBs have been made for both styles of base. In both cases, higher rated carriers had wider pins, so a carrier couldn't be changed for a higher rated one without also changing the base. [...] Cartridge fuse carriers are also now available for DIN-rail enclosures.|$|R

Genting Group UK (the UK's biggest casino operator) is based at Star City near Washwood Heath. Dana Traction Technologies make axles (including that of the Ford Transit and Range Rover) and limited slip differentials at Witton, off the A4040 near the M6, and TIMET UK. Legrand UK (electrical switches) is based at the A41/A4540 junction at Newtown south of Aston. TRW Automotive Electronics (the former Lucas Electrical Training Centre) is on the A453 north of the M6 at Perry Barr. Delcam (CAD/CAM software) is at Small Heath Trading Est off the A45. Eaton Electric (former Delta and MEM) make <b>residual-current</b> <b>devices</b> (Cutler-Hammer) and switchgear off the A41 in Tyseley, and Mereway Kitchens is nearby; SCC (computing) is on A41 at the River Cole bridge. Goodrich Engine Controls make engine control systems for jet engines at Hall Green.|$|R
5000|$|The IEC 61008 and IEC 61009 {{standards}} {{impose the}} use of a 0.5 µs of 100 kHz damped oscillator wave (ring wave) to test the ability of <b>residual-current</b> protection <b>devices</b> to withstand operational discharges with a peak current equal to 200 A. With regard to atmospheric discharges, IEC 61008 and 61009 standards establish the [...] surge current test with 3 kA peak current but limit the requirement to RCDs classified as [...] "selective".|$|R
50|$|Until the 1950s, {{isolated}} ground domestic mains supplies {{tended to have}} no <b>Residual-Current</b> <b>Device</b> (RCD) or Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB), and too high a ground impedance to blow a fuse if a live-to-earth fault occurred. This could leave metalwork in the house live. The use of Residual Current Devices (RCDs) or formerly ELCBs with such installs solved this problem. Such installs are called EEBAD (Earthed Equipotential Bonding and Automatic Disconnection).|$|E
50|$|Corded {{electric}} mowers {{are limited}} in range by their trailing power cord, which may limit their use with lawns extending outward more than 100-150 feet (30-45 m) from the nearest available power outlet. There is the additional hazard with these machines of accidentally mowing over the power cable, which stops the mower and may put users at risk of receiving a dangerous electric shock. Installing a <b>residual-current</b> <b>device</b> (GFCI) on the outlet may reduce the shock risk.|$|E
5000|$|In TN-S and TT systems (and in TN-C-S {{beyond the}} point of the split), a <b>residual-current</b> <b>device</b> can be used for {{additional}} protection. In the absence of any insulation fault in the consumer device, the equation IL1+IL2+IL3+IN = 0 holds, and an RCD can disconnect the supply as soon as this sum reaches a threshold (typically 10 mA - 500 mA). An insulation fault between either L or N and PE will trigger an RCD with high probability.|$|E
50|$|Circuit {{breakers}} and fuses {{are used}} to detect short circuits between the line and neutral or ground wires or the drawing of more current than the wires are rated to handle (overload protection) to prevent overheating and possible fire. These protective devices are usually mounted in a central panel—most commonly a distribution board or consumer unit—in a building, but some wiring systems also provide a protection device at the socket or within the plug. <b>Residual-current</b> <b>devices,</b> also known as ground-fault circuit interrupters and appliance leakage current interrupters, {{are used to}} detect ground faults - flow of current in other than the neutral and line wires (like the ground wire or a person). When a ground fault is detected, the device quickly cuts off the circuit. In northern and central Europe, residential electrical supply is commonly 400 V three-phase electric power, which gives 230 V between any single phase and neutral; house wiring may be a mix of three-phase and single-phase circuits, but three-phase residential use is rare in the UK. High-power appliances such as kitchen stoves, water heaters and maybe household power heavy tools like log splitters may be supplied from the 400 V three-phase power supply.|$|R

5000|$|A {{fault in}} the {{appliance}} which causes a live conductor {{to contact the}} casing will cause a current to flow in the earth conductor. If large enough, this current will trip an over-current device (fuse or circuit breaker (CB)) and disconnect the supply [...] The disconnection time has to be fast enough not to allow fibrillation to start {{if a person is}} in contact with the casing at the time. This time and the current rating in turn sets a maximum earth resistance permissible. To provide supplementary protection against high-impedance faults it is common to recommend a <b>residual-current</b> <b>device</b> (RCD) also known as a residual current circuit breaker (RCCB), ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), or residual current operated circuit-breaker with integral over-current protection (RCBO), which will cut off the supply of electricity to the appliance if the currents in the two poles of the supply are not equal and opposite.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{investigates the}} {{subsystems}} required {{to create a}} combined <b>residual-current</b> <b>device,</b> power manager and phase-switcher for electric vehicles charging, controlled by an FPGA. The purpose of this task {{is to create a}} prototype design for Chargestorm, a company that manufacture charging stations for electrical vehicles and provides a portal for payment. Each subsystem will be separately investigated to see the available alternatives and evaluate which solutions fit this design best. The system is designed to handle currents of 32 A on three phases. The design consists of a hall sensor to detect the residual current, switches to meet the switching requirements and to break the circuit when needed, current transformers to measure current and differential amplifiers to measure voltage. All logic and communication is controlled by an FPGA. Specific isolation requirements are set to prevent the power grid from arcing to the low voltage components. Optocouplers are used to allow communication between the components on the high voltage and the low voltage sides. The final design is placed on a six layer printed circuit board. This is mainly to allow for more copper to conduct the high current and thermal management. Theoretically, the work is complete and all requirements are fulfilled. In practice however, the prototype have not been fully tested and evaluated to see if the theory matches the real world...|$|E
