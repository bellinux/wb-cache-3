5|$|Thanks to its {{appearance}} in the Orange Bowl and a <b>revenue-sharing</b> agreement with other Big East schools, Virginia Tech earned $3.981 million for playing in the 1996 Orange Bowl. $3.5 million of that total came directly from the bowl, while the remaining $481,000 came from the <b>revenue-sharing</b> pool generated by all the Big East teams that participated in bowl games. The almost-$4 million payout made Virginia Tech's football team the wealthiest of the 36 schools that participated in bowl games after the 1996 season.|$|E

The {{competition}} marked Virginia Tech's first trip to the annual Sugar Bowl game, but it was the Hokies' third consecutive bowl appearance. It was Texas' third Sugar Bowl appearance and its first since 1958. In exchange for playing in the game, each team received $8.3 million. Thanks to <b>revenue-sharing</b> agreements with Big East conference members, Virginia Tech received $3.5 million, minus expenses, for playing in the Sugar Bowl. Pregame media coverage of the event focused on Virginia Tech making its first appearance in a major bowl game and Texas' resurgence as a major college football power. On the field, attention was focused on Virginia Tech's strong defense and Texas' successful offense.|$|E

5|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{debt and}} <b>revenue-sharing</b> within the Netherlands Antilles {{eventually led to}} the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and Sint Maarten claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius were absorbed directly into the Netherlands. Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which the Netherlands Antilles participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch Antillean athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. As residents of the Netherlands Antilles hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch Antillean athletes should immediately become eligible to represent the Netherlands in the Netherlands Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch Antillean athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for the Netherlands Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch Antillean NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.|$|E

Sumner Redstone, whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new <b>revenue-sharing</b> arrangement for video in the mid-1980s. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept a 60% of the rental fee, paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through Rentrak. In addition to benefiting from a lower initial price, Blockbuster also capitalized {{on the fact that}} movies were generally not available for purchase at affordable price points during initial release periods. Thus customers had a choice to rent, wait, or buy the film on tape at the much higher manufacturer's suggested retail price targeted at other rental chains and film enthusiasts, which at that time ranged between $70–$100 per title.|$|E
