25|$|In geometry, the rhombicuboctahedron, {{or small}} rhombicuboctahedron, is an Archimedean solid with eight {{triangular}} and eighteen square faces. There are 24 identical vertices, with one triangle and three squares meeting at each. (Note that {{six of the}} squares only share vertices with the triangles while the other twelve share an edge.) The polyhedron has octahedral symmetry, like the cube and octahedron. Its dual is called the deltoidal icositetrahedron or trapezoidal icositetrahedron, although its faces are not <b>really</b> <b>true</b> trapezoids.|$|E

25|$|If {{the camera}} {{position}} and image framing (i.e., angle of view) have been chosen, {{the only means}} of controlling DOF is the lens aperture. Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large f-number. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't <b>really</b> <b>true.</b> Once a lens is stopped down to where most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease sharpness in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the defocus blur spot, and the overall sharpness may still increase. Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits (Gibson 1975, 64). There is thus a tradeoff between sharpness in the POF and sharpness at the DOF limits. But the sharpness in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if the blur at the DOF limits is imperceptible, the blur in the POF is imperceptible as well.|$|E

2500|$|The group {{owes its}} origin to Muganda {{military}} leader Semei Kakungulu. Originally, Kakungulu was converted to Christianity by British missionaries around 1880. He {{believed that the}} British {{would allow him to}} be king of the territories, Bukedi and Bugisu, which he had conquered in battle for them. However, when the British limited his territory to a significantly smaller size and refused to recognize him as king as they had promised, Kakungulu began to distance himself from them. In 1913, he {{became a member of the}} Bamalaki sect, a sect which followed a belief system that combined elements of Christianity, Judaism and Christian Science, most notably, a refusal to use western medicine (based on a few sentences taken from the Old Testament). This led to conflict with the British when the Bamalaki refused to vaccinate their cattle. However, upon further study of the Bible, Kakungulu came to believe that the customs and laws described in the first 5 books of Moses (Torah) were <b>really</b> <b>true.</b> When, in 1919, Kakungulu insisted on circumcision as prescribed in the Old Testament, the Bamalaki refused and told him that, if he practised circumcision, he would be like the Jews. Kakungulu responded, [...] "Then, I am a Jew!" [...] He circumcised his sons and himself and declared that his community was Jewish. According to Henry Lubega, [...] "he fled to the foot of Mt. Elgon and settled in a place called Gangama where he started a separatist sect known as Kibina Kya Bayudaya Absesiga Katonda (the Community of Jews who trust in the Lord)." [...] The British were infuriated by this action and they effectively severed all ties with him and his followers.|$|E

Nancy discovers she is pregnant and suffers a pregnancy scare. Fox told an Inside Soap reported that if Nancy suffered a miscarriage the couple's relationship may not survive. Her portrayer explained that Nancy begins to suffer stomach pains and blood loss but believes going to the hospital will solve the problem. Fox said that Nancy is in [...] "quite a lot of pain and is really frightened" [...] and she [...] "knows that there's a real possibility she could lose the baby, but that's too awful for her to contemplate". Nancy suffers a miscarriage which Fox said is a [...] "really traumatic time" [...] for both Nancy and Darren.

The actress added that the miscarraige will [...] "be a really difficult thing for her to ever get over".
