60|$|I {{can best}} {{continue}} my record of Cicero's life {{for this and}} the two subsequent years by following his speeches and his letters. It was at this period the main object of his political life to reconcile {{the existence of a}} Cæsar with that of a Republic--two poles which could not by any means be brought together. Outside of his political life he carried on his profession as an advocate with all his former energy, with all his former bitterness, with all his old friendly zeal, but never, I think, with his former utility. His life with his friends and his family was prosperous; but that ambition to do some great thing for his country which might make his name more famous than that of other Romans was gradually fading, and, as it went, was leaving regrets and remorse behind which would not allow him to be a happy man. But it was now, when he had reached his fifty-second year, that he in truth began that career in literature which has made him second to no Roman in reputation. There are some early rhetorical essays, which were taken from the Greek, of doubtful authenticity; there are the few lines which are preserved of his poetry; there are the speeches which he wrote as well as spoke for the Rome of the day; and there are his letters, which up to this time had been intended only for his correspondents. All that we have from his pen up to this time has been preserved for us by the light of those great works which he now commenced. In this year, B.C. 55, there appeared the dialogue De Oratore, and in the next the treatise De <b>Republica.</b> <b>It</b> was his failure as a politician which in truth drove Cicero to the career of literature. As I intend to add to this second volume a few chapters as to his literary productions, I will only mention the dates on which these dialogues and treatises were given to the world as I go on with my work.|$|E

50|$|The first protest {{organized}} by Ni una menos {{was held in}} Recoleta, Buenos Aires on March 26, 2015, and consisted of a reading marathon, performance art and screenings; the catalyst of the event was the murder of Daiana García, found dead in a garbage bag on March 16. The movement became nationally recognized {{with the use of}} the hashtag #NiUnaMenos on social media, title under which massive demonstrations were held on June 3, 2015, having the Palace of the Argentine National Congress as a main meeting point. The protest was organized after the muder of 14-year-old Chiara Paez, found buried underneath her boyfriend's house on May 11, beaten to death and a few weeks pregnant. A viral phenomenon which extended to countries such as Uruguay, Chile and Mexico, it managed to congregate around 200,000 in Buenos Aires alone.

40|$|Here are {{introduced}} the main initiatives {{developed in the}} context of the Open Access Movement in Uruguay. The aim is to identify the tendencies in relation to the implementation of the two ways of open access (green way and golden way) at the Science and Technology National System. The opinions of the decision makers are also gathered, about the opportunities that open access offers and the need to implement public policies in that regard. A method is applied that includes bibliographic review, website consulting and interviews to qualified informants. The project originates from the research group “Studies on the Scientific Production”, which develops its activities {{in the context of}} the Programa de Desarrollo Académico de la Información y la Comunicación (PRODIC) at the Universidad de la <b>República</b> (UDELAR). <b>Its</b> purpose is to promote the cross-discipline and inter institutional spaces that analyze the open access issue {{in the context of the}} national general policies about information. At the moment, the group is carrying out the research and development project (R+D) “Institutional repository model as an alternative for the social, scientific and technologic country development”, funded by Scientific Research Sectorial Committee from UDELAR. The execution of the said project gave information about the situation regarding open access around government and education authorities, and decision makers. We identified and described the publications of the active researchers of the Researchers National System (SNI), with the aim of getting to know the different models of scientific communication in each knowledge area, and obtaining empiric elements to develop an institutional repository model according to its own special features. The aim is to contribute to the creation and implementation of national policies that motivate the green way as an alternative to guarantee the open access and the bibliographic control of the national scientific production. These lines of research were recently created and they will gradually become established. They are obtaining visibility in the different national areas and have installed this issue in the current discussion agenda. Consequently Uruguay is not out of date compared to the international context and is going forward in benefit of the scientific and technologic development. We hope that the research results will be reference elements for the creation of new policies of open access that can meet the country needs and be updated with the international tendencies...|$|R
5000|$|The 1970s {{continued}} bringing {{critical acclaim}} to Del Río Reyes' play-writing. El pulpo -Tragedia de los hermanos Kennedy- debuted in 1970 {{under the direction}} of Jorge Esma in the Teatro del Bosque in Mexico City. This documentary play about the controversy surrounding the deaths of John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy ended up winning the national prize Juan Ruíz de Alarcón for drama by the Asociación de Críticos de México. The commemorative plaque of its 100 stagings was revealed in the Teatro Reforma also in Mexico City, site to which it was moved after its inaugural season in the Teatro del Bosque. Her epic poem Trece Cielos, composed of alexandrine sonnets, won the national prize Olímpico in 1968 for poetry. However, in 1975, it is staged as a theatrical show by Joaquín Lanz in the Teatro de la Procaduría General de la <b>República</b> Mexicana. Later, <b>it</b> would be recorded on a disk commemorating the [...] "International Year of the Woman". Aside from her plays, Del Río Reyes' first novel Proceso a Faubritten was published in 1976. During this decade, she and her husband, Hermilo Novelo moved to Prague in 1972 upon being appointed as cultural attaché in the Mexican Embassy and remained there for five years. Between 1977 and 1979, Del Río Reyes was the head of Unidad de Relaciones Culturales Internacionales of the Ministry of Public Education in Mexico in which she created cultural projects such as the current Centro de Investigación y Documentación Teatral Rodolfo Usigli. In 1979, her diplomatic and civil servant activities continued as she was once again appointed to be the cultural attaché in the Mexican Embassy in Brussels. Although much of her time was consumed by her diplomatic obligations in the Mexican Embassy, the articles, poems and essays she managed to write in her free time ended up being published in European journals.|$|R
40|$|TCC(graduação) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. Centro de Ciências Jurídicas. Direito. A pesquisa tem como objeto o desenvolvimento do poder de polícia como instituto jurídico durante a Primeira República. As fontes trabalhadas serão as obras jus-administrativas da época. O aumento populacional, o fim da escravidão, a questão social e a reestruturação urbana foram alguns dos fatores que geravam instabilidade social e faziam com que as elites procurassem respostas para encerrá-los. A solução pela ação estatal não foi rara nesse contexto. Nas últimas três décadas, a historiografia brasileira comprovou o intervencionismo estatal do período por diversos exemplos (i. e. : a revolta da vacina; a repressão às greves em 1917 e 1919; o aumento no controle social de mendigos, menores e prostitutas; entre outros). Tais atividades, no entanto, precisavam de fundamentação jurídica. Esta veio, principalmente, por meio das fórmulas “poder de polícia”, “polícia administrativa” e (por vezes) “polícia”. A palavra, que tinha suas raízes no Antigo Regime, possuía: por um lado, um grau de indeterminação que permitia aos juristas da época moldá-la com facilidade; por outro, a potencialidade necessária para excetuar alguns limites do Estado de Direito. Com efeito, o instituto jurídico era útil como legitimação de uma intervenção “genérica”, servindo como válvula de escape para o liberalismo. The {{object of}} this {{research}} is the juridic figure of “police power” and how did the brazilian jurists of the “First Republic” (Primeira <b>República)</b> drew <b>it's</b> contours. It has been clear by the recent historic researchers {{that there has been a}} number of examples of state interventionism in this period (such as the “revolta da vacina”, the repression on the worker's strike in 1917 and 1919, the increase of social control on poors, etc.). All of these state actions demanded legal groundings. The formulas “police power” (poder de polícia), “polícia administrativa” and sometimes just “police” were used to rationalize in legal terms the state activity. Even though most still identifies the “First Republic” as the peak of liberalism in its classic form, the current work tries to demystify this understanding by showing the existence of non-liberal elements in the theories of the works which we will analyze. The authors of legal literature on administrative law were largely very critical of the presuppositions of the classic liberalism. Although it cannot be stated that they were pro-interventionism, since most of them still cared for liberal concepts in certain areas (such as the economy), it is clear that they do not buy the liberalism in its classic form. That is to say: they demanded interventionism, but not in all areas. The “police power” was the legal ground for this interventionism, mostly because of its generic and malleable form. Each author could use this legal argument as it pleased. That's why it was so convenient but at the same time problematic, because due to its undefined nature it was also not a strong and widely accepted legal argument...|$|R
