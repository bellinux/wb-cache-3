Some <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the poem was written with a specific incident in mind, the execution of one Private Flaxman of The Leicestershire Regiment, at Lucknow in 1887. A number of details of this execution correspond to the occasion described by Kipling in the poem, and he later used a story {{similar to that of}} Flaxman's as a basis for the story Black Jack.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that,</b> given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
5|$|Recent <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the {{explosive}} behavior of alkali metals in water {{is driven by}} a Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt {{as a part of}} the reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E

Many organization defined people as ‘resources’ and used the term ‘Human Resource Management’.

Thus, innovation may provide an important resource that contributes to firm success (Zahra et al. 2004).|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} obtain support from the Imperial Japanese Army for the Midway operation, the Imperial Japanese Navy agreed to support their {{invasion}} of the Aleutian Islands. The IJA wished to occupy the western Aleutians to place the Japanese home islands {{out of range of}} U.S. land-based bombers based in Alaska. The Japanese operations in the Aleutian Islands (Operation AL) removed yet more ships that could otherwise have augmented the force striking Midway. Whereas many earlier historical accounts considered the Aleutians operation as a feint to draw American forces away, early twenty-first century <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> AL was intended to be launched simultaneously with the attack on Midway. A one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's task force resulted in Operation AL beginning a day before the Midway attack.|$|E
5|$|Rima Hadley, a sinuous rille located {{west of the}} Apollo 15 landing site, {{begins in}} an area of low domes at an {{elongated}} crater, Běla, and runs on to the North along the Apennine Mountain Range. Some <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> both the rille and Běla are volcanic vents, and lava flows created the features. Another hypothesis suggests that the rille was originally an underground lava tube, the roof of which collapsed, creating the current appearance of the rille. Several large boulders, some of which are as large as houses, are strewn about the feature's floor. The elongated crater Běla, which forms the beginning of Rima Hadley, could have been formed by the collapse of a shallow magma chamber. Visual observation suggests that the same is the case with other lunar rilles with similar features at their beginnings.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the incline was powered by a water wheel, with the waste water running down the incline in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal.|$|E

25|$|Bone {{volume is}} {{determined}} by the rates of bone formation and bone resorption. Recent <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> certain growth factors may work to locally alter bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity. Numerous bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and classified via bone cultures. These factors include insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins. Evidence suggests that bone cells produce growth factors for extracellular storage in the bone matrix. The release of these growth factors from the bone matrix could cause the proliferation of osteoblast precursors. Essentially, bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local bone formation. <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> cancellous bone volume in postemenopausal osteoporosis may be determined by the relationship between the total bone forming surface and the percent of surface resorption.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> left dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} {{activation}} during a Stroop task is related to an individual's’ expectation regarding the conflicting nature of the upcoming trial, {{and not so much}} on the conflict itself.

25|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{spironolactone}} {{may be able}} {{to interfere}} with the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment. As the drug acts as an antimineralocorticoid, it is thought that it may reduce the effectiveness of certain antidepressants by interfering with normalization of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and increasing glucocorticoid levels. However, other research contradicts this hypothesis and has suggested that spironolactone may actually produce antidepressant-like effects in animals.|$|E

30|$|<b>Researches</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the “curse” {{happens when}} the {{resource}} countries {{do not have the}} capability to handle the huge resource revenue due to the low level of institutions. This helps to explain the strong contrast of the capital expenditure during the oil boom–bust cycle (Arezki and Ismail 2013), as it is easy for the government to increase its fiscal expenditure plan but hard to cut it back (Arezki and Bruckner 2010). Moreover, a general phenomenon is the scale of resource sectors is abnormally huge. This is usually related to “Dutch Disease,” which often results in over-valued domestic currencies, and the decline of other sectors like manufacture and agriculture (Kott 2012).|$|R
