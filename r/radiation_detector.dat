5|$|In March 1944, Wu {{joined the}} Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University. She lived in {{dormitory}} there, returning to Princeton on the weekends. The {{role of the}} SAM Laboratories, headed by Harold Urey, was to support the Manhattan Project's gaseous diffusion (K-25) program for uranium enrichment. Wu worked alongside James Rainwater in a group led by William W. Havens, Jr., whose task was to develop <b>radiation</b> <b>detector</b> instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} of the project {{included}} several elements such as a powerful main engine whose propellant was pressure fed, a computer and a unit to measure inertia {{in order to control}} maneuvers. In addition, a long and close range radar system was required to guide the satellite (the system was taken from the Westinghouse radar used in Bomarc surface-to-air missiles), as were lights to illuminate the other satellite, and four cameras for observation. A <b>radiation</b> <b>detector</b> was to be installed to determine if a satellite was carrying either a nuclear weapon or something whose power source involved a radioactive substance. Other sensors included infrared and gravimetric sensors to ascertain the mass of the other satellite, while defensive counter measures would be installed to identify decoys, booby traps, anti-jamming devices, and enemy attack, along with nitrogen cold gas thrusters for orientation.|$|E

25|$|The Geiger counter was the {{original}} <b>radiation</b> <b>detector,</b> recording the total count rate from all energy levels of radiation. Ionization chambers and Geiger counters were first adapted for field use in the 1930s. The first transportable Geiger–Müller counter (weighing 25kg) was constructed at the University of British Columbia in 1932. H.V. Ellsworth of the GSC built a lighter weight, more practical unit in 1934. Subsequent models were the principal instruments used for uranium prospecting for many years, until geiger counters were replaced by scintillation counters.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1928 that Geiger and Walther Müller (a PhD student of Geiger) {{developed}} the sealed Geiger-Müller tube which developed the basic ionization principles previously used experimentally. This was relatively small and rugged, and could not only detect alpha and beta radiation such as prior models but also gamma radiation. Now a practical radiation instrument could be produced relatively cheaply, and so the Geiger-Muller counter was born. As the tube output required little electronic processing, a distinct advantage in the thermionic valve era due to minimal valve count and low power consumption, the instrument achieved great popularity as a portable <b>radiation</b> <b>detector.</b>|$|E
25|$|CdTe doped with {{chlorine}} {{is used as}} a <b>radiation</b> <b>detector</b> for x-rays, gamma rays, beta {{particles and}} alpha particles. CdTe can operate at room temperature allowing the construction of compact detectors {{for a wide variety of}} applications in nuclear spectroscopy. The properties that make CdTe superior for the realization of high performance gamma- and x-ray detectors are high atomic number, large bandgap and high electron mobility ~1100cm2/V·s, which result in high intrinsic μτ (mobility-lifetime) product and therefore high degree of charge collection and excellent spectral resolution. Due to the poor charge transport properties of holes, ~100cm2/V·s, single-carrier-sensing detector geometries are used to produce high resolution spectroscopy; these include coplanar grids, frish-collar detectors and small pixel detectors.|$|E
25|$|Block 2 of the Ranger project {{launched}} three {{spacecraft to}} the Moon in 1962, carrying a TV camera, a <b>radiation</b> <b>detector,</b> and a seismometer {{in a separate}} capsule slowed by a rocket motor and packaged to survive its low-speed impact on the Moon’s surface. The three missions together demonstrated good performance of the Atlas/Agena B launch vehicle and {{the adequacy of the}} spacecraft design, but unfortunately not both on the same attempt. Ranger 3 had problems with both the launch vehicle and the spacecraft, missed the Moon by about 36,800km, and has orbited the Sun ever since. Ranger 4 had a perfect launch, but the spacecraft was completely disabled. The project team tracked the seismometer capsule to impact just out of sight on the lunar far side, validating the communications and navigation system. Ranger 5 missed the Moon and was disabled. No significant science information was gleaned from these missions. The craft weighed 331kg.|$|E

2500|$|Fermi's reactor {{group also}} left Columbia, as Arthur Compton {{consolidated}} the Manhattan Project's reactor {{project at the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. Those that remained at Columbia became the Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories, {{under the direction of}} Harold Urey, which was mainly concerned with isotope separation for uranium enrichment. Havens and Rainwater also devised a means of measuring residual hydrogen in fluorocarbons, a subject of great interest because uranium hexafluoride gas was being considered for use in isotope separation processes. [...] Havens, Rainwater and Chien-Shiung Wu worked on the development of <b>radiation</b> <b>detector</b> instrumentation, and studies of neutron cross sections using the neutron spectrometer. This included work with plutonium. After the war ended in August 1945, a dozen papers by Dunning, Havens, Rainwater and Wu would be declassified and published. This included his PhD thesis, and he was awarded his doctorate after it was published, along with Rainwater's, in the Physical Review in 1946.|$|E
2500|$|The Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), the {{outermost}} {{component of the}} inner detector, {{is a combination of}} a straw tracker and a transition <b>radiation</b> <b>detector.</b> The detecting elements are drift tubes (straws), each four millimetres in diameter and up to 144 centimetres long. [...] The uncertainty of track position measurements (position resolution) is about 200micrometres. This is not as precise as those for the other two detectors, but it was necessary to reduce the cost of covering a larger volume and to have transition radiation detection capability. [...] Each straw is filled with gas that becomes ionized when a charged particle passes through. [...] The straws are held at about −1,500V, driving the negative ions to a fine wire down the centre of each straw, producing a current pulse (signal) in the wire. [...] The wires with signals create a pattern of 'hit' straws that allow the path of the particle to be determined. [...] Between the straws, materials with widely varying indices of refraction cause ultra-relativistic charged particles to produce transition radiation and leave much stronger signals in some straws. [...] Xenon and argon gas is used {{to increase the number of}} straws with strong signals. [...] Since the amount of transition radiation is greatest for highly relativistic particles (those with a speed very near the speed of light), and because particles of a particular energy have a higher speed the lighter they are, particle paths with many very strong signals can be identified as belonging to the lightest charged particles: electrons and their antiparticles, positrons. The TRT has about 298,000 straws in total.|$|E
