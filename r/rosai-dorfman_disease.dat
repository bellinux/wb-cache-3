40|$|Objective: Histiocytosis is a {{systemic}} disease that usually affects {{the central nervous}} system. The {{aim of this study}} is to discuss the neuroimaging characteristics of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), the most common of these diseases; and the non-Langerhans cells histiocytosis (NLCH), which includes entities such as hemophagocytic syndrome, Erdheim-Chester and <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>diseases.</b> Method: Literature review and illustrative cases with pathologic confirmation. Results: In LCH, the most common findings are 1) osseous lesions in the craniofacial bones and/or skull base; 2) intracranial, extra-axial changes; 3) intra-axial parenchymal changes (white and gray matter); 4) atrophy. Among the NLCH, diagnosis usually requires correlation with clinical and laboratory criteria. The spectrum of presentation includes intraparenchymal involvement, meningeal lesions, orbits and paranasal sinus involvement. Conclusion: It is important the recognition of the most common imaging patterns, in order to include LCH and NLCH in the differential diagnosis, whenever pertinent...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a benign}} histiocytic proliferative {{disorder}} of unknown etiology. The disease mainly affects lymph node tissue, {{although it is}} rarely confined to the skin. Here, we describe a 53 -year-old woman with purely cutaneous <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease.</b> The patient presented with a large pigmented plaque on her left leg, and sparse erythematous papules {{on her face and}} arms. A complete clinical response was achieved with thalidomide, followed by recurrence at the initial site one year later. The histological examination displayed the typical features of <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> in the recent lesions but not in the older lesions. In the setting of no lymphadenopathy, the histopathological features of <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> are commonly misinterpreted. Therefore, awareness of the histological aspects present at different stages, not always featuring the hallmark microscopic signs of <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease,</b> is particularly important for a correct diagnosis of this rare disorder...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Cutaneous <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> is rare, {{and there}} is a lack of {{literature}} on clinical evidence for treatment options. The objective of this report is to illustrate that acitretin may be effective in treating cutaneous <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease.</b> Design: A patient with cutaneous <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> refractory to antibiotics, steroids, and surgical excision was treated with acitretin for a period of four months and was closely monitored for improvement in the lesion. Setting: This was a patient in the authors’ medical dermatology clinic. Participants: A single patient was involved. Results: The patient had continuous improvement in her cutaneous <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> throughout a four-month treatment course with softening of the plaque and decreased erythema. She chose to discontinue treatment after four months due to hair loss with acitretin. Conclusion: Cutaneous <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> is a rare, benign, generally self-limited, lymphoproliferative disease of unknown etiology. It typically occurs as histiocyte-rich inflammatory infiltrates, manifesting as red papules and plaques in older women, without predilection for site. Treatment is usually unnecessary, unless the lesions persist and are bothersome to the patient or cause functional deficits. Treatments are based on case reports and include surgery, radiation, and medical options. Our experience with a patient with a case of cutaneous <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> persisting after surgical excision demonstrates that acitretin may be an effective therapeutic option for cutaneous <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E

40|$|Sinus {{histiocytosis}} {{with massive}} lymphadenopathy (<b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease)</b> {{is a rare}} benign disease of unknown etiology presenting with massive lymphadenopathy. These cases can often be misdiagnosed as lymphoma. Hence, {{it is important to}} distinguish <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> from lymphoma and other causes of histiocytosis because of the different treatment modalities. We report here a case of Rosai-Dorfman presenting with massive bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. We conclude that fine needle aspiration cytology is a useful and reliable tool for the diagnosis of <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> due to which biopsy can be avoided in these patients, thus, reducing inconvenience to patients...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rosai–Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> is a rare, benign histiocytic proliferative {{disorder}} that commonly affects the lymph nodes.

The lesion exhibited an exuberant histiocytic and chronic fibroinflammatory process with focal emperipolesis within histiocytes.

40|$|Sinus {{histiocytosis}} {{with massive}} lymphadenopathy (<b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease)</b> is a rare, benign self-limiting condition of unknown etiology.

We herein report cytohistologic findings in a case of sole skeletal <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> in a 51 -year-old woman who presented with an expansile, heterogeneous lesion at T 11 with cord compression and edema. A CT-guided fine-needle aspiration of T- 11 lesion was performed and the sample was processed by ThinPrep technique. The ThinPrep smear showed characteristic features of <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> including hypercellularity with moderate number of histiocytes in a background of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. The histiocytes possessed abundant, pale and vacuolated cytoplasm, rounded nuclei with smooth nuclear membranes, fine chromatin, and distinct nucleoli.

40|$|Acute {{renal failure}} {{developed}} in a 57 -year-old woman who had <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosed 1 year previously on a cervical lymph node. Organ imaging showed diffuse masses infiltrating both kidneys. The renal biopsy showed a lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic process extensively replacing the parenchyma, which {{is in keeping with}} <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> of the kidneys. However, the typical lymphophagocytic cells were lacking. This case illustrates that diagnosis of <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease</b> in renal biopsy can be very difficult, requiring both exclusion of many benign and malignant lesions and a high index of suspicion for this condition. In particular, lymphoma was excluded based on the mixed polyclonal composition of inflammatory cells and the absence of atypical lymphoid proliferation. The renal function partially recovered after a course of therapy combining VP- 16 (etoposide) and dexamethasone and remained stable over 4 -year follow-up.

An initial diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma was made. An excisional biopsy of the cervical lymph node was undertaken and the histology showed massive histiocytosis with emperipolesis, which confirmed the diagnosis of <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Rosai-Dorfman</b> <b>disease,</b> although a rare clinical entity, should be suspected in patients presenting with massive lymphadenopathy located especially in the neck and groin regions...|$|E
