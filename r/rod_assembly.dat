2500|$|In {{order to}} ensure the locomotive's ability to {{reliably}} keep to the timetable, a number of notable design changes were made. These included {{the replacement of the}} original single blastpipe with dual Lempor ejectors, conversion to oil firing, fitting of power reverse, and the addition of a diesel control stand to allow for multiple unit operation with diesel electric locomotives where required. R711 entered service on regular trains on 21 November 1998, and design refinements based on its performance in service were made to the subsequent conversion of R766. For a number of years, the modified R class locomotives could be seen in regular operation between Melbourne and Warrnambool, keeping a fast 3 hour 13 minute schedule which included six stops along the [...] route. In 2001, locomotive R766 suffered a mechanical failure of its connecting <b>rod</b> <b>assembly</b> while running at [...] The connecting rod became detached at one end and dug into the trackbed, although the locomotive was not derailed.|$|E

Taipower later replaced all hafnium-containing rods with a different alloy to resolve the issue.|$|E

Build-ing on these observations, we propose a collision response algo-rithm that adapts its degree of nonlinearity.

The prompt γ current of self-powered detector is ignored normally due to its weakness compared with the delayed β current, although it promptly reflects the flux change of the core.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} the room temperature ductility behavior of irradiated Zircaloy- 4 nuclear fuel cladding has been developed and applied to evaluate tensile hoop strength of material irradiated to different levels. The test utilizes a polyurethane plug fitted within a tubular cladding specimen. A cylindrical punch is used to compress the plug axially, which generates a radial displacement that acts upon the inner diameter of the specimen. Position sensors track the radial displacement of the specimen outer diameter as the compression proceeds. These measurements coupled with ram force data provide a load-displacement characterization of the cladding response to internal pressurization. The development of this simple, cost-effective, highly reproducible test for evaluating tensile hoop strain {{as a function of}} internal pressure for irradiated specimens represents a significant advance in the mechanical characterization of irradiated cladding. In this project, nuclear fuel <b>rod</b> <b>assemblies</b> using Zircaloy- 4 cladding and two types of mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel pellets were irradiated to varying levels of burnup. Fuel pellets were manufactured with and without thermally induced gallium removal (TIGR) processing. Fuel pellets manufactured by both methods were contained in fuel <b>rod</b> <b>assemblies</b> and irradiated to burnup levels of 9, 21, 30, 40, and 50 GWd/MT. These levels of fuel burnup correspond to fast (E > 1 MeV) fluences of 0. 27, 0. 68, 0. 98, 1. 4 and 1. 7 1021 neutrons/cm 2, respectively. Following irradiation, fuel <b>rod</b> <b>assemblies</b> were disassembled; fuel pellets were removed from the cladding; and the inner diameter of cladding was cleaned to remove residue materials. Tensile hoop strength of this cladding material was tested using the newly developed method. Unirradiated Zircaloy- 4 cladding was also tested. With the goal of determining the effect of the two fuel types and different neutron fluences on clad ductility, tensile hoop strength tests were performed on cladding for these varying conditions. Experimental data revealed negligible performance differences for cladding containing TIGR vs non-TIGR processed fuel pellets. Irradiation hardening was observed in tensile hoop data as the strength of the cladding increased with increasing neutron dose and appeared to saturate for a fast fluence of 1. 7 1021 neutrons/cm 2...|$|R
2500|$|In {{this type}} of engine, the {{cylinders}} are located directly above the crankshaft, with the piston rod/connecting <b>rod</b> <b>assemblies</b> forming {{a more or less}} straight line between the two.

Also the RBMK power stations were constructed without containment structures on grounds of cost as well as the relative ease of re-fueling. (Fuel elements in an RBMK can be replaced while the reactor is running at its nominal output, allowing the continuous operation and plutonium extraction compared to pressurized water reactors like the VVER which need to be shut down to exchange fuel <b>rod</b> <b>assemblies.)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} gas-operated firearms, direct impingement does {{away with}} a separate gas cylinder, piston, and operating <b>rod</b> <b>assembly.</b> High-pressure gas acts directly upon the bolt and carrier thereby saving weight, lowering costs, and reducing {{the mass of the}} operating parts, and thereby the wear on mechanical parts due to movement. By removing the gas piston, the potential amount of moving mass is lowered, thus decreasing the potential for a disrupted sight picture, as caused by the mass of the piston adding to the disruptive mass.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a {{conventional}} engine where the {{centerline of the}} cylinder bore is in perfect vertical alignment with the rotating axis of the crankshaft, the Kappa’s centerline is offset by a small distance. This offset minimizes the lateral force created by the rotating piston & <b>rod</b> <b>assembly</b> (known, and audible, as [...] "piston slap" [...] at its extreme). The net effect is an improvement in fuel consumption {{and a reduction in}} noise, vibration and harshness - it should also help with engine longevity since reduced lateral force will equal reduced bore wear.|$|E
50|$|The {{prime mover}} runs {{a set of}} pulleys to the transmission, often a double-reduction gearbox, which drives a pair of cranks, {{generally}} with counterweights installed on them to assist the motor in lifting the heavy <b>rod</b> <b>assembly.</b> The cranks raise and lower one end of an I-beam which is free to move on an A-frame. On {{the other end of}} the beam is a curved metal box called a horse head or donkey head, so named due to its appearance. A cable made of steel—occasionally, fibreglass—called a bridle, connects the horse head to the polished rod, a piston that passes through the stuffing box.|$|E
50|$|The Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE) was an {{experimental}} nuclear reactor which operated from 1957 to 1964. On July 12, 1957, its {{electrical generating system}} produced the first electricity generated from a nuclear power system to supply a commercial power grid in the United States by powering homes in the nearby city of Moorpark. In July 1959, the narrow internal cooling channels within the reactor fuel <b>rod</b> <b>assemblies</b> became obstructed by an unintended byproduct-produced organic contaminant, causing 13 of 43 reactor fuel elements to partially melt in an incident. Atomics International personnel repaired the reactor, which was restarted in September 1960 and operated with minor incidents until 1964.|$|R
50|$|The {{cleaning}} {{system had}} been installed to remove dirt and corrosion from fuel elements and control rods during shutdown, as there {{had previously been}} problems with magnetite corrosion products from the steam generators being deposited on the fuel elements which affected the flow of coolant. The sixth set of thirty partially spent elements were in the tank having been cleaned, the cleaning having finished at 16:00. At 21:50, radiation alarms mounted on the cleaning system detected a sudden increase {{in the amount of}} krypton-85. The suspicion was that one of the fuel <b>rod</b> <b>assemblies</b> was leaking. At 22:30, the reactor hall was evacuated because of elevated radiation levels both there and in the ventilation stack.|$|R
50|$|Control rods {{are usually}} {{combined}} into control <b>rod</b> <b>assemblies</b> — typically 20 rods {{for a commercial}} pressurized water reactor assembly — and inserted into guide tubes within a fuel element. A control rod is removed from or inserted into the central core of a nuclear reactor {{in order to control}} the number of neutrons which will split further uranium atoms. This in turn affects the thermal power of the reactor, the amount of steam generated, and hence the electricity produced. The control rods are partially removed from the core to allow a chain reaction to occur. The number of control rods inserted and the distance by which they are inserted can be varied to control the reactivity of the reactor.|$|R
