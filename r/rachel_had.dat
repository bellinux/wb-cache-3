5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Now in a {{committed}} relationship, Rachel and Adam begin trying for a baby. The storyline was devised because Harries wanted Cold Feet to reflect relevant issues in contemporary society; {{in vitro fertilisation}} featured heavily in the news during 2000, and Harries felt that incorporating it into the series would help {{to raise awareness of}} it, as well as provide fodder for the characters' story arcs. Rachel's intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment incorporated aspects of the real life IVF treatment experienced by Harries and his wife Rebecca Frayn, and eminent fertility scientist Sammy Lee was consulted extensively throughout the development of the plot. After spending several thousand pounds on IVF treatment, Rachel's doctor informs her that she is infertile due to Asherman's syndrome, most likely caused by her abortion. Despite being unable to have children naturally, Rachel and Adam are determined to continue their relationship; Adam proposes to her and they are married in a civil ceremony in Series 3, Episode 8. In the same episode, she is reunited with her estranged parents, Brian and Mary (Paul Ridley and Sue Holderness). Before the episode, <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> not spoken to them for years; her father because of his bigotry and abuse of her mother, and her mother for staying with him. She refuses to allow Paul to give her away, and instead asks David to, despite learning that he has been having an extra-marital affair. At the reception, she inadvertently reveals to her parents that her sister, their other daughter Lucy, has come out as a lesbian.|$|E
25|$|After Rachel was fired, Paul and Saira {{were warned}} by Sir Alan about their conduct and {{repeated}} arguments, {{particularly when they}} briefly argued in the boardroom over a fact that he dismissed as being irrelevant for discussion, before deciding to separate them for the next task. Before leaving, Saira was seen in tears, mainly because she was upset that <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> been fired instead of Paul.|$|E

25|$|In Mac's will, Iris, Amanda, and <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> {{all been}} left equal shares of Cory Publishing. Rachel {{attempted}} {{to head the}} company and counter Iris's continued interference. When the vote for CEO came down, Rachel and Iris were tied. Vicky offered to use her shares to vote for Rachel if she was given custody of Steven, but Rachel turned her down. In an unforgettable moment, Vicky walked into the Cory Publishing boardroom and, {{to get back at}} Rachel for rejecting her blackmail, broke the tie by voting for Iris.|$|E
5000|$|At times, <b>Rachel</b> <b>has</b> {{been shown}} to learn new skills {{extremely}} quickly. For example, she mastered a set of [...] "demon ninja" [...] sword skills simply by watching her teammate Shadowcat perform them. Along with sword fighting, <b>Rachel</b> <b>has</b> experience in lock-picking, vehicular repair (such as engines), and use of advanced technology and weaponry. However, these abilities have not been evident in her more recent appearances.|$|R

25|$|After Joseph's birth, Jacob {{decided to}} return to the land of Canaan with his family. Fearing that Laban would deter him, he fled with his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and twelve {{children}} without informing his father-in-law. Laban pursued him and accused him of stealing his idols. Indeed, <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> taken her father's idols, hidden them inside her camel's seat cushion, and sat upon them. Laban had neglected to give his daughters their inheritance (Gen 31:14–16). Rachel becomes a trickster like her father, her aunt (Rebekah), and her husband.|$|E
25|$|Mac and <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> {{their own}} marital troubles, mostly {{regarding}} Rachel's decision to work full-time as a sculptress. Mac became close with {{the editor of}} Brava magazine (a part of Cory Publishing), Janice Frame (Christine Jones), who was also Steve's sister. Rachel and Mac began fighting regularly, which eventually led to a divorce. Janice and Mac married, but she only wanted him for his money. Janice {{was having an affair}} with photographer and owner of a popular local discotheque, Mitch Blake (William Gray Espy), and the two plotted to kill Mac and acquire his estate.|$|E
25|$|According to {{classical}} rabbinical sources, Benjamin was only born after <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> fasted {{for a long}} time, as a religious devotion {{with the hope of}} a new child as a reward. By then Jacob had become over 100 years old. Benjamin is treated as a young child in most of the Biblical narrative, but at one point is abruptly described as the father of ten sons. Textual scholars believe that this {{is the result of the}} genealogical passage, in which his children are named, being from a much later source than the Jahwist and Elohist narratives, which make up most of the Joseph narrative, and which consistently describe Benjamin as a child.|$|E

25|$|Jackson {{moved to}} the {{frontier}} town of Nashville in 1788, where he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockly Donelson, the widow of John Donelson. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter, Rachel Donelson Robards. At the time, the younger Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards; he was subject to fits of jealous rage. The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. However, the divorce had never been completed, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794. To complicate matters further, evidence shows that <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made. It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, {{as long as they}} were recognized by the community.|$|E

She praised Salling's [...] "Only the Good Die Young", which was selected by Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post as the best performance of the episode, for being the most in-keeping with Glee usual tone. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand", writing that, [...] "the Beatles' coy flirtation is replaced with a simple, wistful plea that hits just the right note." [...] She commended Riley's vocals on [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", commenting that Murphy should assign Mercedes more solo performances. Futterman criticized [...] "Losing My Religion", however, observing that Monteith struggled to reach the notes, resulting in a performance [...] "more awkward than inspired." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{episodes of}} Cold Feet were shot on film stock on {{locations}} {{in and around}} Greater Manchester. Sets were designed by Chris Truelove to reflect the characters; Karen and David's home {{was designed as a}} spacious detached house intended to be located in Bowdon, while Pete and Jenny and Adam and <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> smaller middle-class abodes intended to be located in Didsbury. All exteriors of the characters' houses were shot on location. Christine Langan was keen to avoid a generic sitcom style of filming, citing the formulae of such programmes as [...] "tired and dreary" [...] and lacking emotional depth. To achieve this goal, she and Harries recruited directors with little background in television. These included Nigel Cole, who came from an advertising background and was keen to use the two episodes of the first series he was allotted to [...] "make his mark" [...] and establish himself as a good television director. Other directors included Mark Mylod, Tom Hooper, Tom Vaughan, Pete Travis, Jon Jones, Ciaran Donnelly and Tim Sullivan.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{retrospective}} of both Rachel and of Baxendale's performance when the series ended. In the New Statesman, Andrew Billen wrote that Rachel [...] "was as near to a sex symbol as this comedy drama about six cold-footed yuppies produced. She was also materialistic, unfaithful, self-absorbed, tricky {{and had not}} the first clue about men [...] Yet her death, caused by a moment of carelessness behind the wheel, was powerful and shocking, {{a tribute to the}} extent to which we have invested and believed in her." [...] Observer critic Kathryn Flett noted that Baxendale's high-profile role in Friends made her the [...] "star" [...] of Cold Feet in the first series, but both she and <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> been [...] "eclipsed" [...] by the other actors and characters by the time of the final series. Spectator critic Simon Hoggart wrote, [...] "I wasn't as sorry about poor old Rachel as I should have been. It was one of those deaths which makes you think, 'Oh, her poor baby boy,' rather than 'Goodness, how we'll miss her.'" [...] Hoggart attributed his ambivalence to Baxendale's portrayal of the character as a [...] "fraught, snippy" [...] woman. Matt Greenhalgh, who co-wrote the episode featuring Rachel's death, called killing off the character [...] "a privilege".|$|E

500|$|The plot of Rachel's {{infertility}} was analysed on {{an episode}} of BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. Ann Furedi of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which had supplied information to the writing team during the research stages, stated that {{there had not been}} a recorded case of Asherman's syndrome in the United Kingdom since the second world war. Further to that, she stated that the consensus among medical groups was that there was no real direct link between abortions and infertility; rather an untreated infection could increase the chances of fertility problems if it interfered with an abortion. Christine Geraghty, then senior lecturer in film and TV at Goldsmith's College, countered that the factual accuracy of the storyline depended on how the producers wanted to portray the issue to viewers. Her opinion was backed up by an ITV statement, which said that [...] "stories for Cold Feet are not just chosen in order to make people aware of the issues involved; they're also chosen for their dramatic potential and relevance to modern living". Woman's Hour presenter Jenni Murray developed the discussion in an article for The Guardian; she mentioned that no impression was given that <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> suffered an incorrectly performed operation or had had to travel to eastern Europe for it, and that it was improbable that Rachel managed to conceive a child after all.|$|E
500|$|Rachel's {{problem with}} {{conception}} is soon diagnosed as being due to [...] "partial Asherman's syndrome", a storyline {{that runs through}} Series 3 and 4. The plot was analysed on an episode of BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. Ann Furedi of BPAS, which had supplied information to the writing team during the research stages, stated that {{there had not been}} a recorded case of Asherman's syndrome in the United Kingdom since the Second World War.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{reaction from}} newspaper critics. In the Liverpool Echo, Rachael Tinniswood {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "was a fantastic display of everything that has made Cold Feet such a popular drama {{over the past few}} years" [...] and that Kimberley Joseph had proved to be [...] "a more than adequate replacement" [...] for Fay Ripley {{over the course of the}} fourth series. Tony Purnell wrote in the Daily Mirror that [...] "The fact that the gang ended up in Australia showed just how much the series had lost its way." [...] Graham Young in the Birmingham Mail wrote that the excursion to Sydney [...] "smacks more of giving the cast a treat after four years, rather than any real necessity of the script". The Daily Records critic wrote [...] "if this is the last-ever episode, we should make the most of what has been a relatively disappointing series". In a column about Chewin' the Fat, Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the episode—"which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot"—of being the point the series jumped the shark. Times columnist Caitlin Moran described it as [...] "both draining and tensifying". Moran went on to say that Adam and <b>Rachel</b> <b>had</b> become poorly characterised and suggested that Mike Bullen had come to loathe the characters. The episode was selected as a [...] "pick of the day" [...] in The Sun and The Sunday Times. Writing in the Journal of British Cinema and Television in 2006, Greg M. Smith analysed the development of the David character over the course of Series 4, including the fantasy scene in this episode where David imagines living with Karen in Australia, and the scene where David and Karen take off their wedding rings: [...] "Old, exhausted love is traded for new, vibrant love in this single gesture. Karen pursues David as he storms off after the ceremony, shouting his name, undoubtedly ready to alternate once more between pain and partial forgiveness, as they have done throughout their marriage. David turns and says: 'No, Karen. No more'." [...] Smith also compared the scene to the wedding scene in the film The Best Years of Our Lives (William Wyler, 1946).|$|E
