40|$|Rajegwesi tourism area {{is one of}} the {{significant}} tourism areas in Meru Betiri National Park, East Java, Indonesia. The area rich in term of biodiversity which are potential for developed as natural tourism attraction. Â The aim {{of this study is to}} identify snakes species diversity and its distribution in Rajegwesi tourism area. Field survey was done in Rajegwesi area, namely swamps forest, residential area, rice fields, agriculture area (babatan), resort area, and Plengkang cliff. This study found some snakes, encompasses Colubridae (10 species), Elapidae (four species), and Phytonidae (one species). There are Burmese Python (Python reticulatus), Red-necked Keelback (Rhabdophis subminiatus), Painted Bronzeback Snake (Dendrelaphis Pictus), Black Copper Rat Snake (Coelognathus flavolineatus), <b>Radiated</b> <b>Rat</b> <b>Snake</b> (C. radiatus), Striped Keelback (Xenochrophis vittatus), Checkered Keelback (X. piscator), Spotted Ground Snake (Gongyosoma balioderius), Gold-ringed Cat Snake (Boiga dendrophila), Common Wolf Snake (Lycodon capucinus), Banded Wolf snake (L. subcinctus), Cobra (Naja sputatrix), King Cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), Malayan Krait (Bungarus candidus), and Banded Krait (B. fasciatus) was found.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{following}} snakes {{were located}} and acquired: two albino black rat snakes; one xanthlc black <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> one hypoplgmented black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> with phenotype not previ-ously described; one leucistic Texas <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> one F, wild-type black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> heterozy-gous for albinism, and one male and two female F ^ wild-type Texas <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> heterozy-gous for albinism. Between 1975 and 1983 these snakes {{were subjected to}} various breed-ing combinations to determine their genetics. The results of 29 matings are summarized. All of the aberrant phenotypes {{were found to be}} autosomal recessive mutations. Allellc and nonallellc forms of albinism were found to exist in the black <b>rat</b> <b>snake.</b> The xanthlc form of hypopigmentatlon was found to be tyroslnase-positive partial albinism. Leucism In the Texas <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> appears to be associated with bilateral exophthalmos in some in-stances. The previously undescribed black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> phenotype was designated "brlndle" because of its appearance. It appears to be a genetically determined alteration In the quantity or quality of pigment, or both, and it does not undergo ontogenetic loss of pattern. It is not a form of tyrosinase-positive albinism analogous to the xanthlc phenotype.

50|$|Most of the Elaphe {{start their}} {{hibernation}} in October and emerge {{again the next}} Spring. The length of the hibernation period varies among species. Elaphe longissima, or Aesculapian snake, may hibernate {{for as long as}} from October to next May as it is among the northernmost occurring <b>rat</b> <b>snakes.</b> However, Elaphe bimaculata, or the twin-spotted <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> only need to hibernate for 2 to 3 months.Interestingly, species like black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta, like to hibernate with other <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and/or many other snake species, most notably timber rattlesnakes, racers, and bull snakes.|$|R

50|$|Though beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> are {{typically}} in less accessible caves, the top predators of these serpents are birds and mammals. Currently, {{there is no}} specific information of the predators of beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> available.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rat</b> <b>snakes</b> {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to predators as juveniles. Predators of P. alleghaniensis include hawks (Buteo spp.), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), foxes, raccoons, and domestic cats. Adult eastern <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> have few known predators other than humans. When frightened, a <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> will freeze. If harassed, it will produce a foul-smelling musk to deter predators. If provoked further, it may coil, shake its tail, and snap at its attacker.|$|R
50|$|Predators {{of adult}} red-bellied {{woodpeckers}} include {{birds of prey}} such as sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper's hawks, black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and house cats. Known predators of nestlings and eggs include red-headed woodpeckers, owls, pileated woodpeckers, gray <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes.</b> When approached by a predator, red-bellied woodpeckers either hide from the predator, or harass it with alarm calls. They defend their nests and young aggressively, and may directly attack predators that come near the nest.|$|R
5000|$|Euprepiophis conspicillatus, {{commonly}} known as the Japanese forest <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> is a species of nonvenomous colubrid snake endemic to Japan. Its Japanese common name, jimuguri, roughly translates to [...] "the burrower". It is closely related to Euprepiophis mandarinus, the Mandarin <b>rat</b> <b>snake.</b>|$|R
50|$|Relatively small, {{the beauty}} <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> {{typically}} feeds on ground rodents such as mice and, {{due to the}} snake's climbing abilities, even bats that are roosting within the caves they share. In addition to small mammals, beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> have also been known to eat birds and bird eggs occasionally. As constrictors, this species uses heat receptors to find prey by sensing the prey's body heat. Further information on hunting habits of the beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> is not currently available.|$|R

50|$|Japan {{has about}} 73 species of reptile of which nearly half are endemic. Sea turtles and highly venomous but non-aggressive sea snakes {{including}} the black-banded sea krait occur in warmer waters around southern Japan. Venomous snakes include the mildly venomous tiger keelback, {{and the more}} venomous front fanged vipers the elegant pit viper, Okinawa habu, Tokara habu, hime habu and the mamushi. Many pitviper species, known as habus throughout Japan are endemic to islands in the warmer Ryukyu Island chain however the mamushi (Gloydius blomhoffii) is found on the main islands. Non-venomous <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> found in Japan are the endemic Japanese <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> Japanese forest <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> Japanese four-lined <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> and the king <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> and beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> (subspecies Orthriophis taeniurus schmackeri) which in Japan are found only in the warm Ryukyu islands but have much wider distributions on mainland Asia. Three species of odd-scaled snakes {{are present in the}} southern islands including the Formosan odd-scaled snake, Japanese odd-scaled snake, and the Amami odd-scaled snake. Lizards include many endemic skink species (especially in the southern islands), the viviparous lizard (found as far north as the island of Hokkaido), and the Okinawa climbing lizard (Japalura polygonata). Freshwater turtles found in Japan include the endemic Japanese pond turtle, Ryukyu black-breasted leaf turtle. The Chinese box turtle is found only on the southernmost islands of Iriomote and Ishigaki in its Japanese range.|$|R
