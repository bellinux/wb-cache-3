40|$|The new European Reform Treaty, {{which was}} agreed {{politically}} in 2007, includes a separate protocol which allows European member states considerable freedom {{to organize and}} run their social amenities - including social housing.

40|$|Many {{companies}} consider {{investments in}} complaint handling as means of increasing customer commitment and building customer loyalty. Firms {{are not well}} informed, however, {{on how to deal}} successfully with service failures or the impact of complaint handling strategies. In this study, the authors find that a majority of complaining customers were dissatisfied with <b>recent</b> <b>complaint</b> handling experiences. Using justice theory, the authors also demonstrate that customers evaluate complaint incidents in terms of the outcomes they receive, the procedures used to arrive at the outcomes, {{and the nature of the}} interpersonal treatment during the process. In turn, the authors develop and test competing hypotheses regarding the interplay between satisfaction with complaint handling and prior experi-ence in shaping customer trust and commitment. The results support a quasi "brand equity " perspective—whereas satisfaction with complaint handling has a direct impact on trust and commitment, prior positive experiences miti-gate, to a limited extent, the effects of poor complaint handling. Implications for managers and scholars are discussed. Considerable evidence indicates tbat recovering effec-tively from service failures contributes to customerevaluations of firtns.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Myofascial pain may be {{considered}} one of the most common clinical findings in patients with neck pain (NP). Motor aspects of myofascial pain include disturbed motor function and muscle weakness secondary to motor inhibition, muscle stiffness, and restricted range of motion (ROM). Currently, it is unclear which interventions may have the greatest immediate impact on pressure pain sensitivity and ROM. Several studies have demonstrated improved pressure pain thresholds (PPT) after cervical manipulation; however, it is not clear if manipulation targeted to the cervicothoracic (CT) junction will have a similar effect. Others recommend stretching as a method to reduce muscle soreness; however, the immediate effects of passive stretching to the upper trapezius on PPT and ROM have not been studied. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the influence of CT manipulation and passive stretching to the upper trapezius on PPT and ROM in individuals without <b>recent</b> <b>complaint</b> of NP. Subjects: Ninety (90) subjects without current complaint of NP were enrolled into the study. Methods: PPT was assessed on both the right and left upper trapezius musculature. Cervical range of motion (CROM) was assessed in the frontal, sagittal, and transverse planes. Subjects were randomized into one of three groups for intervention (CT manipulation, passive upper trapezius stretching, or control). CROM was reassessed immediately after the intervention. PPT levels were reassessed at 5 and 10 minutes post intervention by a blinded examiner. Mean and standard deviations for PPT and ROM were calculated. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA was used to assess within group (pre- and post- treatment) differences as well as difference among treatment conditions (Control, CT Manip, and Stretch groups). Post-hoc one-way ANOVA tests were used to examine the effects of group assignment/time points in the event of significant interactions between time and group assignment. Statistical significant was set at p 3 ̆c 0. 05. Results: The two-way ANOVA test showed that there was a significant interaction between time and group assignment for CROM in the sagittal and transverse planes, however the post-hoc comparisons did not reveal a significant difference among 3 treatment group or among 3 time points. ANOVA also showed that there was not a difference in frontal plane CROM between time and group assignment. Similarly, although the two-way ANOVA test revealed a significant interaction between time and group assignment for PPT, post-hoc analyses showed that there was no difference between the 3 groups or among 3 time points for either side of the upper trapezius. Discussion: No significant difference in any plane of motion CROM or PPT pre-treatment to post-treatment between treatment groups brings into question the cause of the improved measures with time. Trends found with increased CROM and PPT over time are clouded by increased measures in the control group. The need for further research exists to better understand the relationship between CT manipulation and upper trapezius stretching and their effects on pain pressure thresholds and CROM. Conclusion: Upper trapezius stretching and CT manipulation may both be viable options for treatment by improving CROM and increasing PPT. Further high powered studies focusing on reducing the learning effects between measures and lowering participant uneasiness with research methods could produce clearer results...|$|E

Methods Two cross sectional adult total population health surveys from Central Norwegian (the Nord-Trøndelag Health Studies (HUNT)). In 1997 42, 277 and in 2008 50, 713 respondents were included. Variables included demographics (age, education, working status), lifestyle (daily smoker, did hard physical activities), health status (self-rated health status, <b>recent</b> <b>complaints,</b> chronic complaints, psychiatric complaints, a range of diseases) and health care use (visit general practitioner, chiropractor). A test of difference between the results of multivariable logistic regression models for each year, including all variables, was used to analyse changes from 1997 to 2008. Results In 1997 9. 4 % (95 %CI 9. 1 - 9. 6) of the population had visited a CAM practitioner in the last 12 months and this increased to 12. 6 % (12. 3 - 12. 9) in 2008 (p Conclusion The increase in visits was mainly among younger people of both genders with more limited complaints.

40|$|A {{conservation}} planning {{study in}} Papua New Guinea (PNG) addresses {{the role of}} biodiversity surrogates and biodiversity targets, {{in the context of}} the trade-offs required for planning given real-world costs and constraints. In a trade-offs framework, surrogates must be judged in terms of their success in predicting general biodiversity complementarity values - the amount of additional biodiversity an area can contribute to a protected set. Wrong predictions of low complementarity (and consequent allocation of non-protective land uses) may be more worrisome than wrong predictions of high complementarity (and consequent allocation of protection, perhaps unnecessarily forgoing other land uses benefiting society). Trade-offs and targets work well when predictions of complementarity are based on surrogate information that is expressed as a continuum of variation. The PNG study used hierarchical variation for environmental domains and vegetation types, and a nominated target then dictated the level within those hierarchies that was used. Internationally-promoted targets provide a potential basis for comparative evaluation of biodiversity protection levels among countries or regions. However, conventional application of percentage targets, in focusing on proportions of local area or on proportions of habitat types, does not serve the goal of biodiversity protection or sustainability well because targets can be miss-used to restrict the amount of biodiversity protected. At the same time, <b>recent</b> <b>complaints</b> about percentage targets are equally misguided in claiming. based on species-area curves, that 10...|$|R

The most notable example of this is the treatment of the main death and thrash metal bands on Roadrunner's roster throughout the 90s including Obituary, Deicide, Death, Gorguts and Pestilence who were either dropped or left the label after ill treatment. One of the earliest names on the label, King Diamond (who was originally signed to then-Roadracer with Mercyful Fate) before embarking his solo act), left the label due to alleged lack of promotional support for the 1990 King Diamond release, The Eye. Type O Negative left Roadrunner in 2006 following a dispute over the label releasing a [...] "hits" [...] compilation, The Best of Type O Negative, without prior notification to the band, which led them to accept a more appealing offer from SPV Records.
