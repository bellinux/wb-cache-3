500|$|Tricky {{eventually}} grew {{frustrated with}} {{his role in}} Massive Attack, finding it limiting, and wanted to record an album with a female vocalist whose singing would offer another dimension to his lyrics and their meaning. In 1993, he discovered Martina Topley-Bird, then a teenager at Clifton College, {{when he saw her}} sitting against a wall near his house, singing to herself. [...] "That's <b>really</b> <b>how</b> it happened," [...] she recalled. [...] "A few weeks later, I went around to his house with some friends. We'd been drinking cider after our GCSEs. We were banging on his door, but he wasn't in. Then Mark Stewart, who lived there, came up to us and said: 'Yeah, this is Tricky's house, jump in through the window.'" [...] Tricky, whose lyrics had matured from raps about street violence and sex to more personal and introspective writing, said Topley-Bird found his songs [...] "quite depressing", which he believed was because of her more privileged background: [...] "It's just reality. She's been a student all her life, grew up in Somerset, and I don't think she's ever faced the real world. She finds it all a bit weird. But she's my best mate." [...] They would form a musical and romantic partnership over subsequent years, and their first recording together, [...] "Aftermath", later appeared on Maxinquaye. After offering the song to Massive Attack, who were not interested in including it on their 1991 album Blue Lines, Tricky released [...] "Aftermath" [...] independently to local record stores in September 1993 before he signed a record deal with 4th & B'way.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{her first}} name is Kate, she chooses to go by KT, saying [...] " [...] just {{makes me think of}} a buxom lass baking bread for her man working in the fields. I have no problem with that, but it's just not <b>really</b> <b>how</b> I pictured being a rock star." [...] Also, Tunstall spells {{her first name}} KT (as opposed to Katie) to {{differentiate}} herself from fellow singer Katie Melua. She also asserted that she derived [...] "KT" [...] from K-T impact, the name of a geological event that caused extinction of dinosaurs.|$|E
2500|$|This apprenticeship... {{became a}} part of [...] how things were recorded. I started to learn {{microphone}} placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room... And so bit by bit I was learning <b>really</b> <b>how</b> not to record.|$|E

2500|$|Milton Caniff offered another anecdote (from Phi Beta Pogo, 1989) {{involving}} Capp and Walt Kelly, [...] "two {{boys from}} Bridgeport, Connecticut, nose to nose," [...] onstage {{at a meeting}} of the Newspaper Comics Council in the sixties. [...] "Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is <b>really</b> <b>how</b> you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only showing you this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing his version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Publishers Weekly wrote a {{book review}} for Why We Want You to be Rich, commenting, [...] "if it's not exactly Kierkegaardian in scope or language, this {{collaboration}} of real estate magnate and rags-to-riches financial guru manages to entertain and to inform." [...] Publishers wrote, [...] "Trump and Kiyosaki ... together are a strangely winning combination". The review concluded, [...] "Bottom line: these Messrs. Money-bags know their business. We're talking billionaires here, and <b>really,</b> <b>how</b> can you argue with success?" [...] Kiplinger's Personal Finance gave the work a critical book review writing, [...] "unimpressive book. Why We Want You to Be Rich is a thinly veiled infomercial for more financial-advice products from Kiyosaki, Trump and their minions." [...] The review noted, [...] "They sell positive thinking and can-do haziness -- specific details cost extra." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Peter Bogdanovich's ex-wife Polly Platt, a film editor, {{had read}} Hill's script for Hickey & Boggs and {{recommended}} him to co-write The Getaway, which Bogdanovich {{was going to}} make with Steve McQueen. Bogdanovich and Hill worked on the script together in San Francisco while Bogdanovich was directing What's Up, Doc? Hill says that Bogdanovich was interested in making the film a more Hitchcock-type movie. They had completed 25 pages when they went back to L.A., whereupon McQueen fired Bogdanovich without reading any of their work. Sam Peckinpah came on to direct; Hill started from scratch and wrote his own script in six weeks. The resulting movie was a big hit which Hill later described [...] "of the films I wrote, I thought it was far and away the best one, and most interesting." [...] He said the success of the film [...] "was <b>really</b> <b>how</b> I got to be a director; the fact it had done so well put me in line to get a shot." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song {{inspired}} songwriter Margo Guryan to {{move into}} writing pop music. She said: [...] "I {{thought it was just}} gorgeous. I bought the record and played it a million times, then sat down and wrote 'Think of Rain.' That's <b>really</b> <b>how</b> I started writing that way. I just decided it was better than what was happening in jazz." [...] Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne wrote that [...] "It's impossible to exaggerate how beautiful this song is. Everywhere, it takes risks." [...] Bono said in October 2006 during Brian Wilson's induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame that [...] "the string arrangement on 'God Only Knows' is fact and proof of angels". Jimmy Webb, an American popular music composer, has also stated his love for the song, stating, [...] "I love 'God Only Knows' and its bow to the baroque that goes {{all the way back to}} 1740 and Johann Sebastian Bach. It represents the whole tradition of liturgical music that I feel is a spiritual part of Brian's music. And Carl's singing is pretty much at its pinnacle—as good as it ever got." [...] In a 2003 solo concert in Tel Aviv, Steven Wilson, frontman of Porcupine Tree, declared [...] "God Only Knows" [...] as his favorite song of all time. On the Insurgentes listening party that took place in Mexico City in 2009, Steven Wilson said it was a perfect song. Simon Neil of Scottish band Biffy Clyro has the lyrics [...] "God only knows what I'd be without you" [...] tattooed across his chest.|$|E
