In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the <b>release</b> <b>bearing,</b> pulling on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> is pushed into the clutch disengaging the vehicle drive.

50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and <b>release</b> <b>bearing.</b> The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|E

50|$|A common {{example of}} riding the clutch {{is to keep}} slight continual {{pressure}} on the clutch pedal whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on the clutch pedal {{instead of on the}} floorboard or dead pedal. Although this slight pressure is not enough to allow the clutch disc itself to slip, it is enough to keep the <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> against the release springs. This causes the bearing to remain spinning, which leads to premature bearing failure.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, Akiyoshi was {{approached}} by a Buddhist priest, Kyudo Nakagawa who {{asked her if she}} would consider writing a piece for his hometown, Hiroshima. He sent her some photos depicting the aftermath of the nuclear bombing. Her initial reaction was horror. She could not see how she could compose anything to address the event. Finally she found a picture of a young woman, emerging from an underground shelter with a faint smile on her face. Akiyoshi said that upon seeing this picture, she understood the message: hope. With that message in mind, she composed the three-part suite Hiroshima: Rising from the Abyss. The piece was premiered in Hiroshima on 6 August 2001, the 56th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing.

50|$|Long {{established}} parts maker Valeo {{has developed}} a properly engineered 4-piece clutch kit to replace the DMF. The UK introduction {{was at the end}} of 2005. It is claimed to provide increased reliability for the expensive replacement operation (labour time cost and the part cost), of the dual-mass flywheel. The 4-piece kit is composed of a traditional rigid flywheel and long travel damper consisting of a cover assembly, a high performance drive plate and a <b>release</b> <b>bearing.</b> Rigorous R&D testing showed the 4-piece kit performs just as well in terms of overall clutch operation, transmission protection, comfort and improves heat dissipation and durability. The transmission protection provides full engine and gearbox safety; the 4-piece kit matches the DMF for mechanical vibration reduction and therefore limits premature wear within the gearbox. The long travel damper closely matches the damping performance of a DMF. Fitting times are also comparable.|$|E
