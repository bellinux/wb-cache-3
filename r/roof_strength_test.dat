2500|$|The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) {{awarded the}} Camry sedan an overall rating of [...] "good" [...] in both frontal offset and side impact crash tests. Both tests also receive the [...] "good" [...] rating in all 14 {{measured}} categories, {{and is also}} rated [...] "good" [...] in the <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> with a 5.31 strength-to-weight ratio withstanding a peak force of [...] The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) originally rated the XV40 the full five-star rating for the frontal driver, frontal passenger, side driver, and side rear passenger tests, and a four-star rating for the rollover test. However, under the new NHTSA testing methodology introduced in 2010, the 2011 model year XV40 was downgraded to a three-star rating. This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), giving an overall front-impact protection rating of three-stars. A side barrier rating of five-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), gave for an overall side-impact protection rating of three-stars. The third testing component, the rollover rating, resulted in a grading of four-stars. Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety. This resulted in an increase to the side barrier rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} the relationship between quasi-static and dynamic test results, repeatable, dynamic rollover tests were conducted on production vehicles to determine intrusion and intrusion velocities using the Jordan Rollover System (JRS). These tests included complete production vehicles and body bucks at reduced weight, to vary the roof strength-to-weight ratio. Data from these tests are compared with the results of quasi-static <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> measured at greater roll and pitch angles than are used in FMVSS 216. Biomechanical data indicates that serious head, face, neck or thoracic spine injury are a consequence of rapid impacts with significant amplitude. The test data suggests a correlation between quasi-static <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> and dynamic <b>roof</b> intrusion velocity. Localized failures (buckling and collapse of structural elements that often translate into the roof panel) are a more critical aspect of roof performance than its strength as measured in FMVSS 216...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle {{rollover}} is a {{major cause}} of fatality in passenger vehicle crashes. Rollovers are more complicated than planar crashes, and potential injury mechanisms still are being studied and debated. A central factor in these debates is the importance of having a strong vehicle <b>roof.</b> Minimum <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> is regulated under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 216, but no study to date has established a relationship between performance in this or any other test condition and occupant protection in real-world rollover crashes. The present study evaluated the relationship between <b>roof</b> <b>strengths</b> of 11 midsize SUV roof designs and the rate of fatal or incapacitating driver injury in single-vehicle rollover crashes in 12 states. Quasi-static tests were conducted under the conditions specified in FMVSS 216, and the maximum force required to crush the roof to 2, 5, and 10 inches of plate displacement was recorded. Various measures of <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> were calculated from the test results for evaluation in logistic regression models. In all cases, increased measures of <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> resulted in significantly reduced rates of fatal or incapacitating driver injury after accounting for vehicle stability, driver age, and state differences. A one-unit increase in peak strength-to-weight ratio (SWR) within 5 inches of plate displacement, the metric currently regulated under the FMVSS 216 standard, was estimated {{to reduce the risk of}} fatal or incapacitating injury by 28 percent...|$|R
5000|$|The 2012 Hyundai Accent {{was tested}} by the IIHS and {{received}} a [...] "Good" [...] rating in the frontal offset test, an [...] "Acceptable" [...] rating in the side impact test, and a [...] "Good" [...] rating in the <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test.</b> It also received a [...] "Good" [...] rating in the rear crash protection (head restraint) test.|$|E
5000|$|The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety {{gave the}} Venza its Top Safety Pick rating in 2009. [...] The Venza is also rated [...] "Good" [...] in the <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test,</b> {{as a result}} the Venza also {{received}} the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick in 2010 and 2011 when roof strength became a criterion for receiving the award.|$|E
5000|$|All models came {{standard}} with Vehicle Stability Assist. The Honda CR-V {{was rated}} [...] "good" [...] in frontal and side-impact crash tests by the IIHS. However it was rated [...] "marginal" [...] in the <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test.</b> An analysis {{conducted by the}} IIHS and released in June 2011, found that the 2007-08 MY CR-V had the lowest fatality rate in its class and among the lowest fatality rates among all vehicles.|$|E
50|$|In the United States rollovers {{accounted}} for nearly 25% of passenger vehicle fatalities. Features such as electronic stability control are proven to significantly reduce rollovers and {{lane departure warning}} systems may also help. Rollover sensing side curtain airbags also help to minimize injuries {{in the event of}} a rollover. In March 2009, the IIHS began <b>testing</b> the <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> of vehicles. Volkswagen Tiguan, Honda Element, and Jeep Patriot received Good rating for the <b>roof</b> <b>strength.</b> Kia Sportage received poor rating. Volkswagen Tiguan has the strongest roof among all small SUVs and Kia Sportage has the weakest roof among them.|$|R
5000|$|Roof crush {{has also}} been {{identified}} as a cause of both full and partial ejection in rollover accidents because of ejection portals created by the collapsing roof structure. These chiefly involve broken windows but occasionally also involve the body structure. The current Federal regulation involving <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> - 49 CFR 571.216 (FMVSS 216) - has been found to offer little benefit [...] and is currently being reviewed. Many European manufacturers provide stronger roofs than do U.S. or Asian manufacturers despite {{the fact that there is}} no European (EEC) <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> regulation for light vehicles. The Volvo XC90 may be a good example of this.|$|R
40|$|<b>Strength</b> <b>testing</b> is {{commonly}} {{used to determine the}} muscular strength of older individuals participating in a resistance training program. The {{purpose of this study was}} to non-invasively examine and compare the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) response of maximum and sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> in older men. Twenty-four healthy men aged 70 – 80 yr were recruited for the study. Participants completed a 1 repetition maximum (RM) <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> and four days later a sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> on an incline squat. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and HR were measured by plethysmography during and immediately after the <b>strength</b> <b>tests.</b> SBP, DBP and HR were (P < 0. 001) higher during the 1 RM and sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> compared to resting values. Twenty seconds post 1 RM, SBP and HR were higher than resting values. Twenty seconds post sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> SBP and DBP were lower (P < 0. 02) and HR (P < 0. 001) was higher than resting values. SBP, DBP and HR were higher (P < 0. 001) during sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> compared to 1 RM testing. Twenty seconds post testing, SBP and DBP were lower (P < 0. 001) and HR was higher (P < 0. 001) for the sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> compared to the 1 RM. The results of our study demonstrate that sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> resulted in greater changes in BP and HR compared to 1 RM <b>strength</b> <b>testing.</b> The lower cardiovascular stress experienced during the 1 RM shows that this may be a safer method of testing compared to sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> in men aged 70 – 80 yr...|$|R

5000|$|Roof pillars {{may appear}} strong {{to the average}} consumer, {{but many of them}} are {{constructed}} only of sheet metal that is hollow on the inside at the cross sections.

A weak roof makes a vehicle defective, and roof crushes can cause serious injuries. In 1973, the government passed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 216, creating a standard <b>roof</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> to measure the integrity of roof structure in motor vehicles. Despite federal standards, some vehicle roofs may crush by a foot or more during a rollover accident.|$|E
