40|$|Microvibrations are a {{critical}} concern on satellites equipped with instruments with high stability requirements. Amongst many sources of microvibration onboard, reaction wheel and momentum <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> are often {{considered the most}} significant. This thesis presents the development and validation of microvibration models for a cantilever configured <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> designed with a soft-suspension system. <b>Wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> induced microvibrations under hard-mounted and coupled boundary conditions are studied. In particular, the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> semi-analytical microvibration model in a hard-mounted boundary condition is developed with harmonic excitations and the traditionally ignored broadband noise excitations are included. Some peculiar dynamics such as nonlinearity in the motor and high damping of the soft-suspension system are observed from the hard-mounted measurements conducted on a bespoke dynamometer. Modeling strategies for these peculiar dynamics are developed and implemented in the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> microvibration modeling. This includes a systematic approach to extract stiffness and damping values of the suspension system, considering nonlinearity and high damping from measurements. The microvibrations produced by the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> in a coupled boundary condition are studied using a seismic mass to support the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly.</b> A coupled microvibration measurement system, which allows the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> interface loads to be reconstructed by measuring the response accelerations on the seismic mass, is designed, built and validated. In addition, the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> driving point static and dynamic accelerance are measured and analytical expressions of the driving point dynamic accelerance are derived. The coupled microvibrations are predicted with <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> static accelerance, dynamic accelerance and the standard method (i. e. no wheel accelerance). The predicted results {{have shown that the}} method developed in this thesis which uses the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> dynamic accelerance accurately simulates the microvibrations observed in practice...|$|R

A reference arm pivotally connects between the <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and there is indicating means for measuring the angle of pivot between the arm {{and each of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The length of the device is less than the length of a track section, and thus when one of the <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> is on one track section and one is on an adjoining track section, the sum of the indicated angles will be indicative of the angle between track sections. Thus, from the length of a track section and angle, the departure of each track section from the line may be calculated...|$|R

40|$|Microvibration {{management}} onboard spacecraft {{with high}} stability requirements has drawn increasing interest from engineers and scientists, and this paper discusses a reaction wheel design {{that allows a}} significant reduction of mid- to high-frequency microvibrations {{and that has been}} practically implemented in industry. Disturbances typically induced by mechanical systems onboard a spacecraft (especially rotating devices such as reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> and momentum <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies)</b> can severely degrade the performance of sensitive instruments. Traditionally, wheel-induced high-frequency (over 100 - 200 Hz) vibrations, generated by a combination of phenomena from bearing noise to dynamic amplifications due to internal resonances, are especially difficult to control. In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a newly designed <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly,</b> with a cantilevered flywheel configuration supported by a soft-suspension system, is investigated. The <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly's</b> mathematical model is developed and later verified with vibration tests. Wheel-assembly-induced lateral and axial microvibrations are accurately measured using a seismic-mass microvibration measurement system, which represents an alternative to typical microvibration measurement setups. Finally, the performance of this <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> in terms of microvibration emissions is compared with a traditional design (with a rigid suspension) through comparison of frequency spectra, and it is shown that this design produces significantly lower vibrations at high frequency.

40|$|Microvibrations of a {{satellite}} reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> are commonly analysed in either hard-mounted or coupled boundary conditions, though coupled wheel-to-structure disturbance models are {{more representative of}} the real {{environment in which the}} wheel operates. This article investigates the coupled microvibration dynamics of a cantilever configured reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> mounted on either a stiff or flexible platform. Here a method is presented to cope with modern project necessities: (i) need of a model which gives accurate estimates covering a wide frequency range; (ii) reduce the personnel and time costs derived from the test campaign, (iii) reduce the computational effort without affecting the quality of the results. The method involves measurements of the disturbances induced by the reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> in a hard-mounted configuration and of the frequency and speed dependent dynamic mass of the reaction wheel. In addition, it corrects the approximation due to missing speed dependent dynamic mass in conventional reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> microvibration analysis. The former was evaluated experimentally using a previously designed and validated platform. The latter, on the other hand, was estimated analytically using a finite element model of the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly.</b> Finally, the validation of the coupled wheel-structure disturbance model is presented, giving indication of the level of accuracy that can be achieved with this type of analyses...|$|R

50|$|Most German WW II half {{tracks and}} their tanks {{introduced}} {{during the war}} such as the Panther tank had overlapping and sometimes interleaved <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> to distribute the load more evenly on the track and therefore on the ground. This apparently made {{a significant contribution to}} speed, range and track life, as well as providing a continuous band of protection. It has not been used since the end of that war, probably due to the maintenance requirements of more complicated mechanical parts working in mud, sand, rocks, snow and ice, as well as to cost. Rocks and frozen mud often got stuck between the overlapping wheels, which could prevent them from turning or cause damage to the <b>road</b> <b>wheels.</b> If one of the interior <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> were damaged, it would require other <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> to be removed in order to access the damaged <b>road</b> <b>wheel,</b> making the process more complicated and time-consuming.|$|R

Analysis of wheels from two tanks (32 <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> each, 64 <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> total) yielded an estimate of 270 tanks produced in February 1944, substantially more than had previously been suspected.|$|R

Modelling strategies for the effect of damping are presented. Sine-sweep tests are performed and a method is developed to model harmonic excitations based on the corresponding test results. The often ignored broadband noise is modelled by removing spikes identified in the raw signal including a method of identifying spikes from energy variation and band-stop filter design. The validation of the reaction wheel disturbance model with full excitations (harmonics and broadband noise) is presented and flaws due to missing broadband noise in conventional reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> microvibration analysis are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The vehicle's {{weight is}} {{transferred}} to the bottom length of track {{by a number of}} <b>road</b> <b>wheels,</b> or sets of <b>wheels</b> called bogies. <b>Road</b> <b>wheels</b> are typically mounted on some form of suspension to cushion the ride over rough ground. Suspension design in military vehicles is a major area of development; the very early designs were often completely unsprung. Later-developed <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> suspension offered only a few inches of travel using springs, whereas modern hydro-pneumatic systems allow several feet of travel and include shock absorbers. Torsion-bar suspension has become {{the most common type of}} military vehicle suspension.

There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. OT-62 has the PV-6 6-cylinder, inline diesel engine developing 300 hp (224 kW) at 1,800 rpm. The engine gives it a road speed of 60 km/h with a cruising range of 450 km - 550 km. The vehicle can cross 0.9 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches and climb 38° gradients.|$|R

However, for a given engine speed and a gear ratio, the output force on the <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> decreases as the tire size increases. A lower force in turn decreases the acceleration of rotating wheels. Therefore, the smallest tires that are still big enough to drive over obstacles perform better for a given crawl ratio.|$|R
