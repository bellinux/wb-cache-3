50|$|Salmon fry {{weighing}} {{less than}} 1 gram can be successfully tagged, and different sized tags are used {{depending on the}} length of the fish to be tagged. A small handheld injector is portable and can be used where small numbers of fish will be tagged. For large scale tagging projects, an automatic tag injector is used, which cuts and magnetizes the wire. In manual tagging, a juvenile fish's snout is pressed into a molded guide so that the tag will be positioned correctly and the tag is automatically injected by the machine. These automatic injectors can be integrated into a fully automated process inside of a mobile trailer called an AutoFish trailer, or autotrailer, where fish are mechanically sorted, adipose fin clipped, and tagged. Autotrailers do not require anesthetic or the fish to be removed from water. When fish are tagged, their tag code and other information such as release date and location are entered into a database. In the Pacific Northwest, the <b>Regional</b> <b>Mark</b> Information System is used.|$|E
50|$|Trademark {{law in the}} United States {{was adopted}} from the common law of England and {{is part of the}} law of unfair competition. In 1925, an {{influential}} law review article described the dilution of trademarks through blurring where a product uses a name that is similar to a trademark and causes an erosion of its uniqueness. Starting in 1946, various states began to adopt anti-dilution provisions in their trademark statutes. The federal government followed suit in 1995 with the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA). This federal legislation applied to famous marks and made a party liable if it used a similar mark that diluted a famous mark's distinctiveness. However, the legislation did not define terms to establish what constituted a famous mark or articulate a clear standard for determining liability. As a result, as trademark cases were litigated in federal courts, a split developed between the different federal circuit appellate courts regarding issues such as what is a famous mark, whether a <b>regional</b> <b>mark</b> could be a famous mark, and whether a dilution claim required proof of economic harm to the trademark holder.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Coded wire microtags (CWTs) were {{introduced}} in the Pacific Northwest in the late 1960 s {{as an alternative to}} fin clipping and external tags for identification of anadromous salmonids in the region, particularly those of hatchery origin. Coastwide use of CWTs quickly followed, and fisheries agencies in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California established ocean sampling and recovery programs. Now, 54 federal, provincial, state, tribal, and private entities release over 50 million salmonids with CWTs yearly. Regional coordination of these tagging programs is provided by the <b>Regional</b> <b>Mark</b> Processing Center operated by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. The ‘Mark Center ’ also maintains a centralized database for coastwide CWT releases and recoveries, as well as for associated catch and sample data. CWT data are provided to users via interactive on-line data retrieval. The coastwide CWT system proved successful and quite robust despite its piecemeal growth and dependence on cooperative support by all agencies. Not surprisingly, it also has a number of problems that reduce the CWT's effectiveness as a marking tool. Even so, the CWT has proved invaluable as a stock identification tool in marking salmonid hatchery stocks and, to a lesser extent, wild stocks. Most of the CWT’s limitations have persisted from the beginning. These problems include the need for the establishment of standards for tagging levels, expanded use of replication, improved tag loss estimates, improve...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{work was}} to analyze the perception of selected brands from the customer's perspective and {{from the perspective of}} brand founder called Regional Agrarian Chamber of the South Bohemian Region. To determine the attitudes of opinion on brand perception by the customer, I developed a questionnaire survey using semantic differential. First hypothesis, which argues that the selection of food {{plays an important role in}} <b>regional</b> <b>mark</b> at least half of the respondents, was refuted. Customers perceived the regionality as the most important criterion. The research showed that for respondents is very important high quality, but also the lower price and best evaluation are very important criterions for customers. Hypothesis number 2, which says that the brand owner CHJ has a more positive picture of the perceptions of customers than it is in reality, was confirmed. Founder CHJ brand has a positive idea of the perception of the brand, but the differences between this perception are not noticeable because of their own research, brand perception among its customers. When proposing to amend the emphasis was on increasing brand awareness. For this purpose, it was suggested to isme magazine in every three months. Consumers were presented by the newly awards manufacturers with their products. Distribution and financing was mainly doing by the Regional Chamber of Agriculture of the South Bohemia. In conclusion, the CHJ brand is not completely unknown in the eyes of the customer. It creates a certain image that customers perceive and which over time will become stronger and stronger.

40|$|Most {{speakers}} in today’s societies are bilingual or multilingual and linguistic {{research has shown}} that the grammatical systems of two or more languages interact in speech production and perception [11, 13]. The confrontation of two or more competing phonological systems and their phonetic realization leads to what we generally understand as a “foreign accent”. The interference appears on the segmental and the prosodic level. Research in second language acquisition has previously focused on segmental features while research on prosody and its important role in language learning is rather scare. This present paper examines the intonation of Belfast English produced by native speakers and two groups of German second language learners of English. Acoustic prosodic characteristics responsible for the perception of a foreign accent are identified as deviations in the nuclear pitch patterns. Using production data the study aims to examine the occurrence of <b>regional</b> <b>marked</b> intonation patterns in different speaking styles. The study provides (1) evidence that specific regional intonation patterns are acquired in a naturalistic setting, (2) that these patterns are transferred into different speaking styles in second language production whereas regionally marked intonation patterns vary according to the formality of the speaking style in native language production. 1...|$|R
40|$|This M. A. thesis {{contributes}} to the research of <b>regional</b> <b>marked</b> features in the region under the Giant Mountains (Podkrkonoší), which {{is a part of}} the north-eastern dialectal group of the Czech language. The aim of the thesis is to describe spontaneous language of the speakers both in rural (Nová Ves nad Popelkou, Syřenov, Újezdec, Žďár u Kumburku) and urban areas (Lomnice nad Popelkou, Semily), with special regard to phonology and morphology. The research was restricted to the oldest generation only, that means to the people who were born in 1951 and earlier. The data were obtained by recording semi- structured interviews with informants. These data were then analyzed, compared and described in terms of Common Czech, regional and local dialect features. One part of the thesis consists of short description of the idiolect of each spokesman and of speech samples of informants. The results of the research are presented separately for each feature for both groups investigated (rural and urban speakers). In the conclusion of the thesis, the author summarizes the results gained. The rural speakers of the Lomnice microregion still use some dialectal features typical for the region under the Giant Mountains (Podkrkonoší), whereas in the urban areas these features are not present to such a high degree [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The {{globalisation}} {{of processing}} {{industry and the}} consolidation of the international retail trade, together {{with the increase of}} imports after the EU access, supported the competition hot up and saturation of domestic food market. Both food processors and food retailers are exposed to increasing competition. In order to maintenance on the market they are increasingly pressed to minimize their costs and/or to accomplish higher prices for products with competitive advantage. Besides of that all participants of the agri-food chain are pressed to intensify marketing support of their goods. Aiming to reduce the costs, some of processors choose the way by the substitution of part of the input material by another, cheaper one. On the other hand, the offer of foods with specific quality attributes such as organic foods, <b>regional</b> <b>marks,</b> specialities or other quality food products is a way, how to surpass the sharp competition. On the background of the retail network development, of shopping behaviour and of development of competition, this study recapitulates main marketing trends on the food market in the Czech Republic, the reasons of these trends and their impacts. In the study a space for food quality products on the Czech market is being searched in the competition with products of lower price categories. competition, marketing, quality, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Marketing,...|$|R
