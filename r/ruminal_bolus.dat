40|$|The {{effects of}} metabolizable energy levels were {{evaluated}} on nutrient intake and ingestive behaviour in Morada Nova lambs. Forty Morada Nova lambs were used {{with an initial}} weight of 12. 2 ± 2. 05 kg. Five treatments were defined according to the metabolizable energy levels (0. 96, 1. 28, 1. 72, 2. 18 and 2. 62 Mcal/kg DM). The experimental model was a randomized block design. Linear effect (P< 0. 0001) of ME levels was determined for dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), total carbohydrates (TC), non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) in g/day. Quadratic effect was determined for NDF (P< 0. 017) and carbohydrate intake (P< 0. 003). Linear effect was determined for digestibility of DM, OM, NDF, TC and NFC. Eating, ruminating and total chewing times, expressed in hours/day, decreased linearly (P< 0. 0001) with the energy levels of experimental diets. Idle time increased linearly (P< 0. 0001) {{with the increase of}} energy levels of the rations. Feeding and rumination efficiencies were influenced by the energy levels (P< 0. 0001) when expressed in g DM/h. The number of ruminal boluses, number of chews and chews per <b>ruminal</b> <b>bolus</b> were not affected by the levels of ME. However, time spent chewing per <b>ruminal</b> <b>bolus</b> was influenced (P< 0. 0014).

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>ruminal</b> <b>bolus</b> on the intake {{behaviour}} and digestive parameters was studied {{in a group of}} 12 castrated adult Majorera goats. For the experiment they were housed in a metabolic box for 2 weeks to allow for adaptation and fed either an ad libitum Fibrous Diet (FD) (n = 6) or a Concentrated Diet (CD) (n = 6) offered at 130 % of the previous day?s consumption. The animals were subsequently divided into two similar subgroups: bolus (identified with Rumitag Bolus) and control (simulated application). After one week of feeding with the definitive diet, the measuring period started, which lasted for 12 d divided into two sub-periods separated by the application moment (subperiod I: 6 d, before bolus application; sub-period II: 6 d, after bolus application). Samples of faeces and material refused by the animal were collected daily in order to determine DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF. For the FD group a significant difference was found due to the period on DMI being higher in sub- period II, but there were no significant statistical differences due to the bolus treatment. For the CD group, DMI increased during sub-period II due to the overall time spent in both sub-groups. Digestibility parameters results were probably conditioned by the stress which was caused by the accumulation of days in the pen. Taking the evolution of daily DM per kg - 0. 75 live weight intake into account, both groups presented a similar decrease in intake the day after bolus application, to a great extent due to the stress caused by the identification procedure, nevertheless they recovered their DMI level 48 h after application of the bolus.

Twenty-four Charolais and Nellore crossbred cows with age and average initial weight of 7 years and 423 kg, respectively, were used. The experimental diets were plant extracts: basal diet + 5 g/animal/day of a natural additive composed of 750 mg of essential oil of thyme (Thymus vulgaris), 150 mg of garlic (Allium sativum), 250 mg of rosemary extract (Rosmarimus officinalis), 250 mg of canola oil (Brassica napus), 250 mg extract of quillaja (Quillaja saponaria), and 3350 mg of corn starch; sodium monensin: basal diet + 300 mg/monensin/animal/day; and control: basal diet without additive. The basal diet contained sorghum silage and concentrate in a 62 : 38 ratio. The experimental design was completely randomized with a 3 × 2 (3 diets and 2 breed predominances) factorial arrangement, and means were compared using DMS test at 5 % of significance.

40|$|Adequate dietary intakes of trace {{minerals}} {{are thought}} necessary to maximize cow reproduction, calf health, and calf performance. Diets grazed by beef cattle are generally deficient to marginal in copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) concentrations; therefore, these trace minerals are usually {{added to the}} diet in supplement form. The most widely used means of trace-mineral supplementation for grazing cattle is selffed, salt-based, loose mineral supplements. Although cattle do not balance their mineral needs when consuming a self-fed mineral supplement, usually no other practical way of supplying mineral needs exists under grazing conditions. The greatest limitation to using self-fed mineral supplements is variation in animal intake. More direct methods of mineral supplementation include adding minerals to drinking water or feed, oral drenching, <b>ruminal</b> <b>boluses,</b> and injection. Variation in mineral intake is reduced relative to self-fed supplementation, and the additional labor requirement and expense are relatively small. Delivery of supplemental trace minerals using an injectable solution {{may be a more}} reliable means of achieving adequate trace-mineral status than using self-fed, salt-based, loose mineral supplements. Bolus injections of trace minerals have been associated with improved average daily gain, feed efficiency, feed intake, or health status of beef calves fed in confinement; however, trace mineral delivery methods of this type have not been fully evaluated with respect to performance of beef cows and suckling calves.

Animals were fed once daily and milked 3 times per day. The bolus pH and temperature values implemented via esophagus were measured every 15 minutes (96 data points per day) with accuracy ± 0. 1 ph and °C. Outside temperature by FREEMETEO meteorological server (48 times per day) was measured. Outside temperature can affect the drinking regime of dairy cows. During lactation weeks with higher outside temperature higher average number of drinking events (ANDE) was determined. The biggest difference between weeks in ANDE 18. 33 % (p = 0. 000) was found. Daily ANDE 9. 25 ± 1. 85 and average daily temperature (ADT) 19. 03 ± 5. 19 °C were observed. The most of the drinking events (NDE) concentrated to 4 main peaks (25. 17 %) during working hours (74. 98 %) was found. After the feed intake and milking the highest frequencies of NDE were observed. The highest average ruminal temperature after drinking (ARTAD) during night before first feeding due to lower NDE in this time were found. Overall ARTAD 36. 86 °C was observed. The most measured ruminal temperatures after drinking (RTAD) (51. 53 %) in the interval 35 – 37 °C were found.

Twenty crossbred lambs, male, whole, weighting 19. 3 Â 1. 35 kg, averaging 7 months of age {{were randomly assigned to}} four treatments of 0, 50, 75 and 100 % of substitution, on dry matter basis, were used the roughage used was elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) hay. The diets were balanced to be isonitrogenous and isocaloric, delivered in two daily meals, collecting the following day the leftovers, which were weighed, keeping them around 15 %. The experiment lasted for 70 days, when animals were slaughtered. The experimental trials were conducted in a completely randomized design with four treatments and five repetitions. In the assessment of ingestive behavior, the parameters of feeding time, ruminating, other activities, leisure, consumption of salt and water intake were affected by treatments and periods of the day. The urination and defecation were affected only by time of day, in jaw movements per <b>ruminal</b> <b>bolus</b> there was inferior to 100 % substitution. In the assessment of consumption and performance, {{there was a significant difference}} to the feed conversion, determining that the 50 % level of substitution improved better performance of animals. However, there was no significant difference for average daily gain and number of days to reach 12 kg. The regression analysis showed a quadratic effect for the feed conversion, with a biological optimum level to 59 % substitution of soybean meal by detoxified castor meal. There were no significant differences for the intake of dry matter, neutral detergent insoluble fiber, acid detergent insoluble fiber, hemicellulose and mineral matter (in g/animal x day, % BW, and g/UMS). There was less consumption of ether extract for the 75 % level of substitution and crude protein levels in 50 and 75 % for replacement. Related to carcass evaluation and non carcass components, no significantly differences were observed among the levels of substitution for the variables body weight, weight of slaughter, losses due to fasting, hot carcass weight, cold carcass weight, cooling losses, length of carcass, hip of perimeter, hip width and degree of resignation. The regression analysis showed a quadratic effect for real and biological yields, with a great organic level of 100 % substitution. In non carcass components, no significantly differences were registered for viscera, full gastrointestinal tract, empty gastrointestinal tract, genitals, head and legs. For the variable skin, the regression analysis showed a quadratic effect, presenting a point of maximum at 44 % for replacement. Castor bean meal can substitute 100 % of soybean meal. The result of the economic analysis of food offered in the experiment, showed that none of the treatments were profitably. Moreover, considering the gross (US$/kg BW), net (US$/kg BW) and profit (US$/kg BW) margins obtained, it appeared that only the level of 0 % substitution showed positive values for such indices (US$ 0. 31 /kg BW, US$ 0. 29 /kg BW and US$ 0. 26 /kg BW, respectively), when the selling price of live weight was of US$ 2. 26. The replacement of up to 100 % of soybean meal by detoxified castor meal do not alter significantly the ingestive behavior of lambs finished in feedlot. Detoxified castor bean meal shows potential for use as feed for sheep in termination, promoting lower consumption of crude protein with no change in average daily gain at 100 % and good feed conversion, at 59 % for replacement. The characteristics of the carcass and non carcass components were not affected by use in up to 100 % of substitution, and the variable skin presented a biological level optimum when the soybean meal was replaced in 44 % by detoxified castor meal. The use of autoclave-detoxified castor meal in rations for termination of lambs is not presented as a good alternative to guarantee profits to the producer, as this activity would only be viable when the sale price of the lamb is higher than US$ 4. 03 /kg B...|$|E
