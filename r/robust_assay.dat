40|$|Controversy {{exists on}} the role of IgE antidrug {{antibodies}} (IgE-ADA) in infusion reactions (IR) on infliximab treatment, partly {{due to the lack of}} a positive control used for assay validation. We sought to (1) develop a <b>robust</b> <b>assay</b> to measure IgE-ADA, including a positive control, (2) determine the association between IgE-ADA and IR and (3) determine the incidence of IgE-ADA in infliximab treated patients. A recombinant human IgE anti-infliximab monoclonal antibody was developed as standard and positive control. With this antibody, we set up a novel <b>robust</b> <b>assay</b> to measure IgE-ADA. IgE-ADA was determined in three retrospective cohorts (n= 159) containing IR+ (n= 37) and IR- (n= 39), and longitudinal sera of 83 spondyloarthritis. IgE-ADA was found in 0 / 39 IR-, whereas 4 / 37 (11 %) IR+ showed low levels (0. 1 - 0. 3 IU/mL, below the 0. 35 IU/mL threshold associated with elevated risk of allergic symptoms). All patients who were IgE-ADA positive also had (very) high IgG-ADA levels. The incidence of IgE-ADA in patients with infliximab-treated spondyloarthritis was estimated at less than approximately 1 %. IgE-ADA is rarely detected in infliximab-treated patients. Moreover, the absence of IgE-ADA in the majority of IR+ patients suggests that IgE-ADA is not associated with infusion reaction...|$|E

40|$|Melatonin modulates {{circadian}} rhythms via the hypothalamic {{suprachiasmatic nucleus}} (SCN). One {{of the most}} <b>robust</b> <b>assays</b> for SCN melatonin receptor activation in mice is the inhibition of PACAP-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor Ca(2 +) /cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). To assess the effect of aging on responsiveness to melatonin, SCN slices from mice of different ages were prepared and treated with PACAP alone or PACAP plus melatonin. CREB phosphorylation state was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In SCN slices from young (2 - 4 -month-old) mice, melatonin reduced the level of phospho-CREB immunoreactivity following PACAP treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In SCN slices from aged mice (19 - 22 months of age), PACAP alone induced comparable levels of phospho-CREB, but melatonin treatment failed to inhibit the PACAP-induced CREB phosphorylation. The results indicate an age-related loss of sensitivity to melatonin in the SCN.

40|$|Abstract Background Hepcidin is a 25 -residue {{peptide hormone}} crucial to iron homeostasis. It is {{essential}} to measure the concentration of hepcidin in cells, tissues and body fluids to understand its mechanisms and roles in physiology and pathophysiology. With a mass of 2791 Da hepcidin is readily detectable by mass spectrometry and LC-ESI, MALDI and SELDI {{have been used to}} estimate systemic hepcidin concentrations by analysing serum or urine. However, peak heights in mass spectra may not always reflect concentrations in samples due to competition during binding steps and variations in ionisation efficiency. Thus {{the purpose of this study}} was to develop a <b>robust</b> <b>assay</b> for measuring hepcidin using a stable isotope labelled hepcidin spiking approach in conjunction with SELDI-TOF-MS. Results We synthesised and re-folded hepcidin labelled with 13 C/ 15 N phenylalanine at position 9 to generate an internal standard for mass spectrometry experiments. This labelled hepcidin is 10 Daltons heavier than the endogenous peptides and does not overlap with the isotopic envelope of the endogenous hepcidin or other common peaks in human serum or urine mass spectra and can be distinguished in low resolution mass spectrometers. We report the validation of adding labelled hepcidin into serum followed by SELDI analysis to generate an improved assay for hepcidin. Conclusion We demonstrate that without utilising a spiking approach the hepcidin peak height in SELDI spectra gives a good indication of hepcidin concentration. However, a stable isotope labelled hepcidin spiking approach provides a more <b>robust</b> <b>assay,</b> measures the absolute concentration of hepcidin and should facilitate inter-laboratory hepcidin comparisons. </p...|$|E

40|$|Lipid {{regulation}} of ion channels by low-abundance signaling lipids phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) and phosphatidic acid (PA) {{has emerged as}} a central cellular mechanism for controlling ion channels and the excitability of nerves. A lack of <b>robust</b> <b>assays</b> suitable for facile detection of a lipid bound to a channel has hampered the probing of the lipid binding sites and measuring the pharmacology of putative lipid agonists for ion channels. Here, we show a fluorescent PIP 2 competition assay for detergent-purified potassium channels, including TWIK- 1 -related K+-channel (TREK- 1). Anionic lipids PA and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) bind dose dependently (9. 1 and 96  μM, respectively) and agonize the channel. Our assay shows PIP 2 binds with high affinity (0. 87  μM) but surprisingly can directly antagonize TREK- 1 in liposomes.

40|$|The GTPase dynamin is a mechanochemical enzyme {{involved}} in membrane fission, but the molecular {{nature of its}} membrane interactions and their regulation by guanine nucleotides and protein effectors remain poorly characterized. Using site-directed fluorescence labeling and several independent fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, we have developed <b>robust</b> <b>assays</b> for the detection and real-time monitoring of dynamin–membrane and dynamin–dynamin interactions. We show that dynamin interacts preferentially with highly curved, PIP 2 -dense membranes and inserts partially into the lipid bilayer. Our kinetic measurements further reveal that cycles of GTP binding and hydrolysis elicit major conformational rearrangements in self-assembled dynamin that favor dynamin–membrane association and dissociation, respectively. Sorting nexin 9, an abundant dynamin partner, transiently stabilizes dynamin on the membrane {{at the onset of}} stimulated GTP hydrolysis and may function to couple dynamin's mechanochemical conformational changes to membrane destabilization. Amphiphysin I has the opposite effect. Thus, dynamin's mechanochemical properties on a membrane surface are dynamically regulated by its GTPase cycle and major binding partners...|$|R

As with any PCR initial time spent on optimisation of a real-time assay will be beneficial in the long run.

40|$|Abstract: The {{enzymes that}} {{regulate}} histone methylation {{states and the}} protein domains that recognize methylated histone residues have been implicated {{in a number of}} human diseases, including cancer, {{as a result of their}} ability to affect transcriptional changes by altering chromatin structure. These proteins are recognized as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases associated with epigenetic disruption; however, few inhibitors of their activity have been identified. The majority of histone demethylase and methyltransferase enzyme inhibitors have been discovered on the basis of their structural similarity to substrates or known inhibitors of enzymes with analogous mechanisms. The general lack of potency and specificity of these compounds indicates that novel chemotypes are needed to address the large number of recently discovered histone-modifying enzymes. High-throughput screening (HTS) allows rapid testing of chemically diverse small molecule libraries, provided assays amenable to HTS exist.
