5000|$|The Rotary Screw CompressorAlthough {{the first}} {{commercial}} application of a fluid injected <b>rotary</b> <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> was accomplished by Swedish industrial manufacturer Atlas Copco in 1957, it was Sullair's Founding President, Don Hoode, that introduced the technology to the U.S. domestic market in 1966. And by 1969, Sullair had developed an entire line of portable and stationary asymmetric rotary screw air compressors. [...] Hoode purchased {{the use of the}} technology from Swedish firm Svenska Rotor Maskiner, whose retired chief engineer, Alf Lysholm, invented the twin-screw compressor in 1934 while developing gas turbines. The Lysholm design is also used in vehicles to force air induction into engine cylinders, supercharging both gas and diesel powered engines to boost engine performance. Today, rotary screw compressors are the most popular type of air compressor in operation worldwide. Sullair's leadership decision to stay exclusively with the rotary screw technology when others still relied on piston driven technology, proved to be a valuable decision for the company, and was significant in its growth within the industry.|$|E

This work aims to perform the receiver tests regarding the radiated noise and structural vibration due to the compressor in different operating conditions.

For environmental concern, the one-third octave band spectrum is frequently adopted to evaluate the radiated noise, while the narrow band spectrum {{can be used to}} characterize the noise sources. The axial, vertical and horizontal accelerations on the compressor shell at the motor and oil-injection locations are also monitored to correlate the structure-borne noise. Other than the comparison of spectral content between radiated noise and compressor shell vibration, the frequency response functions and the coherence functions are examined to further characterize the relation between noise and vibration. This work lays out the general steps and measurement procedures for noise and vibration evaluation in primary stage for receiver tests considering different load capacities.

40|$|The rotor {{profiles}} of twin <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> {{have a significant}} influence on the compressor performance. Three different rotor profile design methods are derived mathematically and their limitations are addressed. This dissertation presents the complete theory and algorithm of the deviation function (DF) method for the twin <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> design. This method is based on conjugate pair design and generates new twin <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> profiles from generating curves derived by the deviation functions. The deviation functions used in this research are composed of the Bezier curves. The partially overlapped three-segment third-order Bezier curve-based deviation function is proposed to achieve the goal of minimizing the blowhole area along with shorter interlobe sealing line length. The complication of combining curves as the generating curves and determining values of parameters of those curves are problems for the rotor profile designs of twin <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> in industry.

Vibration-based diagnostics of oil flooded <b>screw</b> <b>compressors</b> allows us to estimate the deviation of their operation from the main mode in accordance with changing the settings of vibration processes. The oil flooded <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> transition from the main mode of operation to the abnormal one is accompanied by complex gas-dynamic phenomena i. e. the initial gaps and their decays. This leads to changes in the nature of vibration processes, prompting suggestions that there is a relationship to a change of vibration parameters and mode of compressor operation. Studies were conducted by combined method using an analytical calculation of the decay parameters of the initial discontinuity and an experimental one based on the measurement of acceleration on the body of the real oil flooded <b>screw</b> <b>compressor.</b> A virtually adequate reaction of the decay parameters of the initial gap and the peak values of vibration acceleration to the change of operation mode of oil flooded <b>screw</b> <b>compressor</b> has been received. The peak value of the vibration acceleration was selected by the method of Gating being time-coinciding with the beginning discharge phase of the oil flooded <b>screw</b> <b>compressor,</b> and therefore, with the decay time of the initial discontinuity.
