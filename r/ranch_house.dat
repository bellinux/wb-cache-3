5|$|The McDonald <b>Ranch</b> <b>House</b> {{was built}} in 1913 by Franz Schmidt, a German immigrant, and {{acquired}} by the McDonald family in the 1930s. The ranch was vacated by the McDonald family under protest in 1942, when the United States Army took over the land {{as part of the}} Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range to use in training bomber crews during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The family {{hoped that}} the ranch would be {{returned}} after the war, but it was not, and in 1970, the Army {{announced that it would}} be kept permanently. The McDonald <b>Ranch</b> <b>House</b> was empty and deteriorating until 1982, when it was stabilized by the Army. In 1984 it was restored by the National Park Service to appear as it did on July 12, 1945. The site is now open to visitors twice a year, on the first Saturday in April and October.|$|E

More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site is about ten times higher than normal background radiation in the area.

5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built <b>ranch</b> <b>house</b> next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ranch</b> <b>house</b> and {{surrounding}} buildings {{used for the}} Venneford <b>Ranch</b> <b>house</b> was the Highlands Ranch Mansion (pictured) in Highlands Ranch, which ironically is located near the real town of Centennial, Colorado.

2500|$|Small-scale tract {{building}} of <b>ranch</b> <b>houses</b> {{ended in the}} late 1970s and early 1980s. [...] Those still built today have usually been individual custom houses. [...] One known exception is a tract of ranch-style houses briefly built on Butte Court in Shafter, California in 2007/08. [...] These houses borrowed their style cues from the 1950s Western styled <b>ranch</b> <b>houses,</b> with board and batten siding, dovecotes, large eaves, and extensive porches. [...] Notably, all houses in this tract were on 1/4-acre lots, and had their front garages turned sideways so that the garage doors were not dominating {{the front of the}} house.|$|R

25|$|Preservationist {{movements}} have begun in some <b>ranch</b> <b>house</b> neighborhoods, {{as well as}} renewed interest in the style from a younger generation who did not grow up in ranch-style houses. This renewed interest in the style {{has been compared to}} that which other house styles such as the bungalow and Queen Anne experienced in the 20th century, initial dominance of the market, replacement as the desired housing style, decay and lack of interest coupled with many teardowns, then renewed interest and modernization of the surviving houses.|$|E

25|$|Like most of North American, {{the suburbs}} {{built in the}} years after the Second World War were {{dominated}} by the <b>ranch</b> <b>house.</b> Areas like Alta Vista and the older parts of Nepean are dominated by these quickly built single storey houses with a garage attached and little overt styling. More recent suburbs have moved to larger homes, generally with two or more stories and with more ornamentation, such as gables, dormer windows, and balconies. This neo-eclectic style dominates that rapidly growing areas outside the Greenbelt, such as Kanata and Barrhaven.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Camarillo Ranch House’s ideal {{location}} in Southern California, {{back in the}} early 1900s the home struggled to stay warm. Almost every room in the house has a fireplace in it. Adolfo looked to technology as a way to remedy problems that would arise on the ranch. He was the first farmer to ever purchase a refrigerator, which at that time, would take up an entire room in the house. However, he was able to safely store perishables {{for the first time in}} his life. He also had multiple heaters installed throughout the house in hopes of providing more warmth to his family. The most beautiful room in the Camarillo <b>Ranch</b> <b>house</b> belonged to Adolfo's middle daughter Carmen. Carmen was an avid equestrian who learned how to care for and maintain the horses from the Ranch Manager, Meliton Ortiz. Up until Meliton Ortiz’ death in 2010, he would visit the Camarillo <b>Ranch</b> <b>House</b> frequently to provide stories and details about his life growing up on the ranch. The home was remodeled in 1914, when the oldest daughter Carmen married. They opened many rooms by taking down walls and changing the stair design. The grand parlor had the greatest changes from this, causing it to go from multiple to rooms to one giant open grand parlor. This was in the hopes that it would open up the house more.|$|E
