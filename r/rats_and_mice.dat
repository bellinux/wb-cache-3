5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil. Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci may have seen it {{on a visit to}} Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, perhaps because of the exotic <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice</b> introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably Holocene age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Parrotfinches may be preyed upon by {{indigenous}} {{birds of}} prey such as the endemic Fiji goshawk, or by introduced mammals such as the small Asian mongoose, <b>rats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice,</b> {{and they may be}} susceptible to disease. The Fiji species, despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group, appears to be stable in numbers. It is therefore classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and it is protected under Fijian law.|$|E
5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b> In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice,</b> species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice,</b> which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E
5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, <b>rats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b> The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Intra- and inter-specific {{transfers}} of <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> ova showed that native and foreign ova developed to the blastocyst stage within explanted oviducts of the <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse.</b> Reports {{in the literature}} indicate that ova can develop in foreign oviductal environments in vivo {{at least to the}} blastocyst stage. Warwick & Berry (1949) reciprocally transferred the cleavage stages of sheep and goats and obtained blastocysts in both instances. Averill, Adams & Rowson (1955) found that the cleavage stages of the sheep developed to 8 -day blastocysts when transferred to the rabbit oviduct. Briones & Beatty (1954) were unsuccessful in their attempts to transfer cleavage stages between <b>rat,</b> <b>mouse,</b> guinea-pig <b>and</b> rabbit. However, Tarkowski (1962) reciprocally transferred the cleavage stages of the <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> obtained development to the blastocyst stage.

5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, <b>rats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b> In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, <b>rats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b>|$|E
5|$|The common endemic Fiji goshawk is a {{specialist}} predator {{of small and}} medium-sized birds, and the swamp harrier is also a widespread predator, often taking fledglings. The local subspecies of the peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus nesiotes will hunt finches, but is itself rare and declining. Barn owls eat mainly rats, but sometimes take small birds. <b>Rats</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice</b> use Fiji parrotfinch nests, and may be significant predators of the species, and the small Asian mongoose will prey on birds feeding on the ground. The fan-tailed cuckoo, which has an endemic Fijian subspecies, is a brood parasite, but the parrotfinch {{does not appear to}} be a host of this large cuckoo.|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial {{extracts}} of dog, cat, <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> liver contain {{two forms}} of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2. 6. 1. 44) : one, designated isoenzyme 1, has mol. wt. approx. 80 000 and predominates in dog and cat liver; the other, designated isoenzyme 2, has mol. wt. approx. 175 000 <b>and</b> predominates in <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> liver. In <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> liver, isoenzyme 1 activity was increased by the injection in vivo of glucagon, but not isoenzyme 2 activity. Isoenzyme 1 was purified and characterized from liver mitochondrial extracts of the four species. Both <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> enzyme preparations catalysed transamination between a number of L-amino acids and glyoxylate, and with L-alanine as amino donor the effective amino acceptors were glyoxylate, phenylpyruvate and hydroxypyruvate. In contrast, both dog and cat enzyme preparations were specific for L-alanine and L-serine with glyoxylate, and used glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate as effective amino acceptors with L-alanine. Evidence that isoenzyme 1 is identical with serine-pyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2. 6. 1. 51) was obtained. Isoenzyme 2 was partially purified from mitochondrial extracts of <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> liver. Both enzyme preparations were specific for L-alanine and glyoxylate.

Her body {{disappeared}} amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice</b> recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743.

5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice</b> in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals and}} plants have taken up {{residence}} in urban environments.

40|$|Interactions of {{surfactant}} protein D (SP-D) with micro-organisms {{and organic}} antigens involve binding to the trimeric neck plus carbohydrate recognition domain (neck+CRD). In these studies, {{we compared the}} ligand binding of homologous human, <b>rat,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> trimeric neck+CRD fusion proteins, each with identical N-terminal tags remote from the ligand-binding surface. Although <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> showed similar affinities for saccharide competitors, both differed markedly from the human protein. The human neck+CRD preferentially recognized N-acetyl-mannosamine, whereas the <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> proteins showed greater affinity for myoinositol, maltose, and glucose. Although human neck+CRDs bound to maltosyl-agarose and fungal mannan, only <b>rat</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> neck+CRDs showed significant binding to maltosyl-Toyopearl beads, solid-phase maltosyl-albumin neo-glycoprotein, or the Phil 82 strain of influenza A virus. Likewise, human SP-D dodecamers and trimeric subunits of full-length rat, but not full-length human SP-D trimers, bound to maltosyl-Toyopearl. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human neck+CRD demonstrated an important role of Asp 324 -Asp 325 in the recognition of N-acetyl-mannosamine, and substitution of the corresponding murine sequence (Asn 324 -Asn 325) conferred a capacity to interact with immobilized maltose. Thus, ligand recognition by human SP-D involves a complex interplay between saccharide presentation, the valency of trimeric subunits, and species-specific residues that flank the primary carbohydrate binding site...|$|R
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals have been {{introduced}} to Newfoundland, either by chance or deliberately.

5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of <b>rats</b> <b>and</b> <b>mice</b> used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E
