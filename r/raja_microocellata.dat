50|$|The smalleyed ray or smalleyed skate (<b>Raja</b> <b>microocellata)</b> is {{a species}} of fish in the family Rajidae. It {{is found in the}} eastern Atlantic off the coasts of the United Kingdom and Ireland and southward through France, Spain, and Portugal to Morocco and the Western Sahara. Its natural {{habitats}} are open seas and shallow seas, generally no deeper than 100 m. It grows to 86 cm total length. A species of minor commercial, it is taken as bycatch in trawl and set net fisheries. Overfishing and habitat disturbance are potential threats to it.|$|E
40|$|Egg {{capsules}} of Rajidae species vary in size, {{shape and}} adornments. These differences {{can be used}} as a taxonomic tool to differentiate species. Furthermore, since egg capsule external morphology is adapted to the environment where they are laid, it can be used make inferences on egg-laying grounds. In the present study, oviducal glands and egg capsules of seven species of skates (Leucoraja naevus, Raja brachyura, Raja montagui, <b>Raja</b> <b>microocellata,</b> Raja miraletus, Raja clavata and Raja undulata) are described and compared, and a taxonomic key developed. The resulting taxonomic key constitute a useful tool to identify skate species inhabiting Portuguese continental waters and, therefore, to improve our knowledge of egg laying habitatsproviding useful information for conservation and management...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Biologia Marinha, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2010 Skate populations tend to {{be highly}} {{vulnerable}} to exploitation {{as a result of}} the main life history characteristics (slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity). The cuckoo ray, Leucoraja naevus, one of the skate species landed in Portugal, is mainly a by-catch species from the artisanal mixed-fishery, and for this reason it is very difficult to acquire information about its basic biology. The two main goals of the present work were to estimate the length at first maturity, fecundity and reproductive cycle of the species Leucoraja naevus and to compare the microscopic structure and chemical nature of the secretions produced by the oviducal gland of the species Leucoraja naevus with other skate species taking into account their reproductive strategy. Although the species has been studied in other NE Atlantic geographic areas, namely Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and North Sea, this study is the first to provide information on the reproductive biology of Leucoraja naevus in Southern European waters. Length at first maturity was estimated at 57 cm and 55 cm TL for males and females, respectively. Active females were observed in every months of the year suggesting that reproduction may occur year round, with a reproductive peak during winter months between January and April. Females release follicles in batches of 5. However, it was not possible to determine the number of reproductive episodes realized by a female during a 1 -year period. Leucoraja naevus, Raja brachyura, Raja miraletus, Raja undulata, <b>Raja</b> <b>microocellata</b> and Raja montagui, have similar microscopic structure divided in four zones: club, papillary, baffle and terminal. However, differences were found between Leucoraja naevus and the remaining species in the chemical nature of the secretions produced in the papillary zone, that seems to have a higher content of sulphated acid mucins, and in the terminal zone that, like in <b>Raja</b> <b>microocellata,</b> lacks serous gland tubules. The differences found are related with the reproductive strategy displayed by each species, namely with the capsule and spawning habitats characteristics. Sperm was found in all species as laterally aligned bundles in the deep recessed tubules of the baffle zone, adjacent to the muscle layer, suggesting short-term sperm storage. These results provide essential information on the reproductive biology not only about the species Leucoraja naevus but also about other by-catch species inhabiting Portuguese continental waters and, therefore, constitute an important tool for a proper management plan...|$|E
40|$|A habitat {{specific}} {{survey of}} the epifauna and fish fauna of sandbanks off the Welsh coastline was undertaken in 2001. Of these, three sandbanks were considered to represent extensions of shallow nearshore soft-sediment communities, while a further six sandbanks {{were considered to be}} distinct sandbanks; seabed features clearly defined in comparison with surrounding sediments. Multivariate community analyses revealed that the distinct sandbanks had both fish and epifaunal assemblages that were distinct from those sandbanks considered to be extensions of nearshore sediments. The distinct sandbanks were typified by low species diversity and shared indicator species such as the weever fish Echiichthys vipera, the shrimp Philocheras trispinosus and the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. Differences occurred in species composition among the distinct sandbanks, in particular, southern sandbanks were typified by sand sole Solea lascaris and small-eyed ray <b>Raja</b> <b>microocellata.</b> The sandbanks considered as extensions of nearshore sediments shared many similarities with the Pleuronectes platessa–Limanda limanda assemblage, identified by Ellis et al. (Estuar. Coastal Shelf Sci. 51 (2000) 299), which is widespread in the Irish Sea. Sandbanks, as a habitat definition under the EU habitats directive, are likely to incorporate a number of physically and biologically distinct habitats of which two have been described in the present study...|$|E
40|$|The {{systematics}} {{and some}} aspects on {{the biology of}} a dracunculoid nematode and opistholebetid trematodes parasitic in tetraodontiforms are presented. Moravecia australiensis Ribu and Lester 2004, a new dracunculoid genus and species, is described from gill filaments of the green porcupine fish Tragulichthys jaculiferus (Cuvier) (Tetraodontiformes: Diodontidae) in Moreton Bay. The absence of a buccal capsule, a divided oesophagus, a functional vulva and a single ovary in females {{and the presence of}} caudal alae and spicules in males, are typical characters of the Guyanemidae. This family has four known genera; Guyanema and Travassosnema are exclusively parasites of freshwater fish in South America, Pseudodelphis is a parasite of the tidepool sculpin in Canada and perciform fish in Argentina, and Histodytes in the elasmobranch <b>Raja</b> <b>microocellata</b> off the European Atlantic Coast. Existing species are parasitic in the body cavity except for T. travassosi parasitic in the eye, H. microocellatus in various tissues including gills and P. limnicola in the heart. The new genus differs from these genera by its fine cuticular transverse striations, two forward protruding cephalic elevations, a small mouth surrounded by 6 cephalic papillae arranged in two lateral clusters of three each and a pair of large lateral amphids. The males have only two pairs of pedunculated caudal papillae supporting the caudal alae. A key to the genera of the Family Guyanemidae is presented...|$|E
40|$|Five species {{contribute}} to the landings of the south eastern ray fishery, <b>Raja</b> <b>microocellata</b> being additional to the four more generally encountered in the Irish Sea. Fishing logs from 17 vessels were examined; they described more than 26, 000 hours of fishing effort, {{most of it in}} division Vllg. Auction records contained a higher than expected proportion of small grades. The fishery is assessed as being more heavily exploited than the ray fisheries of division Vila. As far as possible, growth curves of rays in Irish waters were calculated on the fully recruited age groups. Values for L∞ were greater for females than males of all species; those for R. montagui and R. naevus are less than in other published accounts. Values of K range between 0. 19 and 0. 33 while values of to are between - 3. 009 and + 0. 49. In general, there is more variability in the values of to than is warranted by life cycles which are basically similar. Fishermen sort rays primarily on their size and secondarily on their external appearance, certain species having greater values than others. The supply of fish influences the outcome, insufficient quantities requiring that fish which would normally be segregated are bulked. Another Influence is the local occurrence of certain species. Statistical associations among species differ with grade, the smaller growing species rarely gaining access to the larger grades; when they do they are usually associated with species of lesser value. Rays are probably most effectively sampled by working on size grades within which samples are chosen at random...|$|E
40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (<b>Raja</b> <b>microocellata)</b> and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|E
