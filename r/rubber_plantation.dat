5|$|During the French colonial administration, educated Vietnamese were {{employed}} in the civil service administration as secretaries, clerks and bureaucrats. When Cambodia gained independence in 1953, the Sihanouk-led government phased {{out most of the}} Vietnamese civil servants with Cambodians, and they sought employment in banks and commercial enterprises as secretaries and other office-based positions. In the 1960s, urban-dwelling Vietnamese with lower education backgrounds also worked as mechanics in car repair and machine shops owned by Chinese businessmen. Vietnamese immigrants that settled in the countryside worked as fishermen along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong river, and also as <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation</b> workers in Kampong Cham and Kratie provinces.|$|E
5|$|Following {{accusations of}} forced labour {{on the large}} American-owned Firestone <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation</b> and American accusations of slave trading, the Liberian {{government}} asked the League to launch an investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice-president. The Liberian government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Beebe {{traveled}} to Georgetown {{in pursuit of}} his earlier goal of establishing a permanent field research station in Guiana. After following several leads which came to nothing, his goal was realized when George Withers, who owned a <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation</b> on the Mazaruni River, offered him {{the use of a}} large house on his property for this purpose. Soon after Beebe and his researchers moved into the plantation house, which was known by the name of Kalacoon, they were paid a visit by Theodore Roosevelt and his family. Roosevelt subsequently wrote an article about the station for Scribner's Magazine, which helped to build public support for the station.|$|E

These detailed unlawful killings and other abuses made by Abir and Leopold II was embarrassed into instituting reforms. These began with the appointment of American Richard Mohun by Leopold II as director of Abir. However, rubber exports continued to fall and rebellions increased, resulting in the Free State assuming control of the concession in 1906. Abir continued to receive a portion of profits from rubber exports and in 1911 was refounded as a <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation</b> harvesting company. The later history of the company is unknown but it was still active in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Japan was defeated, the {{communist}} fighters renamed themselves the Malayan National Liberation Army, {{and began to}} agitate against British rule. Using the arms that Britain had given them—which they had cached, and then subsequently retrieved—they formed themselves into eight regiments, and began a campaign of Maoist-style rural subversion, their intent being to politicise the villagers and gain popular support, which they could then use {{to take control of}} Malayan cities. In March 1948, the MCP called on the Malayan people to rise up against the British. Three months later, on 16 June, MNLA guerrillas killed three British <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation</b> managers in Perak province.

5|$|While {{pursuing}} the Viet Cong, a helicopter gunship from the U.S. 68th Assault Helicopter Company {{was shot down}} and crashed in the Quảng Giao <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation,</b> about four kilometres away from Bình Giã, killing four of its crewmen. On December 31, the U.S. Marines Advisory Group sent a team of four personnel, led by Captain Donald G. Cook, to Bình Giã to observe conditions on the battlefield. At the same time, the 4th Marine Battalion was ordered to locate the crashed helicopter and recover {{the bodies of the}} dead American crewmen. Acting against the advice of his American advisor, Major Nguyễn Văn Nho, commander of the 4th Marine Battalion, sent his 2/4th Marine Battalion company out to the Quảng Giao <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation.</b> Unknown to the 4th Marine Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment had assembled in the plantation. About one hour after they had departed from the village of Bình Giã, the commander of the 2/4th Marine Battalion reported via radio that his troops had found the helicopter wreckage, and the bodies of four American crewmen. Shortly afterwards, the Viet Cong opened fire and the 2/4th Marine Battalion was forced to pull back. In an attempt to save the 2nd Company, the entire 4th Marine Battalion was sent out to confront the Viet Cong. As the lead element of the 4th Marine Battalion closed in on the Quảng Giao plantation, they were hit by accurate Viet Cong artillery fire, which was soon followed by repeated human wave attacks. Having absorbed heavy casualties from the Viet Cong's ambush, the 2/4th Marine Battalion had to fight {{their way out of the}} plantation with their bayonets fixed. During the entire ordeal, the company did not receive artillery support because the plantation was beyond the range of 105mm artillery guns based in Phước Tuy and Bà Rịa. They however escaped with the crucial support of the U.S. aircraft and helicopters whose rocket attacks forced the enemy to pull back and halted their attempt at pursuit.|$|E

Barely two years later, the {{spinster}} who had purchased her died, and Ho was sold by the woman's nephew, to become a maid. After a few years she was sold again. In her late teens, a group of snakeheads persuaded her and several other girls to emigrate to Singapore, ostensibly {{to work on a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation,</b> but the job did not materialise. At the age of 21, alone and penniless, she married the owner of a grocery business. When the business failed, they left for Hong Kong, hoping for better fortune. Ho became a hairdresser in nearby Macau, but after discovering that her husband had another wife and children she decided to return to Singapore alone, vowing never to remarry. At about that same time, she became a vegetarian.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Stauffer's {{battalion}} was deployed {{into new}} blocking positions, as Viet Cong units {{were believed to}} be moving toward the Michelin <b>Rubber</b> <b>Plantation.</b> On October 11, Cavazos led two of his companies out on a northward probe, and they were immediately attacked by the Viet Cong. While under heavy fire, Cavazos ordered the lead company to pull back behind a perimeter formed by the second company. As the lead company fell back, artillery and air support were called in to pummel the Viet Cong's attacking formation. When the battle was over, 21 Viet Cong soldiers were found dead, whereas U.S. casualties for the day were 1 killed and 4 wounded. Shortly afterwards, Cavazos' battalion pulled back to Phuoc Vinh for rest and refitting. By mid-October, Hay believed the Viet Cong's 271st Regiment had suffered a major defeat and was ready to withdraw from the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, so he was ready to terminate Shenandoah II. However, increased Viet Cong activity near the Ong Thanh Stream, where the 1st Brigade made most of its contacts, had indicated otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion {{landed on the}} battlefield, the Viet Cong had intercepted a radio {{conversation}} between the aforementioned unit and the 52nd Ranger Battalion in the district centre; several months earlier the 7th Airborne Battalion {{was involved in the}} battle at Bình Giã, so they vowed to avenge the loss of their comrades. Thus, from the soccer field, the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion marched up to Thuận Lợi, against only light opposition. The South Vietnamese paratroopers arrived at the area where the first group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was dropped off and they collected seven survivors and 55 bodies. In the afternoon, as elements of the 7th Airborne Battalion moved through the Thuận Lợi <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation</b> to search for remnants of the second group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment started attacking the South Vietnamese paratroopers in a manner which had characterised earlier ambushes. Taking advantage of the poor weather conditions that had limited U.S. air strikes, as well as their numerical superiority, the Viet Cong broke the South Vietnamese formation into small groups and destroyed many of them. On the next day, the strength of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion was reduced from 470 to just 159 soldiers.|$|E

5|$|While {{fighting}} raged {{inside the}} district, all flyable aircraft from the 118th Aviation Company flew out from Biên Hòa to Phước Vinh, {{a small town}} about 30 kilometres from Đồng Xoài. From Phước Vinh the first contingent of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was airlifted into the battlefield. At around 8am, the UH-1 formations of the 118th Aviation Company descend on the landing zone near the Thuận Lợi <b>rubber</b> <b>plantation,</b> about 4 kilometres north of Đồng Xoài; they immediately began to receive fire from bunkers and foxholes surrounding the area. The South Vietnamese command believed the landing zone near Thuận Lợi would be ideal to land their troops, because it was distant enough that the Viet Cong would not find and engage them immediately. However, the Viet Cong had anticipated the South Vietnamese would land troops in the area, and had prepared for an ambush. As a result, after U.S. helicopters had departed from the landing zone, soldiers of the Viet Cong 271st Regiment immediately turned their attention on the South Vietnamese. Within 15 minutes {{the main body of}} the ARVN 1st Battalion was completely destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Unprecedented {{economic}} growth in South-East Asia has encouraged the expansion of <b>rubber</b> <b>plantations.</b> Outbreaks of vector-borne diseases occur in these plantations, yet data on the vector dynamics is limited. In this thesis I describe the mosquito ecology in <b>rubber</b> <b>plantations</b> compared to neighbouring habitats in northern Lao PDR, to assess the risk of vector-borne diseases for rubber workers and villagers, and to identify how to mitigate these risks. I carried out a study to identify an ethically sound alternatives to human landing catches (HLC). The human-baited Double Net trap (HDN) collected similar numbers of Anopheles and Culex as HLC, but under-estimated the number of Aedes albopictus. As both HLC and HDN are crude ways of identifying the human-biting rate, the HDN is a representative method to estimate the human-biting rate outdoors without exposing collectors to mosquito bites. Using the HDN, I compared the adult mosquito dynamics in the secondary forests, immature <b>rubber</b> <b>plantations,</b> mature <b>rubber</b> <b>plantations</b> and villages. A total of 113 species were identified, including 61 species not documented in Lao PDR before The highest number of mosquitoes were collected in the secondary forests. Three of the four most common species found were vector species; the dengue and chikungunya vector Ae. albopictus, the lymphatic filariasis vector Ar. kesseli and the JE vector Cx. vishnui. Additionally, in all habitats a daily exposure to malaria vectors was found. To assess the risk of exposure to vector-borne diseases I explored the local human behaviour using sociological methods. Compared to staying in the village, dengue exposure risk increased when working in the plantations, which was exasperated when also living in these man-made forests. By contrast, malaria vector exposure risk decreased when living in the plantations. I identified the characteristics of mosquito breeding sites in <b>rubber</b> <b>plantations</b> and villages. Aedes albopictus immature stages were most frequently collected from tyres and latex collection cups in the mature <b>rubber</b> <b>plantations</b> and from tyres and water containers (10 L) in the villages. A majority of the Cx. quinquefasciatus were collected from water containers (10 L) in the mature <b>rubber</b> <b>plantations</b> and villages. Anopheles dirus s. l. were mostly collected from puddles in the immature <b>rubber</b> <b>plantations</b> and villages. This thesis {{emphasizes the importance of}} implementing mosquito control in the <b>rubber</b> <b>plantations</b> for the control of dengue disease. Larval control and personal protection methods are possible vector control methods for our study area. The successful implementation of vector control requires an inter-sectoral approach, with strong collaboration between the health sector, rubber industry and local communities...|$|R
