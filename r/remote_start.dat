40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{globalization}} strategy {{that can be}} used in unconstrained optimization algorithms to support rapid convergence from <b>remote</b> <b>starting</b> points. Our approach is based on using multiple points at each iteration to build a representative model of the objective function.

We give a global convergence result and also provide parallel implementation details accompanied with a numerical study. Our numerical study shows that the proposed algorithm is a promising alternative as a globalization strategy. Comment: Submitted for publicatio...|$|R

5000|$|Because nothing social exists {{outside the}} text, papers, {{archives}} and documents constitute the fundamental {{elements of the}} social world.

Naked life is nothing but a <b>remote</b> <b>starting</b> point and culture begins very early making for a clothed life, which is manifested in registrations and imitations: languages, behaviors and rites.

5000|$|Besides {{the armor}} itself, many other {{protective}} modifications are available: automatic fire extinguishers, run-flat tires, an explosion-resistant fuel tank, <b>remote</b> <b>starting</b> of the car, pressure and temperature {{control of the}} tires, a siren or alarm, and an intercom between the exterior and interior of the car, and a PA system, so that the bodyguards inside the car can communicate via a megaphone to individuals outside the car. Sometimes the inside can be sealed or over-pressured, using its own air supply, to protect against poison gas or tear gas attacks. As a side benefit, armored cars give occupants added protection from intrusion during a car accident.|$|R
