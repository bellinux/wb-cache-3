60|$|There would however be a <b>radical</b> <b>error</b> in {{attributing}} this instantaneous {{transition of}} {{feeling in the}} philosopher, {{to any one of}} those causes which might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. Indeed, Pierre Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to understand of his disposition, was of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate an observer of men and things should have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To say no more, the conformation of his visiter's feet was sufficiently remarkable--he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall hat--there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his breeches--and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact. Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all times entertained the most unqualified respect. He was, however, too much of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to appear at all conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading his guest into the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas, which might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication, enlighten the human race, {{and at the same time}} immortalize himself--ideas which, I should have added, his visitor's great age, and well-known proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have enabled him to afford.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral density {{functional}} theories, chosen {{among the}} most popular, are shown to systematically overestimate three-electron bond dissociation energies {{in a series of}} model systems covering the full range of homonuclear three-electron X∴X bonds (X = He, N, O, F, Ne, P, S, Cl, Ar) that can be found in organic cation <b>radicals.</b> The <b>errors</b> range from 15 to 54 kcal/mol with the SVWN local spin density method, from 6 to 45 kcal/mol with the gradient-corrected BLYP, BP 86, and BPW 91 functionals, and from 3 to 31 kcal/mol with the B 3 LYP, B 3 P 86, and B 3 PW 91 three-parameter hybrid functionals. The errors follow some regular tendencies according to the place of the X atom in the periodic table. The geometries and frequencies are also in error, the bond lengths being systematically too long and the frequencies too low. The errors are tentatively interpreted as consequences of electron self-interaction, leading to overstabilization of the Coulombic terms relative to the exchange-correlation terms in this type of bonds. At variance with these systematic errors, the BH&HLYP functional displays overall better results but still severely fails in some particular cases.

40|$|Abstract. The {{hydrostatic}} {{seal rings}} {{are one of}} the most important components used in reactor coolant pumps. They are generally made of hard materials such as silicon nitride, alumina, silicon carbide and tungsten carbide. Meanwhile, the form error should be within the length of one to two helium light bands and the surface roughness should be in the scale of nanometers, which make them difficult to machining. In order to solve this problem, a high accuracy grinding method using a large cup wheel had been proposed and the tilt angle of the cup wheel spindle become a crucial factor affecting the ground form errors. This paper addresses a novel method for high-accuracy calibrating the tilt angle of the cup wheel spindle to fit the extremely shallow taper angle of the seal ring conical surface, and the mathematical model is established incorporating a standard optical flat with a high-accuracy laser displacement sensor. The practicability of this method is verified by grinding a seal ring sample with the outer diameter is 200 mm and the taper angle is 700 µrad. It is found that the taper angle error is only 1. 72 µrad and the <b>radical</b> profile <b>error</b> of the conical surface is about 0. 22 µm...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} {{evidence}} supporting {{the existence of}} logographeme as a unit of representation during Chinese character recognition. Radicals have long been considered a basic unit in Chinese character recognition. However, in studies of dysgraphic patients, writing errors in characters could not be regarded as <b>radical</b> level <b>errors</b> but were considered logographeme level substitution errors (Law & Leung, 2000; Han, Zhang, Shu & Bi, 2007). To assess whether logographeme also affect the recognition process as found in writing studies, logographeme type frequency (high versus low) and logographeme token frequency (high versus low) were investigated using an event-related potential (ERP) lexical decision task. An interaction between logographeme type and token frequency was found at the occipital N 170 component with greater negativity in high type-low token frequency and low type-high token frequency logographemes. Low logographeme type frequency also showed greater negativity at the N 400 component. No logographeme effects or interactions {{were found in the}} P 100 and P 200 components. This study provides evidence supporting the existence of logographeme as a unit in Chinese character recognition and that logographemes are activated during orthographic processing stage and perhaps during lexical-semantic retrieval. published_or_final_versionSpeech and Hearing SciencesBachelorBachelor of Science in Speech and Hearing Science...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is the butler," [...] said Essper George, who now spoke {{for the first time}} since his {{dismissal}} from the room. Vivian did not answer him; not because he entertained any angry feeling on account of his exceedingly unpleasant visit. By no means: it was impossible for a man like Vivian Grey to cherish an irritated feeling for a second. But he did not exchange a syllable with Essper George, merely because he was not in the humour to speak. He could not refrain from musing on the singular events of the last few days; and, above all, the character of Beckendorff particularly engrossed his meditation. Their conversation of the preceding night excited in his mind new feelings of wonder, and revived emotions which he thought were dead or everlastingly dormant. Apparently, the philosophy on which Beckendorff had regulated his career, and by which he had arrived at his pitch of greatness, was exactly the same with which he himself, Vivian Grey, had started in life; which he had found so fatal in its consequences; which he believed to be so vain in its principles. How was this? What <b>radical</b> <b>error</b> had he committed? It required little consideration. Thirty, and more than thirty, years had passed over the head of Beckendorff ere the world felt his power, or indeed was conscious of his existence. A deep student, not only of man in detail, but of man in groups; not only of individuals, but of nations; Beckendorff had hived up his ample knowledge of all subjects which could interest his fellow-creatures, and when that opportunity which in this world occurs to all men occurred to Beckendorff he was prepared. With acquirements equal to his genius, Beckendorff depended only upon himself, and succeeded. Vivian Grey, with a mind inferior to no man's, dashed on the stage, in years a boy, though in feelings a man. Brilliant as might have been his genius, his acquirements necessarily were insufficient. He could not depend only upon himself; a consequent necessity arose to have recourse to the assistance of others; to inspire them with feelings which they could not share; and humour and manage the petty weaknesses which he himself could not experience. His colleagues were, at the same time, to work for the gratification of their own private interests, the most palpable of all abstract things; and to carry into execution a great purpose, which their feeble minds, interested only by the first point, cared not to comprehend. The unnatural combination failed, and its originator fell. To believe that he could recur again to the hopes, the feelings, the pursuits of his boyhood, he felt to be the vainest of delusions. It was the expectation of a man like Beckendorff, whose career, though difficult, though hazardous, had been uniformly successful; of a man who mistook cares for grief, and anxiety for sorrow.|$|E
60|$|After the {{explanations}} so fully entered into {{on the subject}} of propositions, much further discussion can not be necessary to make the <b>radical</b> <b>error</b> of this view of ratiocination apparent. If the word man connoted mortality; if the meaning of “mortal” were involved in the meaning of “man;” we might, undoubtedly, evolve the conclusion from the minor alone, because the minor would have already asserted it. But if, as is in fact the case, the word man does not connote mortality, how does it appear that in the mind of every person who admits Socrates to be a man, the idea of man must include the idea of mortality? Dr. Brown could not help seeing this difficulty, and in order to avoid it, was led, contrary to his intention, to re-establish, under another name, that step in the argument which corresponds to the major, by affirming the necessity of previously perceiving the relation between the idea of man and the idea of mortal. If the reasoner has not previously perceived this relation, he will not, says Dr. Brown, infer because Socrates is a man, that Socrates is mortal. But even this admission, though amounting to a surrender of the doctrine that an argument consists of the minor and the conclusion alone, will not save the remainder of Dr. Brown’s theory. The failure of assent to the argument does not take place merely because the reasoner, for want of due analysis, does not perceive that his idea of man includes the idea of mortality; it takes place, much more commonly, because in his mind that relation between the two ideas has never existed. And in truth it never does exist, except as the result of experience. Consenting, {{for the sake of the}} argument, to discuss the question on a supposition of which we have recognized the radical incorrectness, namely, that the meaning of a proposition relates to the ideas of the things spoken of, and not to the things themselves; I must yet observe, that the idea of man, as a universal idea, the common property of all rational creatures, can not involve any thing but what is strictly implied in the name. If any one includes in his own private idea of man, as no doubt is always the case, some other attributes, such for instance as mortality, he does so only as the consequence of experience, after having satisfied himself that all men possess that attribute: so that whatever the idea contains, in any person’s mind, beyond what is included in the conventional signification of the word, has been added to it as the result of assent to a proposition; while Dr. Brown’s theory requires us to suppose, on the contrary, that assent to the proposition is produced by evolving, through an analytic process, this very element out of the idea. This theory, therefore, may be considered as sufficiently refuted; and the minor premise must be regarded as totally insufficient to prove the conclusion, except with the assistance of the major, or of that which the major represents, namely, the various singular propositions expressive of the series of observations, of which the generalization called the major premise is the result.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{categorization}} of theories of aging into programmed and stochastic ones is outdated and obsolete. Biological aging {{is considered to}} occur mainly {{during the period of}} survival beyond the natural or essential lifespan (ELS) in Darwinian terms. Organisms survive to achieve ELS by virtue of genetically determined longevity assuring maintenance and repair systems (MRS). Aging at the molecular level is characterized by the progressive accumulation of molecular damage caused by environmental and metabolically generated free <b>radicals,</b> by spontaneous <b>errors</b> in biochemical reactions, and by nutritional components. Damages in the MRS and other pathways lead to age-related failure of MRS, molecular heterogeneity, cellular dysfunctioning, reduced stress tolerance, diseases and ultimate death. A unified theory of biological aging in terms of failure of homeodynamics comprising of MRS, and involving genes, milieu and chance, is acquiring a definitive shape and wider acceptance. Such a theory also establishes the basis for testing and developing effective means of intervention, prevention and modulation of aging...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{data have}} {{suggested}} that clinical T stage is not independently associated with biochemical recurrence of localized prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. One explanation for this lack of predictive power may be the inaccurate application of staging criteria. Methods: Data from men in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database with localized prostate cancer (clinical T 1 -T 2) were analyzed. Correct stage was determined by digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings and was compared with the clinical stage reported directly by the practitioner. DRE/TRUS findings and biopsy results were evaluated to determine factors influencing staging errors. The ability of corrected stage to predict biochemical disease recurrence after prostatectomy was assessed using multivariable analysis. Results: Clinical stage was assigned incorrectly in 1370 of 3875 men (35. 4 %). Errors more commonly resulted in patient downstaging than upstaging (55. 1 % vs 44. 9 %; P <. 001). Patients with TRUS lesions {{were more likely to}} be staged incorrectly than those with abnormal DRE findings (65. 8 % vs 38. 2 %; P <. 001). Biopsy laterality was found to strongly influence stage assignment. Even after correction of staging errors, there was no association noted between clinical stage and biochemical disease recurrence after <b>radical</b> prostatectomy. Conclusions: <b>Errors</b> in applying clinical staging criteria for localized prostate cancer are common. TRUS findings are frequently disregarded, and practitioners incorrectly incorporate biopsy results when assigning stage. However, staging errors do not appear to account for the inconsistent reliability of clinical stage in predicting prostate cancer outcomes. These findings further challenge the utility of a DRE-based and/or TRUS-based staging system for risk assessment of localized prostate cancer. © 2010 American Cancer Society...|$|R
40|$|The number, symmetry, and product-forming {{capabilities}} of the intermediates in the photoinitiated reductions of endo- and exo- 5 - bromonorbornene and 2 -bromonortricyclene with tri-n-butyltin hydride at temperatures between - 10 ° and 22 ° were investigated. Three mechanisms were evaluated: 1. The 5 -norbornenyl- and 2 -nortricyclyl radicals isomerize reversibly with the former producing nortricyclene by abstraction of hydrogen from tri-n-butyltin hydride. 2. The 5 -norbornenyl- and 2 -nortricyclyl radicals isomerize reversibly, but some norbornene can be formed from the 2 -nortricyclyl radical or some nortricyclene can be formed from the 5 -norbornenyl radical by abstraction of hydrogen. 3. There is intervention of a "bridged" radical which may be for med reversibly or irreversibly from the 5 -norbornenyl- and 2 -nortricyclyl <b>radicals.</b> Within small <b>error</b> limits, the ratios of norbornene to nortricyclene {{as a function of}} the concentration of tri-n-butyltin hydride are consistent with the first mechanism. In the reductions with tri-n-butyltin deuteride, primary deuterium isotope effects of 2. 3 and 2. 1 for the abstraction of deuterium by the 2 -nortricyclyl- and 5 -norbornenyl radicals, respectively, were found. The primary deuterium isotope effects were invariant with the concentration of tri-n-butyltin deuteride, although the ratios of norbornene to nortricyclene changed appreciably over this range. This is consistent with the first mechanism, and can accommodate the formation of either product from more than one intermediate only if the primary kinetic deuterium isotope effects are nearly equal for all reactions leading to the single product. The reduction of endo- 5 -bromonorbornene- 5, 6, 6 -d 3 with tri-n-butyltin hydride or tri-n-butyltin deuteride leads to both unrearranged and rearranged norbornenes. The ratios of unrearranged to rearranged norbornene require that the 5 -norbornenyl- 5, 6, 6 -d 3 radical isomerize to an intermediate with the symmetry expected of a nortricyclyl free radical. The results are consistent with mechanism 1, but imply a surprising normal secondary kinetic deuterium isotope effect of about 1. 25 for the abstraction of hydrogen by the 5 -norbornenyl- 5, 6, 6 -d 3 radical. Approximate calculations show that there does not appear to be any substantial difference in the stabilities of the 5 -norbornenyl and 2 -nortricyclyl radicals. Although the results can not exclude a small contribution by a mechanism other than mechanism 1, no such contribution is required to adequately explain the results. ...|$|R
