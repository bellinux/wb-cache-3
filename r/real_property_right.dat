40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} conceptual model for classification of <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> and public regulations. The model is called the Legal Cadastral Domain Model. The model is intended to be a terminological framework for cross-border exchange of cadastral information. Parties exchanging cadastral information via the model do not require detailed knowledge of the legal system in which the right or regulation is created. The model is based on the principle that <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> and public regulations influence <b>real</b> <b>property</b> ownership by being either beneficial or encumbering for the <b>real</b> <b>property</b> owner. The theoretical departure of the research presented in this thesis is in comparative legal theory and terminology. <b>Real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> and public regulations are important parts of <b>real</b> <b>property</b> legislation as they describe and secure the use and other exploitation of land, water and air. The research is conducted through studies in <b>real</b> <b>property</b> legislation and associated literature. The model has been developed through case studies on <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> in Portugal, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden and public regulations in Portugal and Sweden. The generated results show that it seems possible to describe <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> and public regulations regardless of their legal origin, at least in Western legal systems.

40|$|Because {{increasing}} numbers of Indigenous people are choosing {{to work within the}} legal and political institutions of their colonisers to achieve native title recognition and respect, a critical question is: can (post-) colonial legal and political institutions meaningfully redress the historic and ongoing dispossession of Indigenous Peoples or does the colonial nature of these institutions inherently predispose them to (intentionally or unintentionally) perpetuate dispossession? This study seeks to answer this critical question by analyzing the legal and political accommodation of native title in Canada and Australia using the neo-institutional lens of path dependence as an explanatory analytic framework. In sum, characterizing native title 2 ̆ 7 s legal and political accommodation as a selfreinforcing path dependent sequence, this study argues that the different degrees of recognition and accommodation afforded native title by the legal and political institutions of (post-) colonial Canada and Australia can be meaningfully explained with reference to these countries 2 ̆ 7 different (and historically contingent) recognition and accommodation of indigenous rights to land during their earliest years of colonial settlement.

40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} {{the treatment}} of certain aspects of real property under the civil codes of Qatar and California, two jurisdictions with very different histories and cultures but somewhat less different economies and environments. Despite their different starting points, the two civil codes have created similar, albeit far from identical, structures to achieve similar goals. This article explores the premise that similar environments - physical, economic, or otherwise - exert, in the long run, a greater pressure {{on the development of}} the law governing real property than do history and culture. The real property regimes of Qatar and California converge in many aspects. The nature of the <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>right,</b> while couched in civil law terms in one and common law terms in the other, includes in each case the rights of exclusion, use, enjoyment, and alienability. The forms of ownership in each vary according to legal tradition, with Qatar using the simpler civil law forms while California indulges in the more Churrigueresque edifice of estates and future interests; nonetheless, both ultimately achieve more or less the same ends. The forms of co-ownership differ to some extent, while private limitations on property rights differ rather less. The differences in these areas can be traced to cultural differences and to differences inherited by the two legal systems in question, each itself a hybrid of sorts, from the common law and civil law traditions. The greatest points of divergence, however, spring from differences in environment. The different treatment of ownership of land by foreigners provides an example of considerable divergence. On the other hand, the concept of waqf in Islamic law, incorporated into the Qatar Civil Code, bears a greater resemblance to the Anglo-American concept of charitable trust (although the two may have arisen independently) than it does to anything in the civil law tradition. This article considers the relevant provisions of the two civil codes in order to identify and, where possible, explain such divergences and convergences, in the hopes of assisting attorneys and scholars versed in either. يقوم هذا البحث بمقارنة ومقاربة طريقة معالجة بعض الجوانب المتعلقة بالملكية العقارية في القانونين المدنيين لكل من قطر وكاليفورنيا، وكلاهما ينتمي لنظام قضائي مختلف تاريخياً وثقافياً، ولكن متشابه إلى حد ما اقتصادياً وبيئياً. وبالرغم من اختلاف النظامين القانونيين من حيث نقاط انطلاقهما، إلا أن بنيتهما متشابهة، وإن لم تكن متطابقة ، في سعيها لتحقيق نفس الأهداف. وتتبنى هذه الدراسة فرضية أن تشابه البيئات - شكلاً أو اقتصاداً أو خلاف ذلك - يشكل على المدى الطويل ضغطاً كبيراً يدفع نحو تطوير القانون المنظم للملكية العقارية ، وهو ما يفوق الدور الذي يقوم به التاريخ والثقافة. ومن هنا يتلاقى نظامي الملكية العقارية في قطر وكاليفورنيا في العديد من الجوانب. إن طبيعة حق الملكية العقارية برغم من صياغته وفقاً للقانون المدني في أحد النظامين ووفقاً للقانون العام في النظام الآخر ، يشمل في كلتا الحالتين حق الاستئثار والاستعمال والاستغلال والتصرف. وتتباين صور وأشكال الملكية في كل منهما وفقاً للأعراف القانونية، فتستخدم قطر أبسط صور القانون المدني ، وتسترسل كاليفورنيا في فخامة صروح العقارات والفوائد المستقبلية، ولكن كلاهما في النهاية يحقق الغايات ذاتها. كما تختلف أيضاً أشكال الملكية المشتركة إلى حد ما في كلا القانونين، ولكن ينحسر ذلك الاختلاف نوعاً ما فيما يخص القيود الخاصة المفروضة على حقوق الملكية. ورغم أن هذه الفروق قد تعزى إلى الاختلافات الثقافية والاختلافات التي ورثها النظامين القانونيين محل الدراسة - وكل منهما يمثل مزيجاً من القوانين في حد ذاته – من أعراف القانونين المدني والعام، إلا أن معظم مواطن الاختلاف نشأت بسبب تباين الظروف البيئية. وخير مثال على التفاوت الشاسع بين النظامين القانونيين هو اختلاف معالجتهما لتمليك الأجانب للأراضي. من جهة أخرى، ينطوي مفهوم "الوقف" في الشريعة الإسلامية، المدرج ضمن القانون المدني القطري، على تشابه كبير مع المفهوم الأنجلو- أمريكي للصندوق الخيري (رغم أن كلا منهما نشأ مستقلاً عن الآخر) تتناول هذه المقالة الأحكام المتعلقة بالملكية العقارية في هذين القانونيين المدنيين من أجل تحديد، وشرح - إن أمكن – هذه الاختلافات والتوافقات، على أمل أن تسهم في مساعدة المحامين والفقهاء المختصين في كليهم...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{provision}} of <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> through titling and informal settlements upgrading is widely imagined to have considerable {{direct and indirect}} effects on urban poverty. The evidence for such effects is, however, scarce, partial rather than holistic, and subject to methodological difficulties. This thesis investigates the effects of <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> through two case-studies: the subsidized construction of privately-titled housing for poor people in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, and the private titling of public rental housing in Matero, Lusaka. It examines nine hypotheses drawn from theories {{about the effects of}} <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> but goes beyond to strengthen this literature by drawing on another ten hypotheses from theories of homeownership and a categorisation of all hypotheses into economic, human and social capital effects using the asset-based approach. The research design uses both quantitative and qualitative approaches and non-experimental methods of estimation. In Khayelitsha, quantitative analysis reveals that the housing subsidy is associated with better physical health and (counter-intuitively) a higher occurrence of teenage pregnancy. The qualitative analysis suggests that beneficiaries experienced improvements with respect to ownership of consumer durables, housing, children's education and attainment of a higher social status. Apart from status attainment, these improvements can more appropriately be attributed to a better housing environment rather than to stronger tenure rights. In Matero, survey results revealed that titling was associated with significantly higher property values, per capita income and ownership of consumer durables, political awareness and neighbourhood satisfaction. Qualitative analysis shows that beneficiaries experienced higher status, but also a worsening of their tenure security because of the long term costs of titling. In neither case was titling associated with improvements in most of my measures of poverty reduction, supporting the argument that the benefits of titling may be exaggerated through a focus on selected variables rather than a broader set of measures. By most measures, titling had no effect in either of my cases. Substantively, it is likely that poverty in Cape Town and Lusaka is driven so strongly by factors such as unemployment that <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> make little overall difference to poverty. Methodologically, these findings indicate the importance of using a diverse set of measures when testing whether (and revealing how) <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> reduce poverty. Scholars need to go beyond the orthodox titling theory and take into consideration hypotheses drawn from theories of homeownership because consideration of a wider range of effects leads to different assessments and conclusions as shown in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{imposition}} of exclusive statutory <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> {{in or near}} pastoralists’ areas and their migration corridors permanently excludes and extinguishes pastoralist rights to mobility and access to required resources. Seasonal interactions with non-pastoralist land use actors often occur during pastoralist migrations between rangelands and highlands or dry season grazing areas. In an embedded case study in Northern Kenya, in which interviews based on semi-structured questionnaires were held with pastoralists and non-pastoralists, we investigated how non-pastoralist land use actors manage encounters with migrating pastoralists {{within the context of}} the Land Administration system. We found that the majority of non-pastoralist land use actors encounter migrating pastoralists during distinct periods. Most never allow herders access to privately owned land. A small proportion allow access and make temporary verbal or written access agreements containing provisions on grazing fees, grazing regulations and rules to protect private property. The majority of non-pastoralists are unwilling to have access arrangements formalized. We argue that land rights adjudication should identify and confer all existing land rights to all users to avoid obstruction or renegotiation for access, and recommend the inclusion of pastoralists’ access <b>rights</b> as <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> in the Land Administration system...|$|R

The programmes promoting <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> tend to go together with measures to formalize, commodify, and individualize landholdings, and that these three processes often intensify the dispossession of women who may have had access to land under informal arrangements or customary law. The promotion of <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> from an economic perspective may well undermine the social rights of women in developing countries. Legal conceptions of property, treat property not as a mere resource but as a set of relations between individuals and groups.
