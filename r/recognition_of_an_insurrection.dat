40|$|This essay {{develops}} <b>an</b> {{economic theory}} <b>of</b> <b>insurrections.</b> The decision-making agents in this theory are an incumbent ruler, <b>a</b> potential leader <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>insurrection,</b> and <b>a</b> large number <b>of</b> peasant or worker families. The essay distinguishes insurrections that attempt only to appropriate current income from revolutions, which are insurrections {{that attempt to}} effect permanent change {{in the distribution of}} income through the appropriation of sovereign power. The analysis shows how the technology <b>of</b> <b>insurrection,</b> together with <b>a</b> discount factor, determines whether there is <b>an</b> <b>insurrection,</b> the allocation <b>of</b> resources among productive activities, soldiering, and insurgency, and the probable outcome <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>insurrection.</b> ...|$|R
