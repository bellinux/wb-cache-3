The paper presents the optimal <b>receding</b> horizon filtering equations.

This result could be a theoretical basis for the optimal control in nonlinear stochastic systems with incomplete information over the most recent time interval. The approximate solutions of the optimal <b>receding</b> horizon filtering equations are discussed.

5|$|Before Eline struck Mozambique, storm {{warnings}} and later hurricane warnings were issued on February21. Flooding had affected the nation since January, with some areas receiving a year's worth of rainfall in two weeks. Widespread areas were inundated, with about 220,000people displaced, and about 150people killed. Eline moved ashore with very powerful winds, {{although there were}} no direct observations of the strongest winds. In Beira, the closest major city to the landfall point, winds reached storm force. However, the rainfall from Eline was the most impacting following the preexisting flooding, which were the worst since 1951. The floods were beginning to <b>recede</b> by the time Eline arrived, {{and by the end}} of February 2000, the situation was considered the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Flooding continued for days after Eline moved through southern Africa due to waters flowing downstream from neighboring countries. By early March the floods were beginning to <b>recede</b> again, leaving behind a deep layer of mud, ponds of contaminated water, and piles of rotten corpses.|$|E

Using inverse cumulative distribution function, we convert the probabilistic state constraints to deterministic constraints, and obtain a tractable deterministic <b>receding</b> horizon control problem. We consider the <b>receding</b> horizon control law to have a linear state-feedback and an admissible offset term.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of crossmodal dynamic visual capture {{occurs when the}} direction of motion of a visual cue causes a weakening or reversal of the perceived direction of motion of a concurrently presented auditory stimulus. It is known {{that there is a}} perceptual bias towards looming compared to <b>receding</b> stimuli, and faster bimodal reaction times have recently been observed for looming cues compared to <b>receding</b> cues (Cappe et al., 2009). The current studies aimed to test whether visual looming cues are associated with greater dynamic capture of auditory motion in depth compared to <b>receding</b> signals. Participants judged the direction of an auditory motion cue presented with a visual looming cue (expanding disk), a visual <b>receding</b> cue (contracting disk), or visual stationary cue (static disk). Visual cues were presented either simultaneously with the auditory cue, or after 500 ms. We found increased levels of interference with looming visual cues compared to <b>receding</b> visual cues, compared to asynchronous presentation or stationary visual cues. The results could not be explained by the weaker subjective strength of the <b>receding</b> auditory stimulus, as in Experiment 2 the looming and <b>receding</b> auditory cues were matched for perceived strength. These results show that dynamic visual capture of auditory motion in the depth plane is modulated by an adaptive bias for looming compared to <b>receding</b> visual cues...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Although on-road vehicle {{detection}} is a well-researched area, overtaking and <b>receding</b> vehicle detection {{with respect}} to (w. r. t) the ego-vehicle is less addressed. In this paper, we present a novel appearance-based method for detecting both overtaking and <b>receding</b> vehicles w. r. t the ego-vehicle. The proposed method is based on Haar-like features that are classified using Adaboost-cascaded classifiers, which result in detection windows that are tracked in two directions temporally to detect overtaking and <b>receding</b> vehicles. A detailed and novel evaluation method is presented with 51 overtaking and <b>receding</b> events occurring in 27000 video frames. Additionally, {{an analysis of the}} detected events is presented, specifically for naturalistic driving studies (NDS) to characterize the overtaking and <b>receding</b> events during a drive.

5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects <b>recede</b> with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E
5|$|As the Universe expands, {{more distant}} objects <b>recede</b> from the Earth faster, {{in what is}} called the Hubble Flow. The light from very distant galaxies is {{significantly}} affected by the cosmological redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E
