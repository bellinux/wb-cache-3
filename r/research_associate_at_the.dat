On the physics faculty at the University of Tennessee from 1982–1988, he continued investigations of photoproduction of charmed particles and vector mesons at SLAC. He joined the SLD Collaboration, beginning preparations for an experiment at the SLAC Linear Collider. He studied the design of a uranium calorimeter for SLD and in 1985 published an analysis in collaboration with Tony A.

Using Monte Carlo calculations, Brau and Gabriel showed the importance of low energy neutron interactions with the readout medium hydrogen to achieve compensation.|$|E

40|$|The Tenth District economy {{improved}} overall during 1993 {{thanks to}} a booming construction sector and healthy growth in services. The district’s gain was uneven, however, because other major sectors of the region’s economy remained mixed. The agricultural and mining sectors were flat, while manufacturing continued to struggle. Economic performance diverged considerably across the seven district states. The New Mexico economy surged due to strong growth in construction and services. Oklahoma, Colorado, and Kansas also recorded strong growth, but Missouri, Wyoming, and Nebraska did not fare as well.
