40|$|We present CoolPaint, {{a system}} for {{computer}} painting that uses a props-based direct interaction technique. By instrumenting real <b>paint</b> <b>brushes</b> and developing corresponding digital models of the brushes, we allow the user to control digital tools by directly manipulating their physical counterparts. In addition, we use a tabletop display which allows the display space and interaction space to be unified. The painter picks up a real <b>paint</b> <b>brush,</b> dabs it in ‘paint’, and makes a brush stroke across the canvas. Digital paint immediately appears on the canvas, directly under the brush, with exactly the brush stroke the painter expects. The result is an intuitive, expressive, and fun painting experience. 1...|$|R
