[...] For this role a larger diameter (6ft 4 in, 1.93 m) propeller is fitted, increasing the rate of climb by 24%. A tow <b>release</b> <b>hook</b> is fitted under the tail.

30|$|A Max Rover MARK II ROV {{system was}} used for {{surveying}} marine litter. The Max Rover was operated in a live-boat mode, which allowed the ROV and the support R/V to be moved simultaneously. The ROV was deployed by a lifting crane with a <b>release</b> <b>hook,</b> from where it was released in the water. The pilots operated the ROV through the navigation consoles in which a TrackPoint positioning system (Tracklink 10000) and a sonar were included. The ROV has two Ocean ProHD cameras and two Normal video cameras, plus one very good zoom camera, while there is another HD camera and normal video camera for general purposed video. The HD video is recorded in two High Definition recorders.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical shock {{tests are}} very {{important}} for portable electronic products such as notebook computers and mobile phones because these products are subjected to high risks of impact loading. Impact loading often plays {{a critical role in}} the functional performance and mechanical reliability of electronic components and devices. Drop tests are adopted usually to the overall product to assess the structural and functional integrity. Traditional test method is to drop the products from a certain height with a quick <b>release</b> <b>hook</b> or drop tester. The obvious advantage for these methods is that they can directly duplicate the field impact scenarios. However, the test repeatability can not be guarantied in drop tests, because it is difficult to control the orientation of the object at impact and to instrument it. Moreover; by considering the real impact conditions, drop tests are not applicable for the shock reliability tests of individual components. Shock table tests are carried out to overcome the drawbacks described above. A shock impulse with a given shape, magnitude and duration is applied to the shock table and then imparted to the sample product or component fasted to the table. However, the shock table test is a simulation of the real-life drop impact process. To make the shock table tests adequately mimic the real drop impact, it is critical to make correlation between the shock table test parameter and field conditions. The present paper aims to conduct a systematic study, both experimentally and analytically, to evaluate the feasibility of using appropriate shock table tests to mimic the shock environment for components and systems adopted in portable electronics. Firstly, dynamic characteristics of typical portable electronic systems and components under drop impact are studied, and then effective shock table test methods are developed for adequately mimic the real-life impact state. At last, by comparing the typical results from shock table tests and those from drop tests, the correlation of shock table test parameters and drop tests conditions are investigated. ...|$|E

40|$|Mooring {{systems are}} one of the less evolved ship systems. For that reason, joined to the elevate number of mooring accidents, {{nowadays}} a few companies have developed innovative automatic mooring systems. With the base of one of these innovative systems, and using TIA Portal of Siemens, a software that allows the automation of mooring and leaving the berth was created. That base has been the quick <b>release</b> <b>hooks,</b> which permit remote release and a load monitoring of ropes. Main novelty of the Project is the automation of undocking operation. To do this, first of all, different sequences depending on wind and current directions have been established. Then, through relations between wind, current and ship dimensions, the direction of resultant force of wind and current, has been calculated. In a second term, the software incorporates different innovate functions for mooring operations. The most important of these functions is the movement of the bollards. That reduces the crew operations with the windless, because the load of ropes has been adjusted with the bollard movement. The result of all of this is a program that carries out all of the desired functions...|$|R
