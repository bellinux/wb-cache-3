40|$|The {{yield stress}} of {{amorphous}} glassy polymers depends strongly on the strain <b>rate,</b> <b>temperature,</b> and hydrostatic pressure.

2500|$|Referring to the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the allowed {{operating}} voltage for electrolytic capacitors {{is called the}} [...] "rated voltage UR" [...] or [...] "nominal voltage UN".

2500|$|An AC voltage {{will cause}} an AC current (with an applied DC bias {{this is also}} called [...] "ripple current"), with cyclic {{charging}} and discharging of the capacitor causing oscillating motion of the electric dipoles in the dielectric.

The maximum RMS alternating voltage at a given frequency which may be applied continuously to a capacitor (up to the <b>rated</b> <b>temperature)</b> {{is defined as the}} rated AC voltage UR AC. Rated AC voltages usually are specified at the mains frequency of a region (50 or 60nbsp&Hz).|$|E
2500|$|For metallized film capacitors, {{the maximum}} {{possible}} pulse voltage is limited {{because of the}} limited current-carrying capacity between contact of the electrodes and the electrodes themselves. The rated pulse voltage Vp is the peak value of the pulse voltage which may be applied continuously to a capacitor at the <b>rated</b> <b>temperature</b> and at a given frequency. The pulse voltage capacity is given as pulse voltage rise time dV/dT in V/µs and also implies the maximum pulse current capacity. The values on the pulse rise time refer to the rated voltage.

The permissible pulse load capacity of a film capacitor is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10°K is acceptable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Elastic–viscoplastic {{constitutive}} equations {{that enable}} the modelling of <b>rate</b> effects, <b>temperature</b> effects and dynamic recrystallization are employed {{to model the}} ring compression test at high temperatures. The effects of strain <b>rate</b> and <b>temperature</b> on the calibration curves, used widely to characterize frictional behaviour in forging, are investigated. Both strain <b>rate</b> and <b>temperature</b> are found to influence the calibration curves obtained, and {{it is found that}} the influence derives from the dependency of dynamic recrystallization processes on strain rate and tempera-ture. The coupling between the deformation and the recrystallization process is found to lead to the establish-ment of significantly different strain fields with different strain rates, and it is this that leads to the dependency of the calibration curves on strain <b>rate</b> and <b>temperature.</b> A methodology has been presented for the determination of friction calibration curves for hot forging of high-performance materials, which accounts for strain <b>rate</b> effects, <b>temperature</b> effects and recrystallization processes.

However, the longitudinal strength was significantly influenced by temperature and moisture content. A qualitative explanation for these observations is presented...|$|R
