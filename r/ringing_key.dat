5000|$|Third {{movement}}: {{the last}} movement of this sonata is {{unlike many of}} Mozart’s sonatas’ last movements, which tend to have fast tempo and joyfulness and happiness. This movement contains a great tragic sense that really makes it stand out. [...] The subject, which is unusually long, consists of two parts, both ending with perfect cadences. The first is introduced quietly, with melody in the R.H. accompanied by L.H. chords, with much calmness. However the second has a great fiery sense to it. Both share distinct and separate ideas. This subject is ended by a prolonged cadential repetition. There is no passage of transition to the second subject, only a basic chord on Eb’s dominant seventh. The second subject then contains Alberti bass in the L.H., with a dancing, flowing melody in the R.H., completely changing the character in the <b>ringing</b> <b>key</b> of E. The second part of this subject is in fact based on a passage of the R.H. in the first movement. The bridge to the next section is modulated from E major to C minor. At this moment, we hear the original principal subject cut short into half. In its place, a dramatic series of chords of F minor’s diminished seventh, lasting for just one bar. This then {{gives way to the}} middle section of F minor. This motif is shown twice exactly the same, the first is shown, modulating into G minor, then C minor, where the same cut-in-half principal subject is heard. This is where the motif is repeated the second time, then giving way to the coda. The coda is founded from the second subject, starting in b. 262, with R.H leading the melody along with the L.H accompanying with broken chords. In b. 296, the Neapolitan sixth is found in C minor. The coda ends with a perfect cadence.|$|E
40|$|Cochlear microphonic {{potentials}} (CMs) {{were recorded}} from the sharply tuned, strongly resonant auditory foveae of 1 - to 5 -week-old mustached bats that were anesthetized with Rompun and Ketavet. The fovea processes Doppler-shifted echo {{responses of the}} constantfrequency component of echolocation calls. During development, the frequency and tuning sharpness of the cochlear resonance increases, and CM ringing persists for longer after the tone. CM is relatively insensitive at tone onset and grows linearly with increased stimulus level. During the tone, the CM is more sensitive and grows compressively with increased stimulus level and phase leads onset CM by 90 ° for frequencies below the resonance. CM during the ringing is also sensitive and compressive and phase leads onset CM by 180 ° below the resonance and lags it by 180 ° above the resonance. Throughout postnatal development, CMs measured during the tone and in the ringing increase both in sensitivity and compression. The cochlear resonance appears to be attributable to interaction between two oscillators. The more broadly tuned oscillator dominates the onset response, and the narrowly tuned oscillator dominates the ringing. Early in development, mechanical coupling between the oscillators results in a relatively broadly tuned system with several frequency modes in the CM at tone onset and in the CM ringing. Beating occurs between the resonance and the stimulus response during the tone and between two components of the narrowly tuned oscillator at tone offset. At maturity, the CM has three modes for frequencies within 10 kHz of the resonance at tone onset and a single, sharply tuned mode in the <b>ringing.</b> <b>Key</b> words: mustached bat; cochlea; microphonic potential; frequency tuning; resonance; synchronization; basilar membrane; tectoria...|$|E
