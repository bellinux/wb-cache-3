[...] The branching vein structure seen in Undulopsychopsis is most similar to the Early through Late Cretaceous genus Kagapsychops which {{has been found in}} Kazakhstan and Japan. The two genera can be distinguished by the overall size of the species, with Kagapsychops continentalis being two times as long in the forewing as Undulopsychopsis alexi. Kagapsychops also possesses a <b>radial</b> <b>space</b> with a graded group of crossveins. [...] The combination of costal space which lacks numerous crossveins, along with the multi-branched Rs1 and 1A veins, is a feature set found in another extinct Neuropteran family, Osmylopsychopidae.

40|$|We {{define a}} set of {{operators}} that localise a radial image in <b>radial</b> <b>space</b> and radial frequency simultaneously. We find the eigenfunctions of this operator and thus define a non-separable orthogonal set of radial wavelet functions that may be considered optimally concentrated over a region of <b>radial</b> <b>space</b> and radial scale space, defined via a doublet of parameters. We give analytic forms for their energy concentration over this region. We show how the radial function localisation operator can be generalised to an operator, localising any square integrable function in two dimensional Euclidean space. We show that the latter operator, with an appropriate choice of localisation region, approximately has the same eigenfunctions as the radial operator. Based on the radial wavelets we define {{a set of}} quaternionic valued wavelet functions that can extract local orientation for discontinuous signals and both orientation and phase structure for oscillatory signals. The full set of quaternionic wavelet functions are component wise orthogonal; hence their statistical properties are tractable, and we give forms for the variability of the estimates of the local phase and orientation, {{as well as the}} local energy of the image. By averaging estimates across wavelets, a substantial reduction in the variance is achieved. Comment: 28 pages, 12 Postscript figure...|$|E

Summary: “A space X is called selectively separable (R-separable) if for every sequence of dense subspaces (Dn: n ∈ ω) one can pick finite (respectively, one-point) subsets Fn ⊂ Dn such that n∈ω Fn is dense in X. These properties are much stronger than separability, but are equivalent to it in the presence of certain convergence properties. For example, we show that every Hausdorff separable <b>radial</b> <b>space</b> is R-separable and note that neither separable sequential nor separable Whyburn spaces have to be selectively separable. A space is called d-separable if it has a dense σ-discrete subspace. We call a space X D-separable if for every sequence of dense subspaces (Dn: n ∈ ω) one can pick discrete subsets Fn ⊂ Dn such that ⋃ n∈ω Fn is dense in X. Although d-separable spaces are often also D-separable (this is the case, for example, with linearly ordered d-separable or stratifiable spaces), we offer three examples of countable non-D-separable spaces...|$|E

Pressed cylindrical samples of 9. 5 mm diameter and density of 7. 0 ± 0. 1 g/cm 3 were prepared by compaction of Ancorsteel 1000 C iron powder. These samples, consti-tuting the central cathode, were positioned concentrically in the interior of an external cathode machined from a tube of stainless steel AISI 310 (containing: 25 % Cr, 16 % Ni, 1. 5 % Mn, 1. 5 % Si, 0. 03 % C and the remainder Fe). Sintering was done at 1150 °C, for 120 min, utilizing radial spacings between the central and hollow cathodes of 3, 6 and 9 mm and a gas mixture of 80 % Ar and 20 % H 2, with a flow rate of 5 cm 3 /s at a pressure of 3 Torr.

The eigen-functions are optimally concentrated over a given region of <b>radial</b> <b>space</b> and scale space, defined via a triplet of parameters. Analytic forms for the energy concentration of the functions over the re-gion are given. The radial function localization operator can be generalised to an operator localizing any 2 (2) function. It is demonstrated that the latter operator, given an appropriate choice of localization region, approximately has the same radial eigen-functions as the radial operator. Based on a given radial wavelet function a quaternionic wavelet is defined that can extract the local orientation of discontinuous signals as well as amplitude, orienta-tion and phase structure of locally oscillatory signals.
