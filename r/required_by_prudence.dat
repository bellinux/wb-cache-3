6000|$|It {{was truly}} news for an American, {{who had been}} so long cut off from {{intelligence}} from home, thus suddenly to be told that some of the scenes of the middle ages--scenes connected with real wrongs and gross abuses of human rights--were about to be enacted in his own land; that country which boasted itself, not only to be the asylum of the oppressed, but the conservator of the right. I was grieved at what I had heard, for, during my travels, I had cherished a much-loved image of justice and political excellence, that I now began to fear must be abandoned. My uncle and myself decided at once to return home, a step that indeed was <b>required</b> <b>by</b> <b>prudence.</b> I was now of an age to enter into the full possession of my own property (so far as [...] "new laws and new lords" [...] would permit); and the letters received by my late guardian, as well as certain newspapers, communicated the unpleasant fact that a great many of the tenants of Ravensnest had joined the association, paid tribute for the support of [...] "Injins," [...] and were getting to be as bad as any of the rest of them, so far as designs and schemes to plunder were concerned, though they still paid their rents. The latter circumstance was ascribed by our agent to the fact that many leases were about to fall in, and it would be in my power to substitute more honest and better disposed successors for the present occupants of the several farms. Measures were taken accordingly for quitting Paris as soon as possible, so that we might reach home late in the month of May.|$|E
