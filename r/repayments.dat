40|$|Abstract—This paper {{analyzes}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of establishing a debt fund on the <b>repayment</b> of student loan. Based on these analyses, on one hand, we discuss the mode of equal fraction <b>repayment</b> of the total amount of the loan principal and its interest in each term. This mode yields great flexibility in that the <b>repayment</b> fund can have a greater interest rate to enhance the will of the lender to save money in the fund and thus can promote the early <b>repayment.</b> Banks can therefore regulate and control the situation and reduce the rate of contract breaking in loan <b>repayment.</b> Moreover, this mode can work well with the current policy and then can have excellent operability; On the other hand, theoretical analysis and example also shows that if the <b>repayment</b> amounts form a reasonable geometric increasing sequence, the <b>repayment</b> can be even more optimal in that it not only has the advantages of the foregoing mode, but also has the advantage of selecting the increasing rate of payments to adjust the burdens in each period of the <b>repayment</b> and make each period <b>repayment</b> burden relatively equal.

5|$|British {{businessman}} Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham {{during most}} of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the 1992 season, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make <b>repayments</b> against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing.

Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money and had no desire for this to be delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the theoretical underpinnings of high-frequency <b>repayment,</b> a feature {{in nearly all}} microfinance contracts that has been largely overlooked by theorists. The pervasive belief among practitioners that frequent <b>repayment</b> is critical in achieving high <b>repayment</b> rates is puzzling. Classically rational individuals should benefit from more flexible <b>repayment</b> schedules, and less frequent <b>repayment</b> should increase neither default nor delinquency. This paper proposes a simple explanation based on present bias. For such individuals, more frequent <b>repayment</b> can increase the maximum incentive compatible loan size. However, the welfare effects are ambiguous. More frequent <b>repayment</b> can lead to over-borrowing, reducing welfare as it increases loan sizes. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} confirms {{our findings}} from the Defaulter Survey regarding quantitatively important relationships between <b>repayment</b> problems and borrower income. We also identify an important role for student debt, educational attainment, and beliefs about <b>repayment.</b> The analysis further reveals the importance of intergenerational relationships for <b>repayment.</b> Children whose parents are {{able and willing to}} financially help them out in times of economic stress are much less likely to experience <b>repayment</b> problems. The extended period of loan designation data associated with the 2010 and 2011 CSS samples allows us to examine the persistence of <b>repayment</b> problems. Individuals who had some form of <b>repayment</b> problem at the date of the CSS (early in their <b>repayment</b> period) {{were much more likely to}} be experiencing <b>repayment</b> problems a year or more later than were individuals with no <b>repayment</b> problem as of the CSS. Individuals on IR/RAP were less likely to be experiencing <b>repayment</b> problems 12 and 18 months later than those who were delinquent at CSS; however, both groups had significantly higher serious <b>repayment</b> problems at the later date than did those with no problem at CSS. Our results also suggest that income (at CSS), student loan debt, and educational attainment are important factors affecting default/bankruptcy a year or more after CSS. Interestingly, youth who attended private post-secondary institutions were significantly more likely to experience serious <b>repayment</b> problems 12 and 18 months after CSS...|$|R
5|$|Only {{recently}} {{promoted to}} {{general manager of}} the New Jersey system, Stanley had been reluctant to take the position in London and took it for one year only, provided he would be free to return to America {{at the end of the}} year. He told the company's senior managers that the company was almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months. Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and public relations, he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around, while the company's chairman, Sir Edgar Speyer, renegotiated the debt <b>repayments.</b> In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the managing director.|$|E

Because the debt had been financed with bonds, the company chose to place revenue in the bank with a higher interest instead of paying off the bonds faster.

5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt <b>repayments,</b> limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E
5|$|The tax was {{rescinded}} by the British in 1812, {{who then}} imposed a British style constitution on the island. One legal innovation {{of this time}} of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only been able to enforce <b>repayments</b> of the interest on a loan or mortgage, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism was in the air. These factors coupled with {{the social and political}} upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their neglect and dereliction of noblesse oblige, an essential element of the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] This paper {{focuses on}} a key aspect of {{microfinance}} contracts - <b>repayment</b> schedules - to determine the impact of greater flexibility in <b>repayment</b> schedules on clients’ ability to smooth consumption as well as increase income by putting their loans in less liquid but higher return investments. Traditionally, microfinance <b>repayment</b> schedules are notoriously rigid, involving high frequency <b>repayment</b> in small installments beginning soon after loan disbursement, {{an important aspect of}} the lending model pioneered by earliest MFIs such as the Grameen Bank (Armendariz and Morduch 2005). However, in theory, clients are likely to be better off under more flexible <b>repayment</b> terms, which would give them greater ability to smooth consumption in the face of unanticipated shocks and encourage them to invest more of the loan in relatively illiquid but potentially higher return business investments (Field and Pande 2008). Through both of these channels, introducing flexibility in the timing of <b>repayment</b> by reducing <b>repayment</b> frequency could increase client long-run business income...|$|R

Juárez then repaid the debts, after which British and Spanish troops withdrew, but Emperor Napoleon III of France used the situation as a pretext to overthrow the republic and install a monarch friendly {{to the interests of}} France. Archduke Maximilian, brother of the Emperor of Austria, was elevated as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, thereby re-establishing the Mexican monarchy, but the new emperor ultimately did not bow to Napoleon's wishes, leading the latter to withdraw the majority of his influence from Mexico. Regardless, Maximilian was still viewed as a French puppet, and an illegitimate leader of the country. As well, {{at the end of the}} American Civil War, US troops moved to the Mexico-US border as part of a planned invasion, seeing the establishment of the Second Mexican Empire as an infringement on their Monroe Doctrine. Backed by the Americans, ex-president Juárez mobilised to retake power, and defeated Maximilian at Querétaro on 15 May 1867. The Emperor was arraigned before a military tribunal, sentenced to death, and executed at the Cerro de las Campanas on 19 June 1867.|$|E

Mistakenly believing that living with her superior will ensure her an easy time at work, Donna invites herself {{to move in with}} nurse Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White). The two have a strained relationship: within weeks, Donna is evicted for falling behind on her rent, and when she is later allowed to move back in, she lets bailiffs take Lisa's possessions after failing to keep up her own loan <b>repayments.</b> Forced to run a shift in charge of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit as recompense, Donna struggles to manage and learns a new respect for Lisa. During this period, Donna has a friendship with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Mickie is questioning her sexuality, and the two have sex while drunk.

His assistant Viv Busby took over as caretaker manager before former Derby County coach Billy McEwan was appointed in February 2005. Under McEwan, York avoided relegation to the Conference North, with a 17th-place finish in 2004–05. One-third into 2005–06, York were in second place but poor midseason results saw them slide down the table. They pushed for the play-offs after six consecutive wins but finished in eighth place after faltering in the run-in. With 22 goals, Andy Bishop was the Conference National top scorer in 2005–06. Financial problems arose again; a loss of £150,000 was reported for the season, and there were problems meeting the first annual payment of £100,000 to the FSIF. McGill's company JM Packaging made a proposal to the ST to become majority shareholders, and would lend the club £650,000 to cover the current losses and meet the loan <b>repayments</b> for the next five years. ST members approved the proposal in June 2006, and JM Packaging became 75% shareholders, reducing the ST's previous 85% ownership to 25%. York made a good start to 2006–07, and were never out of the top five from early November 2006.

5|$|The turnpike {{idea was}} an {{attractive}} one because initial construction {{was to be}} financed {{by the private sector}} via sales of revenue bonds, allowing state highway funds to be used for other important projects. The new toll road would also reduce traffic, and thus maintenance costs, on existing roads. There was also a concern that if Kansas lagged behind in turnpike construction, it might be bypassed by toll roads in other states, leaving it at an economic disadvantage. The toll concept also had the benefit of ultimately putting the financial burden on the drivers who actually used the road, instead of using tax revenue that had been collected from residents statewide. There was a some opposition to the plan, from both government officials and citizens, due to concerns that the toll revenue might not cover the <b>repayments</b> to investors, bankrupting the turnpike authority and burdening the state government with the remaining debt. There were also worries about the possibility of the turnpike requiring maintenance before the bonds had been repaid. Some critics also felt that the high speeds typical of turnpike driving were unsafe. As right-of-way for the project was obtained, the turnpike drew opposition from farmers and ranchers, who objected to the turnpike bisecting their property, making it difficult to access disjointed parcels of land.|$|E
