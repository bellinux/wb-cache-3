40|$|The angular {{intensity}} distribution of <b>radiation</b> <b>scattered</b> {{by a wide}} range of random media can be accounted for by assuming effective source amplitude correlations involving modified Bessel functions Kv. We investigate how such correlations can be derived from physical models of stochastic scattering systems, namely facet models with suitable slope distribution, and consider the cases of constant and varying r. m. s. slope or facet size. We study the pertinent photon statistics of the <b>radiation</b> <b>scattered</b> by these model systems and look for a link between K correlations and K distributions. As an application we revisit the concepts and laws of diffuse reflectance and discuss the existence of lambertian scatterers. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{near field}} and far field are {{regions of the}} {{electromagnetic}} field around an object, such as a transmitting antenna, or the result of <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> off an object. Non-radiative 'near-field' behaviours of electromagnetic fields dominate close to the antenna or scattering object, while electromagnetic radiation 'far-field' behaviours dominate at greater distances.|$|E
50|$|Given a {{potential}} energy function, the radial distribution function can be computed either via computer simulation methods like the Monte Carlo method, or via the Ornstein-Zernike equation, using approximative closure relations like the Percus-Yevick approximation or the Hypernetted Chain Theory.

5000|$|In radiotherapy, a {{percentage}} depth dose curve (PDD) (sometimes percent depth dose curve) relates the absorbed dose deposited by a radiation beam into a medium as it varies with depth along the axis of the beam. The dose values are divided by the maximum dose, referred to as dmax, yielding a plot in terms of percentage of the maximum dose.

40|$|A general {{formalism}} {{is developed}} for computing {{the intensity and}} polarization of unpolarized <b>radiation</b> <b>scattered</b> {{by a group of}} electrons with a specified distribution of momenta. The case of isotropic incident radiation with a power-law spectrum is addressed, and the 'head-on' approximation is developed to describe the nearly unidirectional character of the incident radiation in the electron rest frame. The formalism is implemented numerically, verifying the validity of the 'head-on' approximation and illustrating the polarization and intensity properties of <b>radiation</b> <b>scattered</b> by jets with different electron momentum distribution. The results are placed in an astrophysical setting, determining the optical depths and kinetic energies required for the <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> to dominate over the isotropic component in blazars. It is argued that Comptonization of unbeamed AGN radiation by a relativistic jet can account for the polarization and the overall spectral shape of the IR-optical continuum in blazars...|$|R

50|$|It {{has already}} been {{mentioned}} that in HR-CS AAS lamp flicker noise is eliminated using correction pixels. In fact, any increase or decrease in radiation intensity that is observed {{to the same extent}} at all pixels chosen for correction is eliminated by the correction algorithm. This obviously also includes a reduction of the measured intensity due to <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> or molecular absorption, which is corrected in the same way. As measurement of total and background absorption, and correction for the latter, are strictly simultaneous (in contrast to LS AAS), even the fastest changes of background absorption, as they may be observed in ET AAS, do not cause any problem. In addition, as the same algorithm is used for background correction and elimination of lamp noise, the background corrected signals show a much better signal-to-noise ratio compared to the uncorrected signals, which is also in contrast to LS AAS.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{is carried out}} into the effects of using different atomic models of the <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> event with velocity-noncorrelated scattering (a physical process introduced in a previous paper).

Of the three different models of the atomic <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> event used, two were found to produce complete frequency redistribution. It is pointed out that the significance of the derivation of the mathematical forms describing complete frequency redistribution does not lie in the functional forms themselves, which have known and used with great effect for many years, but rather in the physical interpretation of the <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> event which must be used to obtain the particular mathematical expressions...|$|E
40|$|The master thesis {{discusses}} the principles, design and {{realization of the}} original device for measuring of the electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> {{in the structure of}} solar cells. It follows the results of a previous project "Analýza optických vlastností solárných článku" (ev. n. FT-TA 3 / 142) and as well as knowledge gained from Ing.

The subject of this thesis was to make a device for measuring of the electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> in the visible spectrum. The aim of this work is an innovation of the previous device, so that the electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> in the near infrared spectrum can be studied.

40|$|Space {{constraints}} often {{present the}} greatest challenge in determining the lay-out of specific radiotherapy installations. To fulfill these constraints high density concrete is often employed in construction.

In the course of this study various characteristics of leakage and <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> from a 10 MV linac have also been investigated.

40|$|International audienceThe {{structural}} {{properties of}} ionic liquids and alcohols are viewed under the charge ordering {{process as a}} common basis to explain the peculiarity of their <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> properties, namely the existence, or absence, of a scattering pre-peak. Through the analysis of models, it is shown that the presence, or absence, of a <b>radiation</b> <b>scattering</b> pre-peak is principally related to the symmetry breaking, or not, of the global charge order, induced by the peculiarities of the molecular shapes. This symmetry breaking is achieved, in practice, {{by the emergence of}} specific types of clusters, which manifest how global charge order has changed into a local form. The various atom-atom correlations witness the symmetry breaking induced by this re organization, and this is manifested into a pre-peak in the structure factor. This approach explains why associated liquids such as water do not show a scattering pre-peak. It also explains under which conditions core-soft models can mimic associating liquids...|$|E
