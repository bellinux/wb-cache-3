5|$|A {{connected}} component of an undirected graph is the subgraph {{consisting of the}} vertices and edges that {{can be reached by}} following edges from a single given starting vertex. A graph is connected if every vertex or edge is <b>reachable</b> from every other vertex or edge. A cycle in an undirected graph is a connected subgraph in which each vertex is incident to exactly two edges, or is a loop.|$|E
5|$|In all {{of these}} {{transitive}} closure algorithms, {{it is possible to}} distinguish pairs of vertices that are <b>reachable</b> by at least one path of length two or more from pairs that can only be connected by a length-one path. The transitive reduction consists of the edges that form length-one paths that are the only paths connecting their endpoints. Therefore, the transitive reduction can be constructed in the same asymptotic time bounds as the transitive closure.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Arena is {{currently}} served by Malmö bus lines 6, 8, 33, {{as well as}} several regional bus lines, all of which stop {{in the vicinity of the}} arena. The stadium is also located close to the partially underground railway station Hyllie, which opened in December 2010 as a part of Citytunneln. The station is served by Pågatåg and Öresund Trains, and is <b>reachable</b> non-stop from many parts of the Øresund Region. From Hyllie railway station, spectators can reach Malmö Central Station in 7 minutes, or Copenhagen Airport in 12 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the park}} from the {{mainland}} {{is limited to the}} immediate vicinity of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point. All other portions of the park are <b>reachable</b> only by private or concessioner boats. Activities include boating, fishing, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling and scuba diving. Miami-Dade County operates four marina parks near the park. Homestead Bayfront Park is directly adjacent {{to the park}} headquarters at Convoy Point. Farther south Black Point Park provides access to Adams and Elliott Keys. Matheson Hammock Park is near {{the north end of the}} park, and Crandon Park is on Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|Swedbank Stadion {{is served}} by Malmö bus lines 3, 5, 6, and 34, all of which stop in the {{vicinity}} of the stadium. Local transit authority Skånetrafiken also operates dedicated match-day buses, branded as line 84, which run to the stadium from different areas of Malmö. Due to the central location of the stadium within the city, parking space is limited, and spectators are advised to use public transportation, particularly for more prominent matches. The stadium is also located close to the underground railway station Triangeln, which opened in December 2010 as a part of Citytunneln. The station {{is served by}} Pågatåg and Öresund Trains, and is <b>reachable</b> non-stop from many parts of the Öresund Region.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium has not {{yet been}} synthesised. Nevertheless, because it is only three {{elements}} away from the heaviest known element, oganesson (element 118), its synthesis may come in the near future; it is expected {{to be one of the}} last few <b>reachable</b> elements with current technology, and the limit may be anywhere between element 120 and 124. It will also likely be far more difficult to synthesise than the elements known so far up to 118, and still more difficult than elements 119 and 120. The team at RIKEN in Japan has plans to attempt the synthesis of element 121 in the future after its attempts on elements 119 and 120.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} {{neighbouring}} Swedbank Stadion, Malmö Stadion is currently served by Malmö bus lines 3, 5, 6 and 34, {{all of which}} stop {{in the vicinity of}} the two stadiums. Local transit authority Skånetrafiken also operates dedicated match-day buses, branded as line 84, which run from different areas of Malmö when Malmö FF play home matches at Swedbank Stadion. Due to the central location of the two stadiums within the city, parking space is limited, and spectators are advised to use public transportation, particularly for more prominent matches at Swedbank Stadion. This does not apply to matchdays for IFK Malmö, as not so many fans are drawn for that club's games. Malmö Stadion is also near the underground railway station Triangeln, which opened in December 2010 as a part of Citytunneln. The station is served by Pågatåg and Öresund Trains, and is <b>reachable</b> non-stop from many parts of the Öresund Region.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{experienced}} {{a variety of}} command problems, especially in its early operations in southwestern Germany. After the defeat at Stockach, the army withdrew into the Black Forest. Jourdan relinquished command provisionally to Ernouf, who was a capable staff officer but had insufficient experience to hold together a varied and demoralized force. Jourdan retired to Strasbourg, where he was, or claimed he was, indisposed. By the time Masséna arrived to take command, organization and discipline was in shambles. Only four divisional generals had remained at their posts: Klein, Ferino, Souham, and Vandamme. Decaen was under arrest in Strasbourg, pending a Courts-martial, as was d'Hautpoul, for his failure to organize a timely cavalry attack at Stockach. The others had disappeared to {{different parts of the}} southwest or had gone to France. No one knew where Bernadotte had gone, and Saint Cyr had retired to Mannheim. The latter was at least <b>reachable.</b> Lecourbe, who had been injured at Stockach, had withdrawn to Paris to recover; in a strategically astute move, he remained there until late November, when he was able to offer Napoleon direct assistance in his coup, and thus acquired Bonaparte's attention and gratitude.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan Mahmud Bridge, a three-kilometre {{bridge over}} the Terengganu River, {{provides}} a road link between the two banks of the river (connecting Kuala Nerus to Kuala Terengganu) and Duyong Island. The city and suburbs are relatively easy to negotiate by car. Kuala Terengganu is connected to other towns via a good network of roads that are accessible from many major towns and cities in Peninsula Malaysia. The East Coast Expressway (LPT) E8, which starts from Gombak until Kuala Terengganu, has shorten the time for travellers to drive from the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It takes four hours to drive from Kuala Lumpur to reach the city via the LPT. Visitors can also drive to Kuala Terengganu by using the Federal Route 3 from Kuantan (besides using the LPT), Kota Bharu, and Johor Bahru that offers a more scenic view of the coastline and villages. From {{the north of the}} peninsula, Kuala Terengganu is <b>reachable</b> via East-West Highway 4 and Second East–West Highway 185.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{calculation}} of the half-lives of the isotopes of unbiunium from 290Ubu to 339Ubu suggested that those from 290Ubu to 303Ubu would not be bound and would decay through proton emission, those from 304Ubu through 314Ubu would undergo alpha decay, and those from 315Ubu to 339Ubu would undergo spontaneous fission. Only the isotopes from 309Ubu to 314Ubu would have long enough alpha-decay lifetimes to be detected in laboratories, starting decay chains terminating in spontaneous fission at moscovium, tennessine, or ununennium. This would present a grave problem for experiments aiming at synthesising isotopes of unbiunium if true, because the isotopes whose alpha decay could be observed {{could not be reached}} by any presently usable combination of target and projectile. Calculations in 2016 and 2017 by the same authors on elements 123 and 125 suggest a less bleak outcome, with alpha decay chains from the more <b>reachable</b> nuclides 300–307Ubt leading down to bohrium or nihonium; in particular, 304Ubt could be synthesised in the reaction 249Bk(58Fe,3n)304Ubt and would alpha decay through 300Ubu, 296Uue, and 292Ts to the known 288Mc and 284Nh, though the cross-section would likely be extremely low. It has also been suggested that cluster decay might be a significant decay mode in competition with alpha decay and spontaneous fission in the region past Z = 120, which would pose yet another hurdle for experimental identification of these nuclides.|$|E
5|$|For further {{elements}} up to 124, {{given that}} increasing the neutron number allows for {{getting closer to}} the predicted closed neutron shell at N = 184 that would confer stability, the use of weakly radioactive iron-60 instead of stable iron-58 as a projectile has been considered. 60Fe has a half-life of 2.6 million years. The isotopes 299Ubu, 300Ubu, and 301Ubu that could be produced in these reactions via the 3n and 4n channels {{are expected to be}} the only <b>reachable</b> unbiunium isotopes with half-lives long enough for detection; the cross-sections would nevertheless push the limits of what can currently be detected. They would decay through isotopes of ununennium that could be produced by cross-bombardments in the 248Cm+51V or 249Bk+50Ti reactions, which will be tried at RIKEN and JINR respectively in 2019–2020, down through known isotopes of tennessine and moscovium synthesised in the 249Bk+48Ca and 243Am+48Ca reactions. The multiplicity of excited states populated by the alpha decay of odd nuclei may however preclude clear cross-bombardment cases, as was seen in the purported yet likely nonexistent link between nuclides assigned to 293Ts and 289Mc. Heavier isotopes are expected to be more stable; 320Ubu is predicted to be the most stable unbiunium isotope, but {{there is no way to}} synthesise it with current technology as no combination of usable target and projectile could provide enough neutrons.|$|E

25|$|Many {{components}} in the capsule itself were <b>reachable</b> through their own small access doors. Unlike Mercury, Gemini used completely solid-state electronics, and its modular design {{made it easy to}} repair.|$|E
25|$|The {{islands are}} <b>reachable</b> by ferry {{services}} that depart from Kabataş on the European side. The voyage takes about 25 minutes by fast ferry and 40 minutes by regular ferry (vapur).|$|E
25|$|The island {{features}} {{historic buildings}} and pleasant beaches (all <b>reachable</b> via the many cycling tracks; cycling being the island's main {{mode of transport}} – private or hire cars are not allowed on the island).|$|E

25|$|Each item in {{the given}} {{collection}} will be returned and <b>reachable</b> {{in the context of}} the code block. When the block has been executed the next item will be returned until there are no items remaining.|$|E
25|$|As polls {{were largely}} based on New Orleanians still <b>reachable</b> by their pre-Katrina {{telephone}} numbers, pollsters admitted they were subject to an unusually large margin of error, and declined to speculate exactly how large that margin of error was.|$|E
25|$|Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, <b>reachable</b> {{by train}} or by road using the A29 and A1, or A16 and N104. The {{creation}} of a railway between Creil and Roissy will put Amiens 55 minutes from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport by 2020.|$|E
25|$|Dominance drawing places {{vertices}} {{in such a}} {{way that}} one vertex is upwards, rightwards, or both of another if and only if it is <b>reachable</b> from the other vertex. In this way, the layout style makes the reachability relation of the graph visually apparent.|$|E
25|$|A {{place in}} a Petri net is called k-bounded {{if it does not}} contain more than k tokens in all <b>reachable</b> markings, {{including}} the initial marking; it is said to be safe if it is 1-bounded; it is bounded if it is k-bounded for some k.|$|E
25|$|Also {{noticeable}} is {{the difference}} between coastal regions and the inland. Coastal regions have always been more open to outside influences. Nowadays Sardinia is most known for its coasts (La Maddalena, Costa Smeralda), the north-western coast near Sassari (Alghero, Stintino, Castelsardo) and Cagliari, because these are easily <b>reachable</b> by ship and by plane.|$|E
25|$|Malmö IP {{is served}} by Malmö bus lines 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8, all of which stop at Triangeln railway station, which opened in December 2010 as part of Citytunneln.

25|$|Testa Grigia {{at the top}} of the Theodul Pass {{serves as}} a {{connection}} to the Italian ski-resorts of Cervinia and Valtournenche. From the Swiss side it is only <b>reachable</b> by skilift, but from the Italian side by a chairlift and by a cablecar. There are customs offices here as well as a small alpine museum.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Greece in April 1941 and the Allied loss of the island of Crete in May, Greece and its many islands were {{occupied}} by German and Italian forces. With the surrender of Italy on 8 September 1943 however, the Greek islands, which were seen as strategically vital by Churchill, became <b>reachable</b> {{for the first time}} since the loss of Crete.|$|E

25|$|In {{one corner}} hangs a bell, which is rung {{five times a}} day at the boi – literally, ' scent' (Stausberg, 2004:115) – ceremony, which marks the {{beginning}} of each gah, or 'watch'. Tools for maintaining the fire – which is always fed by wood – are simply hung on the wall, or as is sometimes the case, stored in a small room (or rooms) often <b>reachable</b> only through the sanctum.|$|E
25|$|Trockenbeerenauslese wines ("dry berries selection") {{are made}} from grapes of an even higher {{potential}} alcohol level, generally <b>reachable</b> only {{with the help of}} Botrytis. The grapes used for Trockenbeerenauslese have reached an even more raisin-like state than those used for Beerenauslese. Due to the high concentration of sugar in the raisin-like grape, these wines can only be made in a sweet style and make extremely sweet, concentrated and usually quite expensive wines.|$|E
25|$|Urban {{areas as}} a rule cannot produce their own food and {{therefore}} must develop some relationship with a hinterland which sustains them. Only in special cases such as mining towns which {{play a vital role}} in long-distance trade, are cities disconnected from the countryside which feeds them. Thus, centrality within a productive region influences siting, as economic forces would in theory favor the creation of market places in optimal mutually <b>reachable</b> locations.|$|E
25|$|Each {{corner of}} the cloister gallery has a marble Gothic statue {{of one of the}} Four Evangelists. The Capela do Fundador, the funerary chapel of bishop D. Pedro, builder of the cloisters, {{features}} his tomb with recumbent figure, a statue of the Archangel Gabriel and a polychromed statue of Mary. The upper storey of the cloisters, <b>reachable</b> via a spiral staircase, offers a grand view of the cathedral and the surrounding landscape.|$|E
