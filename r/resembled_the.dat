5|$|The fossils clearly {{belong to}} a hippopotamus, but one much larger than any {{previously}} described Madagascan species. From what is known, the species closely <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> modern hippopotamus, but was somewhat smaller.|$|E
5|$|White marble pillar shafts {{were built}} into the walls of some houses in old Deir al-Balah. They <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> medieval-era pillars in the Temple Mount ("Haram ash-Sharif") in Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Mani {{taught that}} [...] "All my bones shall say: ‘Lord, who is like You?’" [...] {{alludes to the}} lulav.

5|$|Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman have {{suggested}} that Daspletosaurus social interaction would have more closely <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> modern Komodo dragon, where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing {{each other in the}} process. Evidence of cannibalism in Daspletosaurus was published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the album was}} generally favorable, with several reviewers pointing {{out the fact that}} it highly <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> band's debut album. Critics also said the album was less groundbreaking than their debut but had humorous and enjoyable pieces. The album peaked at 148 on the Billboard 200 despite its critical acclaim as well as the band members expecting more commercial success.|$|E
5|$|In this aspect, it <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> stegosaurids, {{which also}} bore {{primitive}} teeth and simple jaws. Its diet would have consisted of ferns or conifers, as grasses did not evolve until {{late into the}} Cretaceous Period, after Scelidosaurus was long extinct.|$|E
5000|$|Histologically also it <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> lateral {{periodontal}} cyst {{which has}} a distinctive thin, nonkeratinized epithelium which is 1-5 cell layers thick and <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> reduced enamel epithelium.|$|R

50|$|Eventually {{from such}} {{linguistic}} analyses, {{it appears that}} while astī (is-ness) would <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> world of Heraclitus, hastī (existence) would rather approaches a metaphysical concept <b>resembling</b> <b>the</b> Parmenidas's interpretation of existence.|$|R
5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known herbals were {{produced}} in Europe between 1470 and 1670. The invention in Germany of {{printing from movable type}} in a printing press c. 1440 was a great stimulus to herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of woodcut illustrations that more closely <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> plants being described.|$|E
5|$|Subsonic-cruise unarmed decoy: SCUD <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> B-52 on radar. As {{an active}} decoy, it carried ECM and other devices, {{and it had}} a range of several hundred miles. Although SCUD was never {{deployed}} operationally, the concept was developed, becoming known as the air launched cruise missile (ALCM-A).|$|E
5|$|The {{makers of}} the film {{acknowledged}} the responsibility of portraying the story. One challenge faced was acquiring a real plane for shooting; director Ram Madhvani and Rucha Pathak decided to re-create the plane because {{a major part of}} the film required shooting against the plane back-drop. It took them 48 days to build the plane, which closely <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> original one.|$|E
50|$|In Kingdom Come, the United Nations Headquarters {{building}} strongly <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Hall of Justice {{as depicted}} on Superfriends, just as <b>the</b> metahuman prison <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> cartoon's {{headquarters of the}} Legion of Doom.|$|R
50|$|The male Andaman Mormon <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> blue Mormon (Papilio polymnestor) while <b>the</b> female <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> female form alcanor of {{the great}} Mormon (Papilio memnon) and is a mimic of the Andaman clubtail (Losaria rhodifer).|$|R
500|$|Cirrus Vertebratus clouds, <b>resembling</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of bones as hinted {{by the word}} [...] "vertebratus". They look more like fish bones, with fibrous lines that originate from one which <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance of}} fish bones.|$|R
5|$|The ruffed lemur genus, Varecia, is {{a member}} of the family Lemuridae. The extinct genus, Pachylemur most closely <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> ruffed lemurs but died out after the arrival of humans. The genus Varecia {{contains}} two species, red ruffed lemurs and black-and-white ruffed lemurs, the latter having three subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} and co-writer George Lucas {{decided to make}} the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film treatment that <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> film's final storyline. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas's collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacements, with the screenplay partly based upon the 1939 film Gunga Din.|$|E
5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E
5000|$|Because it superficially <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> modern-day {{internal}} parasites {{known as}} the acanthocephalids or [...] "spiny-headed worms," [...] A. minor was once thought to be, or once thought to <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> hypothetical free-living ancestor of acanthocephalids.|$|R

5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see the}} Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1946, {{five days}} after the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-300 and the Yak-Jumo made their first flights, the Council of Ministers ordered that the Yakovlev OKB begin design of a new {{aircraft}} similar to the Yak-Jumo, using the RD-10 engine with improved aerodynamics. This generally <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> original aircraft, but the wings were entirely redesigned with laminar flow airfoils, the tail structure was enlarged and an ejection seat was fitted.|$|E
5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached low on the shoulder. The body was short and rounded, with a broad croup and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially so before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E
5000|$|A W {{engine is}} a type of {{reciprocating}} engine arranged with its cylinders in a configuration in which <b>the</b> cylinder banks <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> letter W, in the same way those of a V engine <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> letter V.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the {{correlation}} diagram for any 4n electrocyclic reaction will <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> diagram for the 4 electron cyclization of 1,3-butadiene, while {{the correlation}} diagram any 4n+2 electron electrocyclic reaction will <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> correlation diagram for the 6 electron cyclization of 1,3,5-hexatriene.|$|R
50|$|Khmer temples in general, {{as well as}} Phimai in this case, were {{intended}} to <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> universe. <b>The</b> main building <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> peak of Mount Meru {{at the center of}} the universe. <b>The</b> surrounding walls <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> water and encircling mountains. The Khmer did not develop the technique of true vault architecture during their time, results in large areas at Phimai that could not be roofed over. They instead developed the use of multiple chapels separated by open-air spaces.|$|R
5|$|The castle keep, which {{collapsed}} and was demolished in the 18th century, was originally a square Norman design, 15.6 m by 13.9 m (51ft by 45ft) in size, {{built on a}} motte of clay and stone. Intact, {{it would have been}} approximately 20m (66ft) tall, and would have <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> keeps at Goodrich Castle and White Castle, both of a similar period and design in the region.|$|E
5|$|The current stellar {{classification}} system {{originated in the}} early 20th century, when stars were classified from A to Q based {{on the strength of}} the hydrogen line. It thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple linear function of temperature. Rather, it was more complicated; it strengthened with increasing temperature, it peaked near 9000K, and then declined at greater temperatures. When the classifications were reordered by temperature, it more closely <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> modern scheme.|$|E
5|$|The {{first such}} battlecruisers were the Dutch Design 1047, {{designed}} to protect their colonies in the East Indies {{in the face of}} Japanese aggression. Never officially assigned names, these ships were designed with German and Italian assistance. While they broadly <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> German Scharnhorst class and had the same main battery, they would have been more lightly armoured and only protected against eight-inch gunfire. Although the design was mostly completed, work on the vessels never commenced as the Germans overran the Netherlands in May 1940. The first ship would have been laid down in June of that year.|$|E
