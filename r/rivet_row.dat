Finally, the fatigue cracking initiated from the knife edge associated with the countersunk lap joint rivet holes; the knife edge concentrated stresses that were transferred through the rivets because of lap joint disbonding.|$|E
40|$|Terminating {{action is}} a {{remedial}} repair which entails the replacement of shear head countersunk rivets with universal head rivets which have a larger shank diameter. The procedure was developed to eliminate the risk of widespread fatigue damage (WFD) in the upper <b>rivet</b> <b>row</b> of a fuselage lap joint. A test and evaluation program has been conducted by Foster-Miller, Inc. (FMI) to evaluate the terminating action repair of the upper <b>rivet</b> <b>row</b> of a commercial aircraft fuselage lap splice. Two full scale fatigue tests were conducted on fuselage panels using the growth of fatigue cracks in the lap joint. The second test was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the terminating action repair. In both tests, cyclic pressurization loading was applied to the panels while crack propagation was recorded at all rivet locations at regular intervals to generate detailed data on conditions of fatigue crack initiation, ligament link-up, and fuselage fracture. This program demonstrated that the terminating action repair substantially increases the fatigue life of a fuselage panel structure and effectively eliminates the occurrence of cracking in the upper <b>rivet</b> <b>row</b> of the lap joint. While high cycle crack growth was recorded in the middle <b>rivet</b> <b>row</b> during the second test, failure was not imminent when the test was terminated after cycling to well beyond the service life. The program also demonstrated that the initiation, propagation, and linkup of WFD in full-scale fuselage structures can be simulated and quantitatively studied in the laboratory. This paper presents an overview of the testing program and provides a detailed discussion of the data analysis and results. Crack distribution and propagation rates and directions as well as frequency of cracking are presented for both tests. The progression of damage to linkup of adjacent cracks and to eventual overall panel failure is discussed. In addition, an assessment of the effectiveness of the terminating action repair and the occurrence of cracking in the middle <b>rivet</b> <b>row</b> is provided, and conclusions of practical interest are drawn...|$|E

All tests were constant amplitude tests with maximum stresses being representative for fuselage pressurization cycles and R-values of 0. 1. The parameters selected in the testing program were the stress level (sigma(sub max) = 14 and 16 ksi) and the rivet spacing (0. 75 and 1. 0 inch). All specimens contained 3 rows of countersunk rivets, the <b>rivet</b> <b>row</b> spacing was 1 inch and the rivet orientation continuous...|$|E

40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of a riveted lap joint panel is analyzed with the Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM) : in particular an MSD scenario is obtained from the simultaneous initiation and propagation of different cracks from the most loaded holes. The analysis is two-dimensional with no allowance for the secondary bending effects that are judged negligible due to the reduced thicknesses of the involved plates. The lap joints considered has three <b>rivet</b> <b>rows</b> and, when the initial cracks are sufficiently short, the allowance for non linear pin-rivet contact conditions is provided. The cracks are modeled with discontinuous elements and the Stress Intensity Factors (SIF’s) are calculated by the J-integral approach.

40|$|A {{full scale}} {{fuselage}} test article {{was subjected to}} 60, 000 load cycles (pressurizations) to study the effect of widespread fatigue damage in fuselage structures. Every 10, 000 cycles coded marker block loading sequences were used to mark the fracture surfaces of the fatigue cracks propagating within the panel. The loading sequences consisted of series of underloads combined {{with a series of}} full pressurizations. The combination of loads and underloads marked the fracture surfaces with marker bands that could later be used to reconstruct the fatigue crack growth history of selected regions within the test article. Thirty rivet holes comprising the upper <b>rivet</b> <b>rows</b> from two adjacent bays (bays # 3 and # 4) from a fuselage lap splice joint were examined {{for the purpose of this}} study.

40|$|AbstractCorrosion Inhibiting Compounds (CICs) retard {{or prevent}} {{degradation}} by corrosion, {{and are used}} widely in aviation, particularly in large aircraft with well-developed Corrosion Prevention and Control Programs. The diverse General Aviation sector, including small airliners, also benefit, but are poorly supported in terms of guidelines for CIC selection and application. One risk is that lubricating chemicals (like CICs) might affect the fatigue performance of structural joints, and potentially affect the overall economic or safe life of the aircraft. This paper discusses {{the effect of the}} application of Corrosion Inhibiting Compounds (CICs) on the fatigue life of riveted joints, and on the failure mechanisms involved. Single lap joints treated and untreated with CICs were tested under constant amplitude fatigue loading, with multiple load levels. Two different CICs, one oil-based, and one a soft-waxy CIC, were applied. The results showed that the presence of CICs had a significant influence on the fatigue life, and also on the failure mode of the joints. At high load levels, the application of CICs caused a reduction in the fatigue life of the joint by more than a factor of two. In this load range, the CICs appeared to cause the failure mode to change from tensile failure of the sheet (the prevalent mode at medium load levels) to shear failure of the rivets (observed at the highest load levels). Specimens that failed by rivet shearing showed some fatigue cracks propagating along the critical <b>rivet</b> <b>row.</b> In treated specimens tested at medium load levels, a reduction in the fatigue life still occurred, with all specimens failing in the sheet. At low load levels, there was little difference in fatigue life for the three conditions, although specimen test run-outs meant that further testing will be needed. The results are believed to have significance for managing the small aircraft in which these joints are common...|$|E
40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of a riveted lap joint is analyzed with the Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM). A Multiple Site Damage (MSD) scenario is obtained from the simultaneous initiation, from the most loaded holes, and propagation of different cracks. The analysis is bidimensional, with no allowance for secondary bending effects that are judged negligible, due to the reduced thicknesses of the involved plates. The lap joint considered has three <b>rivet</b> <b>rows</b> and undergoes a uniaxial fatigue load. When the cracks are short in comparison to plate thickness and hole diameters the allowance for nonlinear pin-rivet contact condition is provided. Crack faces are meshed using “discontinuous” quadratic elements and Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) are calculated by the J-integral approach. The crack growth rate is calculated by the well-known Paris’ law, getting a satisfactory correlation between numerical and experimental findings (the latter available from literature) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of riveted assemblies for full-scale complete aircraft crashworthiness. Many comparisons between experiments and FE computations of bird impacts onto aluminium riveted panels have shown that macroscopic plastic strains were not sufficiently developed (and localised) in the riveted shell FE in the impact area. Consequently, FE models never succeed in initialising and propagating the rupture in the sheet metal plates and along <b>rivet</b> <b>rows</b> as shown by experiments, without calibrating the input data (especially the damage and failure properties of the riveted shell FE). To model the assembly correctly, it appears necessary to investigate on FE techniques such as Hybrid-Trefftz finite element method (H-T FEM). Indeed, perforated FE plates developed for elastic problems, based on a Hybrid-Trefftz formulation, {{have been found in}} the open literature. Our purpose is {{to find a way to}} extend this formulation so that the super-element can be used for crashworthiness. To reach this aim, the main features of an elastic Hybrid-Trefftz plate are presented and are then followed by a discussion on the possible extensions. Finally, the interpolation functions of the element are evaluated numerically...|$|R
2500|$|Up {{until the}} late 11th and early 12th centuries the Cumans fought mainly as light cavalry, later {{developing}} heavy cavalry. The main weapons of the Cumans were the recurved and, later, the composite bow (worn on the hip with the quiver), and the javelin, curved sword (a sabre less curved than a scimitar), mace, and heavy spear for lancing. Due to European influence, some of the later period Cumans wielded war hammers and axes. For defense they used a round or almond shaped shield, short sleeved mail armour, consisting of commonly alternating butted and <b>riveted</b> <b>rows,</b> lamelar (iron or leather), leather cuirass, shoulder spaulders, conical or dome shaped iron helmet with a detachable iron or bronze anthropomorphic face plate (gold for princes and khans), and at times a camail suspended from the helmet, consisting of chain or leather. The armour was strengthened by leather or felt disks that were attached to the chest and back. The items suspended from the belts were a bow case with bow, a quiver, a knife and a comb. They also wore elaborate masks in battle, shaped like and worn over the face. The Cuman Mamluks in Egypt were, in general, more heavily armed than Mongol warriors, sometimes having body armour and carrying a bow and arrow, axe, club, sword, dagger, mace, shield and a lance. The Cuman Mamluks rode on larger Arabian horses in comparison to steppe ponies ...|$|R

40|$|The {{attachment}} joints {{are inevitable}} in any large structure like an airframe. Splicing is normally used {{to retain a}} clean aerodynamic surface of the wing skin. The wings {{are the most important}} lift-producing part of the aircraft. Wings vary in design depending upon the aircraft type and its purpose. The wing box has two crucial joints, the skin splice joint and spar splice joint. Top and bottom skins of inboard and outboard portions are joined together by means of skin splicing. Front and rear spars of inboard and outboard are joined together by means of spar splicing. The skins resist much of the bending moment in the wing and the spars resist the shear force. In this study the chord-wise splicing of wing skin is considered for a detailed analysis. The splicing is considered as a multi <b>row</b> <b>riveted</b> joint under the action of tensile in plane load due to wing bending. Stress analysis of the joint is carried out to compute the stresses at rivet holes due to by-pass load and bearing load. The stresses are estimated using the finite element approach with the help of PATRAN/NASTRAN. In a structure like airframe, a fatigue crack will appear at the location of high tensile stress. Further these locations are invariably the sites of high stress concentration. Life prediction requires a model for fatigue damage accumulation, constant amplitude S-N (stress life) data for various stress ratios and local stress history at the stress concentration The response of the splice joint will be evaluated. The splice joint is one of the critical locations for fatigue crack to initiate. In this study prediction of fatigue life for crack initiation will be carried out at maximum stress location...|$|R
