Letters of high frequency are recognized faster than letters of low frequency.

40|$|Determining adults’ and children’s {{strategies}} in mental arithmetic constitutes {{a central issue}} {{in the domain of}} numerical cognition. However, despite the considerable amount of research on this topic, the conclusions in the literature are not always coherent. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} carry on the investigation, and this is the reason why we developed the operand recognition paradigm (ORP). It capitalizes on the fact that, contrary to retrieval, calculation procedures degrade the memory traces of the operands involved in a problem. As a consequence, the use of calculation procedures is inferred from relatively long <b>recognition</b> <b>times</b> of the operands. However, it has been suggested that <b>recognition</b> <b>times</b> within the ORP do not reflect strategies but the difficulty of switching from a difficult task (calculation) to a simpler one (recognition). In order to examine this possibility, in a series of 3 experiments we equalized switch-cost variations in all conditions through the introduction of intermediate tasks between problem solving and recognition. Despite this neutralization, we still obtained the classical effects of the ORP, namely longer <b>recognition</b> <b>times</b> after addition than after comparison. We conclude that the largest part of the ORP effects is related to different strategy use and not to difficulty-related switch costs. The possible applications and promising outcomes of the ORP in and outside the field of numerical cognition are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The fan effect {{made its}} first {{appearance}} {{in a series of}} experiments conducted by John R. Anderson, a cognitive psychologist, in 1974. The three experiments he conducted involved participants learning 26 sentences that paired a person with a location. Additionally, they were asked {{to determine whether or not}} a particular sentence that was given to them belonged to the 26 they were asked to study. An example of a sentence Anderson used in his experiment was: [...] "A hippie is in the park." [...] Some sentences seemed similar in the sense that a person was paired with another location. For instance, [...] "A hippie is in the church." [...] Results revealed that participants produced a longer retrieval time when a person was paired with more than one location. Overall, these experiments demonstrated that multiple associations, such as including a large number of nouns in a sentence, interfered with the <b>recognition</b> <b>time</b> by producing a much slower effect.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} said, after inventing the Flex Defense, he then invented an offense to score on it, {{reviving}} the man-in-motion and {{starting in the}} mid-1970s, the shotgun formation. But Landry's biggest contribution in this area {{was the use of}} [...] "preshifting" [...] where the offense would shift from one formation to the other before the snap of the ball. This tactic was not new. It was developed by Coach Amos Alonzo Stagg {{around the turn of the}} 20th century; Landry was the first coach to use the approach on a regular basis. The idea was to break the keys within the defense used to determine what the offense might do. An unusual feature of this offense was Landry having his offensive linemen get in their squatted prestance, stand up while the running backs shifted, and then go back down into their complete [...] "hand down" [...] stance. The purpose of the [...] "up and down" [...] (Landry Shift) movement was to make it more difficult for the defense to see where the backs were shifting (over the tall offensive linemen), thus to cut down on <b>recognition</b> <b>time.</b> While other NFL teams later employed shifting, few employed this [...] "up and down" [...] technique as much as Landry.|$|E

50|$|The TRACE {{model is}} a connectionist network with an input layer and three {{processing}} layers: pseudo-spectra (feature), phoneme and word. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of TRACE. There are three types of connectivity: (1) feedforward excitatory connections from input to features, features to phonemes, and phonemes to words; (2) lateral (i.e., within layer) inhibitory connections at the feature, phoneme and word layers; and (3) top-down feedback excitatory connections from words to phonemes. The input to TRACE works as follows. The user provides a phoneme sequence that is converted into a multi-dimensional feature vector. This is an approximation of acoustic spectra extended in time. The input vector is revealed {{a little at a}} time to simulate the temporal nature of speech. As each new chunk of input is presented, this sends activity along the network connections, changing the activation values in the processing layers. Features activate phoneme units, and phonemes activate word units. Parameters govern the strength of the excitatory and inhibitory connections, as well as many other processing details. There is no specific mechanism that determines when a word or a phoneme has been recognized. If simulations are being compared to reaction time data from a perceptual experiment (e.g. lexical decision), then typically an activation threshold is used. This allows for the model behavior to be interpreted as recognition, and a <b>recognition</b> <b>time</b> to be recorded as the number of processing cycles that have elapsed. For deeper understanding of TRACE processing dynamics, readers are referred to the original publication and to a TRACE software tool that runs simulations with a graphical user interface.|$|E

A romance started although Barua, hailing from the native Indian state of Gauripur, Assam, was already twice married. As the actress, who was to play Parbati in Barua's next venture Devdas (1935) reported inability to attend the studio on {{the very first day}} of shooting, Jamuna was called from Barua's residence (she was living with him by then) and was asked to get down to work straight away without any preparation whatsoever. Thus she came to be the first Parbati of Indian talkies- Miss Light had played the role in the silent version of the enormously popular Sarat Chandra novel. Aishwarya Rai happens to the last so far and Devdas has been made and re-made a number of times. Jamuna played the same role in the Hindi version also and was accepted in this very first proper exposure as an actress in her own right. She continued to act in Barua's films like Grihadaha (1936), Maya (1936), Adhikar (1939), Uttarayan (1941), Shesh Uttar (1942), Chander Kalanka (1944) and the respective Hindi versions of each film. Barua had left the prestigious New Theatres in 1940 and was directing as well as producing his films. Thereafter she acted in a number of Barua directed Hindi movies like Amiree, Pehchan and Iran Ki Ek Raat. These films however did not add to the prestige of either to Barua or to Jamuna. Jamuna also acted outside Barua direction in three Bengali films Debar (1943) and Nilanguriya (1943) where she proved herself without Barua's influence. Her last film Malancha (1953) was also outside Barua's direction. She also starred in its Hindi version Phulwari (1953). Barua's death in 1951 when he was only 48 changed Jamuna's life altogether. She had three sons by Barua, Deb Kumar, Rajat and Prasun. They were all minors at the time and the Gauripur estate refused to take any of their responsibilities. She had to wage a legal battle with the powerful and influential royal family to get her and her children's dues and <b>recognition.</b> <b>Time</b> settled the matters and she was allowed ownership of the house with its vast adjoining land and also an allowance. Jamuna spent {{the rest of her life}} after Barua as a housewife, busy in bringing up her minor sons. She had to complete the unfinished film Malancha of course but said good bye to the world soon after. Later in her life she did attend a number of functions to celebrate the centennial year of husband P.C. Barua and received felicitations on behalf of the Government of India and the state Government of Assam as the first Parbati of Indian talkies.|$|E

40|$|Progressive image transmission, {{where an}} image builds up gradually, is gaining {{popularity}} in image database browsing applications. In these applications, a user {{might have to}} reject {{a large number of}} unwanted images before selecting the desired one. In such a case, the time required to identify the image contents becomes very important. In this thesis, we present a novel progressive image transmission technique based on a representation by segmentation. The technique preserves edges at low bit rates and is biased toward fast identification. An image is segmented into regions having constant intensity by applying a morphological operator: the watershed. The segmented image is gradually simplified using a graph. The simplifications are transmitted in the reverse order. At the decoder, the image is dynamically divided into an increasing number of regions as the transmission progresses. A subjective experiment was designed, and the <b>recognition</b> <b>times</b> of images transmitted with the proposed algorithm were compared with the <b>recognition</b> <b>times</b> of the same images transmitted with JPEG.
