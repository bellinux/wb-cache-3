5|$|Traditionally, {{the glass}} was melted using local raw materials, {{including}} sand from neighbouring villages, sodium carbonate (from the Dead Sea), and coloring additives such as iron oxide and copper oxide. Nowadays, <b>recycled</b> <b>glass</b> {{is often used}} instead. Glass production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets {{of which have been}} preserved and passed down by a few Palestinian families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city. The products made include glass jewellery, such as beads, bracelets, and rings, as well as stained glass windows, and glass lamps. However, due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, glass production has suffered a decline.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} floats, {{including most}} Japanese glass fishing floats, were handmade by a glassblower. <b>Recycled</b> <b>glass,</b> especially old sake bottles, was typically used and air bubbles {{in the glass}} {{are a result of}} the rapid recycling process.

(This sealing button is sometimes mistakenly identified as a pontil mark. However, no pontil (or punty) was used in the process of blowing glass floats.) While floats were still hot and soft, marks were often embossed on or near the sealing button to identify the float for trademark. These marks sometimes included kanji symbols.|$|E
25|$|The Science and Engineering {{building}} {{received a}} LEED Silver rating in March 2009. SEB achieved this rating by using <b>recycled</b> <b>glass,</b> steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB {{was made to}} reflect 92 percent of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building and therefore, reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also pre-cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, {{as well as a}} drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape reduces water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system that captures wastewater, providing 750 gallons of water a day that is used to flush toilets.|$|E

40|$|The {{challenge}} of managing discarded {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) waste {{has become a major}} environmental concern in Hong Kong and other cities. <b>Recycled</b> CRT funnel <b>glass</b> with a relatively high density (∼ 3000 kg m− 3) {{can be used as a}} potential material for the production of heavyweight concrete. This paper presents the results of an investigation on the feasibility of using <b>recycled</b> CRT funnel <b>glass,</b> both treated (lead has been removed from the glass surface) and untreated (without removal of lead) as partial and full replacements of fine aggregates in heavyweight barite concrete. The inclusion of barite aggregate and <b>recycled</b> funnel <b>glass</b> increased the hardened density but reduced the compressive and splitting tensile strengths. The replacement of natural fine aggregate with <b>recycled</b> CRT <b>glass</b> had no significant effect on the elastic modulus but considerably improved the drying shrinkage of the concrete. In conclusion, the overall properties of heavyweight barite concrete made with the treated and untreated <b>recycled</b> CRT funnel <b>glass</b> are comparable, except for lead leaching results. The results show that it is feasible to use the treated CRT glass as 100 % substitution of fine aggregate in making heavyweight concrete. However, the substitution of untreated glass should be limited to below 25 % due to its potential lead leaching. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Mixtures of {{inorganic}} {{waste materials}} are commonly converted into glasses, {{in turn to}} be transformed into glass ceramics. Specific composition designs may lead to glasses with a low crystallisation temperature, useful for low cost ceramisation by bulk nucleation.

This paper illustrates the optimisation of simultaneous sintering and crystallisation of a waste derived glass, originally intended for bulk nucleation, when coupled with <b>recycled</b> <b>glasses,</b> at a very low temperature (800 uC). The mixing with secondary glasses did not merely enhance the densification (residual porosity of 3 %) but modified the crystallisation. Owing to the mechanical properties (e. g.
