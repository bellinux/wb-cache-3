5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, the <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent {{a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E

25|$|Though Hillary Clinton was {{ultimately}} confirmed on January 21 by a 95–2 vote, with David Vitter (R-Louisiana) and Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) in dissent, Senate Republicans slowed the process due to objections over the charitable activities of Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton. John Cornyn (R-Texas) held up proceedings {{for a day}} to discuss this matter. Richard Lugar (R-Indiana), the <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Foreign Relations Committee, {{expressed an interest in}} President Bill Clinton's foundation reject foreign contributions to avoid possible conflict of interest.

2500|$|Political {{pressure}} from the Northeast to make the game more widely viewable preceded the decision to simulcast <b>the</b> game <b>on</b> CBS and NBC. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania senator who was <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>ranking</b> member <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Senate Judiciary Committee, and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Committee's head, wrote the league a letter threatening to reconsider the antitrust exemption currently enjoyed by the NFL under United States law.

2500|$|There were Republican {{state legislators}} who {{supported}} other cuts of the bonding bill, including Doug Magnus, the <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> House Transportation Finance Division, who praised Pawlenty's [...] "fiscal responsibility." [...] Critics, including Chris Coleman, Mayor of Saint Paul, called Pawlenty's veto [...] "political gamesmanship," [...] seeing the move as retribution for the Legislature's successful override of Pawlenty's veto of a transportation bonding bill. They noted cuts overwhelmingly targeted Democratic districts, and Democratic stronghold Saint Paul most heavily.|$|E

2500|$|Jones' {{views on}} the war in Iraq did not ingratiate him to Bush or to the Republican leadership, which {{prevented}} him from succeeding the late Jo Ann Davis as <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Forces Committee. [...] He was passed over for Randy Forbes when the 110th Congress convened because the full committee's ranking member, Duncan Hunter of California, didn't agree with Jones' change of heart on the war. [...] He had been approached by some Democrats about bolting the GOP and either becoming an independent caucusing with the Democrats or switching back to the Democratic Party outright.|$|E

From 1951 to 1953, Belcher was the last representative of Oklahoma's now-defunct 8th congressional district, then represented the 1st district until 1973.

5000|$|As {{part of the}} National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (the main annual bill used to {{fund the}} US military) Levin and Senator John McCain (<b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> Armed Services Committee-AZ) {{initially}} proposed to permit the indefinite detention of American citizens by the US military, without charges or trial, solely on grounds of suspected terrorist activity. [...] After objections were raised that such detention violates Americans' constitutional rights, Levin agreed to include language (to section 1031, later 1021, of the bill) which exempted American citizens from the requirement for military detention, but not protecting them from indefinite detention. Levin has cited 'the Supreme Court' {{in support of his}} language authorizing indefinite detention (see box above). The NDAA is being challenged as unconstitutional in a lawsuit filed by Chris Hedges, Hedges v. Obama.|$|R
2500|$|He is {{the former}} Chairman of the House Science Committee and the former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee; when the Republicans {{lost control of the}} House, he {{finished}} his six-year term as Chairman, and was not chosen as the Judiciary Committee's ranking minority member (that honor went to Lamar S.

2500|$|Sessions {{also served}} as the <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Judiciary Committee during the {{nomination}} process for Elena Kagan, President Obama's nominee to succeed retired Justice John Paul Stevens. Sessions based his opposition on the nominee's lack of experience, her background as a political operative (Kagan had said that she worked in the Clinton White House not as a lawyer but as a policy adviser), and her record on guns, abortion, and gay rights. Sessions pointed out that Kagan [...] "has a very thin record legally, never tried a case, never argued before a jury, only had her first appearance in the appellate courts a year ago".|$|E
2500|$|New York Republicans who {{criticized the}} plan {{included}} former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani (a [...] "desecration; Nobody would allow {{something like that}} at Pearl Harbor ...

NY gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino (R) noted: [...] "The vast majority of New Yorkers and Americans have rejected their idea. If a bridge was their intent, why jam it down our throats?

However, Steve Buyer, the fourth <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee, asked {{for an interview with}} the Republican Steering Committee, and on January 5, 2005 it voted to make him chairman. That decision was ratified by the Republican Conference on January 6, and Smith was removed from the committee altogether. Smith stated at the time, [...] "I don't look at power as something to hold. I see the power of the gavel as a strategic opportunity to do good, to use it in every way to help veterans", he said in his speech to the Conference. New Jersey Republicans expressed dismay, and New Jersey Democrats and the leaders of just about every veterans group expressed outrage. Richard B. Fuller, the national legislative director for the Paralyzed Veterans of America, said, [...] "The Republicans needed a chairman who would consistently say no to veterans' groups and say yes to the Republican leadership. That meant get rid of Chris Smith." ...|$|E
2500|$|Through his {{testimony}} before Congress on {{issues ranging from}} the Patriot Act to U.S. Attorney firings, he commonly admitted ignorance. The response to Gonzales's testimony by those Senators serving on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees was one of disbelief. Russ Feingold, {{who is a member}} of both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, said, [...] "I believe your testimony is misleading at best," [...] which Sheldon Whitehouse—also a member of both committees—concurred with, saying, [...] "I have exactly the same perception." [...] Chuck Schumer said Gonzales was [...] "not being straightforward" [...] with the committee. [...] Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said, [...] "I just don't trust you," [...] and urged Gonzales to carefully review {{his testimony}}. [...] The <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, said to Gonzales, [...] "Your credibility has been breached to the point of being actionable." [...] Leahy and Specter's comments were interpreted as warnings that Gonzales might have been perjuring himself. [...] After the meeting, Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller said Gonzales was being [...] "untruthful." [...] Rockefeller's sentiments were echoed by Jane Harman, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, who accused Gonzales of [...] "selectively declassifying information to defend his own conduct." ...|$|E
