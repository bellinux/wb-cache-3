In this paper, <b>rough</b> set symbols are simplified and standardized, which are composed of <b>rough</b> interpretation and specialized indication. <b>Rough</b> spatial entities and their topological relationships are also proposed in <b>rough</b> space. Further, a universal intersected equation is developed, and <b>rough</b> membership function is extended with the grey degree of a pixel in a case study. First, <b>rough</b> set is simply reviewed, and a set of simplified <b>rough</b> symbols is advanced on the basis of different kinds of existed <b>rough</b> symbols. It includes both <b>rough</b> interpretation and specialized indication. Second, <b>rough</b> spatial entity is put forward in <b>rough</b> vector space, <b>rough</b> raster space and <b>rough</b> threedimensional space. It is argued that GIS studies the real world as it is, without forcing uncertainties to change into crisp set. Third, <b>rough</b> topological relationships that are disjoint, touch, overlap, equal, cover, covered by, contain and contained by, are studied via <b>rough</b> matrix with their figures. They are divided into three types, CC (crisp entity and crisp entity), RC (<b>rough</b> entity and crisp entity) and RR (<b>rough</b> entity and <b>rough</b> entity).

5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used to identify}} Bovista pila in the field include its relatively small size, the metallic lustre of the endoperidium, {{and the presence of}} rhizomorphs. B.plumbea is similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its typically smaller fruit body and the blue-gray color of its inner coat. Unlike B.pila, B.plumbea is attached to the ground by a mass of mycelial fibers known as a sterile base. Microscopically, B.plumbea has larger spores (5–7 by 4.5–6.0μm); with long pedicels (9–14μm). Another lookalike is the European B.nigrescens, which can most reliably be distinguished from B.pila by its microscopic characteristics. The spores of B.nigrescens are oval rather than spherical, <b>rougher</b> than those of B.pila, and have a hyaline (translucent) pedicel about equal in length to the spore diameter (5μm). The puffball Disciseda pila was named for its external resemblance to B.pila. Found in Texas and Argentina, it has much larger, warted spores that measure 7.9–9.4μm.|$|E
5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the <b>rougher</b> the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

5|$|On 7 November 1943, Berryman became acting {{commander}} of II Corps, a post which became permanent on 20 January 1944, superseding Vasey, whose 7th Division was diplomatically placed directly under Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead's New Guinea Force. II Corps {{was left with}} the 5th and 9th Divisions. Berryman was promoted to lieutenant general on 20 January 1944. As in Syria, Berryman proved a hard-driving commander. In December 1943, II Corps broke out of the position around Finschhafen and began a pursuit along the coast. Whenever the Japanese Army attempted to make a stand, Berryman attacked with 25-pounder artillery barrages and Matilda tanks. Berryman was aware that seasonal changes were making the surf <b>rougher</b> and making it ever harder to operate the US Army landing craft (LCMs) and Australian Army amphibious trucks (DUKWs) that he depended on for the logistical support of his troops, but he realised that the Japanese Army's supply difficulties were greater than his own, and he gambled that if he pushed hard enough the Japanese {{would be unable to}} regroup and organise a successful defence.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using <b>rougher,</b> poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E

5|$|The Nashville {{sound was}} a popular kind of country music that arose in the 1950s, a fusion of popular big band jazz and swing with the lyricism of honky-tonk country. The popular success of Hank Williams' {{recordings}} had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried to strip the rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville's industry was reacting {{to the rise of}} rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop. Chet Atkins, head of RCA's country music division, did the most to innovate the Nashville sound by abandoning the <b>rougher</b> elements of country, while Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in the Nashville Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By {{the early part of the}} 1960s, the Nashville sound was perceived as watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and, most influentially, the Bakersfield sound.|$|E

So the story would be comprehensible for people who had not played Path of Radiance, the story was split up into four segments divided between the game's various factions. The team initially thought of a three-part structure, then settled on the current format. Their aim from the beginning was to create a large-scale, intricate world for players to enjoy. It {{was the first time the}} developers had incorporated such a structure into a Fire Emblem game. The dialogue for characters was made slightly <b>rougher</b> based on feedback from Path of Radiance, where character dialogue remained calm and cultured even in battle situations. The total number of characters increased by approximately 1.5 times compared to Path of Radiance. So players could keep track of how characters interacted with each other, the team introduced a character relationship flow chart. The game's Japanese subtitle made reference to both a key character and the way Telleus came to be. They also wanted to continue to portray the themes of conflict explored in Path of Radiance. The game's thematic color, expressed in its artwork and presentation, was red, as opposed to the use of blue in Path of Radiance. Senri Kita, the character designer for Path of Radiance, returned in that capacity for Radiant Dawn.|$|E
