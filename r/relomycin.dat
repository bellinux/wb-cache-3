40|$|Tylosin, a {{macrolide}} antibiotic, was co-produced {{with four}} structurally similar antibiotics in fermentation cultures of Streptomyces fradiae. Macrocin, desmycosin, lactenocin, and <b>relomycin</b> {{were found to}} be components of a common pathway that functions in tylosin biosynthesis. Data obtained by the addition of the purified 14 C-labeled antibiotics to cultures of S. fradiae revealed that macrocin and desmycosin were direct precursors of tylosin, whereas lactenocin was an immediate precursor of both macrocin and desmycosin. Incubation of these cultures with [14 C]tylosin resulted in an equivalent distribution of radioactive label between <b>relomycin</b> and an unidentified component. The kinetics of incorporation of label into the two species were similar, suggesting that both were derived directly from tylosin. A system that supported that methylation of macrocin to tylosin by cell-free extracts of S. fradiae was developed. A proposed scheme defining the terminal stages of tylosin biosynthesis is presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} mutants of Streptomyces fradiae {{selected}} for increased {{production of the}} macrolide antibiotic tylosin was analyzed for levels of expression of macrocin O-methyltransferase, the enzyme which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of tylosin. Increased tylosin production was accompanied by increased macrocin O-methyltransferase {{in some of the}} mutants. Increased expression of macrocin O-methyltransferase was due to more rapid early biosynthesis of the enzyme, to reduced decay of enzyme specific activity late in the fermentation, or to combinations of both. Mutant strains which showed rapid loss of enzyme specific activity late in the fermentation converted large amounts of tylosin to <b>relomycin.</b> The most productive mutants, which synthesized elevated levels of macrocin O-methyltransferase, also produced large amounts of macrocin, the substrate for the enzyme. Incomplete conversion of macrocin to tylosin by these mutants may be due to substrate and product inhibition (E. T. Seno and R. H. Baltz, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 20 : 370 - 377, 1981). The results suggest that both the levels of precursors and the levels of expression of tylosin biosynthetic enzymes are important for efficient production of tylosin...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{extracts}} of Streptomyces antibioticus, an oleandomycin producer, can inactivate oleandomycin in {{the presence}} of UDP-glucose. The inactivation can be detected through the loss of biological activity or by alteration in the chromatographic mobility of the antibiotic. This enzyme activity also inactivates other macrolides (rosaramicin, methymycin, and lankamycin) which contain a free 2 '-OH group in a monosaccharide linked to the lactone ring (with the exception of erythromycin), but not those which contain a disaccharide (tylosin, spiramycin, carbomycin, josamycin, niddamycin, and <b>relomycin).</b> Interestingly, the culture supernatant contains another enzyme activity capable of reactivating the glycosylated oleandomycin and regenerating the biological activity through the release of a glucose molecule. - It is proposed that these two enzyme activities could'be {{an integral part of the}} oleandomycin biosynthetic pathway. Resistance to macrolides in producing actinomycetes has been studied in some detail, and several resistance genes have been cloned (1, 3, 4, 12, 15, 20). Analysis of the biochemical basis of the resistance indicates that ribosomal modification by means of methylation at specific sites in the 23 S rRNA seems to be a quite general resistance mechanis...|$|E
