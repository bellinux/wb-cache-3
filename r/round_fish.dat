40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify which morphometric measures and ratios are more directly associated with the weight and body yields of <b>rounded</b> <b>fish.</b> A total of 225 specimens of <b>rounded</b> <b>fish</b> (59 pacus, 61 tambaquis, 52 tambacus and 53 paquis) with average weight of 972. 43 g (± 115. 52 g) were sampled, stunned, slaughtered, weighed, measured, and processed for morphometric and processing yield analysis. The morphometric measures taken were: standard length (CP); head length (CC); head height (AC); body height (A 1); and body width (L 1). For completeness, the following morphometric ratios were calculated: CC/CP, AC/CP, A 1 /CP, L 1 /CP, CC/A 1, AC/A 1, L 1 /A 1, CC/AC and L 1 /CC. The yields of carcass, filet, rib and filet with rib were estimated after processing. Initially, a "stepwise" procedure was performed in order to eliminate multicollinearity problems among the morphometric variables, and the phenotypic correlations were then calculated for the dependent variables (weight and body yields) and independent variables (morphometric measurements and ratios). These correlations were later deployed in direct and indirect effects through path analysis, and the direct and indirect contributions of each variable were measured in percentage terms. The CC and A 1 measures were important for determining the weight of <b>rounded</b> <b>fish.</b> The CC/A 1 ratio was the variable most directly associated with carcass yield.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe the relationships between operator’s work performance (speed of filleting and actual output rate of round codfish as well as of fillets) and his physiological parameters (mean heart rate, blood pressure and product of mean heart rate and blood pressure) during codfish filleting operation, and at the same time collect sufficient data to observe the effect of factors, such as speed of filleting and size of fish on the actual output rate and percentage yield of filleting. The effect of size of round codfish filleted on mean heart rate and normal output rate (<b>round</b> <b>fish</b> as well as fillets) of the filleting operator was also investigated. [...] This study was carried out at a small fish processing plant. Four average skilled male filleting operators were selected with the help of plant supervisors. Each subject was asked to work at five different filleting speeds, on an individual type filleting table layout. “Head on-gut in” codfish was supplied to each operator in 75 lb. boxes. A total of about 2625 lbs. of round codfish was processed during this study. A total of 35 individual experiments were performed. The actual time of filleting each box of 75 lbs. round codfish, performance rating (speed of filleting), number of codfish/ 75 lb. box, weight of skin-on fillets, operator’s mean heart rate and blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) were recorded for each filleting experiment. [...] Within the range and scope of this study, the analysis of the results indicated following trends: [...] 1. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 2. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 3. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and product of mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 4. Significant linear negative relationship between speed of filleting and percentage yield produced. [...] 5. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and actual output rate (<b>round</b> <b>fish</b> as well as fillets) produced. [...] 6. Significant linear positive relationship between actual output rate (<b>round</b> <b>fish</b> as well as fillets) and mean heart rate of filleting operator. [...] 7. Significant linear positive relationship between size of <b>round</b> <b>fish</b> filleted and actual output rate (<b>round</b> <b>fish</b> as well as fillets) produced. [...] 8. Significant linear positive relationship between size of <b>round</b> <b>fish</b> filleted and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 9. Significant curvilinear positive relationship between size of <b>round</b> <b>fish</b> filleted and normal output rate (<b>round</b> <b>fish</b> as well as fillets) produced. [...] Management in fish plants could use the relationships between work performance (actual output rate, etc.) and physiological parameters (mean heart rate, etc.) to design a better method of filleting, working height and work layout etc., and therefore improve the efficiency of the plant, without causing unnecessary higher physiological loads on the operator. [...] This study also suggests that management in fish plants should set work standards by establishing relationships between size of fish and normal output rate for a range of different species of fish, input quality of fish, offshore-inshore fish, and dressed-undressed condition of the fish...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that increasing mesh number in the circumference of a diamond-mesh trawl codend can reduce size selection for <b>round</b> <b>fish,</b> whereas selection for flat fish species is unaffected. This effect has also been documented in Mediterranean trawl fisheries. In contrast, no information is available {{with regard to the}} effect of increasing mesh number in the circumference of square-mesh codends on the size selection of <b>round</b> <b>fish</b> and flat fish species. A field study was devised to bridge this gap and formulate proposals aimed at improving trawl fishery management. Size selection data were collected for a <b>round</b> <b>fish</b> species, red mullet (Mullus barbatus), and two flat fish species, Mediterranean scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna) and solenette (Buglossidium luteum). Fishing trials were conducted in the Adriatic Sea (Central Mediterranean) using three square-mesh codends that differed only in mesh number around the circumference. Results demonstrated that increasing the number of meshes from 107 to 213 reduced the 50 % retention length (L 50) for red mullet by 2. 5 cm but did not affect size selection for the two flat fish species. In some fisheries, regulatory provisions regarding the number of meshes in the circumference should therefore be carefully considered both for diamond- and square-mesh codends...|$|E

40|$|Flounders (Platichthysflesus) {{have a body}} geometry, {{which is}} adapted to a life on the sea bottom. When {{swimming}} the dorso-ventrally flattened body makes the flatfish to undulate its body vertical to the substratum. In addition the flounders use their dorsal and anal fin for propulsion as well, which stands in contrast to <b>round</b> <b>fish.</b> Due {{to the lack of}} a hydrostatic organ, flounders are heavier than water and need to produce lift while swimming. For this study, it was expected that flounders show significant differences in swimming kinematics compared to <b>round</b> <b>fish.</b> Comparison of the body and fin movements of the flounders was desirable to show a relation of the two propulsion systems. Juvenile flounders were filmed in side view at 125 frames s- 1 while swimming freely towards a food source. For analysing the wave characteristics of the undulatory movements, ten points on the upper body side, fifteen on the fin tip and fifteen points on the fin base were followed in time. Cubic splines were fitted through these points, to yield accurate estimates of the wave characteristics. The obtained lines indicate the movements of the body and the fin in space and time. Kinematic data were obtained following the methods of Videler and Wardle (1978). Three film sequences showing upward swimming of three different juvenile flounders were analysed. The following results were found: - The last two third of the body of all flounders were active, having about 1 to 1. 2 waves at once. - The fins were undulating over the whole length, with 1. 5 to 1. 9 waves at one time. - For the body the amplitude maximum was located at the tail. - For the fin, the maximum amplitude was found half way to two third of the fin length. - Differences were seen within and between the flounders in the tail beat amplitudes. - An interpretation was given about a possible steering component of the tail beat direction. - Wave speeds v varied quite strongly within and between the flounders. It indicated that the flounders have possibilities to alter their swimming style and are able to change quickly between wave speeds during swimming. - Differences in swimming movements of flatfish compared to <b>round</b> <b>fish</b> were: a smaller wave length lambda b, stride length lambda s and swimming efficiency, which make flounders bad forward swimmers. - The waves on the fins are not an artefact of the moving body, but the flounders appear to have two propulsing systems, the body and the fins. - The fins are moving in phase with the body, enlarging the moving surface and the effect of the waving propulsion. - Small differences in the movements are explained as complexity of the moving systems and can serve as steering components and stabilising factors. ...|$|E
