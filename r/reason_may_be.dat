5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the concentration of activity within the Dairi, the Greater Palace began {{to be regarded as}} increasingly unsafe, especially by night. One <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the prevalent superstition of the period: uninhabited buildings were avoided for fear of spirits and ghosts, and even the great Buraku-in compound was thought to be haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the palace went into decline, and by the early 11th century only one palace gate, the Yōmeimon in the east, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary and even violent crime became a problem within the palace by the first half of 11th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E

25|$|Hieroglyphs {{continued}} to be used under Persian rule (intermittent in the 6th and 5th centuries BC), and after Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt, during the ensuing Ptolemaic and Roman periods. It appears that the misleading quality of comments from Greek and Roman writers about hieroglyphs came about, at least in part, {{as a response to}} the changed political situation. Some believed that hieroglyphs may have functioned as a way to distinguish 'true Egyptians' from some of the foreign conquerors. Another <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the refusal to tackle a foreign culture on its own terms, which characterized Greco-Roman approaches to Egyptian culture generally. Having learned that hieroglyphs were sacred writing, Greco-Roman authors imagined the complex but rational system as an allegorical, even magical, system transmitting secret, mystical knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The {{modulation}} of {{the radio}} emissions by planetary rotation is traditionally {{used to determine the}} rotation period of the interiors of fluid giant planets. In the case of Saturn, however, this appears to be impossible, as the period varies at the timescale of tens years. In 1980–1981 the periodicity in the radio emissions as measured by Voyager 1 and 2 was , which was then adopted as the rotational period of Saturn. Scientists were surprised when Galileo and then Cassini returned a different value—. Further observation indicated that the modulation period changes by as much as 1% on the characteristic timescale of 20–30days with an additional long term trend. There is a correlation between the period and solar wind speed, however, the causes of this change remain a mystery. One <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that the saturnian perfectly axially symmetric magnetic field fails to impose a strict corotation on the magnetospheric plasma making it slip relative to the planet. The lack of a precise correlation between the variation period of SKR and planetary rotation makes it all but impossible to determine the true rotational period of Saturn.|$|E

Adult individuals would be too large for most predators to attack, but the young would have been vulnerable.

Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental.

It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that happy people tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly.

2500|$|The name Sørvágur {{translates}} to [...] "The Bay of Sør". While {{the second half}} of the name makes sense given the fact that the village is located at a bay, the first half is more mysterious. Legend has it that the first man to settle at this place was called 'Sørli' and hence the village was named in honour of him. Another explanation on the origin of 'Sør' comes from the old-Norse 'Seyr' which is a word for sand (seyr is also a word for foggy rain). Sørvágur has quite a large sandbeach in comparison with other Faroese villages and towns, and therefore it was speculated that the original name of Sørvágur was Seyrvágur, and during the course of time, Seyrvágur became Sørvágur. During the first half of the 20th century local people in Sørvágur tried to correct this historical injustice and used the name Seyrvágur instead of Sørvágur. However, this trend died out again. One <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that there is no proof in the Faroese historical records that justifies the name Seyrvágur.|$|E
2500|$|Lengthening always occurs before lenis (short) consonants, {{for example}} in words like Daag (day), loose (listen), miir (we). Shortening, on the other hand, always occurs before long or fortis consonants, {{for example in}} Baseldytsch, {{the name of the}} dialect: whereas other dialects have long [...] in Baseldütsch or any other word with -dütsch (German) in it, Basel German always has short [...] or [...] /a:/ and /o:/ (as well as /ø:/), however, are usually not shortened, {{probably}} because of the shift from earlier /a:/ to /o:/. Another <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the fact that those are the only vowels that exist as such only as long vowels, i.e. whereas you can shorten [...] to , it is never possible to shorten [...] to [...] because * as such does not exist in Basel German. Some speakers, however, use short open vowels in a number of words, e.g. /hɔkkə/ instead of /ho:kkə/ ('hook'). Those speakers who use this pronunciation lack one minimal pair, since /hɔkkə/ also translates as 'crouch'. However, this shortening of /o:/ /ø:/ /a:/ /æ:/ is not general. Note however that /a:/ exists mainly in words of foreign origin such as /sa'la:tt/.|$|E
2500|$|De Sabata's {{compositions}} {{are written}} in a late-romantic style with similarities to Respighi and, especially, Richard Strauss (one early commentator {{went so far as}} to call de Sabata the older composer's [...] "adoptive son"). [...] It was as a composer that De Sabata first came to widespread attention, with the production of his opera Il Macigno in La Scala's 1917 season followed by performances of his orchestral Symphonic Suite (1912) and symphonic poem Juventus (1919) by conductors such as Walter Damrosch, Pierre Monteux, and Arturo Toscanini during the early 1920s. [...] His compositions are little-known today, although Lorin Maazel had them in his repertoire. One <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that de Sabata did relatively little to perform and publicize his own works, preferring that his music should succeed or fail on its own merits. Critical opinion on the merits of his compositions has long been divided. For example, a 1926 Time Magazine review described his Gethsemani as [...] "shallow, unoriginal music for which even the philanthropic genius of a Toscanini could not achieve distinction", while a critic for International Record Review, writing in the early 2000s, said that the same work [...] "contains some of the loveliest orchestral sounds I have heard in years".|$|E

2500|$|The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the {{prototype}} of the Yale ideal in the early 19thcentury: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who [...] "regretted" [...] that he [...] "had but one life to lose" [...] for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became {{the goal of the}} student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself.Along with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected elite British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football. The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates and 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that debates do not have a clear winner, {{as is the case in}} sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.|$|E
2500|$|The {{method of}} assimilating {{individual}} life-forms into the collective has been represented differently over time. The only constant {{is that the}} infant, and fetal humanoids have been grown in an accelerated state and surgically receive implants connected directly into the brain (cannot be removed without death), as well as ocular devices, tool-enhanced limbs, armor, and other prosthetics. In Star Trek: First Contact, the method of adult assimilation is depicted with the more efficient injection of nanoprobes into the individual's bloodstream through a pair of tubules that spring forth from the drone's hand (while in [...] "The Best of Both Worlds" [...] and , at least some Borg were shown with a syringe like prosthetic that also acted as a data port {{that allowed them to}} interface directly with technology and share data between each other). Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a usually fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact, though it seems that the longer the victim is being injected, the quicker they can be fully transformed. The individual is then taken away for complete assimilation by drones. The tubules can also allow for direct interfacing with technology, while they are also shown to be able to reconfigure and enhance such technology into Borg technology. Sometimes assimilated Borg have been noted to be neither male nor female. [...] One theory could be that their reproductive systems have been removed upon assimilation, yet drones such as Captain Picard and Seven of Nine are easily identified as male and female. The other <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that the species from whence they came was gender-less. Drones who have escaped the collective have also been shown to have a gender. The individual has all traces of individuality removed and implants are attached to the new drone so it can become an integrated part of the collective. This method of assimilation is also shown to be much more surgical in nature. In Star Trek: First Contact a captured crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{scholars}} {{of the era}} argue that a single name overshadows all others in 18th-century prose satire: Jonathan Swift. [...] Swift wrote poetry as well as prose, and his satires range over all topics. [...] Critically, Swift's satire marked the development of prose parody away from simple satire or burlesque. [...] A burlesque or lampoon in prose would imitate a despised author and quickly move to reductio ad absurdum by having the victim say things coarse or idiotic. [...] On the other hand, other satires would argue against a habit, practice, or policy by making fun of its reach or composition or methods. [...] What Swift did was to combine parody, with its imitation of form and style of another, and satire in prose. [...] Swift's works would pretend to speak {{in the voice of}} an opponent and imitate the style of the opponent and have the parodic work itself be the satire. [...] Swift's first major satire was A Tale of a Tub (17031705), which introduced an ancients/moderns division that would serve as a distinction between the old and new conception of value. [...] The [...] "moderns" [...] sought trade, empirical science, the individual's reason above the society's, while the [...] "ancients" [...] believed in inherent and immanent value of birth, and the society over the individual's determinations of the good. [...] In Swift's satire, the moderns come out looking insane and proud of their insanity, and dismissive of the value of history. In Swift's most significant satire, Gulliver's Travels (1726), autobiography, allegory, and philosophy mix together in the travels. Thematically, Gulliver's Travels is a critique of human vanity, of pride. [...] Book one, the journey to Liliput, begins with the world as it is. [...] Book two shows that the idealized nation of Brobdingnag with a philosopher king is no home for a contemporary Englishman. [...] Book four depicts the land of the Houyhnhnms, a society of horses ruled by pure reason, where humanity itself is portrayed as a group of [...] "yahoos" [...] covered in filth and dominated by base desires. It shows that, indeed, the very desire for <b>reason</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> undesirable, and humans must struggle to be neither Yahoos nor Houyhnhnms, for book three shows what happens when reason is unleashed without any consideration of morality or utility (i.e. madness, ruin, and starvation).|$|E
