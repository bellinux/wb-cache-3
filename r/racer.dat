5|$|Ridge <b>Racer</b> Revolution is an arcade racing game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Namco for the PlayStation in 1995. It is the PlayStation sequel of Ridge <b>Racer</b> (the arcade sequel is Ridge <b>Racer</b> 2). Like the original Ridge <b>Racer,</b> the player races computer-controlled cars {{with the objective of}} winning a series of races, and supports Namco's NeGcon controller. Ridge <b>Racer</b> Revolution adds two hidden cars, and two-player support via the PlayStation Link cable, and took roughly the same time to develop as the first. The intention was to increase the depth and add features.|$|E
5|$|The game borrows {{most of its}} soundtrack from Ridge <b>Racer</b> 2. Ridge <b>Racer</b> Revolution was re-released in Japan for the PlayStation The Best {{range in}} June 1997, and for the Platinum Range in PAL regions the {{following}} year. The game received generally positive reviews, although some criticised its similarity to the original. Ridge <b>Racer</b> Revolution {{was followed by a}} sequel, Rage <b>Racer,</b> in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Ridge <b>Racer</b> Revolution was {{developed}} over eight months {{by a team}} of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge <b>Racer</b> Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, rear-view mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, so rather than develop a port of Ridge <b>Racer</b> 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The rear-view mirror was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge <b>Racer</b> 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition involved four musicians, who composed for Ridge <b>Racer,</b> Ridge <b>Racer</b> 2, and Rave <b>Racer.</b> The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.|$|E

5|$|After {{they drive}} {{together}} and work naturally as a team, Speed begins {{to suspect that}} <b>Racer</b> X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With {{the help of his}} family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company so that they could profit from Royalton's buyout. An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts <b>Racer</b> X with his suspicion that he is Rex. <b>Racer</b> X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix, which Taejo had rejected. The <b>Racer</b> family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours.|$|E

5000|$|Blue <b>racers</b> {{seem to be}} {{relatively}} intolerant of high levels of human activity {{and for most of}} the active season they remain in areas of low human density.Evidence to suggest this comes largely from radio telemetry data from both blue <b>racers</b> and eastern fox snakes that inhabited the same general areas on Pelee Island(although studies were not conducted concurrently). In contrast to blue <b>racers,</b> fox snakes were often found under front porches, in barns/garages, and in the foundations of houses; whereas, most (but not all) blue <b>racers</b> were observed in more [...] "natural" [...] settings. Therefore, blue <b>racers</b> are more confined to areas with minimal anthropogenic activity. Campbell and Perrin also noted that <b>racers</b> were among the first snakes to disappear from suburban areas.|$|R

5|$|Speed <b>Racer</b> is an 18-year-old {{whose life}} and love has always been {{automobile}} racing. His parents Pops and Mom run the independent <b>Racer</b> Motors, in which his brother Spritle and his pet monkey Chim Chim, mechanic Sparky, and girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex <b>Racer,</b> who was killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 (AKA The Crucible), a deadly cross-country racing rally. Now embarking on his own career, Speed <b>Racer</b> is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill {{behind the wheel of}} his brother's cars, the Mach 5 and his own Formula One car the Mach 6, but remains primarily interested in the art of the race and the well-being of his family.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge <b>Racer,</b> the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge <b>Racer</b> 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge <b>Racer</b> Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge <b>Racer</b> Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge <b>Racer</b> Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E

When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned <b>racer,</b> Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose <b>racer</b> he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E

5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle {{in exchange for}} signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing <b>Racer</b> Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. <b>Racer</b> Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked <b>Racer</b> X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E

5000|$|Adult eastern <b>racers</b> can {{typically}} {{vary from}} 50 to 152 cm in total length {{depending on the}} subspecies, but a record-sized specimen measured 185.4 cm in total length. A typical adult specimen will weigh around 556 g, with little size difference between the sexes. The patterns vary widely between subspecies. Most are solid-colored as their common names imply: black <b>racers,</b> brown <b>racers,</b> tan <b>racers,</b> blue <b>racers,</b> or green <b>racers.</b> [...] "Runner" [...] is sometimes used instead of [...] "racer" [...] in their common names. All subspecies have a lighter-colored underbelly: white, light tan, or yellow in color. Juveniles are more strikingly patterned, with a middorsal row of dark blotches on a light ground color. The tail is unpatterned. As they grow older, the dorsum darkens and the juvenile pattern gradually disappears.|$|R
