The posts, nets and hand-stitched, flannel-covered India-rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies & Co from Woolwich, while the rackets used were an adaptation of those used in <b>real</b> <b>tennis,</b> with a small and slightly lopsided head. The ball-boys kept the tennis balls, 180 of which were used during the tournament, in canvas wells. The umpires who were provided for the matches sat on chairs which in turn were placed on small tables of 18 inches height to give them a better view of the court.|$|E

5|$|Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a {{time when}} the {{university}} was more crowded than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war. He took part in several sports, representing New College as goalkeeper in matches between the colleges, and being given a trial for the University football team, although he was not chosen.

In cricket, Jardine came under the coaching of Tom Hayward who influenced his footwork and defence.

His batting ability, particularly defensively, remained unquestioned.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth I, {{influenced}} by her royal favourite Robert Dudley, appointed Sir Henry Sidney as President of the Council in 1560, {{and he took}} up residence at Ludlow Castle. Henry was a keen antiquarian {{with an interest in}} chivalry, and used his post to restore much of the castle in a late-perpendicular style. He extended the castle by building family apartments between the Great Hall and Mortimer's Tower, and used the former royal apartments as a guest wing, starting a tradition of decorating the Great Hall with the coats of arms of council officers. The larger windows in the castle were glazed, a clock installed and water piped into the castle. The judicial facilities were improved with a new courthouse converted out of the 14th-century chapel, facilities for prisoners and storage facilities for the court records, Mortimer's Tower in the outer bailey being turned into a record depository. The restoration was generally sympathetic and, although it included a fountain, a <b>real</b> <b>tennis</b> court, walks and viewing platform, it was less ephemeral a make-over than seen in other castle restorations of the period.|$|E

In this paper we describe our approach to this task, which integrates computer vision, machine listening, and machine learning. At the low level processing, we improve upon our previously proposed state-of-the-art tennis ball tracking algorithm and employ audio signal processing techniques to detect key events and construct features for classifying the events. At high level analysis, we model event classification as a sequence labelling problem, and investigate four machine learning techniques using simulated event sequences. Finally, we evaluate our proposed approach on three <b>real</b> world <b>tennis</b> games, and discuss the interplay between audio, vision and learning.

5|$|The Gentlemen's Singles competition, {{the only}} {{event of the}} championship, was contested on grass courts by 22 players who each paid one guinea to participate.

5|$|The Trocadero sits in {{the area}} between Coventry Street, Great Windmill Street and Shaftesbury Avenue, with the main {{entrance}} on Coventry Street. The origins of the site {{can be traced back}} to 1744, when John Cartwright gave a 99-year lease on this land to Thomas Higginson, in order to construct a <b>real</b> <b>tennis</b> court. Higginson retained ownership of the court until 1761, after which it had a number of owners through to the 19th century. From the 1820s onwards, it was used as a music and exhibition hall. After the lease expired in 1842, ownership passed to John Musgrove, who sublet it to Robert Bignel. Bignel redesigned the premises as a number of assembly rooms called the Argyll Rooms. It acquired a notorious reputation for prostitution, and consequently closed in 1878. It re-opened four years later as the Trocadero Palace, a music hall. A group of shops were established on the site in 1889, and the entire development was sold to J. Lyon's & Co in 1895. Having been part of the Lyons restaurant complex and shops for much of the 20th century, it is now a shopping centre.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to test empirically the Minimax Theorem {{with the help of}} <b>real</b> data from <b>tennis</b> matches. The thesis {{is based on the assumption}} that the serve is the crucial factor of a game for a player and that it influences the length of the following exchange. Based on these assumptions a hypothesis is deduced stating that according to the minimax hypothesis, a server plays the more, the shorter the exchanges following serve are. The hypothesis is first verified by a regression analysis and then, to strengthen the validity of its results, with the help of the Pearson's chi-square goodness-of-fit test of equality of two distributions. The hypothesis is finally confirmed based on these two methods...|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{binocular}} disparity {{provides a useful}} source of information allowing three-dimensional (3 -D) shape to be recovered from horizontal {{binocular disparity}}. In order to influence metric shape judgments, a large field of view is required, suggesting that vertical disparity may play a limited role {{in the perception of}} objects projecting small retinal images. This limitation could be overcome if vertical disparity information could be pooled over wide areas of 3 -D space. This was investigated by assessing the effect of vertical disparity scaling of a large surround surface on the perceived size and 3 -D shape of a small, central object. Observers adjusted {{the size and shape of}} a virtual, binocularly defined ellipsoid to match those of a <b>real,</b> hand-held <b>tennis</b> ball. The virtual ball was presented at three distances (200, 325, and 450 mm). Vertical disparities in a large surround surface were manipulated to be consistent with a distance of 160 mm or infinity. Both shape and size settings were influenced by this manipulation. This effect did not depend on presenting the surround and target objects at the same distance. These results suggest that the influence of vertical disparity on the perceived distance to a surface also affects the estimated distance of other visible surfaces. Vertical disparities are therefore important in the perception of metric depth, even for objects that in themselves subtend only small retinal images...|$|R

This study compared the movement patterns of nineteen 10 – 12 yr old children, while playing table tennis on three AVG consoles (Nintendo Wii, Xbox Kinect, Sony Move) and as a real world task. Wrist and elbow joint angles and hand path distance and speed were captured. Children playing <b>real</b> table <b>tennis</b> had significantly smaller (e. g. Wrist Angle Forehand Real-Kinect: Mean Difference (MD) : - 18. 2 °, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : - 26. 15 to - 10. 26) and slower (e. g. Average Speed Forehand Real-Kinect: MD: - 1. 98 m s- 1, 95 % CI: - 2. 35 to - 1. 61) movements than when using all three AVGs. Hand path distance was smaller in forehand and backhand strokes (e. g. Kinect-Wii: MD: 0. 46 m, 95 % CI: 0. 13 – 0. 79) during playing with Kinect than Move and Wii. The movement patterns when playing real and virtual table tennis were different and this may impede the development of real world gross motor skills.

30|$|A “costume-as-big-data” {{approach}} could have broader {{implications for the}} world of sports. At Grand Slams, the costumed performing body is already seen through a range of modes: live on court; via camera feed to screens within the grounds (e.g. Henman Hill at Wimbledon); to screens beyond the grounds; in online blogs and video clips of matches; and in news/magazine reports. Media channels broadcasting action from Grand Slam events already augment their coverage of matches with innumerable statistics and graphs plotting ball placement and speed, whilst commentators from screen and print media {{have been known to}} pass comment on what a player is wearing. The data captured by smart fabrics may presage a future where players’ heart rates or biometric rhythms are reported across key points, leading to a place where costume presents itself as a temporal-spatial layered and multi-dimensional event concerned with both aesthetics and the human condition—as a performative agent rather than a decorative layer. This concept is echoed by Chen Shachar, co-founder and CEO of PlaySight’s SmartCourt: “imagine big data-information and video from all over the world—letting you compare your performance with other players, find partners, have remote coaching” (Leybovich 2015, p. 26). As fabric science advances, Walzer (2013, p. 1) predicts: “a shirt that doubles as a personal trainer. A jacket able to take photos with gesture movements… Fabrics that boost energy, reduce cellulite and moisturize your skin”. Beyond the technological expertise needed to assemble the hardware and software for <b>real</b> time <b>tennis</b> costume sensing and data capture, {{there is a need for}} tools which help players to organize, analyze and integrate the variety of visual and numerical information communicated by their costume. Treating tennis costume as a means to extend players’ physical bodies raises questions about the future and the boundaries of sports performance through fashion, design and the practical applications of fabric science technologies.|$|R
