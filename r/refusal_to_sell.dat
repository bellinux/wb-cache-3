25|$|The Black Patch Tobacco Wars, a vigilante action, {{occurred}} in Western Kentucky {{in the early}} 20th century.

Moreover, it would endanger legitimate relationships, such as exclusive distributorships, which the Court was evidently not prepared to disturb.|$|R
25|$|Prior to 1984, ROCAF {{fighters were}} almost {{exclusively}} American-made aircraft sold under {{terms of a}} mutual defense treaty between the Republic of China and the United States. Development of the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) began in 1984 due to U.S. <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> F-16s to the ROCAF {{as a result of}} changes in national policy between the U.S. and the People's Republic of China. After a successful maiden flight in 1989, the domestically produced fighter entered service in 1994. However, the ROCAF was subsequently able to obtain F-16s from the United States as well as Mirage 2000-5 fighters from France, resulting in delays to later IDF development that had been anticipated.|$|E
25|$|Packer {{was often}} the centre of controversy. One of the {{earliest}} incidents occurred on 7 June 1960, {{when his father was}} trying to take over the Anglican Press, a small publisher run by Francis James. According to author Richard Neville, Frank Packer was angered by James' <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the Anglican Press, so he sent Kerry and some burly friends to pressure him into selling. They forced their way in and reportedly began vandalising the premises, but James was able to barricade himself in his office and call his friend Rupert Murdoch, Packer's most powerful rival. Murdoch quickly dispatched his own team of 'heavies', who threw Kerry and friends out. Not surprisingly, the Murdoch press had a field day with the news that the son of Australia's biggest media tycoon had been caught brawling in the street.|$|E
25|$|The racial {{makeup of}} Union-Miles Park changed {{as the local}} Union-Miles Park economy worsened. African Americans had long been {{restricted}} to Cleveland's Central neighborhood by white <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> or rent to blacks, restrictive housing covenants, and low incomes. Few blacks lived outside Central; just 2,300 African Americans (10 {{percent of the total}} neighborhood population) lived in Union-Miles Park in 1960. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, African Americans moved into Cleveland neighborhoods being abandoned by whites—neighborhoods once denied to blacks, but now with plenty of empty housing being sold at steep discounts. Although Cleveland as a whole lost 52 percent of its population from 1960 to 1980, the city's African American population held steady. There were 253,108 African American residents in Cleveland in 1960 (28.9 percent of total population), and 252,481 blacks in Cleveland in 1980 (44 percent of total population)—a loss of just 627 people. As a percentage of population, however, African Americans rose from 28.9 {{percent of the total population}} in 1960 to 44 percent of the total population in 1980.|$|E
50|$|A boycott is a <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> buy, <b>sell,</b> or {{otherwise}} trade {{with an individual}} or business. Other tactics include go-slow, sabotage, work-to-rule, sit-in or en-masse not reporting to work. Some labour law explicitly bans such activity, none explicitly allows it.|$|R
50|$|The author builds his {{analysis}} on the exhaustion doctrine and the repair and reconstruction doctrine, which hold respectively that the owner of patented property such as a machine {{has a right to}} use and dispose of it without being subject to post-sale restrictions by the patentee and a right to repair it to keep it in good order. The general theory is that once a manufacturer such as Kodak <b>sells</b> a copier <b>to</b> a customer, the customer acquires a property interest in the copier that includes a right to use it without restrictions and keep it in good repair, but <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> repair parts <b>to</b> ISOs (at least absent a sound business justification) unreasonably derogates from the customer's property rights.|$|R

500|$|Although the Minas Geraes class {{remained}} in Brazilian hands, the mutiny {{had a clear}} detrimental effect on the navy's readiness: by 1912, an Armstrong agent stated that the ships were in terrible condition, with rust already forming on turrets and boilers. The agent believed it would cost the Brazilian Navy around £700,000 to address these issues. Haggard tersely commented, [...] "These ships are absolutely useless to Brazil," [...] a sentiment echoed by Proceedings. Despite the government's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the two Minas Geraes-class ships and subsequent support for acquiring Rio de Janeiro, some historians credit the rebellion, combined with the Baron of Rio Branco's death in 1912, as major factors in the Brazilian government's decision (which was possibly made by January 1913, but certainly by September) to sell the ship to the Ottomans.|$|E
500|$|Most of Yonkers' {{economy in}} the early 19th century {{was derived from the}} Saw Mill River. As of 1813, there was a small wharf {{slightly}} upstream from the mouth where the sloops that carried river trade put in. Five small mills existed along the river above the village, all with their own dams, small mill ponds, and nearby tenements for the workers. The stagecoach route up the Post Road stopped at an inn near the bridge; a few stores existed to supply the workers there and at the mills. [...] Some pastures and orchards existed, but the rocky soil deterred most attempts at farming. (A historian later wrote that it was said at the time that [...] "the succession of boulders was so continuous that one might have stepped from Getty Square to the present Glenwood without setting his foot upon the ground".) Between the rocky soil and Wells' general <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> or lease most of his land, there were so few settlers in Yonkers that two schoolhouses built during the Revolution fell into severe neglect {{due to the lack of}} students.|$|E

40|$|The Federal Circuit's {{decision}} in CSU v. Xerox 1 has generated enormous controversy. However, {{there seems to}} be emerging agreement among both critics and supporters of the decision on a correct, narrow reading of the decision. Whatever else the decision stands for, it appears to declare antitrust immunity for unilateral <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> or license patented or copyrighted intellectual property (IP). What was at stake in Xerox is whether a firm with a legitimate property right in the design of certain parts has the right to condition sale of those parts with terms that enable Xerox to obtain a monopoly in a different market, for service labor. More broadly, what is at stake is a safe harbor for conduct that previously has been found illegal. For, although much emphasis is placed on whether this was a unilateral <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> deal (as opposed to a concerted agreement, which would not be exempt from Section 1 scrutiny), it is at least as important that this was a conditional refusal. As I show below, the meaningful distinction between this conditional <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> deal and a conventional illegal tie is nil. Further, if an antitrust exemption is given to all conditional unilateral <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal, this formalistic shield will be easily available in the future to firms that would otherwise be subject to antitrust liability for tying or other concerted agreements...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Increasing sterile syringe {{access for}} {{injection}} drug users (IDUs) {{is one way to}} prevent HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in this population. In 2005, California Senate Bill 1159 allowed counties to adopt the Disease Prevention Demonstration Project (DPDP).

500|$|When {{the open}} housing {{proposal}} became public, local reaction was often hostile. [...] Such {{was the reaction}} of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit.

By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{exclusive}} sale contract or solus agreement. Its first part identifies some characteristic features {{of this type of}} agreement, which quite often is not only aimed at regulating the exercise of trade, but also serves as a technique of market organization and economic power concentration. The impact of the increasing currency of such commercial practices on the free market justifies consideration of the various forms of control that can be exercised by public authorities in order to preserve free competition. Control can be achieved through the judiciary applying concepts such as public order in civil law or public policy at common law. However, in view of the courts' reluctance to interfere with such instances of private economic power and their indifference towards the economic inequities inherent in such agreements for the distributor, legislative intervention has become necessary to protect the free market. Thus the Combines Investigation Act was amended in 1976 to allow regulation of commercial practices such as <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> deal, consignment <b>selling,</b> exclusive dealing, market restriction and tied selling...|$|R
