5|$|The realist {{narrative}} {{style of}} Pather Panchali {{was influenced by}} Italian neorealism and the works of French director Jean Renoir. In 1949 Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River (1951). Ray, {{a founding member of}} the Calcutta Film Society (established in 1947), helped him scout for locations in the countryside. When Ray told him about his longstanding wish to film Pather Panchali, Renoir encouraged him to proceed. In 1950 Ray was sent to London by his employer, the advertising agency D.J. Keymer, to work at their headquarters. During his six months in London, he watched about 100 films. Among these, Vittorio De Sica's neorealist film Bicycle Thieves (1948) had a profound impact on him. In a 1982 lecture, <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> that he had come out of the theatre determined to become a filmmaker. The film made him believe that it was possible to make realistic cinema that was shot on location with an amateur cast.|$|E
500|$|... "You Really Got Me" [...] {{was written}} by Ray Davies, the Kinks' vocalist and main songwriter, {{sometime}} between 9 and 12 March 1964. Created on the piano {{in the front room}} of the Davies' home, the song was stylistically very different from the finished product, being much lighter and somewhat jazz-oriented. <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> of the song's writing, [...] "When I came up with [...] I hadn't been writing songs very long at all. It {{was one of the first}} five I ever came up with." ...|$|E
500|$|Ray, {{initially}} {{planning for}} the song to be a [...] "more laid-back number", later played the chords of the song to brother Dave Davies, the Kinks' lead guitarist. However, upon hearing the track, Dave decided that the riff {{would be much more}} powerful on a guitar. <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> of the track's change to a guitar-centred track, [...] "I wanted it to be a jazz-type tune, because that's what I liked at the time. It's written originally around a sax line... Dave ended up playing the sax line in fuzz guitar and it took the song a step further." [...] The band then began to perform the new track in some of their live shows, where it was well received.|$|E

Navarro was reported to be in serious pain and had to be carted off the field. Later that day it was announced that Navarro suffered a bruised nerve. The <b>Rays</b> <b>said</b> that the injury was not bad enough that it would cause Navarro to miss opening day.|$|R

500|$|They {{admitted}} that Ray was a thief and burglar, but {{claimed that he}} had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon. However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for charges of armed robbery. In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. Jerry <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> that he had assisted his brother on one such robbery. [...] "I never been with nobody as bold as he is," [...] Jerry said. [...] "He just walked in and put that gun on somebody, it was just like it's an everyday thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} the single reached, {{it would be}} one of the Kinks' final hits in either Britain or America, ending the {{comeback}} the band had during the late 1970s and early 1980s. <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> in 1996, [...] " [...] wanted to quit in 1984, after 'Come Dancing.' I felt that that was the end of an era for the Kinks, and I wanted to stop the treadmill and step back and reappraise the whole thing, but we had another album to deliver. It seemed like we always had another album to deliver." [...] Mick Avory left the band in 1984, a year after [...] "Come Dancing" [...] peaked in the USA. He later said, [...] "I think leaving after a world wide hit with 'Come Dancing' was a good note to leave on." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1998, <b>Ray</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'd written 'You Really Got Me' as {{tribute to}} all those great blues people I love: Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy." [...] Dave cited Gerry Mulligan as an inspiration, saying, [...] "Ray was a great fan of Gerry Mulligan, who was in , and as {{he sat at the}} piano at home, he sort of messed around in a vein similar to Mulligan and came up with this figure based on a 12-bar blues". Dave has also said that song had been {{inspired}} by Jimmy Giuffre's song [...] "The Train and the River". According to the band's manager, Larry Page, the song's characteristic riff came about while working out the chords of the Kingsmen's [...] "Louie Louie". Lyrically, the song was said to be influenced by an encounter with one of the band's [...] "first serious female fans." ...|$|E

500|$|On June 23, 2000, the {{suspense}} ended when Ray submitted the final Independent Counsel {{report on the}} travel office affair under seal to the judicial panel {{in charge of the}} investigation and publicly announced that he would seek no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. [...] <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> that she had, contrary to her statements, [...] "ultimately influenced" [...] the decision to fire the employees. [...] However, [...] "the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that any of Mrs. Clinton's statements and testimony regarding her involvement in the travel office firings were knowingly false," [...] and thus prosecution was declined. [...] White House press secretary Joe Lockhart was critical of Ray's statement: [...] "By inappropriately characterizing the results of a legally sealed report through innuendo, the Office of Independent Counsel has further politicized an investigation that has dragged on far too long." ...|$|E
500|$|Ray's {{work has}} been {{described}} as full of humanism and universality, and of a deceptive simplicity with deep underlying complexity. The Japanese director Akira Kurosawa said, [...] "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon." [...] But his detractors find his films glacially slow, moving like a [...] "majestic snail." [...] Some find his humanism simple-minded, and his work anti-modern; they criticize him for lacking the new modes of expression or experimentation found in works of Ray's contemporaries, such as Jean-Luc Godard. As Stanley Kauffman wrote, some critics believe that Ray assumes that viewers [...] "can be interested in a film that simply dwells in its characters, rather than one that imposes dramatic patterns on their lives." [...] <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> he could do nothing about the slow pace. Kurosawa defended him by saying that Ray's films were not slow, [...] "His work can be described as flowing composedly, like a big river".|$|E
500|$|Political ideologues {{took issue}} with Ray's work. In a public debate during the 1960s, Ray and the Marxist filmmaker Mrinal Sen engaged in an argument. Sen criticised him for casting a matin√©e idol such as Uttam Kumar, whom he {{considered}} a compromise. <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> that Sen only attacked [...] "easy targets", i.e. the Bengali middle-classes. However Ray himself has made movies on Bengali middle class in films like Pratidwandi and Jana Aranya set {{during the period of}} the naxalite movement in Bengal. Advocates of socialism said that Ray was not [...] "committed" [...] to the cause of the nation's downtrodden classes; some critics accused him of glorifying poverty in Pather Panchali and Ashani Sanket (Distant Thunder) through lyricism and aesthetics. They said he provided no solution to conflicts in the stories, and was unable to overcome his bourgeois background. During the naxalite movements in the 1970s, agitators once came close to causing physical harm to his son, Sandip. Early in 1980, Ray was criticised by an Indian M.P. and former actress Nargis Dutt, who accused Ray of [...] "exporting poverty." [...] She wanted him to make films to represent [...] "Modern India." ...|$|E

500|$|As with Miley and Ray Cyrus's last duet, [...] "Ready, Set, Don't Go" [...] (2007), [...] "Butterfly Fly Away" [...] {{describes}} a child's transition to adulthood. The song was written and produced by Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri for the 2009 film [...] According to the film, when main character Miley Stewart (played by Miley Cyrus) was young, her father Robby Ray Stewart (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), would often {{tell her that}} while a caterpillar {{may not be able}} to move much, it can still dream about the butterfly it will one day be. This comment became a recurring motif in the film and provided the basis for the lyrics to [...] "Butterfly Fly Away", which use a caterpillar's metamorphosis as a metaphor for a child's coming of age. In Hannah Montana: The Movie, the Cyruses perform the song as their characters in [...] "a tender movie scene under a gazebo in the rain". Billy <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> filming the scene was [...] "a pretty special moment. The song itself was written by Glen Ballard, a masterful songwriter who wrote 'Man in the Mirror' for Michael Jackson. I knew it was a pretty special song [...] and it certainly comes at a nice spot in the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Ray wrote {{a script}} {{for a film}} to be called The Alien, based on his short story [...] "Bankubabur Bandhu" [...] ("Banku Babu's Friend"), which he wrote in 1962 for Sandesh, the Ray family magazine. Columbia Pictures was the {{producer}} for what was a planned US-India co-production, and Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers were cast as the leading actors. Ray found that his script had been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Mike Wilson. Wilson had initially approached Ray through their mutual friend, Arthur C. Clarke, to represent him in Hollywood. Wilson copyrighted the script credited to Mike Wilson & Satyajit Ray, although he contributed only one word. Ray later said that he never received a penny for the script. After Brando {{dropped out of the}} project, the project tried to replace him with James Coburn, but Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta. Columbia expressed interest in reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s, but nothing came of it. When E.T. was released in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similarities in the film to his earlier Alien script. Ray claimed that this film plagiarized his script. <b>Ray</b> <b>said</b> that Steven Spielberg's movie [...] "would not have been possible without my script of 'The Alien' being available throughout America in mimeographed copies." [...] Spielberg denied any plagiarism by saying, [...] "I was a kid in high school when this script was circulating in Hollywood." [...] (Spielberg actually graduated high school in 1965 and released his first film in 1968). Besides The Alien, two other unrealised projects that Ray had intended to direct were adaptations of the ancient Indian epic, the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, and E. M. Forster's 1924 novel A Passage to India.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead {{focusing}} on {{work in the}} studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, [...] "Wonderboy", released {{in the spring of}} 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. [...] "In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful‚ÄîPete Quaife recalled, [...] "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." [...] At the end of June, the Kinks released the single [...] "Days", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. [...] "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", <b>Ray</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I played it to Brian, who used to be our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful‚Äîlike going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone." [...] "Days" [...] reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.|$|E
