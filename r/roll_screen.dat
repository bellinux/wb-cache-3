The titular Master Pillywags hosts the variety show in his basement, {{with the help}} of his servants, Screen (a {{projection}} screen with eyes and a mouth) and Greg (a goblinesque creature). In the pilot, Pillywags interviews a pair of inanimate dolls propped up on a shelf before performing a song about love. He then invites a guest onto the set, his neighbor Professor Steve, who has been captured by Pillywags pet monster and is enclosed in its mouth. When asked by Pillywags why his monster chose to swallow him, Steve posits that, due to his small stature, he was mistaken for prey. This brings Pillywags to the topic of size, and, before airing an animated segment on the topic of it, he asks the viewer the question, [...] "is it better to be big or small?" [...] After the cartoon, Pillywags answers the question saying that it is better to be big. As the credits <b>roll,</b> <b>Screen</b> and Greg [...] "take five" [...] before preparing themselves for the next show.|$|E

50|$|A {{screen is}} an attempt by an {{offensive}} player to stop a defender from guarding the ball-carrier. For example, John Stockton and Karl Malone were well known for their pick and <b>roll</b> (or <b>screen</b> and <b>roll)</b> play. The ball-carrier's teammate is the screener; {{he stands in the}} path of the defender as the ball-carrier dribbles past the screener. This at least costs the defender time, and may induce a collision. Either leaves the ball-carrier unguarded. However, if the screener moves towards the ball-carrier when contact occurs, or does not respect the elements of time and distance, or initiates contact, he is charged with illegal screening or setting a moving pick. These are blocking fouls.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Chemotherapy {{after surgery}} {{is one of}} the {{adjuvant}} therapy components in breast cancerpatients. In the current study, Taxane-based and Anthracycline-based regimes were compared toCyclophosphamide, Methotrexate and 5 -Fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy after modified radicalmastectomy (MRM) surgery in terms of disease-free survival (DFS). Materials and Methods: Sixty-two patients with confirmed breast cancer that underwent MRMsurgery at no metastasis stage (M 0) enrolled. These patients were received one of the three types ofadjuvant chemotherapies that mentioned above and the relapse/metastasis in 8 -year follow-up wasrecorded. In addition, some paraclinical and demographical factors were recorded and the efficacy of thedifferent chemotherapy regimes was compared using log-logistic survival model. Results: The mean age (SD) of patients was 49 (1. 31). More than 40 % of patients had tumors withgrade 3. The median time of follow-up was 20. 0 months and the rate of 5 -year DFS was 48 %. Survivalanalysis indicated that type of chemotherapy (OR(Taxane/CMF) = 3. 676; OR (Anthracycline/CMF) = 3. 185),histological grade (OR= 2. 528), tumor size (OR= 5. 598) and number of lymph nodes (OR= 1. 112) affectthe DFS. Conclusion: The results of the current study indicated that the efficacy of Taxane-based andAnthracycline-based is more than CMF. This study also showed that early detection of tumor was animportant factor for a successful treatment in terms of DFS, and so, it declares the <b>roll</b> of <b>screening</b> andpublic education...|$|R

The Start and Select buttons on the second controller do not work at all, likely a relic of the Japanese Famicom which had hard-wired controllers, only the first of which had Start and Select buttons. The use of specific NES joysticks and other controller peripherals that were meant for the original consoles usually do not work when connecting it to the Super 8. European model SNES users are only able to play European SNES games, other overseas games were incompatible. There are also brightness issues present in some games.|$|R
40|$|Think {{of perfume}} wrappings and {{chocolate}} boxes. For such high quality printing products, printing inks with special effect pigments are used more frequently {{due to the}} unique optical properties and visual appearance. The shifting color, the pearlescent gloss and the visible texture of printed special effect colors fascinate the observer. A {{lack of knowledge about}} the printing of special effect colors and about the description of the optical properties and visual appearance causes problems. First, special effect printing calls for knowledge about the influence of different printing parameters. Therefore, multiple samples varying in the special effect pigment, paper quality, varnishing state and background color were printed. In screen printing, 22 inks with pigments of BASF SE were applied on a white glossy and black uncoated paper. The combination of 22 pigments with two paper grades or background colors results in 44 application cases. In total, 224 application cases were realized in flexo printing with 28 pigments of MERCK KGaA, two paper qualities, two background colors and two varnishing states. A white glossy and matt coated paper was partially primed with a black light-absorbing ink and partly varnished with a clear gloss varnish. Furthermore, some knowledge about the bidirectional reflectance and texture distribution is required to specify the optical properties. A database was thus generated basing on spectral and imaging measurements in multiple geometric configurations. The determined reflectance spectra, color coordinates and texture parameters are filed in a hierarchical structure. Using the freely available bidirectional reflectance and texture data (www. idd. tu-darmstadt. de, office@idd. tudarmstadt. de), the influence of the varied printing parameters on perception-related parameters was investigated. A medium and very high hue difference sum is caused by interference effect and multi-color pigments, respectively. For the comparably large sparkle pigments, the sparkle parameters are particularly high. Perceptually, the lightness difference sum and the relative luminance difference do not satisfactorily represent the lightness shift and the contrast gloss or distinctness-of-image gloss. All considered parameters are significantly lower for the white paper than the black printed background. Finally, the essential visual appearance attributes should be known for the description of the visual appearance. Their number and nature was determined by means of visual experiments and statistical evaluations. In a color matching light both and a multi-angle test bench, 14 <b>rolled</b> <b>screen</b> and 20 planar flexo printing samples were presented, respectively. Visual differences and twelve attributes were rated in relative and absolute category scaling experiments, respectively. They were evaluated in classical multidimensional scaling, in two correlation analyses, a principal component analysis and in an exploratory factor analysis. According to the STRESS values, cumulated variances and the eigenvalues, at most six attributes are essential. Significantly positive correlation coefficients between the two and three tested gloss and texture attributes, respectively, suggest their joint consideration. The composition and factor loadings indicate that the six essential attributes are the four color attributes hue, chroma, lightness and hue shift as well as the two combined attributes for gloss and texture...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} research 2 -year-olds {{have failed to}} show knowledge of solidity in a search task in which a ball <b>rolled</b> behind a <b>screen</b> and was stopped by a barrier. The screen had four doors and the barrier was visible above the door hiding the ball. To establish what cues 2 -year-olds might be using, precise point-of-gaze measures were taken during the hiding event. A transparent screen with opaque doors provided two cues: (1) the ball could be tracked until it failed to emerge, and (2) the barrier’s position could indicate the correct door. Point-of-gaze measures revealed that children failed to use the more indirect cue of the barrier, which requires reasoning and spatial integration. Their search success was predicted only by the more immediate cue of actively tracking the ball. These findings support the claim that children use best those cues {{directly related to the}} object’s disappearance, while failing to use cues that entail higher cognitive demands...|$|R
