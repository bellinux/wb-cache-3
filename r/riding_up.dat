5|$|The Desert Mounted Corps {{began the}} advance <b>riding</b> <b>up</b> the Plain of Sharon to Liktera, on 19 September where they {{attacked}} and captured an entrenched line barring their advance. Subsequently, the Corps crossed the Mount Carmel Range by the Musmus Pass {{and the northern}} Shushu Pass, during the night of 19/20 September. As the 4th Cavalry Division rode out across the Esdraelon Plain {{on the morning of}} 20 September, towards their primary objective; the main communications hub at Afulah, they attacked and captured a force sent from Yildirim Army Group headquarters at Nazareth, to hold and bar the Musmus Pass, which had failed to get into position. Afulah was captured by units from both the 5th and the 4th Cavalry Divisions shortly after. Leaving the 5th Cavalry Division and one regiments at Afulah, the 4th Cavalry Division advanced to capture Beisan and later in the day, the regiment advanced directly from Afulah to occupy the railway bridges at Jisr el Mejamie, across the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers. The capture of Jenin on the southern edge of the Esdraelon Plain, also blocked the main line of retreat to Damascus from the Judean Hills. The General Headquarters of the Yildirim Army Group commanded by General Otto Liman von Sanders at Nazareth was captured the next day, and Haifa two days later.|$|E

There were no injuries, although one passenger was taken to hospital for checks. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch report stated that the incident was due to exceptionally slippery rails, but that {{the consequences of this}} were made more severe by the buffer stop being of an older design, which did not absorb the impact energy effectively. The report further stated that that particular stop had not undergone a risk assessment within the previous ten years, and was possibly not appropriate for class 221 units.|$|E
25|$|As skirts became {{narrower}} and flatter in front, {{more emphasis}} {{was placed on}} the waist and hips. A corset was therefore used to help mold the body to the desired shape. This was achieved by making the corsets longer than before, and by constructing them from separate shaped pieces of fabric. To increase rigidity, they were reinforced with many strips of whalebone, cording, or pieces of leather. As well as making corsets more constricting, this heavy structure helped prevent them from <b>riding</b> <b>up,</b> or from wrinkling at the waist. Steam-molding also helped create a curvaceous contour. Developed by Edwin Izod in the late 1860s, the procedure involved placing a corset, wet with starch, on a steam heated copper torso form until it dried into shape. While tight lacing continued to be a hotly debated topic among moralists and physicians, most extreme descriptions came from male sexual fantasies.|$|E
25|$|Three of the outlaws (Bob Younger, Frank James and Charlie Pitts) {{crossed the}} bridge by the Ames Mill {{and entered the}} bank; the other five (Jesse James, Cole and Jim Younger, Bill Stiles and Clell Miller) stood guard outside {{with two or three}} <b>riding</b> <b>up</b> and down Division Street {{shooting}} their guns to frighten people off the street. Local citizens soon realized a robbery was in progress and several took up arms from local hardware stores. Shooting from behind cover, they poured a deadly fire on the outlaws. During the gun battle, medical student Henry Wheeler, shooting from a third-floor window of the Dampier House Hotel {{across the street from the}} bank, killed Miller. Another civilian named A.R. Manning, who took cover at the corner of the Sciver building down the street, killed Stiles. Other civilians wounded the Younger brothers (Cole was shot in his left hip, Bob suffered a shattered elbow, and Jim was shot in the jaw). The only civilian fatality on the street was 30-year-old Nicholas Gustafson, an unarmed recent Swedish immigrant, who was killed by Cole Younger at the corner of 5th Street and Division.|$|E

25|$|A highly fictionalized {{version of}} Balian {{is the main}} {{character}} of the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven, played by Orlando Bloom {{as a young man}} with a questioning sensibility regarding religion and social attitudes. In the film, Balian's father, a fictional character named Godfrey the Baron of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson), returns to Europe to find Balian, his long-lost illegitimate son, who is a blacksmith in France, and encourages him to come to the Holy Land as his heir. Balian is portrayed as having a love affair with Sibylla (this is possibly derived from the Old French Continuation of William of Tyres claims about her and Baldwin). The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem, and instead of working in close alliance with Patriarch Eraclius, Balian is depicted as his rival. In the film's coda, Balian returns to France (with Sibylla) where he meets Richard I of England, who rides up to Balian and says to him that he is looking for Balian, the defender of Jerusalem, to which Balian replies that he is a blacksmith. After some time passes Balian and Sibylla are seen to be <b>riding</b> <b>up</b> the crossroads his father had used when returning from Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the desert}} tribes' {{relationship}} with the Romans was not exclusively hostile. The {{other side of the}} coin is that many volunteered to serve in the Roman army, in both the regular auxilia and irregular native foederati (allied) units (although conscription was still common at this time - and was another cause of discontent). The army provided the prospect of a well-paid career which gave scope for the tribesmen's martial nature, which was highly regarded by the Romans. Numidian cavalry (equites Numidarum or Maurorum), which had played a prominent role in Roman armies since the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), were regarded as the best light cavalry in the Roman world. A Numidian cavalryman rode his small but agile and resilient desert mount without bridle, saddle or stirrups, restraining it by a loose rope round its neck and directing it by leg movements and voice commands. Unarmoured, he was protected by just a small round leather shield. His weaponry consisted of several javelins. Exceptionally fast and manoeuvrable, Numidian cavalry would harass the enemy by hit-and-run attacks, <b>riding</b> <b>up</b> and loosing volleys of javelins, then scattering and retreating faster than any opposing cavalry could pursue. They were superbly suited to scouting, harassment, ambush and pursuit. Numidian foot soldiers were also predominantly light infantry, relying on speed and manoeuvrability. However, both Numidian foot and mounted warriors were vulnerable in close-order combat with Roman troops, who mainly wore metal armour.|$|E

500|$|After {{rallying}} {{his troops}} near Schwennenbach – well beyond their starting point – Eugene prepared {{to launch a}} second attack, led by the second-line squadrons under the Duke of Württemberg-Teck. Yet again they {{were caught in the}} murderous cross-fire from the artillery in Lutzingen and Oberglauheim, and were once again thrown back in disarray. The French and Bavarians, however, were almost as disordered as their opponents, and they too were in need of inspiration from their commander, the Elector, who was seen – [...] " ... <b>riding</b> <b>up</b> and down, and inspiring his men with fresh courage." [...] Anhalt-Dessau's Danish and Prussian infantry attacked a second time but could not sustain the advance without proper support. Once again they fell back across the stream.|$|E
500|$|The huge war party {{crossed into}} central Texas and first {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Victoria, August 6. Although rangers had found the tracks of a gigantic war party coming out of West Texas, and were shadowing the onrushing Comanches, {{part of the war}} party broke off and attacked Victoria before the citizens could be warned. One resident wrote, [...] "We of Victoria were startled by the apparitions presented by the sudden appearance of six hundred mounted Comanches in the immediate outskirts of the village." [...] The citizens of Victoria hid in the buildings, and the Comanches, after killing a dozen or so townspeople and <b>riding</b> <b>up</b> and down, departed Victoria when rifle fire from the buildings began to make the riding dangerous. The war party intended to gather horses and loot the coastal towns, which were not as prepared for the Comanches as the central Texas cities. After the attack on Victoria, the Comanches camped the night of August 6 on nearby Spring Creek.|$|E

500|$|From the Second Punic War {{until the}} 3rd century AD, {{the bulk of}} Rome's light cavalry (apart from mounted archers from Syria) was {{provided}} by the inhabitants of the Maghrebi provinces of Africa and Mauretania Caesariensis, the Numidae or Mauri (from whom derives the English term [...] "Moors"), who were the ancestors of the Berber people of modern Algeria and Morocco. They were known as the equites Maurorum or Numidarum ("Moorish or Numidian cavalry"). On Trajan's Column, Mauri horsemen, depicted with long hair in dreadlocks, are shown riding their small but resilient horses bare-back and unbridled, with a simple braided rope round their mount's neck for control. They wear no body or head armour, carrying only a small, round leather shield. Their weaponry cannot be discerned due to stone erosion, but is known from Livy to have consisted of several short javelins. Exceptionally fast and maneuverable, Numidian cavalry would harass the enemy by hit-and-run attacks, <b>riding</b> <b>up</b> and loosing volleys of javelins, then scattering faster than any opposing cavalry could pursue.
