40|$|Abstract Since Fe-Cu-C {{sintered}} steels {{are easily}} rusted, they are coated with rust preventive oils. High viscosity of those rust preventive oils decrease workability, and low viscosity deteriorates rust preventive performance. Therefore, {{it is necessary}} to develop new rust preventive oils with contradictory properties of low viscosity and superior <b>rust</b> <b>prevention.</b> However, precise methodology to evaluate <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> ability has not been established. In this study, we developed new technique to quantitatively evaluate <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> ability by measuring the open circuit potential through thin corrosive solution on Fe-Cu-C sintered steels coated with a rust preventive oils. As a result, the ability for <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> can be measured quantitatively, and it decreases slowly over time, with repeating destruction and restoration. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} deteriorating processes of <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> ability for <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> oils are composed of three characteristics steps respectively. That is, in the first step the great open circuit potential changes from 0 V to- 0. 3 V with repetition were observed where the excellent <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> ability was kept, in the second step it decreases slowly from- 0. 1 V to- 0. 4 V with oscillation of the small potential changes where the gradual decrease of <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> ability was recognized and in the third step it decreases monotonously in the lower potential than- 0. 4 V where the rust was observed because of the remarkable deteriorating of the <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> ability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{electricity}} rust preventive machining method {{has been developed}} to perfectly prevent the rust of workpiece using only {{the water in the}} surface grinding. The surface grinding can be performed under the condition of <b>rust</b> <b>prevention,</b> in which a negligible current is applied between the workpiece, connected with the cathode, and the cooling water, connected with the anode. This method can be an ultimate zero emission ecology machining, because only the water is used as the working fluid without the extreme pressure additive, the mineral oil, and the surface active agent...|$|E
40|$|Fe-Cu-C {{sintered}} steels {{are widely}} used as powder materials, because of its small volumetric shrinkage. However, Cu, which acts as cathode enhance formation of rust Fe 2 O 3 ·xH 2 O during fabrication. To prevent formation of Fe 2 O 3 ·xH 2 O rust preventive oils {{are widely used}}. High viscosity of those rust preventive oils decrease workability. While, low viscosity degrade rust preventive performance. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop new rust preventive oils with contradictory properties of low viscosity and superior <b>rust</b> <b>prevention.</b> In this study, we developed technique to quantitatively evaluate <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> ability by measuring polarization curve through thin corrosive solution on Fe-Cu-C sintered steels coated with rust preventive oils. The electrochemical measurements were carried out in corrosive solution of 0. 35 mass % NaCl. Using a double capillary was added dropwise to the specimen. From the experimental, it is possible to evaluate the corrosion rate quantitatively in the surface of specimen, which was coated with rust preventive oil through thin corrosive solution. From the measurement results, Corrosion rate is reduced by coating the rust preventive oil. Especially, corrosion rate of the specimen coated with oil that showed best performance indicated 10000 times better than that of without oil ones. Zn addition negative correlation between corrosion rate and period of potential oscillation...|$|E
40|$|Free {{brackets}} used {{in sections}} susceptible to salt damage {{need to be}} replaced before reaching their expected service life due to severe corrosion, and thus development of highly corrosion-resistant free brackets is demanded. Possible measures to improve corrosion prevention performance include replacing the material of free brackets with a material having higher corrosion prevention performance such as weather-resistant steel and stainless steel or applying double <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> where zinc hot dip galvanized steel is further coated. In the previous development of beams for sections susceptible to salt damage, we compared and verified those measures and attained the conclusion that the best measure is double <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> coating with saturated polyester powder (so-called Terry powder coating). 1) Based on that conclusion, we decided to develop a free bracket and a stem insulator coated with saturated polyester powder for sections susceptible to salt damage. As a free bracket has a structure with differing bolt holes in steel pipes as shown in Fig. 1, corrosion progresses inside of the pipes too. Ensuring that the interior of the pipes is coated with the powder is thus necessary. There were, however, few examples of powder coating of the interior of such pipes of a small outer diameter of 60. 5 mm and of an intricate structure. We thus needed to examine and identify the appropriate structure and the appropriate coating thickness. For stem insulators, there were no examples of powder coating of fixtures for those either, so we needed to examine the area to be coated and confirm mechanical strength. In this research, we made prototypes to check whether those requirements could be met and carried out salt water spray tests of the prototypes to verify corrosion resistance of those...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Grinding {{coolants}} {{have the}} functions of cooling, lubrication, cleaning and <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> in grinding process. To avoid the environment pollution, we should develop environmental protection grinding coolants. So {{it is important to}} research the performance evaluation for grinding coolants. In this paper, three different test methods for grinding performance evaluation of grinding coolants are used to investigate the influence of three coolants on grinding process. The three test methods are four balls test, tapping torque test and real grinding test. The test results showed that the mechanism of four balls test is simple, and the test results have good repeatability, but there is a large divagation with real grinding test results. The tapping torque test has a good relativity with cutting process. The real grinding test is the best test method for grinding performance evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For low {{environmental}} load and decreasing waste fluid disposal cost, the electric rust preventive machining method that uses only water as machining fluid has been developed. However, {{there are several}} problems for this practical use. In this investigation, for using this method in various regions of the world, reset and synthesis of water quality that is different in regions for containing impurity ingredient and water hardness is examined. At first, water is deionized and purified with water refine recycle system. Afterward, synthesized water is reproduced. Hardness and conductivity is adjusted in water by addition of very small amount of natural hardness ingredient CaSO 4. Consequently, even if water is different, constant quality of the water can be always secured anywhere in world. Furthermore, electric <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> is achieved 3 hours with adjusted 100 µS/cm synthesized water. However, adhesion derived from anode is appeared in workpiece 2 hours. It {{is possible that the}} electric rust preventive machining can be carried out stability anywhere in world...|$|E
40|$|Editorial The {{application}} of paint {{to a car}} body can be a complicated process. Expensive auto body paint is usually applied in four layered stages and often includes clear coat, primer and base coats as well as electro coat layers. The result of these successive paint layers is a surface that exhibits complex light interactions, giving the car a smooth, glossy and sparkly finish. More importantly, these paint layers not only provide appealing color effects, but also have important functions such as <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> and waterproofing. It is hence {{of great interest to}} characterize car paint properties including thickness and uniformity for the purpose of quality control and quality assurance. The most common method currently used to measure the thickness of paint layers is ultrasonic sensor which is portable and easy to use. However, for high precision measurement ultrasonic sensor has to be attached to the sample thus it is not a noncontact method. In addition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{machining}} (cutting, grinding etc.) {{is conducted}} in manufacturing. Machining fluid (cutting oil, grinding fluid) {{that consists of}} oil, surface active agent, and extreme pressure agent, anti rust agent etc. is used. It improves machining performance, but it needs waste fluid disposal that is incineration or coagulative precipitation and so on. It causes huge cost and environmental load. Furthermore, it is afraid of workers health hazard for several chemicals while machining. Therefore, the electric rust preventive machining method system (water machining) is proposed and developed. This method uses only harmless water (tap water etc.) as machining fluid. In this paper, improvement of electric rust preventive chip sedimentation system {{that is part of}} water recycle system which is used for machining water purification and re-use. On long time (3 days) preservation of iron chip in water, decreasing of rust and turbidity is examined. Improved electric rust preventive chip sedimentation system is equipped simple circulation filter unit newly and its effectiveness is clarified. When many quantity of iron powder (3 kg) likened to actual sludge is sunken in sedimentation water tank, if electric <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> and simple circulation filter activated, turbidity and colour would be decreased greatly. Therefore, it is expected that purification load of next part of filters is decreased and life-time of filter and system will be prolonged...|$|E
40|$|The Sugar Milling Research Institute (SMRI) has {{investigated}} an innovation which {{could take the}} sugarcane processing industry into the future: cane preparation without knives and shredders. The technology is a complete break from the past, with knives and shredders being replaced by water, bringing advantages centred on reductions in maintenance and downtime, as {{there will be no}} more wearing faces. Outside of the sugar industry, the use of very high and ultra high pressure water for cutting and surface preparation has increased rapidly in recent years. A demonstration of the use of water jets for preparation of surfaces for <b>rust</b> <b>prevention</b> coatings stimulated the idea of shredding sugarcane using water jets. Trials at the SMRI showed that the technology can be used successfully for shredding sugarcane. International patents for the process have now been lodged. This paper details the trials conducted as well as some of the challenges faced as a result of this new area of research. The parameters pressure, flow rate and power, formed the basis of many discussions, and the terms ‘nozzle attack tip ’ and ‘stand-off distance ’ became new buzz phrases at the Institute. One of the major challenges is to determine ways to minimise overall energy consumption, such as reducing evaporator loading by using juice instead of clean water for shredding. This has proven to be a substantial hurdle since manufacturers of very high pressure pumps are unwilling to certify their pumps for this fluid and conventional high pressure pumps cannot provide the pressure required for this process...|$|E
