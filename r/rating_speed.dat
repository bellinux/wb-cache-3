In this paper, we extend {{existing}} research on rating scales with findings from an experiment we ran to measure the cognitive load users experience while rating. In this paper, we analyze the cognitive load and time required by different rating scales. Our analysis draws upon 14, 000 movie and product ratings we collected from 348 users through an online survey. In the survey, we measured the speed and cognitive load users ex- perience under four scales: unary (‘like it’), binary (thumbs up / thumbs down), five-star, and a 100 -point slider. We compare a variety of measures of cognitive load and <b>rating</b> <b>speed,</b> and draw conclusions for user interface designers based on our results.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe the relationships between operator’s work performance (speed of filleting and actual output rate of round codfish as well as of fillets) and his physiological parameters (mean heart rate, blood pressure and product of mean heart rate and blood pressure) during codfish filleting operation, and at the same time collect sufficient data to observe the effect of factors, such as speed of filleting and size of fish on the actual output rate and percentage yield of filleting. The effect of size of round codfish filleted on mean heart rate and normal output rate (round fish as well as fillets) of the filleting operator was also investigated. [...] This study was carried out at a small fish processing plant. Four average skilled male filleting operators were selected with the help of plant supervisors. Each subject was asked to work at five different filleting speeds, on an individual type filleting table layout. “Head on-gut in” codfish was supplied to each operator in 75 lb. boxes. A total of about 2625 lbs. of round codfish was processed during this study. A total of 35 individual experiments were performed. The actual time of filleting each box of 75 lbs. round codfish, performance <b>rating</b> (<b>speed</b> of filleting), number of codfish/ 75 lb. box, weight of skin-on fillets, operator’s mean heart rate and blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) were recorded for each filleting experiment. [...] Within the range and scope of this study, the analysis of the results indicated following trends: [...] 1. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 2. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 3. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and product of mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 4. Significant linear negative relationship between speed of filleting and percentage yield produced. [...] 5. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and actual output rate (round fish as well as fillets) produced. [...] 6. Significant linear positive relationship between actual output rate (round fish as well as fillets) and mean heart rate of filleting operator. [...] 7. Significant linear positive relationship between size of round fish filleted and actual output rate (round fish as well as fillets) produced. [...] 8. Significant linear positive relationship between size of round fish filleted and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 9. Significant curvilinear positive relationship between size of round fish filleted and normal output rate (round fish as well as fillets) produced. [...] Management in fish plants could use the relationships between work performance (actual output rate, etc.) and physiological parameters (mean heart rate, etc.) to design a better method of filleting, working height and work layout etc., and therefore improve the efficiency of the plant, without causing unnecessary higher physiological loads on the operator. [...] This study also suggests that management in fish plants should set work standards by establishing relationships between size of fish and normal output rate for a range of different species of fish, input quality of fish, offshore-inshore fish, and dressed-undressed condition of the fish...|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{process for}} generators are often done for <b>rated</b> <b>speeds</b> and torques. This thesis will discuss and show optimization of a vertical axis {{wind turbine generator}} that has a given wind profile. Although the rated power of the turbine is at winds of about 10 m/s, the wind is mostly at 4 - 6 m/s, thus needing a generator that has high efficiencies also at lower speeds and torques. Vertical axis wind turbine does not use blade pitching as the horizontal ones do and the torque and speed characteristics are therefore a bit different. It is important that the generator has a high efficiency at lower wind speeds. Optimization with different <b>rated</b> <b>speeds</b> where therefore done to ensure that the best generator was found. The final results for the wind turbine QR 5, produced by Quiet Revolution, was a generator with <b>rated</b> <b>speed</b> of 260 rpm.

40|$|Abstract — Pitch angle {{control of}} wind turbine {{has been used}} widely to reduce torque and output power {{variation}} in high <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> areas. It {{is a challenge to}} maximize available energy in the low <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> areas. In this paper, a wind turbine prototype with a pitch angle control based on fuzzy logic to maximize the output power is built and demonstrated. In the varying low <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> of 4 - 6 m/s, the use of fuzzy logic controller can maximize the average output power of 14. 5 watt compared to 14. 0 watt at a fixed pitch angle of the blade.
