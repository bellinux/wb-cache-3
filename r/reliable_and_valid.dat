40|$|Parents and {{caregivers}} {{faced with the}} challenges of transferring children with disability {{are at risk of}} musculoskeletal injuries and/or emotional stress. The Caregiver Self-Efficacy Scale for Transfers (CSEST) is a 14 -item questionnaire that measures self-efficacy for transferring under common conditions. The CSEST yields <b>reliable</b> data <b>and</b> <b>valid</b> inferences; however, its rating scale structure has not been evaluated for utility. The aims of this study were to evaluate the category response structure of the CSEST, test the utility of a revised rating scale structure, and confirm its psychometric properties. The Rasch Measurement Model was used for all analyses. Subjects included 175 adult caregivers recruited from multiple communities. Results confirm that a revised five-category rating scale structure yields <b>reliable</b> data <b>and</b> <b>valid</b> inferences.

25|$|The machine {{learning}} community most often uses the ROC AUC statistic for model comparison. However, this practice {{has recently been}} questioned based upon new {{machine learning}} research that shows that the AUC is quite noisy as a classification measure and has some other significant problems in model comparison. A <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>valid</b> AUC estimate {{can be interpreted as}} the probability that the classifier will assign a higher score to a randomly chosen positive example than to a randomly chosen negative example. However, the critical research suggests frequent failures in obtaining <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>valid</b> AUC estimates. Thus, the practical value of the AUC measure has been called into question, raising the possibility that the AUC may actually introduce more uncertainty into machine learning classification accuracy comparisons than resolution. Nonetheless, the coherence of AUC as a measure of aggregated classification performance has been vindicated, in terms of a uniform rate distribution, and AUC has been linked to a number of other performance metrics such as the Brier score.|$|E

25|$|To assess job performance, <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>valid</b> {{measures}} must be established. While {{there are}} many sources of error with performance ratings, error can be reduced through rater training and {{through the use of}} behaviorally-anchored rating scales. Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance. Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.|$|E
25|$|The CAGE questionnaire, {{the name}} of which is an acronym of its four questions, is a widely used {{screening}} test for problem drinking and potential alcohol problems.

The CAGE questionnaire does not have a specific intended population, and is meant to find those who drink excessively and need treatment. The CAGE questionnaire is <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>valid</b> for assessment of alcohol abuse; however, it is not valid for diagnosis of other substance use disorders, although somewhat modified versions of the CAGE questionnaire have been frequently implemented for such a purpose.|$|E

25|$|For {{the fifth}} {{edition of the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), {{there has been a}} {{tremendous}} amount of debate around whether the sexual and gender identity, which includes the GID, qualifies as a mental disorder. One of the most notable discussions for this occurred in 2003 during the annual APA meeting, where Darryl B. Hill, Ph.D., argued that the GID should not be considered a mental disorder. He explains that due to the limited amount of <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>valid</b> evidence, given the role of parents and therapies, for whether GID meets the conditions as a mental disorder among children and adolescents. Furthermore, other researchers have stated that the diagnosis does not give recognition to the individual’s discomfort with their biological sex which is completely detached from their gender assignment. This leaves patients susceptible to social changes for what acceptably feminine or masculine. Lastly, it does not provide evidence for nonconformity to traditional gender behaviours which varies between cultures, life stages, genders, and ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>valid</b> construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to better understand how service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E
