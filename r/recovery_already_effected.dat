30|$|Finally, the {{immediate}} neighborhood {{of the maximum}} voxel determines {{the magnitude of the}} potential interpolation effect. For a large homogeneous lesion, the difference of maximum voxel and neighboring voxel is just noise and the interpolation effects essentially lead to noise reduction (assuming trilinear interpolation). This is different for small or heterogeneous lesions. For small lesions (compared to the spatial resolution), the neighborhood of the maximum voxel is usually lowered by partial volume effects, and therefore, interpolation effects are increased. It should be noted that for very small lesions, the maximum voxel itself is compromised by limited signal <b>recovery</b> <b>already</b> in the original image and should be interpreted with care even without interpolation effects.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of heat exchanger network (HEN) retrofit with the objective to reduce the utilities consumption in a biodiesel production process. Pinch analysis studies allow determining the minimum duty utilities as well the maximum of heat recovery. The existence of heat exchangers for heat <b>recovery</b> <b>already</b> running in the process causes a serious restriction for the implementation of grassroot HEN design based on pinch studies. Maintaining the existing HEN, a set of alternatives with additional heat exchangers was created and analysed using some industrial advice and selection criteria.

40|$|By 2009, Poland had {{attracted}} the highest inward {{foreign direct investment}} (IFDI) stock (US$ 182 billion) among the new members of the European Union (EU) from Central and Eastern Europe. Its FDI inflows increased considerably after the country's accession to the EU. They fell during the crisis, but rather modestly, remaining at higher levels than in other countries of the region. The combination of a competitive and constantly improving policy framework for FDI and investment in general, the best GDP growth performance among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2009 and favorable projections for 2010 and 2011 augurs well for the recovery of IFDI in Poland.

50|$|Inadvertently, {{people who}} use knives on glass or metal cutting boards are {{abrading}} their knife blades. The pressure at the knife edge can easily create microscopic (or even macroscopic) cuts in the board. This cut is a ready source of abrasive material {{as well as a}} channel full of this abrasive through which the edge slides. For this reason—without regard for the health benefits—wooden boards are much more desirable. A similar occurrence arises with glass-cutters. Glass-cutters are have circular blades that are designed to roll not slide. They should never retrace an <b>already</b> <b>effected</b> cut.|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 2000 a first mapping of the macro-zones within the Soave Classico zone was carried out, {{which led to}} an initial {{substantial}} identification of macro-areas whose wines were characterized by similar aromatic and organoleptic qualities.

40|$|The pace of {{economic}} {{expansion in the}} world economy as a whole last year was strongly influenced by the cyclical slowdown in the USA.

30|$|OSEM+PSF and OSEM+PSF+BC {{were used}} as {{correction}} techniques for the spill-in effect (their convergence properties are shown in Additional file  1 : Figure S 1). For L 3, there {{does not seem to}} be any major improvement in OSEM+PSF reconstruction over OSEM especially for SUVmax (as seen in Fig.  6). This could be because of the closeness of the lesion to the bladder, coupled with the blurring effect caused by post-filtering. This seems to nullify the <b>recovery</b> <b>already</b> obtained by incorporating PSF into the reconstruction algorithm, thereby making both ordinary OSEM and OSEM+PSF reconstructions to behave in a similar way. This blurring effect could further be confirmed by a pronounced bias at the bladder edges due to the spill-in activity from the bladder as shown in Fig.  7, as well as the edge analysis in Table  2. OSEM and OSEM+PSF are greatly affected by filtering, but OSEM+PSF+BC is more robust and less sensitive to filters. Another reason for the similar behaviour between OSEM and OSEM+PSF might be the simplistic spatially invariant resolution modelling in this study. This simple resolution modelling has been shown by past studies to increase edge artefact and system blurring [41].|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} how a negative life event (NLE) affects perceived psychosocial stress, recovery and running economy (RE). Competitive runners were monitored in a prospective non-experimental cohort study over one full training season in which they experienced the same unplanned severe NLE. 16 runners recorded stress and recovery scores (RESTQ-Sport) every week. The average scores over 3 weeks before the NLE were used as a baseline and were compared to scores {{during the week of}} the NLE (week 0), week 1 and week 2. 7 runners completed a submaximal treadmill test before and after the NLE. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that most scores on general stress scales were increased in week 0 and 1. Of the general recovery scales, general well-being was decreased in week 0 and 1, social and physical recovery were decreased in week 0. No changes in the sport-specific stress scales were found. However, 2 of the sport-specific recovery scales were decreased in week 0. An impaired RE was shown 3 weeks after the NLE. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} what is going on in an athlete's life, because stressful life events alter RE after the stress and <b>recovery</b> <b>already</b> returned to normal levels...|$|R

Both {{before and after the}} Communist takeover of 1950 there have been examples of human rights abuses, both state-sanctioned and otherwise. The political debate associated with the Serfdom in Tibet controversy rests on whether these incidents justify the positions of the opposing parties.

60|$|Here, therefore, Titus {{determined}} to make his attack. On the 22nd of April, the troops began the work. Each legion was to erect a bank, mount a battering ram, and construct a tower. A vast quantity of timber was required, and the desolation <b>already</b> <b>effected</b> between the north wall and Scopus was now widely extended; {{the whole of the}} trees, for a great distance round Jerusalem, being cut down and brought to the spot. The towers were constructed about ninety feet in height, and with a wide face. They were put together beyond the range of the missiles of the defenders; and were to be advanced, upon wheels, up the bank until they neared the wall. As the three banks approached the wall, hurdles covered with hides were erected to protect the workers; and on each side javelin men and archers were posted, together with the war engines for casting missiles.|$|R
50|$|After Dermott's death, the two Grand Lodges {{moved slowly}} towards union. The need for unity was {{underlined}} during the Napoleonic wars, when {{the leaders of}} the Ancients, Moderns, and the Grand Lodge of Scotland acted together to prevent their lodges becoming proscribed organisations. However, the actual process of unification did not start until 1811, when the Moderns started the administrative process of returning their ritual to a form acceptable to the other British Grand Lodges. The final union was in the hands of two sons of the King, the Duke of Sussex, the Grand Master of the Moderns, and the Duke of Kent. Kent had <b>already</b> <b>effected</b> a union in Canada by simply abolishing the Moderns, and merging their lodges with those of the Ancients.
