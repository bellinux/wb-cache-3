40|$|The {{study focused}} on {{assessing}} the role of complaint handling system in enhancing customer satisfaction. Specifically, it looked at the effectiveness of communication in <b>complaint</b> handling system <b>to</b> the customers, examined the organization’s <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> the <b>complaints</b> of the customers {{and the level of}} customer satisfaction. Moreover, uncovering {{the extent to which the}} company shows empathy <b>to</b> the <b>complaints</b> of the customers and lastly it assessed the effectiveness in delivering fast recovery to the service failures. Data were collected using questionnaires and interview to key informants. The analysis of data was done using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The findings have established that effective complaints handling system is determined by four key elements as predicted in the regression analysis. These factors include effective complaints communication, responsiveness in complaints handling, empathy in complaints handling and fast service recovery. Effectiveness of communication in complaint handling system was assessed using; polite treatment of customers, treating customers with dignity; treating customers with proper remarks and comments; detailed and timely communication of the <b>complaints</b> <b>to</b> the customers. The descriptive results show that customers indicated to agree with the communication used in complaints handling. From the study findings, the researcher recommends that complaint handling is considered as very important instrument for service organizations in evaluating the effectiveness of recovery options. Complaints should be shared not only with the front-line employees, but also with those employees who work within organizations that play key roles in the success of the organization...|$|R

Therapeutic decisions, including somatostatin-analogues (SAs) and (non) -transplant surgery are besides the existence of hepatomegaly, also guided by the severity of complaints. We developed and validated a self-report instrument to capture the presence and severity of disease specific complaints for PCLD. METHODS: The study population consisted of 129 patients. Items for the PCLD-complaint-specific assessment (POLCA) were developed based on the chart review of symptomatic PCLD patients (n= 68) and literature, and discussed during expert-consensus-meetings. 61 patients who needed therapy {{were asked to complete}} the POLCA and the short form health survey version 2 (SF 36 V 2) at baseline and after 6 months of SA-treatment. CT-scans were used to calculate liver volumes (LV). Factor analysis was conducted to identify subscales and remove suboptimal items. Reliability was assessed by Cronbach's alpha. Convergent, criterion validity and responsiveness were tested using prespecified hypotheses. RESULTS: In the validation group (n= 61), 47 received lanreotide (LAN) and 14 were offered LAN as bridge to liver transplantation (LTx). Factor analysis identified four subscales, which correlated with the physical component summary (PCS). Baseline POLCA scores were significantly higher in LTx-listed patients. In contrast to SF 36 V 2, POLCA-paired observations in 47 patients demonstrated that 2 subscales were lowered significantly and 2 borderline. LV reduction of ⩾ 120 ml resulted in a numerical, more pronounced relative decrease of all scores.

40|$|Customer orientated {{reforms have}} been widely adopted for {{improving}} service delivery. However, the introduction of these reforms {{in the public sector}} is still little understood; and the literature is pessimistic regarding their application in the public sector in developing countries. To further understand the relevance of customer orientated reforms in developing countries, this study assessed their performance when implemented by the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), which is in charge of urban water supply in Uganda. Using multiple data sources, including household user surveys and interviews, the study posed the questions: Has the NWSC become more customer-oriented as a result of reforms? If so, what are the consequences for user satisfaction and loyalty? The study finds first that customer oriented reforms in the NWSC were introduced by a committed leadership which reduced resistance to change and coordinated key stakeholder involvement. Second, it finds that the reforms contributed to improved water accessibility, affordability and customer care. Third, it finds that increased provider <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> correlates with increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Since the study focused on users with home water connections, {{further research is needed to}} assess how similar the results would be for poorer non-connected users and commercial and institutional users.

40|$|What is {{the form}} of natural {{selection}} on immune responsiveness? For a population at evolutionary equilibrium, {{there are two different}} scenarios. First, it is generally assumed that immune defense has both benefits and costs. If variation in immune <b>responsiveness</b> is due <b>to</b> variation in how individuals trade off these costs and benefits, one would expect immune <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> be subject to stabilizing selection. Second, {{it is well known that}} an individual's immune responsiveness is often dependent on its overall condition. If immune responsiveness is condition-dependent, one would expect immune <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> be under positive directional selection. We would therefore expect that {{the form of}} natural selection on immune responsiveness depends on the relative magnitude of these two sources of variation: variation in how individuals trade off the costs and benefits of defense, and variation in condition. We measured primary and secondary antibody <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> diphtheria-tetanus vaccine in blue tits during winter and investigated the relationship between <b>responsiveness</b> and survival <b>to</b> the following breeding season. We use <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> these antigens as measures of an individual's ability or propensity to mount an antibody response in case of an infection. Interestingly, different measures of <b>responsiveness</b> were subject <b>to</b> different selective regimes: primary <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> diphtheria was subject to stabilizing selection, whereas secondary <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> tetanus was subject to positive directional selection. In contrast, there was no significant selection on primary <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> tetanus or secondary <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> diphtheria. The finding of stabilizing selection on a measure of responsiveness is evidence that immune defense can incur fitness costs; a central but little-tested assumption of theories of the ecology and evolution of immunological defense. The finding of directional selection on a measure of responsiveness is consistent with the idea that immune responsiveness is condition-dependent, although we cannot rule out the alternative explanation that the population is not at evolutionary equilibrium with respect to this trait...|$|R

We administered oral slow-release theophylline or placebo to each subject for 7 days according to a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study design.

40|$|In {{order to}} keep {{customer}} loyalty in online shopping, complaint behaviors are important. Complaint behavior provide an insight into the customer's experience of service failure and help to redress the failures. Based on the previous studies, customer satisfaction is important as a mediator for complaint intentions. It is critical to examine the antecedents of customer satisfaction and its links <b>to</b> <b>complaint</b> intentions. In this context, there are three major concerns: justice, technology and trust. This study proposes a research models to combine these issues, in order <b>to</b> investigate <b>complaint</b> intentions. This study aimed to test the influence of distributive justice, procedural justice, interactional justice, expectation-confirmation, perceived usefulness, and trust on customer satisfaction, in turn, to intention to complain in online shopping. Also this study aimed to test the influence of prior online shopping and perceived <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> the link between customer satisfaction and intention to complain. This type of research is causal research with quantitative approach. This study used purposive sampling approach, which the sample consists of respondents who had negative experience in online shopping. Respondents in this study amounted to 277 people. The analysis in this study used a model of SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) and processed by using SPSS software version 16. 0 for Windows and Amos 16 to test the measurement and structural model. The result indicates that perceived usefulness and distributive justice contribute significantly to customer satisfaction and, in turn, <b>to</b> <b>complaint</b> intentions, but procedural justice and interactional justice does not.

40|$|For {{governments to}} be {{democratic}} they must {{carry out the}} will of citizens, either indirectly through elected officials or directly. Political science research on agency responsiveness has focused primarily on agency <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> political principals, with an underlying assumption that <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> political principals equates with <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> citizens.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Among the {{functional}} neuroimaging studies on emotional face processing in schizophrenia, few have used paradigms with facial expressions of disgust. In this study, we investigated whether schizophrenia patients show less insula activation to macro-expressions (overt, clearly visible expressions) and micro-expressions (covert, very brief expressions) of disgust than healthy controls. Furthermore, departing from {{the assumption that}} disgust faces signal social rejection, we examined whether perceptual sensitivity to disgust is related to social alienation in patients and controls. We hypothesized that high insula <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> facial disgust predicts social alienation. METHODS: We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to measure insula activation in 36 schizophrenia patients and 40 healthy controls. During scanning, subjects passively viewed covert and overt presentations of disgust and neutral faces. To measure social alienation, a social loneliness scale and an agreeableness scale were administered. RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients exhibited reduced insula activation in response to covert facial expressions of disgust. With respect to macro-expressions of disgust, no between-group differences emerged. In patients, insula <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> covert faces of disgust was positively correlated with social loneliness. Furthermore, patients' insula <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> covert and overt faces of disgust was negatively correlated with agreeableness. In controls, insula <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> covert expressions of disgust correlated negatively with agreeableness. DISCUSSION: Schizophrenia patients show reduced insula <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> micro-expressions but not macro-expressions of disgust compared to healthy controls. In patients, low agreeableness was associated with stronger insula response to micro- and macro-expressions of disgust. Patients with a strong tendency to feel uncomfortable with social interactions appear to be characterized by a high sensitivity for facial expression signaling social rejection. Given the associations of insula <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> covert disgust expression with low agreeableness in healthy individuals, insula <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> expressions of disgust might be in general a neural marker of the personality trait of agreeableness...|$|R
40|$|Data on {{respiratory}} {{symptoms were}} obtained on 2503 schoolchildren aged 7 and 11 in Southampton {{by means of}} a self administered parental questionnaire. Children were classified into seven symptom groups from which 330 were tested for bronchial <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> {{less than or equal to}} 6. 4 mumol methacholine and skin tested for the presence of atopy. The symptoms of wheeze, cough, and shortness of breath were all significantly associated both with each other and bronchial <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> methacholine but only wheeze was associated with atopy. The association of wheeze with both bronchial <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> methacholine and atopy remained highly significant when controlling for the symptoms of cough and shortness of breath. Neither cough nor shortness of breath, however, were significantly related <b>to</b> bronchial <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> methacholine when controlling for the symptom of wheeze. This study therefore calls into question the epidemiological relevance of these two symptoms as diagnostic features of asthma, particularly in the absence of wheeze, although they may be useful indicators of morbidity. Wheeze was not related <b>to</b> bronchial <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> methacholine in the absence of atopy or to atopy in the absence of bronchial <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> methacholine but was strongly related to the combination of the two phenomena. The presence of these three characteristics could therefore indicate a discrete disease entity. The decrease in the prevalence of cough between 7 and 11 years appeared to be mirrored by a similar decrease in the prevalence of wheeze when the symptom was not associated with the combination of bronchial <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> methacholine and atopy. On the basis of these findings and those of others we suggest that the latter group may represent children with a separate disease entity(ies) or with residual symptoms secondary to acute viral or other infections of the lower respiratory tract...|$|R
