Understanding the complex relations between <b>ridesharing</b> and traffic congestion is a critical step {{in the evaluation of}} a <b>ridesharing</b> enterprise or of the convenience of regulatory policies or incentives to promote <b>ridesharing.</b> In this work, we propose a new traffic assignment model that explicitly represents <b>ridesharing</b> as a mode of transportation.

This model is built by combining a <b>ridesharing</b> market model with a classic elastic demand Wardrop traffic equilibrium model.

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{problems}} of congestion {{in urban areas}} due to the massive usage of cars, last-minute travel needs and progress in {{information and communication technologies}} have fostered the rise of new transportation modes such as <b>ridesharing.</b> In a <b>ridesharing</b> service, a car owner shares empty seats of his car with other travelers. Recent <b>ridesharing</b> approaches help to identify interesting meeting points to improve the efficiency of the <b>ridesharing</b> service (i. e., the best pickup and drop-off points so that the travel cost is competitive for both driver and rider). In particular, <b>ridesharing</b> services, such as Blablacar or Carma, have become a good mobility alternative for users in their daily life. However, this success has come at the cost of user privacy. Indeed in current's <b>ridesharing</b> services, users are not in control of their own data and have to trust the <b>ridesharing</b> operators with the management of their data. In this paper, we aim at developing a privacy-preserving service to compute meeting points in <b>ridesharing,</b> such that each user remains in control of his location data. More precisely, we propose a decentralized architecture that provides strong security and privacy guarantees without sacrificing the usability of <b>ridesharing</b> services. In particular, our approach protects the privacy of location data of users. Following the privacy-by-design principle, we have integrated existing privacy enhancing technologies and multimodal shortest path algorithms to privately compute mutually interesting meeting points for both drivers and riders in <b>ridesharing.</b> In addition, we have built a prototype implementation of the proposed approach. The experiments, conducted on a real transportation network, have demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} reach a trade-off in which both the privacy and utility levels are satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ridesharing</b> services, whose aim is {{to gather}} {{travelers}} with similar itineraries and compatible schedules, are able to provide substantial environmental and social benefits through reducing the use of private vehicles. When the operations of a <b>ridesharing</b> system is optimized, it can also save travelers {{a significant amount of}} transportation cost. The economic benefits associated with <b>ridesharing</b> in turn attract more travelers to participate in <b>ridesharing</b> services and thereby improve the utilization of transportation infrastructure capacity. This study addresses two of the most challenging issues in designing an efficient and sustainable <b>ridesharing</b> service: <b>ridesharing</b> optimization and <b>ridesharing</b> market design. The first part of the dissertation formally defines the large-scale <b>ridesharing</b> optimization problem, characterizes its complexity and discusses its relation to classic relevant problems like the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle routing problem (VRP). A mixed-integer program (MIP) model is developed to solve the <b>ridesharing</b> optimization problem. Since the <b>ridesharing</b> optimization problem is NP-hard, the MIP model is not able to solve larger instances within a reasonable time. An insertion-based heuristic is developed to get approximate solutions to the <b>ridesharing</b> optimization problem. Experiments showed that <b>ridesharing</b> can significantly reduce the system-wide travel cost and vehicle trips. Evaluation of the heuristic solution method showed that the heuristic approach can solve the problem very fast and provide nearly-optimal (98 %) solutions, thus, confirming its efficiency and accuracy. From a societal perspective, the <b>ridesharing</b> optimization model proposed in this dissertation provided substantial system-wide travel cost saving (25 %+) and vehicle-trip saving (50 %) compared to non-ridesharing situation. However, the system-level optimal solution might not completely align with individual participant interest. The second part of this dissertation formulates this issue as a fair cost allocation problem through the lens of the cooperative game theory. A special property of the cooperative <b>ridesharing</b> game is that, its characteristic function values are calculated by solving an optimization problem. We characterize the game to be monotone and subadditive, but non-convex. Several concepts of fairness are investigated and special attention is paid to a solution concept named nucleolus, which aims to minimize the maximum dissatisfaction in the system. However, finding the nucleolus is very challenging because it requires solving the <b>ridesharing</b> optimization problem for every possible coalition, whose number grows exponentially as the number of participants increases in the system. We break the cost allocation (nucleolus finding) problem into a master-subproblem structure and two subproblems are developed to generate constraints for the master problem. We propose a coalition generation procedure to find the nucleolus and approximate nucleolus of the game. When the game has a non-empty core, in the approximate nucleolus scheme the coalitions are computed only when it is necessary, and the approximate nucleolus scheme produces the actual nucleolus. Experimental results showed that, when the game has an empty core, the approximate nucleolus is close to the actual nucleolus. Results also showed that, regardless of the emptiness of the game, by using our algorithm, only a small fraction (1 : 6 %) of the total coalition constraints were generated to compute the approximate nucleolus, and the approximate nucleolus is close to the actual nucleolus...|$|R
