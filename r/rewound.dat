5|$|The film's {{special effects}} are {{generally}} recognized {{to be among}} the best of all time, using the available (non-digital) technology to the fullest. In addition to matte paintings and models, the techniques employed included multipass exposures. In some scenes, the set was lit, shot, the film <b>rewound,</b> and then rerecorded over with different lighting. In some cases this was done 16 times in all. The cameras were frequently motion controlled using computers. Many effects used techniques which had been developed during the production of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.|$|E

This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line-type poles that were 100 feet apart and further protected by wind-break fences of canvas. Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet varnished fabric onto for drying. After drying the fabric was then <b>rewound</b> onto rollers and varnished {{over and over again}} several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time. Each application of new varnish added a thin layer.|$|E

Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is <b>rewound,</b> as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of wound healing in the {{framework}} of finite elasticity, focussing our attention on the processes of growth and contraction in the dermal layer of the skin. The dermal tissue is treated as a hyperelastic cylinder that surrounds the wound and is subject to symmetric deformations. By considering the initial recoil that is observed upon the application of a circular wound, we estimate the degree of residual tension in the skin and build an evolution law for mechanosensitive growth of the dermal tissue. Contraction of the wound is governed by a phenomenological law in which radial pressure is prescribed at the wound edge. The model reproduces three main phases of the healing process. Initially, the wound recoils due to residual stress in the surrounding tissue; the wound then heals as a result of contraction and growth; and finally, healing slows as contraction and growth decrease. Over a longer time period, the surrounding tissue remodels, returning to the residually stressed state. We identify the steady state growth profile associated with this remodelled state. The model is then used to predict the outcome of <b>rewounding</b> experiments designed to quantify the amount of stress in the tissue, and also to simulate the application of pressure treatments...|$|R
40|$|A rapidly induced, {{transitory}} {{increase in}} the rate of ethylene synthesis occurred in wounded tissue excised from actively growing regions of etiolated barley, cucumber, maize, oat, pea, tomato, and wheat seedlings. Cutting intact stems or excising 9 -mm segments of tissue from near the apex of 7 -day-old etiolated Pisum sativum L., cv. Alaska seedlings induced a remarkably consistent pattern of ethylene production. At 25 C, wound-induced ethylene production by segments excised 9 mm below the apical hook increased linearly after a lag of 26 minutes from 2. 7 nanoliters per g per hour to the first maxium of 11. 3 nanoliters per g per hour at 56 minutes. The rate of production then decreased to a minimum at 90 minutes, increased to a lower second maximum at 131 minutes, and subsequently declined over a period of about 100 minutes to about 4 nanoliters per g per hour. Removal of endogenous ethylene, before the wound response commenced, had no effect on the kinetics of ethylene production. Tissue containing large amounts of dissolved ethylene released it as an exponential decay with no lag period. Rapidly induced wound ethylene is synthesized by the tissue and is not merely the result of facilitated diffusion of ethylene already present in the tissue through the newly exposed cut surfaces. Previously wounded apical sections did not exhibit a second response when <b>rewounded.</b> No significant correlation was found between wound-induced ethylene synthesis and either CO 2 or ethane production...|$|R
40|$|Wound {{healing is}} a complex process, in which a {{sequence}} of interrelated events at both the cell and tissue levels interact {{and contribute to the}} reduction in wound size. For diabetic patients, many of these processes are compromised, so that wound healing slows down and in some cases halts. In this thesis we develop a series of increasingly detailed mathematical models to describe and investigate healing of full thickness skin wounds. We begin by developing a time-dependent ordinary differential equation model. This phenomenological model focusses on the main processes contributing to closure of a full thickness wound: proliferation in the epidermis and growth and contraction in the dermis. Model simulations suggest that the relative contributions of growth and contraction to healing of the dermis are altered in diabetic wounds. We investigate further the balance between growth and contraction by developing a more detailed, spatially-resolved model using continuum mechanics. Due to the initial large retraction of the wound edge upon injury, we adopt a non-linear elastic framework. Morphoelasticity theory is applied, with the total deformation of the material decomposed into an addition of mass and an elastic response. We use the model to investigate how interactions between growth and stress influence dermal wound healing. The model reveals that contraction alone generates unrealistically high tension in the dermal tissue and, hence, volumetric growth must contribute to healing. We show that, in the simplified case of homogeneous growth, the tissue must grow anisotropically {{in order to reduce the}} size of the wound and we postulate mechanosensitive growth laws consistent with this result. After closure the surrounding tissue remodels, returning to its residually stressed state. We identify the steady state growth profile associated with this remodelled state. The model is used to predict the outcome of <b>rewounding</b> experiments as a method of quantifying the amount of stress in the tissue and the application of pressure treatments to control tissue synthesis. The thesis concludes with an extension to the spatially-resolved mechanical model to account for the effects of the biochemical environment. Partial differential equations describing the dynamics of fibroblasts and a regulating growth factor are coupled to equations for the tissue mechanics, described in the morphoelastic framework. By accounting for biomechanical and biochemical stimuli the model allows us to formulate mechanistic laws for growth and contraction. We explore how disruption of mechanical and chemical feedback can lead to abnormal wound healing and use the model to identify specific treatments for normalising healing in these cases.

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film <b>rewound,</b> and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E

40|$|This multiperspectual {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to explore and}} describe {{the complexity of the}} helping / healing process in a community-based counselling centre. The standard for evaluation was client satisfaction. Client and worker participants’ perspectives were sought in an exploration of whether and / or how the client as an individual, the worker both as an individual and as a staff member, the therapeutic relationship, and the organizational setting impacted client satisfaction. Former clients of the agency (N= 400) were asked to complete Greenfield, Attkisson, and Pascoe’s (© 2005) Service Satisfaction Scale (SSS- 30). Respondents (N= 73) were profiled using descriptive statistics which led the researcher to a further sample of client participants who agreed to follow-up interviews. Overall, twenty-two former clients made up the client participants’ voices captured in the in-depth qualitative study (N= 22). Simultaneously, worker participants were asked to take part in focus groups to lend their perspectives on their work and on client satisfaction (N= 7). Grounded theorizing characterized the qualitative portion of the study. The analogy of the dance was developed to frame participants’ experiences exploring the process of reaching out and asking for help, what was brought to the dance, the dance itself, the dance floor as context and what elements contributed to extremely satisfied dancers. Constructs related to client participant identity, social taboos, and risks of <b>rewounding</b> emerged. Clear negotiation and communication, the development of a trusting and meaningful connection, working through missteps, intentional endings, {{and the quality of the}} counselling experience were found to be important contributors to satisfaction. Worker participants made connections between organizational and supervisory provisions and client satisfaction. Intangible provisions such as validation, support and positive feedback, interested and involved leadership, autonomy, and the promotion of self-care were named and explored. Concrete provisions including training, time and staffing, regulation in caseload, flexibility in scheduling, and adequate remuneration were also recognized for their influence on client satisfaction. Organizational context, climate, and culture were identified as important for both client and worker participants in this study of satisfaction. The ability to grow beyond life challenges also proved relevant to the discussion. Models for empowering and disempowering contexts emerged and were constructed to frame the discussion. The sent message, I value you and the internalized message, I feel valued were explored in the context of evaluations. Recommendations were made regarding evaluation of practice and about what social workers and their organizations need to consider in light of the study. Further research is suggested to explore relevance and applicability to other contexts...|$|R

25|$|Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also {{includes}} a historical debugger for managed code called IntelliTrace. Unlike a traditional debugger that records only the currently active stack, IntelliTrace records all events, such as prior function calls, method parameters, events and exceptions. This allows the code execution to be <b>rewound</b> in case a breakpoint was not set where the error occurred. Debugging with IntelliTrace causes the application to run more slowly than debugging without it, and uses more memory as additional data needs to be recorded. Microsoft allows configuration of how much data should be recorded, in effect, allowing developers to balance the speed of execution and resource usage. The Lab Management component of Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 uses virtualization to create a similar execution environment for testers and developers.

500|$|The incline's {{original}} {{steam engine}} was disconnected on January6, 1912, {{and replaced with}} an electric motor. The cars used on the incline were originally double-deckers, but were reconfigured into a single-decker design in 1921. The double-decker cars had horses and wagons riding on the main, upper deck and passengers riding in a compartment below.

There were two incidents in the 1920s when horses aboard the incline became spooked and leapt from the car onto the tracks below. Bethlehem Steel, the successor to Cambria Iron, sold the Johnstown Inclined Plane to the borough of Westmont in April 1935. On March17, 1936, nearly 4,000people were evacuated from Johnstown to higher ground via the incline as the Stoneycreek and Conemaugh Rivers overflowed their banks.
