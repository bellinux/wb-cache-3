In Experiment 1 preference reversal was demonstrated in that an immediate short <b>reinforcer</b> was chosen more frequently than a longer <b>reinforcer</b> delayed 6 s from the choice, whereas the longer <b>reinforcer</b> was chosen more frequently when delays to both reinforcers were lengthened. In both experiments, choice responding was more sensitive to variations in <b>reinforcer</b> duration at overall longer <b>reinforcer</b> delays than at overall shorter <b>reinforcer</b> delays, independently of whether fixed-interval or variable-interval schedules were arranged in the choice phase.

Three types of bond were considered, i. e. concrete confined by (1) flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer tube, (2) flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer tube with internal flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer rings and (3) flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer wrapping. They were termed as naturally, mechanically and adhesively bonded, respectively. A total of 18 flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer–confined plain concrete and coir fibre <b>reinforced</b> concrete cylinders were tested under axial compression. The test results indicated that all the three flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer confinements increased the ultimate compressive strength and ductility of the concrete significantly compared to the unconfined concrete. It {{was found that the}} type of flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer and concrete bond has a significant effect on the ultimate strength and axial strain of the confined cylinders. The composite cylinder with naturally bonded offered the largest ultimate strength and axial strain. In all cases of flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer–confined coir fibre <b>reinforced</b> concrete, the coir fibre inclusion reduced the numbers and widths of the cracks in the concrete. Additionally, existing confinement stress and strain models were used to predict the experimental results of the confined plain concrete and coir fibre <b>reinforced</b> concrete cylinders...|$|R

In recent years however, bamboo has generated interest from researchers as a candidate to replace environmental unfriendly glass as fiber in fiber <b>reinforced</b> composites.

This paper is to review on the properties of bamboo <b>reinforced</b> composites from numerous characterization studies of bamboo that are available in the literatures. The review is based on characterization studies on several types of bamboo <b>reinforced</b> composites such as laminated bamboo fiber <b>reinforced</b> composite, randomly oriented bamboo <b>reinforced</b> composite, hybrid fiber <b>reinforced</b> composite, bamboo fiber <b>reinforced</b> bio-composite and bamboo fiber sandwiched structure composite.

While specific tensile properties of laminated bamboo <b>reinforced</b> composite are at par with glass fiber <b>reinforced</b> composite, the mechanical properties of bamboo fiber <b>reinforced</b> composite are comparable to the mechanical properties of the best among natural fiber <b>reinforced</b> composites...|$|R
