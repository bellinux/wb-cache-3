40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{independent}} EFL reading among Grade 11 students across public and non-public schools in Ethiopia. Students who practice independent reading develop a love for reading and ultimately become life-long self-initiated readers. Therefore, independent reading {{should be considered as}} a vital goal of instruction and research. The issues of focus in this study were students’ reading comprehension ability levels, attitude towards learning English as a school subject and reading its literature, reading motivation, reading strategy use, persistence in independent reading and access to reading resources along with inclusion of independent reading in classroom instruction and in English textbooks. To this end, the study used quantitative data (collected through reading comprehension test, structured questionnaire and independent reading follow-up checklist) and qualitative data (gathered via classroom observation and content analysis). The findings revealed lower predisposition towards and practice of independent EFL reading among public school students (n = 375). A statistically significant difference, in favour of non-public schools (n = 181), was also found between the two groups of students in scores pertaining to most of the variables investigated. Enhanced scaffolding of independent reading through improved instruction and resource provision, regular short <b>refresher</b> <b>courses</b> <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> of English and further studies have been recommended to improve public school students’ involvement in independent EFL reading.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the strategies for improving staff personnel for effective implementation of Universal Basic Education (UBE) program in junior secondary schools in Rivers State. Descriptive survey design {{was used for the}} study. The population comprised 8, 687 junior secondary school teachers. A stratified random sampling technique was used to select 720 teachers out of which 120 were from urban schools while 600 were from rural schools. Two research questions and two hypotheses guided the study. The instrument for data collection was questionnaire captioned Strategies for Improving Staff Personnel Questionnaire (SISPQ). The questionnaire was subjected to face and content validity by experts in the department of Educational Management, University of Port Harcourt. Data collected were analyzed using mean for research questions and z-test for the hypotheses at 0. 05 alpha level. Findings revealed among others that in-service training programs in the areas of sandwich, workshops, and conferences were strategies for improving staff personnel for effective implementation of Universal Basic Education in junior secondary schools in Rivers State.

40|$|Department of Educational Management Policy & Curriculum Studies, 94 p. The PL 8701. O 37 2012 The {{tenet of}} this study was that despite the {{critical}} role played by Kiswahili language in Kenya: first, as an official language second, as a national language and a core subject examinable for all candidates at KCSE, student's performance in this subject is dismal. Factors leading to this dismal performance have not been exhaustively investigated and internalized, hence impeding the development of Kiswahili in Kenya. The purpose {{of this study}} was to investigate institution- based factors influencing students' performance in Kiswahili language at KCSE examinations in public secondary schools in Sameta Division Kisii County. The objectives of the study were: To identify which school physical resources influenced students performance in Kiswahili language; to find out school language policies in public schools of Sameta Division and their impact on Kiswahili performance; to find out the qualification and adequacy of Kiswahili teachers in Sameta Division; to identify students' and teachers' attitudes to Kiswahili. The study adopted a descriptive survey design. The population of the study comprised 1025 form four students, 40 teachers of Kiswahili and 32 principals of schools in Sameta Division. The total population of the study was 1097. Stratified random sampling was used to select 10 schools for the study. Ten (10) classes were used in the study, 200 students, 14 teachers of Kiswahili and 10 principals totaling to a sample size of 224. Questionnaires and interview schedule were used to collect data. Piloting of the questionnaires and interview schedule was done in three schools identical to but not including the group of the study. Reliability was done through test-retest method and the scores of the two tests scored manually. A comparison of the two scores was done using Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient formula to establish the consistency of the instruments. Validity was determined through experts' judgment. The researcher's two supervisors and one departmental lecturer were requested to assess the content used and give feedback which enriched them. Data were collected through questionnaires for students and teachers and interview schedule for principals. The questionnaires were administered to both students and teachers while interview schedule was administered to principals of sampled schools. Qualitative data were organized into themes, categories and patterns relevant to the study and findings represented through, tabulation. Quantitative data were coded then analyzed with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) then results were presented using percentages, means, frequency distribution tables, bar graphs and pie-charts. The study found that majority of the schools had inadequate teaching/learning resources to a level that learners lacked language course books. A good number of the schools lacked enough physical facilities like libraries and classrooms because student population was over 60. Most day schools had inadequate trained teachers consequently engaging untrained form four school leavers who not only could not deliver content, but also lacked language pedagogy. Majority of the schools had inadequate strategies of enforcing language policies because they were skewed towards English in some while in others unofficial languages like sheng were in use. The study recommended funding of schools to enable them to purchase enough teaching/learning resources as well as putting up physical facilities, posting of adequate qualified teachers to schools, curriculum designers and ministry of Education to split Kiswahili to two subjects, regular <b>refresher</b> <b>courses</b> <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> and adoption of sound mechanisms to ensure proper enforcement of language policies at school level so as to better the performance in Kiswahili.

The title came from a phrase Stanley used to explain the idea to James Killian, science advisor to President Eisenhower. Physics for the nuclear age was the topic of the first year's course, which was broadcast from 6:30 to 7:00 in the morning Monday through Friday. The second course, in chemistry, was preceded by a rebroadcast of the physics course at 6:00 am. Courses in mathematics and American government followed. The Ford Foundation withdrew its funding for the fourth season, and the network subsequently canceled the program.

40|$|Current {{researches}} into teacher formation show {{different aspects}} in their approaches. To teach science, a professional {{is required to}} have more than knowledge of the contents and possession of good didactic skills. Teacher formation (initial and continued) is a broad problem, and a challenge, facing the innumerous questions already raised by experienced professionals in this field. Our research is directed at permanent teacher formation (initial and continued), giving priority to the relationship between DOING SCIENCE and TEACHING SCIENCE (VIANNA, 1998), while attempting to compare scientists practice at laboratories with teachers’ science. We analyzed a <b>refresher</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> High School <b>teachers</b> of Biology in Rio de Janeiro. We highlighted the parts of this course that took place in research laboratories, which we refer to as “research episodes,” showing what participants gained from this experience: knowledge about scientists’ practices, what they do, what they say, how they behave, how they interact, what they build, what they publish in their articles and why, that is: TO EXPERIENCE DAILY SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE. We looked at these “episodes” according to LATOUR and WOOLGAR (1988, 1989, 1994, 1995, 1997). The teachers who attended the course were queried about its influence on their teaching formation. They emphasized the perception they gained about how scientific knowledge is built, the passion researchers have for their activity, the new technologies and instruments used nowadays, and their desire to adopt a new approach in the classroom. Our work points out the need <b>for</b> a permanent <b>teacher</b> formation, establishing an analogy between scientific and pedagogic research with teaching practice...|$|R
