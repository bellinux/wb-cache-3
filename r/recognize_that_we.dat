Flinders Petrie has counted nine attempts at civilization made by people exactly like us; {{and every one of them}} failed just as ours is failing. They failed because the citizens and statesmen died of old age or over-eating before they had grown out of schoolboy games and savage sports and cigars and champagne.

60|$|What a vile slip {{of the pen}} was that! How absurd in me to {{talk about}} burying the bones of Byron, who, I have just seen alive, and incased in a big, round bulk of flesh!

And then that ridiculous old story darted into my mind, how that Byron died of fever at Missolonghi, above twenty years ago. More and more I <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> dwell in a world of shadows; and, for my part, I hold it hardly worth the trouble to attempt a distinction between shadows in the mind and shadows out of it.
