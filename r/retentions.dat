500|$|Stephen Houston, John Robertson and David Stuart have {{suggested}} that the specific variety of Ch'olan found in the majority of Southern Lowland glyphic texts was a language they dub [...] "Classic Ch'olti'an", the ancestor language of the modern Ch'orti' and Ch’olti’ languages.

However, Mora-Marín has argued that traits shared by Classic Lowland Maya and the Ch'olti'an languages are <b>retentions</b> rather than innovations, and that the diversification of Ch'olan in fact post-dates the classic period.

40|$|Variable <b>retention</b> {{harvesting}} is used {{to sustain}} structural and compositional complexity, along with various ecosystem functions, in harvested forests. A key component of variable <b>retention</b> harvest systems is determining the spatial pattern of residual overstory <b>retention,</b> which can range from dispersed to aggregate. Hypothesized responses to <b>retention</b> pattern depend on the attribute examined. For instance, growth of intolerant tree regeneration {{is likely to be}} higher, at the stand-scale, with aggregate <b>retention,</b> whereas growth of tolerant species should be higher with dispersed <b>retention.</b> Other ecosystem attributes such as songbird populations, plant resource availability, and mortality of residual trees should also vary depending on spatial pattern of <b>retention.</b> We report on early results of a large-scale <b>retention</b> experiment in Great Lakes red pine forests in northern Minnesota. The experiment includes four replicates of three overstory manipulations—dispersed <b>retention,</b> aggregate <b>retention</b> with small gaps, and aggregate <b>retention</b> with large gaps—and unharvested controls. Three years after harvest, avian abundance, richness, and diversity were all greater within treatment compared to controls, but no discernable differences among <b>retention</b> pattern were found.

40|$|Direct {{conversion}} of isothermal to temperature programmed indices is not possible. In this work it is shown that linear temperature programmed <b>retention</b> indices {{can only be}} calculated from isothermal <b>retention</b> data if the temperature dependence of both the distribution coefficients and the column dead time are taken into account. Procedures are described which allow calculation of <b>retention</b> temperatures and from these, accurate programmed <b>retention</b> indices. Within certain limits the initial oven temperature and programming rate can be chosen freely. The prerequisite for this calculation is the availability of reliable isothermal <b>retention</b> data (<b>retention</b> times, <b>retention</b> factors, relative <b>retention</b> times, or <b>retention</b> indices) at two different temperatures for one column. The use of compiled isothermal <b>retention</b> indices at two different temperatures for the calculation of <b>retention</b> temperatures and thus temperature programmed indices is demonstrated. For the column for which programmed <b>retention</b> indices have to be determined, the isothermal <b>retention</b> times of the n-alkanes and the column dead time {{as a function of}} temperature have to be known in addition to the compiled data for a given stationary phase. Once the programmed <b>retention</b> indices have been calculated for a given column the concept allows the calculation of temperature programmed indices for columns with different specifications.

A simulation reveals however that the contribution of volume dealers to brand <b>retention</b> is rather small in comparison to the impact of brand-related variables on brand <b>retention.</b> In line with the notion of brand-dealer fit we also find that the impact of dealer extrinsic quality (e. g., dealer showrooms) and dealer payment equity on dealer <b>retention</b> differs between prestige, volume, and economy brands.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal design of <b>retention</b> in securitisation, {{in order to}} maximize welfare of screening per unit of <b>retention,</b> assuming that screening is costly and that the bank intends to securitise its loans. In contrast to the focus of previous literature on tranche <b>retention,</b> we deviate from the constitutional mechanisms of tranche <b>retention</b> to present a pareto-optimal method of tranche <b>retention.</b> Unlike the current ad-hoc-regulations, we derive the optimal design of <b>retention</b> from a utility maximization problem. We show that the level of <b>retention</b> per tranche should be dependent on the rate of credit default, i. e. the higher the rate of default, the higher the optimal rate of <b>retention</b> required to provide an incentive to screen carefully. From this approach, it follows that the rate of <b>retention</b> per tranche should be higher, the higher the position within the ranking order of subordination. Accordingly, the efficiency of tranche <b>retention</b> can be enhanced, reducing the level of <b>retention</b> required to maintain a given level of screening-effort. This <b>retention</b> design entails a recovery of the bank’s equity capital, thereby increasing liquidity and lending capacities...|$|R

Over the past three decades, ACT has conducted national surveys of <b>retention</b> practices asking postsecondary institutions to identify the <b>retention</b> practices they employ to mitigate student attrition. Based on ACT’s most recent survey conducted {{in the spring of}} 2009 this paper focuses on the <b>retention</b> practices employed at 2 -year public institutions (N= 303), 4 -year public institutions (N= 255), and 4 -year private institutions (N= 434). Information on institutional characteristics (type, control, size, minority enrollment rate, and admissions selectivity) was collected as well, as was data on first-to-second-year <b>retention</b> rates. Do <b>retention</b> practices vary based on differences in institutional characteristics? What <b>retention</b> practices are most related to institutional <b>retention</b> rates? The findings suggest that frequency of use of <b>retention</b> practices differs based on institution type and control. Four-year public institutions reported using more <b>retention</b> practices than the 2 -year public or 4 -year private institutions. Only eight of the 94 identified practices were used by more than 80 % of all institutions, regardless of type and control. A plurality of the practices most used by most institutions focuses on increasing student academic skills and performance. Stepwise regression analyses indicated that institutional selectivity and size were the most significant predictors of institutional <b>retention</b> rate in the 4 -year institution models, accounting for about 80 % of the variance in <b>retention</b> rates explained by the models. The relationship between institutional selectivity and <b>retention</b> was less pronounced for 2 -year public institutions than for the 4 -year institutions. The contribution of any single <b>retention</b> practice to institutional <b>retention</b> rate appeared to be noticeably smaller: <b>retention</b> practices account for just over 3 % of the variance in institutional <b>retention</b> rates in even the best case. Collectively, the findings provide IR professionals with information that may be useful as they conduct <b>retention</b> studies on their individual campuses...|$|R
