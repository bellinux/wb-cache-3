In all membrane methods, the membrane separates the fluid passing through it into a permeate (that which passes through) and a <b>retentate</b> (that which is left behind).

50|$|Membrane {{filtration}} processes can {{be distinguished}} by three major characteristics; Driving force, <b>retentate</b> stream and permeate streams. The microfiltration process is pressure driven with suspended particles and water as <b>retentate</b> and dissolved solutes plus water as permeate.

The product water, or the permeate stream, is the UPW passing through the skin of the hollow fiber and exiting through the center of the hollow fiber.

30|$|High {{molecular}} weight mannans likely accounted {{for part of}} the carbohydrates quantified in <b>retentates,</b> considering that the IYDs in this study are used for increasing the content of parietal yeast mannoproteins in wines. The detection of proteins and results of aggregation assays with the 2  kDa <b>retentates</b> also affirmed the presence of these glycoproteins, since lectin-like proteins on the cell surface of LAB can bind to mannose residues of yeast mannans and mannoproteins, causing an increase in bacterial aggregation (Katakura et al. 2010). Size exclusion chromatography of ethanol-precipitated polysaccharides in OptiRed® and Noblesse® performed by Gonzalez-Royo et al. (2013) revealed that the former IYD comprised of polysaccharides that were greater than 5  kDa, whilst the latter had polysaccharides that were mostly smaller than 6  kDa.

40|$|In desalination, {{effective}} pretreatment {{is the key}} {{to reduce}} membrane fouling that occurs during the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) process. However, it is difficult to compare the flux decline after different pretreatments using a small-scale reverse osmosis filtration unit. In this study, we successfully evaluated the effect of pretreatment on SWRO in terms of molecular weight distribution (MWD) of seawater organic matter (SWOM) after 20 h of SWRO operation. Microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), ferric chloride (FeCl(3)) flocculation and powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption, were used as pretreatment. The effluents and the <b>retentates</b> after each pretreatment and 20 h of SWRO operation were characterized in terms of MWD. Although the normalized flux of SWRO showed similar flux decline (J/J(0) = 0. 17) with/without pretreatment, SWOM concentration in the <b>retentates</b> after different pretreatments was different in quantity and it increased linearly with time. The slope of the SWOM increase was 0. 110, 0. 096, 0. 077 and 0. 059 after MF, FeCl(3) flocculation, UF and PAC adsorption pretreatments, respectively. MW peaks for the seawater used in this study consisted of 1200 Da (biopolymers), 950 Da (fulvic acids), 650 Da (hydrolysates of humic substances), 250 Da (low MW acids) and 90 Da (low MW neutrals and amphiphilics). FeCl(3) flocculation preferentially removed 1200 Da (biopolymers), while PAC adsorption mostly removed 950 Da (fulvic acids). UF and NF removed only a marginal amount of relatively large organics, while RO removed the majority of organics. The intensity of 1200, 950, 650 and 250 Da MW in the RO <b>retentates</b> increased with the RO operation time. The organics of MW around 1200 Da (biopolymers) had a relatively low rate of increase with time compared with those of lower MW. This suggests that the SWOM of 1200 Da MW was preferentially retained on the membrane surface. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reservedclose 302...|$|R

30|$|Amongst {{the various}} acid {{tolerance}} responses in LAB, {{the expulsion of}} protons from the cell through F 0 F 1 -ATPase complexes found on the bacterial membrane is the most well understood mechanism. This process is energetically demanding as the translocation of protons out of the bacterial cytoplasm by F 0 F 1 -ATPase is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (Siegumfeldt et al. 2000). In LAB, the ATP required is mainly generated from the glycolysis of sugars via the Embden–Meyerhof pathway or pentose phosphate pathway (Corcoran et al. 2005). Although carbohydrates were present in both 2  kDa permeates or <b>retentates</b> of the IYD supernatants, no free mono- and disaccharides were detected. Thus, L. rhamnosus HN 001 might have utilized complex carbohydrates {{as a source of}} metabolizable sugars through hydrolysis with glycosidases (Kankainen et al. 2009). Prior research involving IYDs used in the current study and similar preparations had characterized the carbohydrates in these preparations as yeast cell wall polysaccharides composed of mannose and/or glucose monomers (Andujar-Ortiz et al. 2010; Perez-Magarino et al. 2015). Based on the pore size of the membrane used for ultrafiltration (2  kDa MWCO), the carbohydrates in permeates were probably oligosaccharides and low molecular weight polysaccharides such as mannooligosaccharides and water-soluble glucans, while those in the <b>retentates</b> had higher degrees of polymerization and branching.|$|R

Chromatographic separation of free sugars was performed using a Zorbax carbohydrate column (150  ×  4.6  mm. Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and 80 % v/v acetonitrile with a flow rate of 1  mL/min at 30  °C. An evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD-LT II, Shimadzu) {{was used for}} the detection of eluted sugars. Free amino acids and ammonia were derivatized with 6 -aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC) using the Waters AccQ-Tag Ultra Chemistry Kit (Dublin, Ireland), followed by chromatographic analysis according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The total free amino acid concentration was calculated by summing the amounts of ammonia and individual amino acids detected. Total carbohydrates were quantified using the phenol–sulfuric acid method as described by DuBois et al. (1956) and expressed as (mg glucose/mL). The total protein in each fraction was determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA), with bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) as the standard. The total antioxidant capacity of the IYD ultrafiltered-fractions were measured using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assays according to the methods of Brand-Williams et al. (1995) and Amamcharla and Metzger (2014), respectively, and blanks were prepared by adding pH 3.0 PBS in place of the samples. Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the standard for both antioxidant assays, and the DPPH radical scavenging activity and FRAP value of permeates and <b>retentates</b> were expressed in terms of Trolox equivalents (μg TE/mL).|$|R

30|$|Although free {{amino acids}} were absent in the 2  kDa <b>retentates,</b> the {{proteins}} present may have been utilized by L. rhamnosus HN 001 {{for the production of}} amino acids (Aljewicz et al. 2014). These soluble proteins includes peptides produced during yeast autolysis or the protein moiety of mannoproteins, which could be hydrolyzed by proteases and oligopeptidases in the LAB (Koponen et al. 2012; Pozo-Bayon et al. 2009). Exposure of LAB to adverse environmental conditions of heat, acidic and osmotic stress induces an upregulation of protein expression as a response mechanism (van de Guchte et al. 2002). In the acid stress assay, supplementing IYDs also provides a source of amino acids required for the synthesis of general stress response (ClpE, DnaK, GrpE) and cell signalling (LuxS) proteins, enzymes involved in carbohydrate, protein and amino acid metabolism, transporter molecules and F 0 F 1 -ATPase (Koponen et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|Apart from {{lowering}} cytoplasmic pH, {{lactic acid}} {{has also been}} shown to exert oxidative stress in LAB by dissociating iron from the catalytic sites of proteins and forming iron-lactate complexes. The increase in free iron and iron-lactate complexes enhances the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide by catalysing the Fenton reaction (Bruno-Bárcena et al. 2010). Antioxidants in IYDs might have contributed to the improved viability of L. rhamnosus HN 001 in the acid stress assays by alleviating oxidative stress imposed by reactive oxygen species. The greater survival of the LAB at pH 3.0 with IYD supernatant permeates as compared to <b>retentates</b> may be partly due to their higher antioxidant activity. Compounds that could contribute to the antioxidant activity of IYDs include aromatic amino acids, peptides and low molecular weight, water-soluble glucans (Alcaide-Hidalgo et al. 2007; Lei et al. 2015; Nimalaratne et al. 2011).|$|R

The ultrafiltration <b>retentate</b> can then be used to make various whey powders, including whey protein isolate. Additionally, the ultrafiltration permeate, which contains lactose, is concentrated by reverse osmosis from 5% total solids to 18-22% total solids to reduce crystallization and drying costs of the lactose powder.|$|E
50|$|Ultrafiltration (UF) is {{a variety}} of {{membrane}} filtration in which forces like pressure or concentration gradients lead to a separation through a semipermeable membrane.

This separation process is used in industry and research for purifying and concentrating macromolecular (103 - 106 Da) solutions, especially protein solutions. Ultrafiltration is not fundamentally different from microfiltration. Both of these separate based on size exclusion or particle capture. It is fundamentally different from membrane gas separation, which separate based on different amounts of absorption and different rates of diffusion. Ultrafiltration membranes are defined by the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membrane used. Ultrafiltration is applied in cross-flow or dead-end mode.|$|E

50|$|Membrane {{separation}} processes operate without {{heating and}} therefore use less energy than conventional thermal separation {{processes such as}} distillation, sublimation or crystallization. The separation process is purely physical and both fractions (permeate and <b>retentate)</b> can be used.

50|$|Transport through pores - in the {{simplest}} case - is done convectively. This requires {{the size of the}} pores to be smaller than the diameter of the two separate components. Membranes which function according to this principle are used mainly in micro- and ultrafiltration. They are used to separate macromolecules from solutions, colloids from a dispersion or remove bacteria. During this process the retained particles or molecules form a pulpy mass (filter cake) on the membrane, and this blockage of the membrane hampers the filtration. This blockage can be reduced by the use of the cross-flow method (cross-flow filtration). Here, the liquid to be filtered flows along the front of the membrane and is separated by the pressure difference between the front and back of the membrane into <b>retentate</b> (the flowing concentrate) on the front and permeate (filtrate) on the back. The tangential flow on the front creates a shear stress that cracks the filter cake and reduces the fouling.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving force}} for {{transport}} of different components {{is provided by}} a chemical potential difference between the liquid feed/retentate and vapor permeate at {{each side of the}} membrane. The <b>retentate</b> is the remainder of the feed leaving the membrane feed chamber, which is not permeated through the membrane. The chemical potential can be expressed in terms of fugacity, given by Raoult's law for a liquid and by Dalton's law for (an ideal) gas. During operation, due to removal of the vapor-phase permeate, the actual fugacity of the vapor is lower than anticipated on basis of the collected (condensed) permeate. Separation of components (e.g. water and ethanol) is based on a difference in transport rate of individual components through the membrane. This transport mechanism can be described using the solution-diffusion model, based on the rate/ degree of dissolution of a component into the membrane and its velocity of transport (expressed in terms of diffusivity) through the membrane, which will be different for each component and membrane type leading to separation.|$|E
