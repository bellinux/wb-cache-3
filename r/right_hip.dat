40|$|Hip dysplasia: a {{significant}} {{risk factor for}} the development of hip osteoarthritis. A cross-sectional survey S. Jacobsen and S. Sonne-Holm Objectives. The aim of this cross-sectional survey of 2232 women and 1336 men (age range 20 – 91 yr) was to investigate individual risk factors for hip joint osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Standardized, weight-bearing pelvic radiographs were evaluated. Radiological hip joint OA was defined as minimum joint space width (JSW) 2. 0 mm. Hip dysplasia was evaluated according to common radiographic indices. Radiographic findings were correlated to general health and lifestyle information obtained at baseline examinations and questionnaires. The study focused on age; self-reported hip pain, occupational exposure to repeated daily lifting, body mass index, smoking and hip dysplasia. Results. Hip dysplasia (HD) prevalence ranged from 5. 4 – 12. 8 % depending on the radiographic index applied. Hip OA prevalence was 1. 0 – 2. 5 % in subjects < 60 yr of age and 4. 4 – 5. 3 % in subjects 60 yr of age. Of factors entered into logistic regression analyses, only age (P< 0. 001 for <b>right</b> <b>hips</b> and P< 0. 001 for left hips) and hip dysplasia (P< 0. 001 for <b>right</b> <b>hips</b> and P 0. 004 for left hips) were significantly associated with hip OA prevalence in women.

40|$|Background: Undetected {{developmental}} dysplasia {{of the hip}} can {{progress to}} hip instability, {{which can lead to}} the development of early osteoarthritis. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the reliability and accuracy of the Shenton line in the diagnosis of acetabular dysplasia in the skeletally mature patient. Methods: Supine anteroposterior pelvic radiographs were obtained for a total of 128 hips in patients with a diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip prior to pelvic osteotomy (sixty-four hips, including thirty-two left and thirty-two <b>right</b> <b>hips)</b> and normal patients (sixty-four hips, including thirty-two left and thirty-two <b>right</b> <b>hips).</b> Six orthopaedic surgeons determined if the Shenton line was broken or intact to determine interobserver reliability. Four observers reviewed the randomized radiographs again after four weeks to determine intraobserver reliability. Results: The mean intraclass kappa value was 0. 90 (range, 0. 79 to 0. 97), indicating excellent agreement between each reviewer’s primary and secondary reviews. The kappa estimate for interobserver reliability among all six reviewers was 0. 80 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 75 to 0. 84), indicating an excellent agreement. The determination of a normal or abnormal Shenton line had a mean sensitivity of 83. 3 % (range, 60. 9 % to 93. 8 %) and specificity of 98. 4 % (range, 92. 2 % to 100 %). Conclusions: The Shenton line is a reliable and accurate radiographic marker to detect superior femoral head sublux-ation indicative of acetabular dysplasia...|$|R

Harris did not miss any games following the injury and instead switched to mainly using her left leg and dealt with the pain. Dorrance again employed the two-goalkeeper method, as Harris split time with junior goalkeeper, Anna Rodenbough. The two goalkeepers alternated starts and played for half of each game. Harris played in 19 games and made 9 starts, playing a total of 1120 minutes. She allowed nine goals and recorded 29 saves, giving a 0.763 save percentage.

5|$|The bones {{found on}} 25 August were {{uncovered}} on 4 September and the grave soil dug back further {{over the next}} two days. The feet were missing, and the skull was found in an unusual propped-up position, consistent with the body being put into a grave that was slightly too small. The spine was curved in an S-shape. No sign of a coffin was found; the skeleton's posture suggested the body had not been put in a shroud, but had been hurriedly dumped into the grave and buried. As the bones were lifted from the ground, a piece of rusted iron was found underneath the vertebrae. The skeleton's hands were in an unusual position, crossed over the <b>right</b> <b>hip,</b> suggesting they were tied together at the time of burial, although this could not be established definitively.

We have sought to evaluate the reproducibility over time of isokinetic testing of the hip flexor (FI) and extensor (Ext) muscles and to establish {{whether there is a}} significant difference in peak torque (PT) between the left and <b>right</b> <b>hips.</b> Patients and methodsTen adults were tested once a week for 3 weeks by the same investigator and according to the same protocol, with two velocities (60 °/s and 180 °/s) for the hip FI and Ext in concentric tests and one velocity (30 °/s) for the Ext only in eccentric tests. The reproducibility of the measured PT was analyzed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a Bland and Altman plot. The difference in PT between the <b>right</b> and left <b>hips</b> was tested using Student's T test. ResultsThe ICC for the observed PT values revealed very good reproducibility (with a value of between 0. 75 and 0. 96) for the hip FI and Ext measurements (regardless of the body side, test velocity or contraction mode). We did not observe any significant PT differences between the <b>right</b> and left <b>hips.</b> ConclusionThe isokinetic assessment of the concentric and eccentric PT values generated by the hip FI and Ext is highly reproducible.
