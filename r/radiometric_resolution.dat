Thematic Mapper data acquired over the Washington, D. C. area on November 2, 1982 were utilized to conduct the experiment. The following results were obtained: the reduction of quantization level from eight bits to six bits caused a decrease in overall accuracy (7 %); the use of only three bands (TM 2, 3 and 4) covering the isible and near infrared portion of the spectrum caused a decrease in overall accuracy (7 %); and the decrease in spatial resolution resulted in an increase in overall accuracy (4 %).

40|$|The {{information}} content in remote sensing imagery depends upon various {{factors such as}} spatial and <b>radiometric</b> <b>resolutions,</b> <b>radiometric</b> contrast between different target types, and also the final application for which the imagery has been acquired. Our approach to quantifying image {{information content}} is based upon classification accuracy. As noise is added to the image, the classification accuracy reduces, thereby resulting in loss of “information”. The relationship between the information content and the noise variance can be described by a negative exponential model. The model is seen to be applicable for relating the information content to noise variance for Landsat TM as well as multi-look and single-look SIR-C imagery. We observe that the relationship is independent of the type of noise (Gaussian, Rayleigh, or Gamma). However, the rate of information loss increases with the correlation distance in the case of spatially correlated noise. The rate of information loss also increases with the number of classes chosen for classifying the scene. The model is useful in deducing allowable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for different sensor systems...|$|R

40|$|When {{computing}} the <b>radiometric</b> <b>resolution</b> of an interferometric radiometer {{the correlation}} among the errors of different baselines is usually assumed negligible. ln this way: a) the radiometric sensitivity {{turns out to}} be pixel independent (except for antenna pattern effects), and b) the error of the average of P redundant baselines is reduced by a factor of (P) 1 / 2. While this may be the case in radioastronomy applications, for an on-board instrument where all the baselines are measured at the same time interval the errors will actually be correlated.
