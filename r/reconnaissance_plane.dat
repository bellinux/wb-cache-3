5|$|As {{the storm}} began to reorganize, the forward motion had become {{virtually}} stationary but later began {{to increase as}} Arlene turned northeastward, beginning recurvature into the main belt of the Westerlies. Ships {{in the vicinity of}} the depression reported that it had regained gale-force winds on August8, resulting in advisories on Arlene being re-initiated around that time. Later that day, a Navy <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> found hurricane-force winds around the center of the storm, resulting in Arlene being upgraded to a minimal hurricane a second time.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Greta {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Jamaica on October30, 1956. A Navy <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> recorded sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) and found an area of low pressure. Around this time, the system was classified as a tropical depression. Although a ship near the system discovered a cold-core circulation—a feature of non-tropical cyclones—it was classified as tropical. By October31, the depression passed near {{the western edge of}} Haiti and later crossed the eastern tip of Cuba before entering the Atlantic Ocean. By the afternoon of November1, the depression had moved through the central Bahamas and turned towards the northeast.|$|E

Moscow Defence Brief provided a higher estimate for air force losses, saying that Russian Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, one Su-24M Fencer fighter-bomber, one Su-24MR Fencer E <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> and four Su-25 attack planes. Anton Lavrov listed one Su-25SM, two Su-25BM, two Su-24M and one Tu-22M3 lost. Two helicopters, a Mi-8MTKO and a Mi-24, were wrecked in an accident after the hostilities.|$|E
5|$|A {{deepening}} trough {{over the}} eastern United States was forecast {{to turn the}} storm toward the north on August16. This turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated. The storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced {{from the center of}} circulation; however, upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the Gulf Stream. Later that day, Bob began to consolidate and a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719UTC, following this reading, the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly after, the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast in response to a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September16, a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> recorded flight-level winds of 185km/h (115mph). Around this time, surface winds were estimated to be the same, making Helen a Category3 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Later that day, the storm made landfall near Cape Kushimoto. In Shionomisaki Lighthouse, just west of where the center of Helen passed, a barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg) was recorded, the lowest {{in relation to the}} storm. As the system neared Hokkaido, it slowed down and began a multi-day anticyclonic loop. During this period, it merged with an upper-level low and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September19. The remnants of Helen then tracked across southern Hokkaido before dissipating just east of the island on September21.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Liza was {{the third}} {{hurricane}} of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Forming from {{an area of the}} Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on August 28 and reaching tropical storm strength in the same day, Liza meandered generally westward over the Pacific Ocean, reaching hurricane strength on August 29 while far from land. It maintained that intensity until September 2, when the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm, but avoided tropical depression status despite the presentation seen by an Air Force <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane.</b> After weakening, the storm moved northwestward, weakening to a depression on September 4, when it began a turn to the east. There is a possibility that the depression completed a small loop between the downgrade and its dissipation on September 6.|$|E
5|$|In early September1972, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed within a near-equatorial trough near the Northern Mariana Islands. On September11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring this system as {{a tropical}} depression shortly after moving through the island chain. Initially, the system tracked southwestward before turning northwestward {{along the edge of}} a ridge. On September13, a United States Air Force <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> flew into the system and found that it had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the newly named Tropical Storm Helen. Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began warning on the system, assigning it the local name Paring. The following day, Helen attained typhoon status as it turned northward. Subsequently, a deepening trough over the East China Sea caused the typhoon to turn north-northeastward and accelerate.|$|E
5|$|On August14, roughly 24hours after degenerating into {{a remnant}} low, {{convection}} began to redevelop over the system. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> deployed dropsondes into the system. They {{found that the}} system was regenerating and shortly after, the NHC began re-issuing advisories on the depression when it was located roughly 1,075mi (1,735km) east of the Leeward Islands. The depression continued to track westward {{in response to an}} upper-level high over the north Atlantic. Early on August15, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, giving it the name Ana as deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, wind shear caused convection to become displaced from the circulation, exposing the center of Ana again.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the depression}} intensified into a tropical storm; however, advisories were not {{issued by the}} National Hurricane Center (NHC) on the system until August 30 {{because of the lack}} of reconnaissance aircraft data. It was determined that Christine had become a tropical storm by this time after receiving reports of gale-force winds from a German cargo ship in the vicinity of the storm. The first advisory from the NHC came after a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> found sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1007 mbar (hPa; 29.74 inHg). At that time, Christine was located roughly 1000 mi (1,500 km) east of Trinidad. Although the storm was relatively disorganized by this point, satellite imagery showed large outer bands extending hundreds of miles (kilometres) from the storm.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Abby was an {{exceptionally}} small tropical cyclone that had minor effects across Southeast Texas in early August 1964. Forming as a tropical depression {{out of a}} trough south of Louisiana on August5, the system moved generally westward. It was not until August7 that the system began to organize. That day, an eye rapidly formed within the system {{and it became a}} tropical storm just 60mi (95km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Soon thereafter, a weather <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> reported a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg) at the storm's center. Around 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT), the newly named Abby attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). It subsequently made landfall near Matagorda, Texas four hours later. Once onshore gradual weakening ensued, though a brief period of re-organization delayed its dissipation. Abby degenerated into an area of showers on August8 southwest of San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} exited {{the coast of}} Africa on August 15, 1964, moved westward, not organizing into a tropical depression until around 890miles (1432.3km) east of Barbados on August 20–as reported by a Navy <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane.</b> It continued west-northwestward, quickly strengthening to a hurricane {{the next day with}} a minimum central pressure of 993mb. Early in the afternoon of August 22, Cleo crossed Guadeloupe as a 115mph (185km/h) Category3 hurricane. The hurricane continued to strengthen as it moved through the Caribbean Sea and reached its peak intensity of 155mph (250km/h) on the August 23 while south of the Dominican Republic. It maintained that intensity for a day, bringing heavy rain and winds to Hispaniola. As Cleo passed south of Haiti on August 24, it veered northward momentarily, enough {{to move on to the}} Southwest Peninsula of Haiti. The circulation of the hurricane was greatly disrupted by the mountainous terrain of the island, quickly weakening the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong {{first saw}} {{action in the}} Korean War on August 29, 1951, as an escort for a photo <b>{{reconnaissance}}</b> <b>plane</b> over Songjin. Five days later on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of Wonsan. While making a low bombing run at about , Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by anti-aircraft fire. While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of about , which sliced off about three feet (1 m) of the Panther's right wing. Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due {{to the loss of}} the aileron, ejection was his only safe option. He planned to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, and therefore flew to an airfield near Pohang, but his ejection seat was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked Armstrong up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of No. 125122 F9F-2.|$|E
5|$|In mid-June, a mid-level {{center of}} {{circulation}} formed {{in association with}} a quasi-stationary cold front that stretched across northern Florida and the extreme northeast Gulf of Mexico. On June20, a weak and disorganized {{area of low pressure}} developed in conjunction with the front and it passed by Tampa Bay, Florida the following day. Upon moving into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, there was little convection on observed on satellite imagery, although a distinguishable wind-shift was noted by an offshore buoy. However, by June23, the presence of deep convection atop a circulation had become well-defined enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify the disturbance as a tropical depression, while centered 330mi (535km) southwest of Cape Coral, Florida. Moving generally west to west-northwestward across the central Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center sent a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> into the tropical depression at 1500UTC on June24, at which time winds of 60mph (95km/h) were found. About three hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 1700UTC on September22, {{the eye of}} Janet {{passed over}} Barbados. A {{reconnaissance}} flight into the hurricane discovered that the Hurricane Janet's eye measured only 20mi (32km) in diameter, with gale force winds extending 120mi (190km) away {{from the center of}} circulation. The flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of 979mbar (hPa; 28.91inHg). After passing between the islands of Grenada and Carriacou in the morning hours of September23, Janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern Caribbean Sea. As a result, the hurricane became disorganized, with winds weakening to 90mph (145km/h) by 1200UTC on September23. A U.S. Navy <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> entered the hurricane early on September24, reporting a lack of organization, and noting an indiscernible center of circulation with weak rainbands. However, the hurricane began to reintensify in favorable conditions, regaining major hurricane strength by 1200UTC on September24 and subsequently Category 4hurricane intensity by the next day.|$|E

5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
5|$|By August16, {{the forward}} motion of Ana began to increase, and the storm quickly entered {{a region of}} dry, stable air. By the afternoon, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission {{did not find any}} evidence of tropical storm-force winds, resulting in Ana being downgraded to a tropical depression. It was determined in post-storm analysis, that Ana had degenerated into a tropical wave shortly afterwards, and was no longer a tropical cyclone. Several hours later, the system redeveloped convection as it raced towards the west-northwest at 26mph (42km/h). Early on August17, radar imagery from Guadeloupe and San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a system without a closed, low-level circulation. Despite this, the NHC continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery. Later that day, a final <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> flew into the storm and did not find a low-level circulation. Following this, the NHC stated that Ana had dissipated off the coast of Puerto Rico, despite having already degenerated into a tropical wave the previous day. The remnants of Ana were once more monitored for signs of regeneration, but land interaction with Hispaniola and Cuba spoiled the system's chances of redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|Tracking west-{{northwest}} {{and later}} northwest around the southwestern {{edge of a}} subtropical ridge, steady intensification of the cyclone ensued. Early on August27, a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>plane</b> measured a central pressure of 994mbar (hPa; 29.36inHg) and flight-level winds of , indicating the system had become a tropical storm. In light of this, the JTWC assigned the name Agnes to the storm. Additionally due to its proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration dubbed the system with the local name Pining. Strengthening occurred at a climatological rate, with Agnes attaining typhoon-status on August29. A large, banding eye-feature developed within the core of Agnes as it approached the Ryukyu Islands of southwestern Japan. The storm passed 170km (105mi) south of Okinawa around 06:00UTC on August30 and emerged over the East China Sea. Early on August31, Agnes achieved its peak strength with winds of 175km/h (110mph) and an estimated central pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). This ranked it as a Category2-equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The JMA estimated the system to have been slightly weaker, with ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg).|$|E
