Compositional shifts indicate that deforestation and forest degradation favours matrix-tolerant species with lower levels of forest habitat specificity.

40|$|This {{research}} is part of a project aimed at verifying the potential of a specifically assessed wooded riparian zone in removing excess of combined nitrogen from the Zero river flow for the reduction of nutrient input into Venice Lagoon. The experimental site was built on an area previously used for arable crops. 300 seedlings of the following plant species were then planted: Quercus robur, Alnus glutinosa, Acer campestre, Salix alba, Coryllus avellana, Salix triandra, Prunus padus, Crataegus monogyna, Fraxinus ornus, Frangula alnus. The buffer zone was organized with an irrigation ditch carrying water from the Zero river and drainage ditches, resulting in a sub-surface water flow running through the entire buffer strips. Soils were sampled in March, April, June and October 2008 from three different depths through the soil profile. The analysis of the bacterial communities was performed by combined approaches involving cultivation on complex solid media to determine colturable bacterial cells, the use of di-chromatic fluorescent stain and CTC+ assay to determine the viable and the metabolically active fractions of the community. Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) and computer assisted electrophoretic ARDRA fingerprinting were performed to analyze microbial diversity through (a) the comparison between the microbial communities in the wooded <b>riparian</b> <b>strip</b> (internal) to that of soil external to the experimental site, (b) the fluctuation of the microbial communities with time by collecting samples at each season, (c) the characterization of bacterial populations colonizing the soil at different depths. The number of total living cells did not follow significant and important seasonal fluctuations, but epifluorescence counts showed greater variations when surface soils was compared to medium and deep samples. The fraction of culturable bacteria did not show any significant variation between internal and external sampling; the main difference observed was the number of metabolically working cells, higher for the internal soil. These results indicate that the plants {{play an important role in}} supporting microbial growth in soil by overcoming the main limiting factor, almost always represented by the availability of organic carbon. To characterize microbial diversity of the culturable fraction, several hundreds colonies were then isolated from the wooded <b>riparian</b> <b>strip</b> and from the external site, 16 S rDNA was amplified and HinfI- and HpaII-restricted. A variety of different DNA fragment patterns was revealed.

Although logging is a potential threat to the species, no studies have examined how clear-cutting affects its terrestrial stage. We used radio-telemetry to compare the movements of 35 terrestrial Pacific {{giant salamanders}} at sites with three different logging histories: forested, clearcut to the stream margin, and clearcut with <b>riparian</b> buffer <b>strips.</b> The results demonstrate that logging affected movements of the salamanders. Salamanders in clearcuts remained significantly closer to the stream, spent more time in subterranean refuges, and had smaller home ranges than those at forested sites. During a dry year, salamanders in clearcuts were significantly more dependent on precipitation for their movement than salamanders in forested habitats.

40|$|Background: This {{research}} is part of a project aimed at verifying the potential of a specifically assessed wooded riparian zone in removing excess of combined nitrogen from a river flow for the reduction of nutrient input into Venice Lagoon. Objectives: 1. To compare microbial metabolic activities in the wooded <b>riparian</b> <b>strip</b> (internal) to that of external soil. 2. To characterize bacterial populations colonizing that soil at different depths. Methods: Cultivation on complex solid media, LIVE/DEAD BacLight stains and CTC assay were used to determine culturable, viable and actively metabolizing bacterial cells, respectively. Microbial diversity of colturable populations was analyzed by Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA). Results: As expected, the number of culturable, total living and metabolically active cells followed seasonal fluctuations and significantly higher values were always found for surface soils as compared to medium and deep samples. The main difference observed between the wooded riparian soil and the external samples was the number of metabolically working cells, although the total number of living bacteria was almost the same.

40|$|This {{research}} is part of a project aimed at verifying the potential of a specifically assessed wooded riparian zone in removing excess of combined nitrogen from the Zero river flow for the reduction of nutrient input into Venice Lagoon. Seasonal fluctuations of microbial populations in the water entering and leaving the wooded <b>riparian</b> <b>strip</b> were determined for at least two years. Combined approaches involving cultivation, microscopic approaches and DNA bases techniques were adopted to characterize both culturable and total microbial community. Seven major bacterial lineages, namely Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria,Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, and Sphingobacteria were present in water samples as revealed by 16 S rDNA sequence analysis of the culturable fraction of the bacterial population. Gammaproteobacteria were the most dominant both in spring and fall, although distinct bacterial communities were clearly detectable for the two seasons. However, while DGGE cluster analysis did not reveal significant differences between irrigation and drainage ditches, a significant alteration was detected by PCA based on 16 S rDNA of the culturable fraction. Since the wooded <b>riparian</b> <b>strip</b> was vigorously working in terms of N removing by plant uptake and especially by microbial denitrification, as demonstrated by parallel studies performed on the same experimental site (Gumiero et al., 2011), it is reasonable to suppose that the culturable bacteria fraction is the one effectively carrying out the required task. In other words, the wooded riparian buffer zone specifically assessed for water remediation (nitrogen removal) is efficiently working {{as a result of the}} special conditions there produced to support the work of specific microbial populations. This is confirmed by the increase of metabolically active bacteria detected at the drainage ditches.

40|$|Excessive {{nutrient}} {{and sediment}} export from agricultural basins with intensive row crop cultivation {{have been identified}} as persistent problems leading to higher levels of nitrate nitrogen and reduced levels of dissolved oxygen in the water bodies. Water quality thus gets degraded and becomes less suitable for human use and potential threat to the aquatic life and environment. Development of bio-fuel technology further increases the demand of grain that will result in more land under row crop cultivation, which supposedly would worsen the situation regarding water quality. In this study, application of contour and <b>riparian</b> buffer <b>strips</b> and strategic conversion of row crop to biomass yielding switchgrass to conserve the basin scale water quality is evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Finally SWAT hydrological parameters have been developed for a small portion of Iowa that would be instrumental in development of TMDL 2 ̆ 7 s. The use of contour and <b>riparian</b> buffer <b>strips</b> planted with perennial vegetation has been found to improve surface water quality by reducing NO 3 -N and sediment outflow from cropland to a river.
