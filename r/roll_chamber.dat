It contained the hit singles [...] "Livin' Thing", [...] "Telephone Line", [...] "Rockaria!" [...] and [...] "Do Ya", a re-recording of the Move song. The band toured in support in the US only from September 1976 to April 1977 with a break in December, then an American Music Awards show appearance on 31 January 1977, plus a one-off gig in San Diego in August 1977. Casey Kasem said that the Electric Light Orchestra is the [...] "World's first touring rock 'n' <b>roll</b> <b>chamber</b> group" [...] before he played [...] "Livin' Thing" [...] at #28. A New World Record {{was followed by a}} multi-platinum selling album, the double-LP Out of the Blue, in 1977. Out of the Blue featured the singles [...] "Turn to Stone", [...] "Sweet Talkin' Woman", [...] "Mr. Blue Sky", and [...] "Wild West Hero", each becoming a hit in the United Kingdom. The band then set out on a nine-month, 92-date world tour, with an enormous set and a hugely expensive space ship stage with fog machines and a laser display. In the United States the concerts were billed as The Big Night and were their largest to date, with 62,000 people seeing them at Cleveland Stadium. The Big Night {{went on to become the}} highest-grossing live concert tour in music history up to that point (1978). The band played at London's Wembley Arena for eight straight sold-out nights during the tour, another record at that time.|$|E

Diante do exposto, objetivou-se com o presente trabalho avaliar a embebiÃÃo de sementes, temperatura na germinaÃÃo e propagaÃÃo assexual de fisÃlis, na produÃÃo de mudas de qualidade. Os experimentos foram conduzidos durante o perÃodo de outubro/ 2011 a maio/ 2012, na EstaÃÃo de Horticultura e Controle BiolÃgico âProfessor MÃrio CÃsar Lopesâ, da Universidade Estadual do Oeste do ParanÃ (Unioeste), Campus Marechal CÃndido Rondon, PR. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado no experimento com sementes foi inteiramente casualizado, com os seguintes tratamentos 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 e 40 ÂC. A curva de embebiÃÃo foi realizada empregando-se trÃs mÃtodos, sendo papel embebido em Ãgua, semente submersa em Ãgua e rolo de papel em BOD a 30 ÂC por 72 horas). Nos experimentos de propagaÃÃo assexuada utilizou-se o delineamento experimental em blocos ao acaso, fatorial 3 x 3 (comprimento de estacas de 5, 10 e 15 cm x trÃs espÃcies de fisÃlis, sendo Physalis angulata, P. peruviana e P. pubescens) e fatorial 3 x 3 (estacas lenhosas, semi-lenhosas e herbÃceas x trÃs espÃcies de fisÃlis, sendo Physalis angulata, P. peruviana e P. pubescens), contendo quatro repetiÃÃes e 10 estacas por repetiÃÃo. Aos 60 dias apÃs a implantaÃÃo dos experimentos, realizaram-se as avaliaÃÃes fitotÃcnicas. Para sementes de P. angulata, sÃo consideradas como temperatura Ãtima para a germinaÃÃo na faixa de 22 a 32 ÂC, mÃnima e mÃxima como 15 ÂC e 35 ÂC respectivamente. Sementes de fisÃlis apresentam embebiÃÃo elevada atÃ Ã 10 Â hora, e inÃcio de germinaÃÃo a partir da 48 Â hora. O tamanho e o tipo das estacas afetam a propagaÃÃo assexual de fisÃlis. Estacas de 15 cm sÃo apropriadas para a produÃÃo de mudas de fisÃlis propagadas assexuadamente. Estacas lenhosas apresentam melhores resultados na propagaÃÃo vegetativa de fisÃlisThe main {{methods of}} obtaining quality seedlings of cape gooseberry involve propagation by seed, softwood and micropropagation, {{being one of}} the most important factors for the establishment of new orchards. Given the above, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the soaking of seeds, germination temperature and asexual propagation of cape gooseberry, the production of quality seedlings. The experiments were conducted during the period from October/ 2011 to May/ 2012, the Station of Horticulture and Biological Control "MÃrio CÃsar Lopes," at the State University of West ParanÃ, Marechal CÃndido Rondon â Brazil. The experimental design used in the experiment with seeds was randomized with the following treatments 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 ÂC. The absorption curve was performed using three methods; paper soaked in water, seed submerged in water and paper <b>roll</b> <b>chamber</b> at 30 ÂC for 72 hours). In asexual propagation experiments used the experimental design in randomized blocks, factorial 3 x 3 (cutting length of 5, 10 and 15 cm x three species of cape gooseberry, Physalis angulate, P. peruviana and P. pubescens) and a 3 x 3 factorial (hardwood cuttings, semi-woody and herbaceous x three species of cape gooseberry, Physalis angulata, P. peruviana and P. pubescens), with four replications and 10 cuttings per replicate. At 60 days after implantation of the experiments were carried out assessments phytotechnical. To seeds of P. angulata, are considered optimum temperature for germination in the range 22 to 32 ÂC, minimum and maximum to 15 ÂC and 35 ÂC respectively. Seed imbibition present cape gooseberry raised to 10 Â hour, and early germination from the 48 th hour. The size and type of cuttings affect the asexual propagation of cape gooseberry. Cuttings of 15 cm are suitable for the production of seedlings propagated asexually cape gooseberry. Hardwood cuttings show better results in the propagation of cape gooseberr...|$|E

5000|$|Ammunition with a {{black powder}} charge is {{currently}} available commercially from Buffalo Bore. Reloaders have experimented {{with a variety of}} bullet weights from 425 to 600 gr g in weight. Additionally, the US Navy contracted with Remington to produce several thousand <b>Rolling</b> Block carbines <b>chambered</b> for a reduced load version of this cartridge which was officially produced for use only in carbines. This reduced load cartridge used a shortened [...]50-70 with a 430 gr g bullet and 45 gr g of black powder.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} {{of using a}} two <b>chambered</b> <b>roll</b> becomes most apparent when loading. Since each chamber is light-tight, a loader only needs to load the feed side in darkness - once that chamber is secured, {{the remainder of the}} loading can take place in light. The small amount of film which is exposed on the take-up side would not be used for exposure under any design, and thus is not considered a significant loss of stock. Most two chambered axial magazines have fixed loop sizes, which adds some extra time to the loading procedure, but allows for magazines to be attached to the camera with minimal or no threading required. This can be a great advantage when filming requires reloading that takes only seconds.|$|R
5000|$|They were {{becoming}} more {{accepted in the}} folk community, but, like many on the folk circuit, were looking to electrify their music and develop a more rock and <b>roll</b> sound. Joe <b>Chambers</b> recalled in a May 1994 Goldmine article that people at the Newport Folk Festival were breaking down fences and rushing to the stage. [...] "Newport had never seen or heard anything like that." [...] After the group finished and the crowd finally settled down, the MC came up and said [...] "Whether you know it or not, that was rock 'n' roll." [...] That night they played at a post-concert party for festival performers {{and went to a}} recording session of the newly electrified Bob Dylan. Shortly after appearing at Newport, the group released its debut album, People Get Ready.|$|R
5000|$|A new Swedish-Norwegian arms {{commission}} {{set up in}} the 1880s {{suggested that}} the Norwegian M1884 Jarmann rifle should replace the m/1867 in both Swedish and Norwegian service but the Jarmann rifle was rejected by the Swedish Army since the 10.15x61mmR cartridge used by the Jarmann rifle was seen as being too little of an improvement over the 12.17 mm cartridge used in the Model 1867 rifles. So as a stop-gap measure rifles and carbines with rolling block action were converted to a for that time period very modern centerfire cartridge, the 8×58mmR Danish Krag (bullet diameter [...]322 in/8.17mm, bullet weight 237 grains/15.29 grams, muzzle velocity 1,965 ft per second/600 m/s), with the designation [...] "gevär m/1867-89" [...] used for converted rifles and [...] "gevär m/1889" [...] used for new rifles. <b>Rolling</b> block rifles <b>chambered</b> for the 8×58mmR were shorter than the M1867 rifles, with an overall length of 1,240 mm (48.8 in) and a barrel length of 840 mm (33.1 in).|$|R
5000|$|Another major {{categorization}} is {{the type}} of design: is the magazine one chamber or two chambers? If the latter, are the two horizontal or axial to each other? Most 35 mm camera magazines are one large chamber containing both spindles - usually the spindles are close enough together so that the feed and take-up rolls will just miss touching each other when the maximum length of film for that magazine is at its halfway point. Cameras with the single chamber magazine design include all Panavision and Moviecam cameras, most 35 mm Arri cameras, and all older 16 mm Arri cameras. Some old cameras, such as the Mitchell, have two separate chambers horizontal to each other, which looks very similar to a one chamber design. More popular today in two chamber design, however, are two chamber axial magazines, where the feed and take-up <b>rolls</b> (and thus <b>chambers)</b> are [...] "stacked" [...] one atop the other. Cameras with this magazine design in 16 mm include the Aaton and Arri SR models, and in 35 mm include the Arri BL and 535 models.|$|R

The US Army also ordered both Rolling Block rifles and carbines in caliber 50-70 and also made some Rolling Blocks at their Springfield Armory facility in this caliber. [...] The US Army also had a large supply of percussion fired Sharps carbines {{at the close of}} the Civil War and had the Sharps Rifle company convert about 31,000 of those to caliber 50-70 for cavalry use. Meanwhile the Army, which had exited the Civil War with an inventory of almost a million percussion fired muzzle loaders converted Springfield Model 1863 and Model 1864 muskets to metallic cartridge ammunition using the Allin conversion (trapdoor) method, as well as cadet rifles. The first of the 50-70 conversions was the Springfield Model 1866. Newer improved versions were made and used by the Army through 1873. After 1873 with the advent of the 45-70 cartridge, the Army declared the [...]50-70 to be surplus and while some rifles in [...]50-70 were issued to Indian Scouts, the bulk were simply sold off as surplus. In the US Navy however, the 50-70 cartridge and the guns associated with it remained in Navy use until the late 1880s.|$|R
