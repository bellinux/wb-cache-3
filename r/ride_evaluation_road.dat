The document is analyzed to show why its application to vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>evaluation</b> is strongly opposed. Alternative vertical horizontal limits for comfort are recommended in the ground vehicle ride frequency range above 1 Hz. These values are derived by correlating the absorbed power findings of Pradko and Lee with other established criteria. Special emphasis is placed on working limits in the frequency range of 1 to 10 Hz since this is the most significant area in ground vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>evaluation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this this report was to find the sources {{that led to the}} {{deviation}} between the simulation and measurement on the <b>ride</b> comfort <b>evaluation</b> of a high-speed train. This report consists of a literature study, introduction of the train where the measurement was taken on, result analysis and sensitivity test of the secondary suspension. The literature study focused on the modelling of secondary suspensions and the simulation of rail vehicles. The predicted results were compared with the measured results. Furthermore, comparison was carried out among three different secondary suspension concepts. The secondary suspensions went through a sensitivity test to see how the parameters influence the <b>ride</b> comfort <b>evaluation</b> of the rail vehicle. It was figured out that the main deviation between the simulation and the measurement was focused on a carbody where a hydraulic damper was introduced. The difference was mainly at 1. 3 Hz and between 7. 5 Hz and 9 Hz. With the main deviations figured out, the sources that might influence the <b>ride</b> comfort <b>evaluation</b> was tested. It showed that the detail of track measurement had influence on the <b>ride</b> comfort <b>evaluation.</b> More detailed measurement should be carried out if higher agreement is wanted. The secondary suspensions went through a sensitivity test. The key parameters and their influence on <b>ride</b> comfort <b>evaluation</b> was pointed out. This report can be a guidance if further tuning on the parameters of the secondary suspensions are needed...|$|R

40|$|Creative work {{is often}} {{conducted}} in distributed groups. Therefore information exchange is frequently facilitated by groupware systems. However, group work suffers from several losses such as information overload, production blocking, free <b>riding,</b> <b>evaluation</b> apprehension and production matching and yet {{has not been}} tailored to the need of creative work. In order to reduce these losses and to best support creative group processes (CGP), we propose a framework which combines a) the stages of the creative process, b) the potential losses of creative group processes and c) different media characteristics drawn from the Media Synchronicity Theory to formulate groupware design principles. We conclude that idea generation should be supported by asynchronous groupware functionality whilst idea evaluation merits from synchronous functionality...|$|R

The aim of {{this report}} {{is to develop a}} {{procedure}} for the environmental <b>evaluation</b> of <b>roads</b> in South Africa, because in the past the environmental <b>evaluation</b> of <b>road</b> projects have been on an ad hoc basis, often using different formats. The procedure is therefore to be replicable from scheme to scheme, procedure, Management and is to be incorporated into the existing road development while drawing on the principles of Integrated Environmental The first part of the report is a study of the environmental evaluation procedures adopted in the United Kingdom, United States of America and Ontario (Canada). The environmental <b>evaluation</b> of <b>roads</b> in these countries are compared under the following headings: contextual features of the environmental evaluation procedures; the planning, location and design stages of the environmental evaluation procedures, and the environmental evaluation documentation. In this comparative study, the common and unique steps and elements are identified in order to generate an 'Ideal'. The second part of the report is a study on the environmental <b>evaluation</b> of <b>roads</b> in South Africa. The administrative structure, legislation, policy and planning procedures for roads in South Africa, and Integrated Environmental Management (IEM) are discussed. Although IEM is currently been developed and road authorities are committed to IEM, the procedure still needs to be incorporated into the existing road development procedure. The third part of the report develops a procedure for the environmental <b>evaluation</b> of <b>roads</b> in South Africa. The procedure developed incorporates common and unique steps and elements generated in the 'Ideal' into the existing road development procedure. The Environmental Conservation Act and Integrated Environmental Management are also taken into account in developing the procedure. Finally, as there is at present no formal documented procedure for the environmental <b>evaluation</b> of <b>roads</b> in South Africa, it is recommended that the procedure be considered by road and environmental authorities with a view to implementing it...|$|R

In the present study, we focus on a specific process that intends to inhibit some dysfunctional behaviors occurring in team work schemes for idea generation - namely free <b>ride,</b> <b>evaluation</b> apprehension and production blocking. To that effect, we follow a twofold approach: a literature review of some aspects pertaining to creativity, reward systems and team work; and the application of an anonymous and asynchronous idea-generation system with incentives based on impact (IDEATION) in real-world situations of an R&D department. The outcomes of the proposed IDEATION process are analyzed and compared to the estimated results for verbal brainstorming, thus allowing conclusions about the effectiveness of the former. by Rafael Holzhacker.

40|$|We {{conducted}} four {{experiments to}} investigate free <b>riding,</b> <b>evaluation</b> apprehension, and production blocking as {{explanations of the}} difference in brainstorming productivity typically observed between real and nominal groups. In Experiment 1, we manipulated assessment expectations in group and individual brainstorming. Although productivity was higher when subjects worked under personal rather than collective assessment instructions, type of session still had a major impact on brainstorm-ing productivity under conditions that eliminated the temptation to free ride. Experiment 2 demon-strated that inducing evaluation apprehension reduced productivity in individual brainstorming. However, the failure to find an interaction between evaluation apprehension and type of session in Experiment 3 raises doubts about evaluation apprehension as a major explanation of the productiv-ity loss in brainstorming groups. Finally, by manipulating blocking directly, we determined in Exper-iment 4 that production blocking accounted for most of the productivity loss of real brainstorming groups. The processes underlying production blocking are discussed, and a motivational interpreta-tion of blocking is offered. In his influential book, Osborn (1957) suggested brainstorm-ing as a method of group problem solving that considerably in...|$|R

The aim is to evaluate both regulations and their flanking policy. For the <b>evaluation,</b> <b>road</b> users, road authorities and, on a small scale, representatives of various organizations were questioned. A part of the flanking policy was aimed at road users, another part at road authorities. After introduction of the RVV 1990 and the BABW, road authorities were aware of the principle, but not of the accurate contents of regulations and provisions. Following introduction of the new RVV and BABW, police, judicial bodies and road authorities had many questions. In the course of time, these questions were answered through joint consultation between various bodies. Some of the questions suggested a need to modify the RVV 1990 and BABW. In retrospect, most organizations judged the updated RVV quite favourable. On the whole, the regulations have become clearer and the distinction between the RVV and the BABW is now better defined.
