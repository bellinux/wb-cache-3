50|$|When she arrives, Toni is {{confused}} when the manager, the lecherous (and quite possibly lesbian) Madame Bauer (Maude George), asks her {{to show her}} bare legs in lieu of exhibiting her singing voice. She is hired nonetheless, having been deemed sexy enough, while still ignorant of the set-up. She refuses to wear the skimpy costume assigned and is given a white puritan-style costume instead. Before the show, the manager greets aristocrat Henri D'Avril (Lowell Sherman), giving him a menu (of sorts) of the showgirls from which to choose. When he asks if there is anyone new, he is directed to Toni's name on the program. When Toni begins her performance in earnest, the audience starts to slumber, given her conservative dress. But the manager directs a lighting change, which causes her translucent clothing become highly revealing and quite nearly see-through. Through their reaction, Toni realizes what has happened and runs off the stage where she is comforted by the wardrobe woman, <b>Rosa</b> (<b>Louise</b> Dresser), the only friend she's made since arriving in the city.|$|R
50|$|Annie is shrewd {{and smart}} and {{completely}} averse to showing any emotion, {{which comes from}} a desperate need to prove that she can cut it in a male-dominated business. She wants to show her father that she can do her job as good as, if not better than, any man. But Annie's tough exterior masks a hidden vulnerability, so she rarely allows men {{to get close to}} her. She has flings with Conor Flaherty (Seán Gleeson) (her loan-shark 'heavy') and Phil at the same time, and relishes watching them compete against each other for her affections. She later becomes close to her childhood friend Gianni di Marco (Marc Bannerman), but when they look likely to embark on a serious relationship, Annie's father drops the bombshell that Gianni may be his son. It is revealed that George had had an affair with Gianni's mother <b>Rosa</b> (<b>Louise</b> Jameson) behind <b>Rosa's</b> husband's back, and Gianni's paternity is unknown. The realisation that he could have been having an incestuous relationship with Annie devastates Gianni, and he cuts all ties with both George and Annie. Blood tests later confirm that George isn't Gianni's father, which devastates him as he has always longed for a son who would inherit the family business. Seeing her father's devastation, Annie shows some rare emotion and tells him she'd always sensed his desperation for a son and that is why she'd always strived so hard to prove her worth. Unable to deal with Annie's emotion, George leaves England in 1998, leaving Annie to run their businesses on her own.|$|R

Her relationship with George is strained, as Annie has always felt her father wanted a son, and Annie continuously tries to prove her worth to her father. George starts a romance with widow <b>Rosa</b> di Marco (<b>Louise</b> Jameson), and they eventually get engaged. It emerges {{that he had an}} affair with Rosa years before moving to Albert Square, when her husband Giuseppe was in prison, which put doubt in Rosa's mind about who fathered her son Gianni (Marc Bannerman). A DNA test confirms George is not the father. George then breaks off the engagement and goes back to New Zealand in 1998.|$|R

The ceremony takes place in 1998, but just as Terry is about to say [...] "I do", his first wife, Louise (Carol Harrison), halts the proceedings by announcing that she and Terry are still married. Irene is furious and humiliated, but Terry manages to win her round and they decide to go on their honeymoon anyway.
