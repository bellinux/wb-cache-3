40|$|The general goal of <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> is {{to support}} the community, from {{diagnostic}} laboratories to research institutions, in the execution of their work by providing reference strains and reagents and giving instructions and recommendations to individual colleagues and national and international organisations {{on a wide variety}} of issues. There are different levels of <b>reference</b> <b>centres,</b> from local to international, with an increasing package of tasks and responsibilities. Local <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> might limit activities to diagnostic confirmation by applying standard testing, while international <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> cover a wider range of activities from design, validation and harmonisation of diagnostic and reference technologies to international monitoring associated with recommendations on the global burden and distribution of leptospirosis and its prevention and control to national and international health decision makers. This chapter focusses on four major pillars constituting reference tasks in addition to the obvious provision of reference substances, i. e. Research and training, Diagnosis, Identification of Leptospira and Surveillance. Due to financial and organisational constraints, <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> are restricted in their capacity for basic research and consequently focus on applied research into various aspects of leptospirosis. They offer training, either individually or group-wise, that might vary from standard technologies to novel sophisticated methodologies, depending on the need and requests of the trainee. Most <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> are involved in the confirmation of preliminary diagnosis obtained at peripheral levels, such as local hospitals and health centres, while other major activities involve the design and validation of diagnostics, their international harmonisation and quality assurance. Identification of causative Leptospira strains (or serovars) is key to the identification of infection sources and is critical for surveillance. Hence, <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> also focus on the development, application and provision of methods that are required for unambiguous characterisation of new and recognised Leptospira strains and the maintenance of the integrity of strain collections. In line with their central role, <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> are frequently associated with local, national and/or international surveillance activities linked to an advisory role and the production of guidelines. Such surveillance activities usually comprise collation of morbidity and mortality data, signalling of outbreaks and the investigation of infection sources and risk...|$|R

40|$|In the 1990 s, the {{government}} of Senegal implemented a series of policy changes {{for the provision of}} family planning services through the public sector. A strategy to provide high quality services through <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> was adopted. This paper presents findings from a longitudinal survey of 1, 320 Senegalese women who had sought family planning services at ten public sector facilities- five <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> and five health centres. Information was collected on the quality of care they received at the time they adopted family planning. One thousand one hundred and ten of the respondents were followed up sixteen months later to ascertain their contraceptive status. The first principal finding was that attendees at <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> reported receiving relative better care than those who attended health centres. On average, clients at <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> received 4. 3 out of five units of care, compared to 3. 8 units as reported by health centre clients. Second, multivariate analyses indicated that quality of care received at the time of adopting a contraceptive has a significant influence on subsequent contraceptive use. Those who received good care were 1. 3 {{times more likely to be}} using a method than others. (Af...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} {{the rates of}} pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations and their determinants in children with chronic medical conditions. Patients and Methods Children with HIV infection, cystic fibrosis, liver transplantation and diabetes mellitus were enrolled. Physicians of regional <b>Reference</b> <b>Centres</b> for each condition, primary care paediatricians and caregivers of children provided information through specific questionnaires. For diabetes, 3 <b>Reference</b> <b>Centres</b> were included. Results Less than 25 % of children in each group received pneumococcal vaccination. Vaccination rates against influenza were 73 % in patients with HIV-infection, 90 % in patients with cystic fibrosis, 76 % in patients with liver transplantation, and ranged from 21 % to 61 % in patients with diabetes mellitus. <b>Reference</b> <b>Centres</b> rather than primary care paediatricians had {{a major role in}} promoting vaccinations. Lack of information was the main reason for missing vaccination. Awareness of the severity of pneumococcus infection by key informants of at-risk children was associated with higher vaccination rate. Conclusions Vaccination rates in children with chronic conditions were poor for pneumococcus and slightly better for influenza. Barriers to vaccination include lack of awareness, health care and organization problems. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe optimal {{management}} of rare tumours (i. e. from accurate diagnosis to management in <b>reference</b> <b>centres)</b> {{is a public}} health challenge. In 2009, the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) identified and financially supported the two expert networks for pathological and clinical diagnosis and {{management of}} soft tissue tumours. MethodsThe activities of both networks were prospectively collected using a nationwide database (rreps. org). Data describing the diagnosis management of 863 successive cases of desmoids tumours (DT) were prospectively collected from 2010 to 2013 and analysed. ResultsThe number of confirmed DT constantly improved from January 2010 to December 2013 (from 173 to 273 cases per year); the expected incidence ranged from 132 to 330 cases/year. The rate of cases diagnosed with core-needle biopsies and CTNNB 1 mutational status analysis increased from 30. 6 to 40. 7 % and from 87. 8 to 94. 1 %, respectively. The mean delay for pathological diagnosis confirmation constantly decreased from 107 to 47 d. Among the 846 adult patients, 414 (48. 9 %) patients were treated by <b>reference</b> <b>centres.</b> The rate of patients managed by <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> constantly increased with time from 36. 9 to 49. 5 % since 2010. The median management time of the referral centres constantly decreased from 440 to 67 d. ConclusionThe two expert networks worked synergistically and improved diagnosis modalities of rare desmoid tumours at a national level. The impact of management by expert networks on the outcome will be prospectively analysed in the future...|$|R
