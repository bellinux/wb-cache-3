30|$|Cho et al. [39] {{studied the}} effect of <b>retightening</b> the {{abutment}} screw on RTVs in internal connection implants under cyclic loading at 3, 10, 100, and every 20, 000 [*]cycles up to 100, 000 [*]cycles. They found {{that most of the}} decrease in RTVs occurred at 10 [*]cycles, and after that, RTVs did not change significantly. The study showed that <b>retightening</b> the abutment screw under cyclic loading resulted in superior RTVs when compared with no <b>retightening</b> [39]. However, <b>retightening</b> the abutment screw might change the shape of the abutment screw and the inner screw thread of the implant [41]. In our study, we demonstrated decreasing the RTVs after cyclic loading without <b>retightening</b> the abutment screw.|$|R
30|$|Tzenakis et al. [42] {{reported}} that <b>retightening</b> of the screw is strongly recommended, but the appropriate timing of <b>retightening</b> {{is still not}} clear. Cho et al. [39] recommended <b>retightening</b> abutment screws in the early stage of functional loading, at {{the first week in}} vivo, in internal type implants because they found no significant difference in RTVs between 20, 000 and 100, 000 [*]cycles of loading. In our study, the RTVs decreased in the early stage at 50, 000 [*]cycles of loading and then remained constant to 1, 800, 000 [*]cycles. The result can be used to estimate that the implant should also be <b>retightened</b> in the early stage of cyclic loading under a worst-case situation [26]. Seol et al. [37] stated that to minimize screw loosening, the screw should be <b>retightening</b> at 1 [*]month in vivo after constant axial displacement at 100, 000 [*]cycles of loading. Nevertheless, different implant-abutment connections, designs, and materials influence the screw preload differently. Therefore, it may be summarized that re-tightening is a theoretical recommendation based on in vitro studies that have found it beneficial in terms of RTV reduction.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} an adjustable suture (AS) experimental model {{that allows for}} tightening, loosening and <b>retightening</b> of the suture tension in trabeculectomy. METHODS: Standard trabeculectomy was performed in fifteen pig eyeballs. All pig eyes were tested twice: one test with conventional suture in both flap's corners (conventional suture group) and another test with a conventional suture at one corner and an adjustable suture in the other corner (AS group). The order in which each test was performed was defined by randomization. Intraocular pressure was measured at three time points: T 1) when the knots were tightened; T 2) when the AS was loosened or the conventional knot was removed; and T 3) when the AS was <b>retightened</b> in the AS group or five minutes after the knot removal in the conventional suture group. RESULTS: The mean Intraocular pressure was similar {{between the two groups}} at time point 1 (p= 0. 97). However, significant Intraocular pressure differences were found between eyes in the conventional and adjustable suture groups at time points 2 (12. 6 ± 4. 2 vs 16. 3 ± 2. 3 cmH 2 O, respectively, p= 0. 006) and 3 (12. 2 ± 4. 0 vs 26. 4 ± 1. 7 cmH 2 O, respectively; p= 0. 001). While the conventional technique allowed only Intraocular pressure reduction (following the knot removal; T 2 and T 3), the AS technique allowed both Intraocular pressure reduction (T 2) and elevation (T 3) through the management (loosening and <b>retightening)</b> of the suture. CONCLUSION: This experimental model provides an effective noninvasive postoperative mechanism of suture tension adjustment...|$|R

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. Development {{and testing}} of a new spinal implant-locking {{mechanism}} based on the special properties of nickel-titanium alloy. OBJECTIVE. To develop a new self-tightening locking mechanism to reduce fretting corrosion at implant junctions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. All current implant locking involves tightening of a nut against the rod and screw head to form a coupling. Particulate debris is generated, and the coupling becomes loose because of wear between the rod and locking mechanism (fretting). To avoid this fretting, a new locking mechanism with an automatic <b>retightening</b> effect based on the superelastic and shape-memory properties of nickel-titanium alloy has been developed. METHOD. The new coupling made of nickel-titanium alloy will tightly lock the rod when temperature increases to 50 °C (shape-memory effect). If fretting occurs, the coupling will further tighten itself around the rod (superelastic effect). This new coupling is mechanically tested against 4 current implant couplings. RESULTS. In axial compression, conventional couplings failed between 570 and 740 N, while the new coupling reached 800 N without loosening. In axial rotation, conventional devices failed between 1. 8 and 5. 3 Nm, while the new coupling reached 6. 5 Nm without failure. During testing, the <b>retightening</b> effect could {{be seen on the}} force versus displacement plot. CONCLUSIONS. To our knowledge, the self-tightening coupling is a new concept not previously described and is attributable to the superior superelastic effect of the new coupling. This implant coupling {{has the potential to be}} used as a very low profile system and also in nonfusion technologies in which demands on the coupling would not higher without the protection of spinal fusion. © 2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Additionally, nitinol can be used in endodontics, where nitinol files are used to clean and shape the root canals during the root canal procedure. Because of the high fatigue tolerance and flexibility of nitinol, it greatly decreases the possibility of an endodontic file breaking inside the tooth during root canal treatment, thus improving safety for the patient.|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{well-known}} American truss bridges {{built in the}} first half of the 19 th century were prestressed. Specifically, the Long, Howe, Pratt and Rider/Moulton forms, built entirely of wood or iron or using a combination of wood and iron, were prestressed. The prestressing was achieved by driving wood or iron wedges or by tightening nuts on threaded iron rods. The level of prestressing was controlled only qualitatively, probably by observing if any elements became slack when a heavy live load traversed the span. The significant advantages of prestressing were that connections were simplified, some wood tensile connections were eliminated and, if all elements did not loosen, the stiffness of a bridge was increased. 	This paper describes studies of the Eldean Bridge in Miami County, Ohio. The Eldean Bridge is a wooden Long truss, built in 1860 by James and William Hamilton. The experimental and analytical studies address the actual magnitudes of prestress forces achieved by driving wedges, the effects of prestress on the structural behavior, the loss of prestress from wood shrinkage and creep, and the need for periodic <b>retightening.</b> Also presented are studies of the Pine Bluff Bridge in Putnam County, Indiana. The Pine Bluff Bridge is a classic Howe truss, built in 1886 by Joseph Albert Britton. The studies quantify the actual magnitudes of prestress forces achieved by tightening nuts and examine the same issues as those for the Long truss.

Laser cutting, an advance non-contact processing technique, outweighs the old methods such as hotwire and milling due to the requirement of <b>retightening</b> and replacement of cutting tools with time. Orthogonal array and Factorial design are selected as a design of experiment for modelling and optimization of Laser cutting process. The range adjustment of laser machine requires knowledge of experimental design, laser cutting process and material properties, otherwise missing values generate due to unsuccessful cutting. For this reason, many universities are unable to utilize these machines effectively. It is essential to formulate a technique which allows modelling the data with some missing values, consequently, it enhance the utilization of laser machines for research and other purposes. Initially, the qualities of output characteristic were modelled by Statistical and Neural network without missing values and then by supervised and novel Semi-supervised learning algorithms with missing values. The Statistical modelling results using one and two way analysis of variance with replication were better than other data mining techniques like linear and nonlinear regression, however, {{it is difficult to}} use these methods with missing values.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Traditional {{surgical}} {{management of}} lumbosacral spondylolisthesis is technically challenging and {{is associated with}} significant complications. The advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques offers patients treatment alternatives with lower operative morbidity risk. The combination of percutaneous pedicle screw reduction and an axial presacral approach for lumbosacral discectomy and fusion offers an alternative procedure for the surgical management of low-grade lumbosacral spondylolisthesis. Case presentation Three patients who had L 5 -S 1 grade 2 spondylolisthesis and who presented with axial pain and lumbar radiculopathy were treated with a minimally invasive surgical technique. The patients-a 51 -year-old woman and two men (ages 46 and 50) -were Caucasian. Under fluoroscopic guidance, spondylolisthesis was reduced with a percutaneous pedicle screw system, resulting in interspace distraction. Then, an axial presacral approach with the AxiaLIF System (TranS 1, Inc., Wilmington, NC, USA) was used to perform the discectomy and anterior fixation. Once the axial rod was engaged in the L 5 vertebral body, further distraction of the spinal interspace {{was made possible by}} partially loosening the pedicle screw caps, advancing the AxiaLIF rod to its final position in the vertebrae, and <b>retightening</b> the screw caps. The operative time ranged from 173 to 323 minutes, and blood loss was minimal (50 mL). Indirect foraminal decompression and adequate fixation were achieved in all cases. All patients were ambulatory after surgery and reported relief from pain and resolution of radicular symptoms. No perioperative complications were reported, and patients were discharged in two to three days. Fusion was demonstrated radiographically in all patients at one-year follow-up. Conclusions Percutaneous pedicle screw reduction combined with axial presacral lumbar interbody fusion offers a promising and minimally invasive alternative for the management of lumbosacral spondylolisthesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{evidence}} for the superiority of two-implant overdentures over complete dentures in the mandible. Various anchorage devices were used to provide stability to overdentures. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare two designs of a rigid bar connecting two mandibular implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Completely edentulous patients received a new denture in the maxilla and an implant-supported overdenture in the mandible. They were randomly allocated to two groups (A or B) with regard to the bar design. A standard U-shaped bar (Dolder bar) was used connecting the two implants in a straight line. For comparison, precision attachments were soldered distal to the bar copings. Group A started the study with the standard bar (S-bar), while group B started with the attachment-bar (A-bar). After 3 months, they had to answer a questionnaire (visual analogue scale [VAS]); then the bar design was changed in both groups. After a period of another 3 months, the patients had to answer the same questions; then they had the choice to keep their preferred bar. Now the study period was extended to another year of observation, and the patients answered again the same questionnaire. In vivo force measurements were carried out with both bar types at the end of the test periods. The prosthetic maintenance service carried out during the 6 -month period was recorded for both bar types in both groups. Statistical analysis as performed with the SPSS statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: Satisfaction was high in both groups. Group B, who had entered the study with the attachment bar, gave slightly better ratings to this type for four items, while in group A, no differences were found. At the end of the 6 -month comparison period, all but one patient wished to continue to wear the attachment bar. Prosthetic service was equal in groups A and B, but the total number of interventions is significantly higher in the attachment bar. Force patterns of maximum biting were similar in both bar designs, but exhibited significantly higher axial forces in the attachment bar. CONCLUSIONS: Both bar designs provide good retention and functional comfort. High stability appears to be an important factor for the patients' satisfaction and oral comfort. Rigid retention results in a higher force impact and appears to evoke the need for the <b>retightening</b> of occlusal screws, resulting in more maintenance service...|$|R
40|$|Bolted flange joints form {{a part of}} {{pressure}} vessels and piping components, and are used extensively in the chemical, petrochemical and nuclear power industries. They are simple structures and offer the possibility of disassembly, making them attractive for connecting pressurized equipment and piping. In addition of being prone to leakage, they often require maintenance while in operation, {{in which case the}} bolts are either <b>retightened,</b> as in hot torquing, or untightened for replacement. Although such maintenance work prevents costly shutdowns, it can nevertheless expose the operator to a potential risk because altering the bolt load can produce a gasket load unbalance, which results in a local gasket contact stress drop below a critical value, causing a major leak, and putting the operator’s life at risk. This proposal addresses flange deflection variation as it investigates the flange contact stress level unbalance around the flange when the bolts are subjected to a load alteration during operation. This study may serve to help limit the degree of load increase in hot torquing or the maximum number of bolts to be replaced at a time, and to identify the flanges whose bolts cannot be replaced while they are in operation. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine a theoretical approach for identifying and analyzing the effects of initial bolt-up and pressurization on the bolted flange joints, in order to obtain a solution for bolt spacing calculation, according to different gasket contact stress variation levels. Our research breaks down into three parts. The first part, an analytical method based on the theory of circular beams resting on a linear elastic foundation, is developed to predict the circumferential distribution of gasket contact stresses. Finite element model of symmetry bolted flange joints is created for use in evaluating the analysis. Then, as a second step of this research, an approach based on the theory of a ring on a non-linear elastic foundation behavior is applied in order to get more accurate results than linear model solution. This part is applied to non-linear solution and then validated by finite element analysis. In the third part, a linear regression model is developed to propose bolt spacing calculation procedures for bolted flange joint connections. In industrial practice, this work should help in designing, maintaining and operating technical pressure vessels and piping systems...|$|R

Background: Micromovements in the implant-abutment {{connection}} {{may influence}} periimplant bone preservation, {{especially in the}} cervical region of the implant. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate and quantify these micromovements after repeated cycles of tightening and loosening the prosthetic screw using the method of three dimensional image correlation (DIC 3 D). Materials and Methods: 10 Mis® Seven internal hexagon 4. 2 x 13 implants were included in an acrylic block with similar elasticity of bone and randomly allocated into 2 groups. Mis® Titanium abutments (Standard cementing post, anti-rotational) were screwed to the implants at 30 Ncm torque and loaded up to 200 N with an universal testing machine (AG-I Shimadzu®) at a 30 º angle. Samples were then randomly allocated into two groups. Group I was submitted to one cycle of loosening and <b>retightening</b> of the abutment screw and group II was submitted to 2 consecutive cycles of loosening and tightening of the abutment screw. Each sample was loaded again and the micromovements captured with Vic- 3 D (Correlated Solutions, Inc), in three axis U, V, W, corresponding to the movements in the mesio-distal, vertical and antero-posterior directions, statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20. 0, considering independent samples t-test for group comparison and paired samples t-test for intra-group comparison. Mixed ANOVA was used to determine the interaction of screw loosening and tightening cycles and load on the micromovements of the abutments. Results: No statistically significant differences were found between groups regarding the three directions, under any load. Also, no statistically significant differences were found between micromovements before and after the screwing cycles for each group. However, absolute displacement was higher in Group II under 100 N load than in Group I after the protocol with a statistically significant difference of - 0. 168 (95 % CI, - 0. 321 to - 0. 016), t(8) =- 2. 55, p= 0. 03.

These requirements demand robust and optimized bolted joints, where a high amount of preload obtained by effective utilisation of the bolt is essential. This work presents a method, based on probabilistic design engineering, of tightening a bolt over its yield point. The bolt is utilised to its maximum in a controlled fashion. The proposed torque and angle control method {{can be used in}} modern assembly plants as well as in small workshops with less sophisticated tightening tools. This study determines an appropriate combination of snug torque and tightening angle to exceed the yield point of a bolt. Previously underestimated, or in some cases undetermined, deformations resulting in a non-elongating effect on the bolt are here covered and studied in detail. These deformations include the plastic deformation of the bearing surfaces of the fasteners and clamped parts, plastic and elastic twisting of the bolt, and plastic deformation of the nut threads. The total sum of these non-elongating parameters constitutes 16  35 % of the total deformation of the studied bolted joint, depending on how far into the plastic range the bolt is tightened. Two theoretical models for torque and angle controlled tightening, the elastic ideal-plastic and elastic-plastic models, respectively, are developed and studied. The main difference between the models is the bolted-joint behaviour after reaching the plastic region of the bolt. Both models determine the momentary and permanent elongations, final preload and torque, etc., with an excellent agreement with experimental findings. This important information on the joint behaviour has been neglected in previous research work. It is proposed that a split of the bolted joint into groups of sections exposed to tensile and compressive forces during tightening is necessary when measuring bolt elongation by means of having the measurement points at the unengaged and tension free sections of the bolt. This leads to a new definition of the spring constants and characteristics of the bolted joint, which is presented in this thesis. In addition, the spring characteristic of an M 10 bolt with external hexalobular drive (Torx) with a conical shaped flange is also covered. Additionally, a <b>retightening</b> model is also presented, where the bolted joint behaviour is described for reusing the fasteners...|$|R
