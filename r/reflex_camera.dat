5|$|On November 22, 1963, Altgens was {{scheduled}} {{to work in the}} AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the railroad overpass (the bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photograph the motorcade that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his scheduled appearance at the Dallas Trade Mart. Altgens was not assigned to work in the field that day, so he took his personal single-lens <b>reflex</b> <b>camera</b> rather than the motor-driven equipment normally used for news events.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Sony {{unveiled}} the first consumer camera {{to use a}} charge-coupled device for imaging, {{eliminating the need for}} film: the Sony Mavica. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital. In 1991, Kodak {{unveiled the}} DCS 100, the first commercially available digital single lens <b>reflex</b> <b>camera.</b> Although its high cost precluded uses other than photojournalism and professional photography, commercial digital photography was born.|$|E
25|$|David Malin pioneered {{multiple}} exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining {{the images in}} the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately. For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultra-violet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans. Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate {{the extent of the}} display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters. Terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images, making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites. It is possible to take excellent images with standard film (using ISO ratings between 100 and 400) and a single-lens <b>reflex</b> <b>camera</b> with full aperture, a fast lens (f1.4 50mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.|$|E

500|$|Albert Mayer led {{the next}} major project: the {{creation}} of a lightweight <b>reflex</b> <b>camera</b> adaptable to either handheld or studio conditions. [...] After four years of development, the Panaflex debuted in 1972. [...] A revolutionary camera that operated quietly, the Panaflex eliminated the need for a cumbersome sound blimp, and could synchronize handheld work. [...] The Panaflex also included a digital electronic tachometer and magazine motors for the take-up reel. Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express (1974) was the first motion picture filmed with the Panaflex.|$|E
500|$|During an 1861 Royal Institution {{lecture on}} colour theory, Maxwell {{presented}} the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. Thomas Sutton, {{inventor of the}} single-lens <b>reflex</b> <b>camera,</b> took the picture. He photographed a tartan ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's photographic plates were [...] insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, {{the results of this}} pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that [...] "if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue," [...] it [...] "would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved." [...] Researchers in 1961 concluded that the seemingly impossible partial success of the red-filtered exposure was due to ultraviolet light, which is strongly reflected by some red dyes, not entirely blocked by the red filter used, and within the range of sensitivity of the wet collodion process Sutton employed.|$|E
2500|$|A digital single-lens <b>reflex</b> <b>camera</b> (also {{called a}} digital SLR or DSLR) is {{a digital camera}} that {{combines}} the optics and the mechanisms of a single-lens <b>reflex</b> <b>camera</b> with a digital imaging sensor, as opposed to photographic film. The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design, light travels through the lens, then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either the viewfinder or the image sensor. The traditional alternative {{would be to have}} a viewfinder with its own lens, hence the term [...] "single lens" [...] for this design. By using only one lens, the viewfinder of a DSLR presents an image that will not differ substantially from what is captured by the camera's sensor. A DSLR differs from non-reflex single-lens digital cameras in that the viewfinder presents a direct optical view through the lens, rather than being captured by the camera's image sensor and displayed by a digital screen.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>reflex</b> <b>camera</b> is {{a camera}} that permits the {{photographer}} {{to view the}} image that will be seen through the lens, and therefore to see exactly what will be captured, contrary to viewfinder cameras where the image could be significantly different from what will be captured. A single-lens <b>reflex</b> <b>camera</b> typically uses a mirror and prism system (hence [...] "reflex", from the mirror's reflection) to accomplish this. The mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera achieves the same result by providing the photographer with a digitally captured image. The twin-lens <b>reflex</b> <b>camera</b> provides both a viewfinder image and the reflected image from the actual camera lens.|$|E
