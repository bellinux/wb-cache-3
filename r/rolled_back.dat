5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Trotsky and his {{supporters}} believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International could still be fought from within and slowly <b>rolled</b> <b>back.</b> They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which {{was intended to be}} a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters within the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.|$|E
5|$|The first rollout to Launch Pad 39A {{occurred}} on 4 September 2008. On 27 September, the Science Instrument Command and Data Handling (SIC) Unit on the Hubble Space Telescope failed. Because of its {{importance to the}} telescope, NASA postponed the launch of STS-125 on 29 September until 2009 so the failed unit could be replaced as well. Atlantis was <b>rolled</b> <b>back</b> to the Vehicle Assembly Building on 20 October.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, the Socialist Party {{candidate}} Salvador Allende won {{the presidential}} election of 1970, becoming the first democratically elected Marxist {{to become president of}} a country in the Americas. The CIA targeted Allende for removal and operated to undermine his support domestically, which contributed to a period of unrest culminating in General Augusto Pinochet's coup d'état on 11 September 1973. Pinochet consolidated power as a military dictator, Allende's reforms of the economy were <b>rolled</b> <b>back,</b> and leftist opponents were killed or detained in internment camps under the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA). The Pinochet regime would go on {{to be one of the}} leading participants in Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and state terrorism organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America that was covertly supported by the US government.|$|E

30|$|In stack update case, {{individual}} resource creation, deletion {{and update}} may be operated, {{so that there}} may be a case we cannot <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> all operations. For example, a volume is deleted successfully then a VM creation is failed, we cannot <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> because the volume is already deleted. Therefore, in stack update case, the TM server tries to <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> or <b>roll</b> forward for each OpenStack API transaction (not all API transactions) when each OpenStack API processing is failed.|$|R
5|$|MD222 was {{originally}} constructed as MD268, a number presently assigned to North Street in Elkton. The state highway was paved from Perryville to Port Deposit {{in the late}} 1910s and early 1920s. MD268 was extended north to Conowingo in the early 1930s. In 1938, MD268 was superseded when US222 was extended south from US1 in Conowingo to US40 in Perryville. US222 was widened from Perryville to Port Deposit in the early 1940s and reconstructed around 1960. The highway was relocated {{for the construction of}} I-95 interchange in the early 1960s and reconstructed south to Perryville in the late 1960s. MD222 was established in 1972 on the portion of US 222 between MD 7 and US 40. The designation was extended from Perryville to Conowingo in 1995 when US222 was <b>rolled</b> <b>back</b> to its former and present terminus at US1 in Conowingo.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was {{constructed}} {{as the original}} state road from West Friendship north to Westminster and from Westminster west to Taneytown in the early 1910s. The state highway was extended northwest to the Pennsylvania state line near Emmitsburg in the late 1910s. The portion of MD32 from Glenelg to US1 in Savage was built as MD106 in the 1920s and early 1930s. MD32 was extended south from West Friendship and assumed all of MD106 in the mid-1940s. In the mid-1950s, the section of MD32 from Westminster west to Emmitsburg was renumbered {{as an extension of}} MD97. MD 32 would later be restored to its old route through Westminster and west toward Taneytown when MD97, which is now MD140 west of Westminster, was relocated in the early 1960s. MD32 was truncated to Westminster in the late 1970s and <b>rolled</b> <b>back</b> to its present northern terminus in 2001.|$|E
5|$|When the {{expressway}} spur between MD 168 and U.S. Route 301 (now MD 648) {{was built}} between 1951 and 1954, the expressway, which {{became part of}} the Baltimore Beltway, included an at-grade intersection with MD 170 between Linthicum and Pumphrey. This junction was replaced with the present interchange in 1967; MD 170 was expanded to a divided highway {{on either side of the}} interchange in 1968. MD 170's grade separation with Stoney Run Road on the west side of the airport was built in 1982. The state highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from north of I-195 to MD 162 when the adjacent eastwest portion of MD 162 was built in 1988. MD 170 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway through its interchange with MD 100 when the single-point urban interchange was built in 1995. MD 170 had been expanded to four lanes through its interchange with MD 32 and from MD 176 through the I-195 interchange, and had its southern terminus <b>rolled</b> <b>back</b> from MD 677 to MD 175, by 1999.|$|E
