I began with energy, and a burning desire to impart to the world, in worthy language, the sense I have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost; my strength has failed under the task. Recurrence to the past, full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows, contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle, has shaken my health. Days of great suffering have followed my attempts to write, and these again produced a weakness and languor that spread their sinister influence over these notes. I dislike speaking of myself, but cannot help apologizing to the dead, and to the public, for not having executed in the manner I desired the history I engaged to give of Shelley's writings.

50|$|Psychologist Jean Piaget {{created the}} theory of {{cognitive}} development, which talks about how the mentality of children develops and matures {{as they grow older}} and further interact with society. Piaget defined four main periods of development which include the sensorimotor period, the pre-operational period, the concrete operational period and the formal operational period. The sensorimotor period takes place from birth to about two years of age and is defined as the stage in which infants learn by using their senses and motor skills. In this stage, the main goal is for an infant to learn that an object still exists even when it is not directly in sight; this is known as object permanence. During the pre-operational period, from roughly two to seven years of age, a child is much more capable of conceiving symbolic thought, but is not capable of <b>reasoning</b> <b>yet.</b> Also, children during this period cannot comprehend conservation, which is the ability to understand that different-looking objects can have the same measurable features, such as area, volume, and length. The next period, the concrete operational period, takes place from ages seven to eleven. In this stage, children are able to solve problems or mental operations, only in regards to real events or tangible objects, in their minds. The final stage is the formal operational period, taking place from age eleven through adulthood, and is the period in which individuals learn to solve problems based on hypothetical situations; during that stage, the person can think logically, symbolically and abstractly.|$|E

In this chapter we argue that to see language as only a tool for individual thought presents a limited view of its transformative power. This power, we argue, lies in the ways in which dialogue is used to interthink – that is, to think together, to build knowledge co-constructively through our shared understanding. Technology can {{play an important role in}} resourcing thinking through the provision of information, and support to provide a space to think alone.

40|$|Abstract — Decades of {{research}} have repeatedly shown that people perform poorly at estimating and understanding conditional probabilities that {{are inherent in}} Bayesian <b>reasoning</b> problems. <b>Yet</b> in the medical domain, both physicians and patients make daily, life-critical judgments based on conditional probability. Although {{there have been a}} number of attempts to develop more effective ways to facilitate Bayesian reasoning, reports of these findings tend to be inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory. For instance, the reported accuracies for individuals being able to correctly estimate conditional probability range from 6 % to 62 %. In this work, we show that problem representation can significantly affect accuracies. By controlling the amount of information presented to the user, we demonstrate how text and visualization designs can increase overall accuracies to as high as 77 %. Additionally, we found that for users with high spatial ability, our designs can further improve their accuracies to as high as 100 %. By and large, our findings provide explanations for the inconsistent reports on accuracy in Bayesian reasoning tasks and show a significant improvement over existing methods. We believe that these findings can have immediate impact on risk communication in health-related fields...|$|R
60|$|There was {{obviously}} {{a great deal of}} truth and justice in this <b>reasoning,</b> and <b>yet</b> it was a view of the subject not likely to be very agreeable to Darius, since it seemed to deny the existence of any real and valid title to the sovereignty in him. It assigned the crown, at his death, not to his son as such, but to his predecessor's grandson; for though Xerxes was both the son of Darius and the grandson of Cyrus, it was in the latter capacity that he was regarded as entitled to the crown in the argument referred to above. The doctrine was very gratifying to the pride of Atossa, for it made Xerxes the successor to the crown as her son and heir, and not as the son and heir of her husband. For this very reason it was likely to be not very gratifying to Darius. He hesitated very much in respect to adopting it. Atossa's ascendency over his mind, and her influence generally in the Persian court, was almost overwhelming, and yet Darius was very unwilling to seem, by giving to the oldest grandson of Cyrus the precedence over his own eldest son, to admit that he himself had no legitimate and proper title to the throne.|$|R

Previous literature, relying {{on the nature of}} information as a public good, concurs with the courts about the inadequacies of strict liability, but fails to devise an optimal regime. The present study aims to fill this void, and formally study optimal liability for libel taking into account the unique nature of information. We first demonstrate that a single damage measure for publication of false libelous information cannot simultaneously induce socially optimal decisions regarding both pre-publication verification and publication. We then propose a two-dimensional strict liability rule, which can induce the first-best outcome. Interestingly, the first dimension of the optimal rule, which applies when some positive level of verification is socially desirable, sets the damage award equal to the social benefit from truthful publication...|$|E

30|$|Of special {{interest}} {{is the fact that}} exercise-induced oxidative stress is exacerbated in obese populations, which has been shown in response to both acute aerobic and resistance exercises. Specifically, the total antioxidant status (TAS) in obese subjects decreased by 8.6 and 17.6  % in response to a single bout of aerobic and resistance exercises, respectively, whereas increases were observed in normal-weight individuals [50]. Furthermore, greater thiobarbituric reactive acid substances (TBARS), a marker of systemic oxidative stress, and lipid hydroperoxide (PEROX) increases were noted in obese subjects [50, 51]. Additionally, despite similar increases in PEROX levels in response to acute aerobic exercise in healthy obese and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), those with T 2 DM demonstrated greater decreases in TAS following exercise [70], suggesting a synergistic effect of metabolic dysfunction in further diminishing oxidative stress resistance. The authors suggested these outcomes {{may be the result of}} decreased availability of plasma vitamins C and E, elevated systolic blood pressure which may exacerbate vascular production of ROS during exercise, or greater mechanical and metabolic stress imposed by excessive adiposity; however, definitive <b>reasoning</b> remains <b>yet</b> to be elucidated.

40|$|Humans {{have used}} {{arguments}} for defending or refuting statements {{long before the}} creation of logic as a specialized discipline.

Yet in the justification of the correctness and adequacy of these rules commonsense reasoning must necessarily be used, and in such a way its foundational role is recognized.

40|$|Central to most {{scientific}} and engineering tasks- design, diagnosis, analogy and design rationale capture- are descriptions of {{a device that}} capture its salient features with respect to how it works.

While current reasoning systems are effective users of qualitative abstractions, future systems must also be able to create these abstractions. We take the perspective that a device works by constructing a topology of interactions between quantities. To construct a parsimonious description of an interaction topologywe introduce the concept of a critical abstraction- a most abstract description of a topology relative to a set of queries, that preserves the link between the individual mechanisms of a device, and the behaviors mentioned in the queries. We demonstrate critical abstraction for equational descriptions of interactions. We present a generative modelling technique for computing critical topologies using only the mathematical properties of the interaction topology representation. The use of causal connections during all phases of abstraction highlights the central link between causality and what is interesting. 1...|$|R
