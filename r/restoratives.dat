These 17 power-ups range from increasing damage, such as spinning fireballs around his head, to providing invincibility, restoring health, increasing speed, etc. Some of these power-ups last for only a short time. Other than heads, the player can also find health <b>restoratives,</b> extra points, and extra lives throughout the levels.

Players take control of two characters with similar gameplay abilities. Navigation takes place through hand-drawn 2D side-scrolling environments reminiscent of Japanese artwork of the period, and can enter towns to talk with non-playable characters (NPCs) and buy items such as health <b>restoratives</b> and accept quests. An additional cooking element allows the characters to cook meals using materials gathered during exploration: meals grant temporary character boosts, and fill a [...] "fullness" [...] meter that limits how much food a character can eat.|$|E

Through this overview of the existing knowledge base regarding why and for whom <b>restorative</b> procedures work, we draw attention to gaps in the <b>restorative</b> justice literature. We highlight the need for more focused research in understudied areas-in particular, we discuss the need for further development of experimental methods in <b>restorative</b> justice research-which will enable <b>restorative</b> justice scholars to develop more effective procedures that complement existing legal processes...|$|R

He was awarded a gold medal by the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (later renamed the Royal National Lifeboat Institution) in 1835, for his efforts in the rescue of a boat during a gale. Angharad Llwyd, writing when Williams was at St Mary's, noted that [...] "this benevolent gentleman, aided by his lady, ever alert in the cause of humanity, are generally among the first on the shore, in case of accident, well supplied with <b>restoratives,</b> and other necessaries, to comfort and protect the suffering mariners." [...] The artist Sir Kyffin Williams (1918–2006) was a great-grandson of James and his wife Frances. At his request, a memorial to them was put up on the south wall of the chapel.

Blue Horse {{was one of}} the major leaders of Colonel Fred T. Cummins Indian Congress and Wild West Show. Dr. N.W.

The squaw of Blue Horse tumbled over in a faint one afternoon and she was carried into her tepee. The Indians said she was dead. I applied <b>restoratives</b> and in a little while she was alright. Now Blue Horse is a big civil chief in the Sioux Nation, and his wife is of some consequence in Sioux society. So when the Indians saw her come back to life after apparent death, they gave me credit for having worked a miracle. Blue Horse himself believed it and circulated the story.” Blue Horse was so grateful that Dr. Wilson was conferred an honorary degree of medicine man and given the name of “He-Wakes-Them-Up” in a great ceremony at the council house.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades, <b>restorative</b> justice has emerged in {{numerous}} localities {{around the world as}} an accepted approach to responding to crime. This article, which stems from a doctoral study on the history of <b>restorative</b> justice, provides a critical analysis of accepted histories of <b>restorative</b> practices. It revisits the celebrated historical texts of the <b>restorative</b> justice movement, and re-evaluates their contribution to the emergence of <b>restorative</b> justice measures. It traces the emergence of the term 'restorative justice', and reveals that it emerged in much earlier writings than is commonly thought to be the case by scholars in the <b>restorative</b> justice field. It also briefly considers some 'power struggles' in relation to producing an accepted version of the history of <b>restorative</b> justice, and scholars' attempts to 'rewrite history' to align with current views on <b>restorative</b> justice. Finally, this article argues that some histories of <b>restorative</b> justice selectively and inaccurately portray key figures from the history of criminology as <b>restorative</b> justice supporters. This, it is argued, gives <b>restorative</b> justice a false lineage and operates to legitimise the widespread adoption of <b>restorative</b> justice around the globe...|$|R

I here examined how the idea of "justice" is understood in these <b>restorative</b> theories. I will also show how the <b>restorative</b> theories advocates are identifying their idea of "justice" and how it differs from the concept of "justice" in other contemporary theories of justice, to consequently investigate the significance of the new alternative idea of "justice. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the enthusiasm}} with which <b>restorative</b> justice has been embraced by many, {{and despite the}} {{increasingly}} widespread introduction of <b>restorative</b> approaches into youth justice systems in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, there remains a lack of clarity and some strong debate about the exact definition and nature of <b>restorative</b> justice.

40|$|During {{the last}} quarter-century, <b>restorative</b> justice {{has emerged as}} a widely {{utilised}} response to crime in Western nations. This article, which stems from a Foucauldian genealogy of <b>restorative</b> justice, argues that its embeddedness within the discourse of ‘‘empowerment’’ renders <b>restorative</b> justice a politically acceptable response to crime. ‘‘Empowerment’’, it is argued, is one of many conditions of emergence of <b>restorative</b> justice.

This article seeks to problematise the taken-for-granted nature of this discourse. It argues that the discourse of ‘‘empowerment’’ produces <b>restorative</b> justice subjects who are increasingly governed and governable. As ‘‘empowering’’ <b>restorative</b> practices are targeted towards ‘‘disempowered’’ individuals and communities, concerns are raised about the potential of <b>restorative</b> justice to disproportionately impact upon socially marginalised populations and to increase social exclusion...|$|R

40|$|The chapter {{examines}} <b>restorative</b> justice {{literature and}} research {{in order to assess}} whether the victim is indeed central in the <b>restorative</b> justice discourse. Looking at the origins of both <b>restorative</b> justice and the victimological movement, similarities can be discerned, but generally <b>restorative</b> justice did spring from offender-oriented movement such as communitarianism, and diversionary approaches. The relation between <b>restorative</b> justice and criminal justice (the latter being offender-oriented), the implementation of <b>restorative</b> justice within offender-oriented organizations and offender-oriented research have casted doubt on the victim centrality. <b>Restorative</b> justice evaluations generally show that victims are satisfied with their participation in <b>restorative</b> justice, voicing various reasons why they decided to participate. The flexibility of the process so it can be adapted to their needs and expectations was evaluated as important. Restoration may entail a sense of regaining control and being recognized as a victim. The complementary role between <b>restorative</b> justice and criminal justice can be important, with criminal justice offering a formal response and <b>restorative</b> justice an opportunity to voice concerns and questions.
