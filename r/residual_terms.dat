40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the response of this system/scheme in terms of stability in presence of explicitly treated <b>residual</b> <b>terms,</b> as it inevitably occurs in the reality of NWP. This sudy is restricted to the impact of thermal and baric <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> (metric <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> linked to the orography are not considered here). It is shown that conversely to what occurs with Hydrostatic Primitive Equations, the choice of the prognostic variables used to solve the system in time is of primary importance for the robustness with Euler Equations. For an optimal choice of prognostic variables, unconditionnally stable schemes can be obtained (with respect to the length of the time-step), but only for a smaller range of reference states than in the case of Hydrostatic Primitive Equations. This study also indicates that: (i) vertical coordinates based on geometrical height and on mass behave similarly in terms of stability for the problems examined here, and (ii) hybrid coordinates induce an intrinsic instability, the practical importance of which is however not completely elucidated in the theoretical context of this paper.

40|$|The {{activity}} coefficient models {{that have been}} proposed for correlation of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) of polymer solutions are often based on an ad-hoc coupling of the combinatorial (free-volume) and <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> available in the literature. The goal of this work is to present {{a comparison of the}} performances of all the possible models that can be obtained based on some of the best and most used combinatorial (free volume) and <b>residual</b> <b>terms.</b> The combinatorial terms studied here are the Entropic free volume, p-free volume and Freed FH and the <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> the NRF, UNIQUAC and Wu-NRTL along with a segment based UNIQUAC term, sUNIQUAC, here proposed for the first time. All the models investigated have two adjustable parameters and a two-parameter Flory-Huggins model was used as benchmark for comparative purposes. A database of 70 VLE data systems was used to evaluate the different models. It is shown that models based on the p-free volume combinatorial term with a segment based residual part derived from either the NRTL or UNIQUAC models can provide an excellent correlation of VLE data for polymer systems and can describe a wide range of molecular weights using a single pair of interaction parameters. The NRF based models are shown to suffer from some deficiencies that limit their application to dilute solutions...|$|E

Using a mesh-dependent weight, the <b>residual</b> <b>term</b> {{is bounded in}} a sharply localized fashion. In specific situations the pollution term may also be bounded by computable residual estimators. On nonconvex polygonal and polyhedral domains in two and three space dimensions, we may choose estimators for the pollution term which do not employ specific knowledge of corner singularities and which are valid on domains with cracks. The finite element mesh is only required to be simplicial and shape-regular, so that highly graded and unstructured meshes are allowed. 1. Introduction an...|$|R
