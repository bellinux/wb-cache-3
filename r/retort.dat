5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} of a red brick <b>retort,</b> built in 1924, when it was {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them.

40|$|This paper mainly {{describes}} the world’s commercial oil shale <b>retorting</b> technologies, including lump oil shale and particulate oil shale <b>retorting</b> technologies. Fushun Type <b>Retorting,</b> Petrosix <b>Retorting,</b> and Kiviter <b>Retorting</b> are illustrated as {{the examples of}} lump oil shale retorting; Galoter <b>Retorting</b> and Alberta Taciuk Processing(ATP) are as the particulate oil shale <b>retorting.</b> Comparison of different <b>retorting</b> technologies are discussed. I. Underground <b>Retorting</b> Underground <b>retorting,</b> also called in-situ <b>retorting,</b> is the technology for processing oil shale in-situ underground; it is usually carried out by introducing air to burn and pyrolyze the underground oil shale layer to obtain shale oil. This process obviates the problems of mining, handling, and disposing of large quantity of material, which occurs for aboveground <b>retorting.</b> In-situ <b>retorting</b> offers the potential of recovering the deep buried oil shale. The true in-situ method is not successful, because oil shale lacks permeability, thus hindering the inflow of air and outflow of produced oil and gases, also lowering the heat transfer into the oil shale deposit. Modified in-situ <b>retorting</b> is a better approach, to solve the permeability problem: an uppe...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, the Fushun Mining Group {{operated}} the largest shale oil plant in the world, consisting of seven <b>retorting</b> units with 20 <b>retorts</b> in each unit, for a total 140 sets of Fushun type <b>retorts.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion {{patented}} {{a process}} to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical <b>retort</b> style smelter. His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient. Champion's process was used through 1851.|$|E
5|$|Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a {{separate}} furnace, the oil shale gas from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another advantage {{is that there is}} no limit on the smallest particles that the <b>retort</b> can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is that more water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} {{technologies such}} as the Paraho Direct are thermally efficient, since combustion of char on the spent shale and heat recovered from the shale ash and evolved gases can provide all the heat requirements of the <b>retort.</b> These technologies can achieve 80-90% of Fischer assay yield. Two well-established shale oil industries use internal combustion technologies: Kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in Estonia since the 1920s, {{and a number of}} Chinese companies operate Fushun process facilities.|$|E

50|$|The {{major oil}} shale {{industry}} in China is the Fushun Mining Group. Several other coal and {{oil companies have}} expanded their activities into oil shale extraction. , there were seven shale <b>retorting</b> plants with a total production of 650,000 tonnes of shale oil. These plants located in Fushun, Huadian, Wangqing, Beipiao, Longkou, Yaojie, and Dongning. Most of them use Fushun <b>retorts</b> or modified Fushun <b>retorts.</b>|$|R

A <b>retort</b> builder like red-rumped swallow starts with an open cup, closes it, and then builds the entrance tunnel. Winkler and Sheldon propose {{that the development of}} closed nests reduced competition between males for copulations with the females. Since mating occurs inside the nest, the difficulty of access means other males are excluded. This reduction in competition permits the dense breeding colonies typical of the Delichon martins.|$|E

At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, {{in order to try to}} repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E
5|$|Alchemy {{was already}} well {{established}} before {{the rise of}} Islam. It {{was based on the}} belief that substances were made up of the four Aristotelian elements, fire, earth, air, and water in different proportions. Alchemists supposed that gold was the noblest metal, and that other metals formed a series down to the basest, such as lead. They believed, too, that a fifth element, the elixir, could transform a base metal into gold. Jabir ibn Hayyan (8th–9th centuries) wrote on alchemy, based on his own experiments. He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue to be used when alchemy had transformed into chemistry. Ibn Hayyan identified many substances including sulphuric and nitric acids. He described processes such as sublimation, reduction and distillation. He made use of equipment such as the alembic and the <b>retort</b> stand.|$|E

5|$|The {{shale oil}} {{industry}} at Kohtla-Järve and Kiviõli was redeveloped. In 1945, the first tunnel kiln was restored, {{and by the}} end of the 1940s four tunnel kilns located in Kiviõli and Kohtla-Nõmme had been restored. German prisoners of war contributed most of the labour. Between 1946 and 1963, 13Kiviter-type retorts were built in Kohtla-Järve and eight in Kiviõli. In 1947, a pilot Galoter <b>retort</b> was built at the Ilmarine engineering plant in Tallinn. This unit, in operation until 1956, was capable of processing 2.5tonnes of oil shale per day and was used for modelling the next generation of commercial-scale retorts. The first Galoter-type commercial-scale pilot retorts were built at Kiviõli in 1953 and 1963 with capacities of 200 and 500tonnes of oil shale per day, respectively. The first of these retorts closed in 1963 and the second in 1981. The Narva Oil Plant, annexed to the Eesti Power Station and operating two Galoter-type 3,000-tonnes-per day retorts, was commissioned in 1980. Started as a pilot plant, the process of converting it to a commercial-scale plant took about 20years.|$|E

25|$|Finally, infant {{formulas}} are {{heat treated}} {{to maintain the}} bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either <b>retort</b> sterilization or high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then spray drying would be required in addition. <b>Retort</b> sterilization is a traditional <b>retort</b> sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118°C. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2–3 seconds) treatment at 142°C. Because of the short time used, there is little protein denaturation, but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.|$|E

30|$|Pyrolysis {{characteristics}} of a North Korean oil shale and its pyrolysates were investigated in this paper. The pyrolysis experiments were conducted below 600 °C at a heating rate of 10, 15, 20 and 25 °C/min, respectively. The kinetics data were calculated using both integral and differential methods with the assumption of first order kinetics. The {{results show that the}} averaged oil content of the North Korean oil shale is about 12.1 wt% and its heat value is 13, 400 kJ/kg. The oil yields at different <b>retorting</b> temperatures show that the higher the <b>retorting</b> temperature the greater the oil and <b>retorting</b> gas yields. The optimal <b>retorting</b> temperature for the North Korean oil shale is about 500 °C. The properties of the North Korean shale oil including density, viscosity, flash point and freezing point are found to be relatively low compared with those of shale oil from FuShun, China. The gasoline fraction, diesel fraction and heavy oil fraction account for 11.5 wt%, 41.5 wt% and 47 wt%, respectively. The major pyrolysis gases are CH 4 (the most abundant), H 2, CO 2, H 2 S, CO, and C 2 –C 5 hydrocarbons. The heat value of <b>retorting</b> gas is more than 900 kJ/mol, and the <b>retorting</b> gas has high sulfur content.|$|R

40|$|While {{oil shale}} has the {{potential}} to provide a substantial fraction of our nation's liquid fuels for many decades, cost and environmental acceptability are significant issues to be addressed. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) examined a variety of oil shale processes between the mid 1960 s and the mid 1990 s, starting with <b>retorting</b> of rubble chimneys created from nuclear explosions [1] and ending with in-situ <b>retorting</b> of deep, large volumes of oil shale [2]. In between, it examined modified-in-situ combustion <b>retorting</b> of rubble blocks created by conventional mining and blasting [3, 4], in-situ <b>retorting</b> by radio-frequency energy [5], aboveground combustion <b>retorting</b> [6], and aboveground processing by hot-solids recycle (HRS) [7, 8]. This paper reviews various types of processes in both generic and specific forms and outlines some of the tradeoffs for large-scale development activities. Particular attention is given to hot-recycled-solids processes that maximize yield and minimize oil shale residence time during processing and true in-situ processes that generate oil over several years that is more similar to natural petroleum...|$|R
