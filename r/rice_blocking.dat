40|$|Understanding how {{metabolic}} reactions {{translate the}} genome of an organism into its phenotype {{is a grand}} challenge in biology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) statistically connect genotypes to phenotypes, without any recourse to known molecular interactions, whereas a molecular mechanistic description ties gene function to phenotype through gene regulatory networks (GRNs), protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and molecular pathways. Integration of different regulatory information levels of an organism is expected to provide a good way for mapping genotypes to phenotypes. However, the lack of curated metabolic model of <b>rice</b> is <b>blocking</b> the exploration of genome-scale multi-level network reconstruction. Here, we have merged GRNs, PPIs and genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) approaches into a single framework for rice via omics&amp;rsquo; regulatory information reconstruction and integration. Firstly, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model, containing 4, 462 function genes, 2, 986 metabolites involved in 3, 316 reactions, and compartmentalized into ten subcellular locations. Furthermore, 90, 358 pairs of protein-protein interactions, 662, 936 pairs of gene regulations and 1, 763 microRNA-target interactions were integrated into the metabolic model. Eventually, a database was developped for systematically storing and retrieving the genome-scale multi-level network of rice.

40|$|To {{localize}} wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ESTs on chromosomes, 882 homoeologous group 6 -specific ESTs {{were identified}} by physically mapping 7965 singletons from 37 cDNA libraries on 146 chromosome, arm, and sub-arm aneuploid and deletion stocks. The 882 ESTs were physically mapped to 25 regions (bins) flanked by 23 deletion breakpoints. Of the 5154 restriction fragments detected by 882 ESTs, 2043 (loci) were localized to group 6 chromosomes and 806 were mapped on other chromosome groups. The number of loci mapped was greatest on chromosome 6 B and least on 6 D. The 264 ESTs that detected orthologous loci on all three homoeologs using one restriction enzyme were used to construct a consensus physical map. The physical distribution of ESTs was uneven on chromosomes with a tendency toward higher densities in the distal halves of chromosome arms. About 43 % of the wheat group 6 ESTs identified rice homologs upon comparisons of genome sequences.

40|$|ABSTRACT Water {{availability}} for {{cultivation of}} irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) is decreasing worldwide. Therefore, new technologies {{are needed to}} grow rice under aerobic conditions, {{in order to produce}} rice grains without yield losses and with lower water consumption. This study aimed at determining the best combination of management options for producing upland <b>rice.</b> A randomized <b>blocks</b> design, in a factorial scheme, was used. The treatments consisted of a combination of five rice cultivars (BRS Caçula, BRS Serra Dourada, BRS Primavera, BRS Sertaneja and BRS Esmeralda) with two compaction pressures in the seed furrow (25 kPa or 126 kPa), two types of seed treatment (with or without pesticide) and two types of N management (all at sowing or all at topdressing). Applying N at sowing instead of at topdressing produced higher grain yield in the no-tillage system (NTS). Under this system, upland rice genotypes show higher grain yield with higher compaction pressure. Seed treatment with pesticide provided greater grain yield for the BRS Sertaneja, in NTS, and for all genotypes in the conventional tillage system (CTS). BRS Esmeralda, in NTS, and BRS Esmeralda and BRS Primavera, in CTS, were the most productive genotypes. Moreover, in NTS, the application of N at sowing and the compaction pressure on the seed furrow are important for increasing upland rice grain yield. In CTS, seed treatment is important to improve upland rice grain yield...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genome-wide {{duplication}} is ubiquitous during {{diversification of}} the angiosperms, and gene duplication {{is one of}} the most important mechanisms for evolutionary novelties. As an indicator of functional evolution, the divergence of expression patterns following duplication events has drawn great attention in recent years. Using large-scale whole-genome microarray data, we systematically analyzed expression divergence patterns of <b>rice</b> genes from <b>block,</b> tandem and dispersed duplications. Results We found a significant difference in expression divergence patterns for the three types of duplicated gene pairs. Expression correlation is significantly higher for gene pairs from block and tandem duplications than those from dispersed duplications. Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between the expression divergence and the synonymous substitution rate which is an approximate proxy of divergence time. Thus, both duplication types and divergence time influence the difference in expression divergence. Using a linear model, we investigated the influence of these two variables and found that the difference in expression divergence between block and dispersed duplicates is attributed largely to their different divergence time. In addition, the difference in expression divergence between tandem and the other two types of duplicates is attributed to both divergence time and duplication type. Conclusion Consistent with previous studies on Arabidopsis, our results revealed a significant difference in expression divergence between the types of duplicated genes and a significant correlation between expression divergence and synonymous substitution rate. We found that the attribution of duplication mode to the expression divergence implies a different evolutionary course of duplicated genes. </p...|$|R
40|$|The central {{structure}} of the symbiotic association between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is the fungal arbuscule that delivers minerals to the plant. Our earlier transcriptome analyses identified two half-size ABCG transporters that displayed enhanced mRNA levels in mycorrhizal roots. We now show specific transcript accumulation in arbusculated cells of both genes during symbiosis. Presently, arbuscule-relevant factors from monocotyledons have not been reported. Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (<b>rice)</b> ABCG transporters <b>blocked</b> arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str 1 and str 2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes. This phenotypic resemblance and phylogenetic analysis suggest functional conservation of STR 1 and STR 2 across the angiosperms. Malnutrition of the fungus underlying limited arbuscular growth was excluded {{by the absence of}} complementation of the str 1 phenotype by wild-type nurse plants. Furthermore, plant AM signaling was found to be intact, as arbuscule-induced marker transcript accumulation was not affected in str 1 mutants. Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR 1 and STR 2. However, full arbuscule development in the strigolactone biosynthesis mutants d 10 and d 17 suggested strigolactones to be unlikely substrates of STR 1 /STR 2. Interestingly, rice STR 1 is associated with a cis-natural antisense transcript (antiSTR 1). Analogous to STR 1 and STR 2, at the root cortex level, the antiSTR 1 transcript is specifically detected in arbusculated cells, suggesting unexpected modes of STR 1 regulation in rice.

30|$|LD {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} for the all the marker pairs and 32 % of the pairs were significant (P[*]>[*] 0.05). The number of significant intra- and inter-chromosomal LD pairs varied on different chromosomes. Chromosome 2 had {{the highest number of}} significant intra- and inter-chromosomal LD pairs, whereas chromosome 7 had the lowest number. There was a reduction in number of significant LD pairs as the interval distances between marker pairs increased. The LD plotted against r 2 and LD plotted against cM is presented in Fig.  2. There was a sharp decline in LD decay for the linked markers at 5 - 20  cM. Overall, the r 2 varied from 0.005 to 0.31, with an average of 0.03. Significant pairs of linked loci (r 2 [*]>[*] 0.2) showed an average distance of 25  cM, indicating the presence of a higher number of significant LD blocks in this set of genotypes. The larger LD blocks within a germplasm collection are highly useful in genome-wide association mapping. There are numerous reports of LD patterns in rice. Olsen et al. (2006) and Mather et al. (2007) reported LD decay occurring at about 1  cM distance, whereas others reported LD decay at 20 – 30  cM distances using SSR markers (Agrama et al. 2007; Agrama and Eizenga, 2008; Jin et al. 2010; Vannirajan et al. 2012). Several factors such as nature of pollination, geographic isolation, evolutionary pattern, mutation, selection pressure and genetic drift influence the size and number of LD blocks (Gupta et al. 2005). In a predominantly self-pollinated crop species such as <b>rice,</b> larger LD <b>blocks</b> extending over several cM are usually expected (Abdurakhmonov and Abdukarimov, 2008); also, LD varied among different subspecies of rice. The extent of LD in the indica subspecies was lesser than in temperate japonica or tropical japonica (Khush, 1997; Garris et al. 2005; Mather et al. 2007).|$|R

In this study, we compared the biosynthesis, structural diversity, in vitro and in planta activities of orfamides {{produced by}} rhizosphere-derived Pseudomonas protegens and related Pseudornonas species. Genetic characterization together with chemical identification revealed that the main orfamide compound produced by the P. protegens group is orfamide A, while the related strains Pseudomonas sp.

The structures of these two CLPs were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Mutagenesis and complementation showed that orfamides determine the swarming motility of parental Pseudomonas sp. strain CMR 5 c and their production was regulated by luxR type regulators. Orfamide A and orfamide B differ only in the identity of a single amino acid, while orfamide B and orfamide G share the same amino acid sequence but differ in length of the fatty acid part. The biological activities of orfamide A, orfamide B, and orfamide G were compared in further bioassays. The three compounds were equally active against Magnaporthe oryzae on rice, against Rhizoctonia solani AG 4 -HGI in in vitro assays, and caused zoospore lysis of Phytophthora and Pythium. Furthermore, we could show that orfamides decrease blast severity in <b>rice</b> plants by <b>blocking</b> appressorium formation in M. oryzae. Taken all together, our study shows that orfamides produced by P protegens and related species have potential in biological control of a broad spectrum of fungal plant pathogens...|$|R
