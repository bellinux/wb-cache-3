5|$|Custer {{used his}} 2nd and 3rd (Capehart's) brigades {{for two more}} {{ineffective}} attacks. Finally, Custer made a rare night attack using his entire division. Strong moonlight reduced the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> lost or misidentifying friendly and enemy soldiers. The night attack was successful, and Custer's division captured 24 to 30 artillery pieces. About 1,000 Confederates were taken prisoner, and 150 to 200 wagons were captured.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is thought}} to reduce the overall <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> both <b>getting</b> cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is {{particularly}} beneficial for colorectal cancer (CRC).

5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed footwear such as boots and shoes {{can reduce the}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur when someone is gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E
5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an induced abortion {{can increase the}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> breast cancer. This hypothesis {{is at odds with}} mainstream scientific opinion and is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer over time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) {{tries to help}} Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{understand}} how diabetes affects him after Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) told Tracy that he is at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> diabetes. Kenneth tells him a story of how a wicked witch will come and take him away {{if he continues to}} consume his unhealthy eating habits but Tracy does not believe him. Tracy gets disgusted when Kenneth tries to scare him by dressing as a witch but suddenly Jenna comes running in screaming and looking like a witch complete with a broomstick in hand. This scares both Kenneth and Tracy who fearfully vows to change his eating habits immediately.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Baltic Front {{commenced}} their {{offensive in}} the early morning of 17 September. After the German II Army Corps were subjected to an artillery barrage of 132,500 shells, the three leading rifle corps crossed the Emajõgi River in the 25km long section of the front east of Tartu and breached the defence. The 2nd Shock Army forced its way through to the German divisional headquarters and artillery positions. Only Kampfgruppe Rebane, stationed near Tartu, held their frontage, albeit with heavy losses. Army Detachment Narwa and XXVIII Corps, the northernmost elements of Army Group North, were at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> encircled and destroyed. General Ferdinand Schörner ordered II Army Corps to abandon the defence of the Emajõgi and to move quickly around the northern tip of Lake Võrtsjärv to Latvia.|$|E

Overtreatment is also costing us between $ 600 and $ 800 billion annually. What are the factors that encourage the delivery of unnecessary care?

Men have a 20% <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> the infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected woman. The risk for men that have sex with men (MSM) is higher.

Part <b>of</b> {{the reason why the}} area in Acapulco is often entrenched in violence is because the port city is treasured by drug traffickers due to its corruption, its long and jagged coastline, and the high amount of boat traffic. Hence, Acapulco is considered an ideal place to carry out drug trafficking operations, where smugglers use speedboats to move large sums of cocaine from South America northward.|$|R
50|$|Low to {{moderate}} evidence indicates it decreases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> one's <b>getting</b> influenza by 1% to 12% in those exposed.

Also there was no evidence <b>of</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> person-to-person spread of the influenza virus.The evidence for a benefit in preventing influenza is weak in children, with concerns of publication bias in the literature.|$|R
25|$|A 1994 {{systematic}} review found that BCG reduces the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> TB by about 50%.

25|$|Trichomoniasis (trich) is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. About 70% {{of women and men}} do not have symptoms when infected. When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex.

40|$|Identification of {{non-linear}} finite {{impulse response}} (N-FIR) models is studied. In particular {{the selection of}} model structure, i. e., to find the contributing input time lags, is examined. A common method, exhaustive search among models with all possible combinations of the input time lags, has some undesired drawbacks, as a tendency that the minimization algorithm gets stuck in local minima and heavy computations. To avoid these drawbacks {{we need to know}} the model structure prior to identifying a model. In this report we show that a statistical method, the multivariate analysis of variance, is a good alternative to exhaustive search in the identification of the structure of non-linear FIR-models. We can reduce the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> an erroneous model structure due to the non-convexity of the minimization problems, reduce the computation time needed and also get a good estimate of how far we can enhance the fit of the desired model...|$|R
25|$|Zanamivir is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of infections caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses, but in otherwise-healthy individuals, benefits overall appear to be small.

The combination of diagnostic uncertainty, the risk for virus strain resistance, possible side effects and financial cost outweigh the small benefits of zanamivir for the prophylaxis and treatment of healthy individuals.|$|R
