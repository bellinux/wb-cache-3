5000|$|A {{particularly}} simple case of {{the word}} problem for groups and the isomorphism problem for groups asks if a finitely presented group is the trivial group. This {{is known to be}} intractable in general, even though there is a finite sequence of elementary Tietze transformations taking the presentation to the trivial presentation if and only if the group is trivial. A special case is that of [...] "balanced presentations", those finite presentations with equal numbers of generators and <b>relators.</b> For these groups, there is a conjecture that the required transformations are quite a bit simpler (in particular, do not involve adding or removing <b>relators).</b> If one allows taking the set of <b>relators</b> to any Nielsen equivalent set, and one allows conjugating the <b>relators,</b> then one gets an equivalence relation on ordered subsets of a <b>relators</b> of a finitely presented group. The Andrews-Curtis conjecture is that the <b>relators</b> of any balanced presentation of the trivial group are equivalent to a set of trivial <b>relators,</b> stating that each generator is the identity element.|$|R

The result {{shows that there}} are two kinds of discourse <b>relators</b> in Sundanese which are grammatically and lexically characterized. The grammatically characterized discourse <b>relators</b> are reference, substitution, ellipsis, and conjunctive relation. The latter comprises several types and sub-types. Meanwhile, the lexically characterized discourse <b>relators</b> consist of six kinds: repetition, synonym, antonym, hyponym, mernym, and collocation. This latter kind also includes several types and sub-types. The typically unique discourse <b>relators</b> in Sundanese are cataphoraic pronoun of intra-phrase, inter-sentence, and inter-paragraph. The inter-paragraph cataphoraic pronoun can be used if there is not a new topic between the refernce and the referred pronoun. In Sundanese, in order restate something previously atated, we can use the repetition of the same form or the repplacement with co-referential form followed by demonstratives ieu 'this, eta 'that close', and itu 'that far'.

5000|$|A {{presentation}} of a group {{is a set of}} elements that generate the group (all group elements are products of finitely many generators), together with [...] "relators", products of generators that give the identity element. The free abelian group with basis B has a presentation in which the generators are the elements of B, and the <b>relators</b> are the commutators of pairs of elements of B. Here, the commutator of two elements x and y is the product x&minus;1y&minus;1xy; setting this product to the identity causes xy to equal yx, so that x and y commute. More generally, if all pairs of generators commute, then all pairs of products of generators also commute. Therefore, the group generated by this presentation is abelian, and the <b>relators</b> of the presentation form a minimal set of <b>relators</b> needed to ensure that it is abelian.|$|R
