The <b>renal</b> <b>osmotic</b> stress-induced cotransporter (ROSIT), a new {{putative}} {{member of a}} family of organic solute transporters, is highly expressed in the kidney. Our in situ hybridization data now reveal that large amounts of ROSIT mRNA {{can be found in the}} S 3 segment of the proximal tubule.

Because the S 3 segment is the major site of damage in the post-ischemic kidney, we evaluated alterations in ROSIT mRNA expression after ischemic acute tubular necrosis. <b>Renal</b> <b>osmotic</b> stress-induced cotransporter mRNA levels were already decreased eight hours post-ischemia. At seven days post-ischemia, ROSIT mRNA reappeared in a mosaic pattern in the regenerating S 3 segment, being fully expressed three weeks after the insult except for focal areas.

40|$|The Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) mediates Na+-retaining {{action of}} aldosterone. It is highly {{expressed}} in the distal nephron which is submitted to intense variations of the extracellular fluid tonicity generated by the corticopapillary gradient. We previously showed that posttranscriptional events control renal MR abundance. Here, we find that hypertonicity increases expression of the mRNA-destabilizing protein Tis 11 b, a member of tristetraprolin/ZFP 36 family, and thereby decreases MR expression in renal KC 3 AC 1 cells. The 3 '-Untranslated region (3 '-UTR) of human and mouse MR mRNA containing several highly conserved Adenylate/Uridylate-Rich Elements (ARE), were cloned downstream of a reporter gene. Luciferase activities of full length or truncated Luc- 3 '-UTR mutants were drastically reduced when cotransfected with Tis 11 b plasmid in HEK 293 T cells, consistent with a 50 % shorter half-life of ARE-containing transcripts. We identified a crucial ARE motif within MR 3 '-UTR, to which Tis 11 b binds as shown by site-directed mutagenesis and RNA Immunoprecipitation, responsible for Tis 11 b-mediated destabilizing activity. Importantly, endogenous Tis 11 b physically interacts with MR mRNA in KC 3 AC 1 cells, leading to hypertonicity-elicited MR repression as demonstrated by Tis 11 b knockdown. Moreover, hypertonicity impaired MR signaling by blunting aldosterone-stimulated Gilz and αENaC expression in the Na+-transporting KC 3 AC 1 cells. Challenging the <b>renal</b> <b>osmotic</b> gradient by submitting mice to water deprivation, diuretic administration or high Na+ diet increased renal Tis 11 b while decreased MR expression, notably in the cortex, thus establishing a mechanistic pathway for osmotic regulation of MR expression in vivo. Altogether, we uncover a previously undetected mechanism by which renal MR expression is regulated via mRNA turnover, a posttranscriptional control which appears physiologically relevant...|$|R
40|$|A {{family of}} orphan {{transporters}} {{has been discovered}} that are structurally related to the Na+-Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, including the dopamine transporter. One member of this family, the mouse XT 2 gene, is predominantly expressed in the kidney and has 95 % homology to rat ROSIT (<b>renal</b> <b>osmotic</b> stress-induced Na+-Cl− organic solute cotransporter). To study the physiological functions of this transporter, we generated XT 2 -knockout mice by gene targeting. XT 2 −/− mice develop and survive normally with no apparent abnormalities. To attempt to identify potential substrates for XT 2, we screened urine from XT 2 -knockout mice by high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry and found significantly elevated concentrations of glycine. To study glycine handling, XT 2 +/+ and XT 2 −/− mice were injected with radiolabeled glycine, and urine samples were collected to monitor glycine excretion. After 2 h, XT 2 −/− mice were found to excrete almost twice as much glycine as the XT 2 +/+ controls (P = 0. 03). To determine whether {{the absence of the}} XT 2 transporter affected sodium and fluid homeostasis, we measured systolic blood pressure by computerized tail-cuff manometry. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in XT 2 −/− mice (127 ± 3 mmHg) than in wild-type controls (114 ± 2 mmHg; P < 0. 001). This difference in systolic blood pressure was maintained on high and low salt feeding. To examine whether the alteration in blood pressure and the defect in glycine handling were related, we measured systolic blood pressure in the XT 2 −/− mice during dietary glycine supplementation. Glycine loading caused systolic blood pressure to fall in the XT 2 −/− mice from 127 ± 3 to 115 ± 3 mmHg (P < 0. 001), a level virtually identical to that of the wild-type controls. These data suggest that the XT 2 orphan transporter is involved in glycine reabsorption and that the absence of this transporter is sufficient to cause hypertension...|$|R

40|$|The <b>renal</b> cortico-papillary <b>osmotic</b> {{gradient}} {{is generated}} by sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb. The antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) increases collecting duct water permeability by enhancing aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) water channel insertion in the apical membrane of principal cells, allowing water to passively flow along the osmotic gradient from the tubule lumen to the interstitium. In addition to short-term AQP 2 redistribution between intracellular compartments and the cell surface, AQP 2 whole cell abundance is tightly regulated. AVP is a major transcriptional activator of the AQP 2 gene, and stimulation of insulin- and calcium-sensing receptors respectively potentiate and reduce its action. Extracellular tonicity is another key factor that determines the levels of AQP 2 abundance. Its effect is dependent on activation of the tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein that reinforces AVP-induced AQP 2 transcriptional activation. Conversely, activation of the NF-kappaB transcriptional factor by proinflammatory factors reduces AQP 2 gene transcription. Aldosterone additionally regulates AQP 2 whole cell abundance by simultaneously reducing AQP 2 gene transcription and stimulating AQP 2 mRNA translation. These examples illustrate how cross talk between various stimuli regulates AQP 2 abundance in collecting duct principal cells and consequently contributes to maintenance of body water homeostasis...|$|R

Increasing evidences support the central role of renal function alterations in the pathogenesis of hydroelectrolytic imbalances in cirrhotic patients, thus implying a dense cross-talk between liver and kidney in the systemic and splanchnic vascular homeostasis in such subjects. Since Arginin Vasopressin (AVP) hyperincretion occurs at late stage of cirrhosis and {{plays an important role in}} the development of refractory ascites, dilutional hyponatremia and finally hepato-renal syndrome, selective antagonists of AVP receptors V 2 (vaptans) have been recently introduced in the therapeutic algorithm of advanced cirrhotic patients. Despite the promising results of earlier phase-two studies, randomized controlled trials failed to find significant results in terms of efficacy of such drugs both in refractory ascites and hyponatremia. Moreover, concerns on their safety profile arise, due to the number of potentially severe side effects of vaptans in the clinical setting, such as hypernatremia, dehydration, <b>renal</b> impairment, and <b>osmotic</b> demyelination syndrome. More robust data from randomized controlled trials are needed in order to confirm the potential role of vaptans in the management of advanced cirrhotic patients...|$|R
40|$|In {{mammalian}} kidney, the osmolarity of {{the inner}} medulla is highly hypertonic. The cells protect themselves from shrinkage by {{the expression of a}} number of genes, such as AR and SMIT that increase the cellular levels of compatible osmolytes. The transcription of these genes is regulated by OREBP. Two independent lines of transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress the dominant-negative form of OREBP specifically in the collecting ducts were generated to study the physiological role of OREBP in the kidney. These Tg mice exhibited polyuria, polydipsia due to impaired urine concentrating ability. There was a reduction in the mRNA expression level of AQP- 2, UTA- 1 and UTA- 2 in both renal medulla and renal epithelial cells of Tg mice but no change in the AQP- 3 expression. However, during dehydration, Tg mice were able to concentrate their urine to ~ 30 % of that in the non-Tg mice and there was up-regulation of AQP- 2 and UTA- 1 mRNA expression. Our data suggest that under normal physiological condition, OREBP {{plays an important role in}} water reabsorption in the kidney by regulating the expression of AQP- 2, UTA- 1 and UTA- 2. Under dehydrated condition, increase of water reabsorption by the vasopressin/AQP 2 system remains functional in the absence of OREBP. Furthermore, the Tg mice developed bilateral hydronephrosis progressively, suggesting that OREBP may also protect the <b>renal</b> cells against <b>osmotic</b> stress...|$|R
40|$|The forces between charged macromolecules, usually {{given in}} terms of osmotic pressure, are highly {{affected}} by the intervening ionic solution. While in most theoretical studies the solution is treated as a homogeneous structureless dielectric medium, recent experimental studies concluded that, for a bathing solution composed of two solvents (binary mixture), the <b>osmotic</b> pressure between <b>charged</b> macromolecules {{is affected by the}} binary solvent composition. By adding local solvent composition terms to the free energy, we obtain a general expression for the osmotic pressure, in planar geometry and within the mean-field framework. The added effect is due to the permeability inhomogeneity and nonelectrostatic short-range interactions between the ions and solvents (preferential solvation). This effect is mostly pronounced at small distances and leads to a reduction in the osmotic pressure for macromolecular separations of the order 1 [...] 2 nm. Furthermore, it leads to a depletion of one of the two solvents from the charged macromolecules (modeled as planar interfaces). Lastly, by comparing the theoretical results with experimental ones, an explanation based on preferential solvation is offered for recent experiments on the osmotic pressure of DNA solutions.

To fulfil many of these roles, malate has to be accumulated within the large central vacuole. Many unsuccessful efforts {{have been made in the}} past to identify the vacuolar malate transporter; here, we describe the identification of the vacuolar malate transporter [A. thaliana tonoplast dicarboxylate transporter (AttDT) ]. This transporter exhibits highest sequence similarity to the human sodium/dicarboxylate cotransporter. Independent T-DNA [portion of the Ti (tumor-inducing) plasmid that is transferred to plant cells] Arabidopsis mutants exhibit substantially reduced levels of leaf malate, but respire exogenously applied [14 C]malate faster than the WT. An AttDT-GFP fusion protein was localized to vacuole. Vacuoles isolated from Arabidopsis WT leaves exhibited carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and citrate inhibitable malate transport, which was not stimulated by sodium.

40|$|In our {{previous}} studies of varying osmotic diuresis, UT-A 1 urea transporter increased when urine and inner medullary (IM) interstitial urea concentration decreased. The {{purposes of this study}} were to examine 1) whether IM interstitial tonicity changes with different urine urea concentrations during osmotic dieresis and 2) whether the same result occurs even if the total urinary solute is decreased. Rats were fed a 4 % high-salt diet (HSD) or a 5 % high-urea diet (HUD) for 2 wk and compared with the control rats fed a regular diet containing 1 % NaCl. The urine urea concentration decreased in HSD but increased in HUD. In the IM, UT-A 1 and UT-A 3 urea transporters, CLC-K 1 chloride channel, and tonicity-enhanced binding protein (TonEBP) transcription factor were all increased in HSD and decreased in HUD. Next, rats were fed an 8 % low-protein diet (LPD) or a 0. 4 % low-salt diet (LSD) to decrease the total urinary solute. Urine urea concentration significantly decreased in LPD but significantly increased in LSD. Rats fed the LPD had increased UT-A 1 and UT-A 3 in the IM base but decreased in the IM tip, resulting in impaired urine concentrating ability. The LSD rats had decreased UT-A 1 and UT-A 3 in both portions of the IM. CLC-K 1 and TonEBP were unchanged by LPD or LSD.

40|$|A voltage-independent cation (VIC) channel {{has been}} {{identified}} in the plasma membrane of wheat (Triticum aestivum) root cells (P. J. White [1999] Trends Plant Sci 4 : 245 – 246). Several physiological functions have been proposed for this channel, including roles in cation nutrition, <b>osmotic</b> adjustment, and <b>charge</b> compensation. Here, we observe that Ca 2 + permeates this VIC channel when assayed in artificial, planar lipid bilayers, and, using an energy barrier model to describe cation fluxes, predict that it catalyzes Ca 2 + influx under physiological ionic conditions. Thus, this channel could participate in Ca 2 + signaling or cytosolic Ca 2 + homeostasis. The pharmacology of 45 Ca 2 + influx to excised wheat roots and inward cation currents through the VIC channel are similar: Both are insensitive to 20 μm verapamil or 1 mm tetraethylammonium, but inhibited by 0. 5 mm Ba 2 + or 0. 5 mm Gd 3 +. The weak voltage dependency of the VIC channel (and its lack of modulation by physiological effectors) suggest that it will provide perpetual Ca 2 + influx to root cells. Thus, it may effect cytosolic Ca 2 + homeostasis by contributing to the basal Ca 2 + influx required to balance Ca 2 + efflux from the cytoplasm through ATP- and proton-coupled Ca 2 + transporters under steady-state conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} all cells to set and {{regulate}} their size {{is a fundamental}} aspect of cellular physiology. It {{has been known for}} sometime but not widely so, that size stability in animal cells is dependent upon the operation of the sodium pump, through the so-called pump-leak mechanism (Tosteson and Hoffman, 1960). Impermeant molecules in cells establish an unstable osmotic condition, the Donnan effect, which is counteracted by the operation of the sodium pump, creating an asymmetry in the distribution of Na+ and K+ staving off water inundation. In this paper, which is in part a tutorial, I show how to model quantitatively the ion and water fluxes in a cell that determine the cell volume and membrane potential. The movement of water and ions is constrained by both <b>osmotic</b> and <b>charge</b> balance, and is driven by ion and voltage gradients and active ion transport. Transforming these constraints and forces into a set of coupled differential equations allows us to model how the ion distributions, volume and voltage change with time. I introduce an analytical solution to these equations that clarifies the influence of ion conductances, pump rates and water permeability in this multidimensional system. I show that the number of impermeant ions (x) and their average charge have a powerful influence on the distribution of ions and voltage in a cell. Moreover, I demonstrate that in a cell where the operation of active ion transport eliminates an osmotic gradient, the size of the cell is directly proportional to x. In addition, I use graphics to reveal how the physico-chemical constraints and chemical forces interact with one another in apportioning ions inside the cell. The form of model used here is applicable to all membrane systems, including mitochondria and bacteria, and I show how pumps other than the sodium pump can be used to stabilize cells. Cell biologists may think of electrophysiology as the exclusive domain of neuroscience, however the electrical effects of ion fluxes need to become an intimate part of cell biology if we are to understand a fundamental process like cell size regulation...|$|R
40|$|Mannitol, {{when given}} {{intravenously}} to normal human subjects or animals, shares {{with a number}} of other substances the property of promoting an increased rate of renal excretion of sodium, chlo-ride, and water. The generally accepted hy-pothesis concerning the mechanism of this action is that mannitol exerts its effect directly on the <b>renal</b> tubules. The <b>osmotic</b> pressure of the man-nitol within the tubular lumen is considered to in-terfere with the reabsorption of water. Sodium excretion is thought to be increased {{in the presence of the}} increased amounts of water in the tubule per unit time, either because reabsorption of so-dium is limited by a maximum concentration dif-ference for sodium which can be achieved between the tubular urine and the extracellular fluid (1 - 3) or because the contact of the sodium with the tu-bule cells is so brief that reabsorption is incom-plete (4, 5). Evidence for a direct effect of man-nitol on the renal excretion of salt and water is afforded by the experiments of Goodyer and Glenn (5). They injected large mannitol loads directly into one renal artery of dogs and pro-duced prompt increases in salt and water excre-tion on the injected side. However another mechanism of action of mannitol in the intact ani-mal is not excluded by these observations. Seldin and Tarail (6) have suggested that mannitol in-fusions may exert their effects outside the kidney by producing an expansion of extracellular volume and, when given in hypertonic solution, a con-traction of intracellular volume, and thus indirectly altering some regulatory mechanism which in-creases the renal excretion of salt. This hypothe-sis has not thus far been excluded, and indeed was suggested as the probable mechanism of ac...|$|R

First, a descriptive explanation is presented of the biphasic theory required to understand how interstitial water contributes toward the viscoelastic behavior of any hydrated soft tissue. Then, the famous <b>osmotic</b> effect in <b>charged,</b> hydrated soft tissue is interpreted {{in light of the}} triphasic mixture theory framework. In the introduction of mechanical testing methods, our emphasis is on the popular indentation technique, which can determine the material properties of cartilage in situ or in vivo. The widely accepted indentation analysis solutions in cartilage biomechanics history are summarized and evaluated. At the end of this paper, a new generalized correspondence principle between charged, hydrated soft tissue and linear, isotropic, elastic material (i. e., elasticity theory) is introduced. This principle makes the employment of triphasic theory as straightforward as using an elasticity theory to solve any equilibrium problem where the elasticity theory can be used to model the material. By using this generalized correspondence principle, the fixed charge density of bovine cartilage has been simply and conveniently calculated from the indentation testing data. The results of proteoglycan content from this mechanical test are remarkably consistent with those from standard biochemical assay. This new correspondence principle significantly improves the power of indentation tests in the determination of mechanoelectrochemical properties of articular cartilage.

The accumulation of malate, along with K+ and sugars, {{is thought to}} play an important role in fibre elongation through <b>osmotic</b> regulation and <b>charge</b> balance. However, there is a lack of evidence for or against such an hypothesis. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a key enzyme responsible for the synthesis of malate. The potential role of PEPC in cotton fibre elongation is examined here. Developmentally, PEPC activity was higher at the rapid elongation phase than that at the slow elongation stage. Genotypically, PEPC activity correlated positively with the rate of fibre elongation and the final fibre length attained. Importantly, suppression of PEPC activity by LiCl that reduces its phosphorylation status decreased fibre length. To examine the molecular basis underlying PEPC activity, two cDNAs encoding PEPC, GhPEPC 1 and 2, were cloned, which represents the major PEPC genes expressed in cotton fibre. RT-PCR analyses revealed that GhPEPC 1 and 2 were highly expressed at the rapid elongation phase but weakly at the slow-to-terminal elongation period. In situ hybridization detected mRNA of GhPEPC 1 and 2 in 1 d young fibres but not in the ovule epidermis prior to fibre initiation.
