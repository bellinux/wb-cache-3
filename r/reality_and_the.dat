5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of <b>Reality</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E
5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming widely held social values, such as heterosexuality and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were socially acceptable. Some countries, such as Japan, continue to present the family stereotypically, especially in their television advertisements. In the past decade, however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers.|$|E

5|$|Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth's {{views on}} baptism by {{appealing}} to Calvin, the idea that baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished <b>reality,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> idea of baptism as a replacement of circumcision. Scottish Reformed theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized the idea that baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German Reformed liberation theologian Jürgen Moltmann, on the other hand, saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a free response God's call to discipleship. Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
50|$|The {{period of}} {{colonization}} radically changed existing power structures, leaving a confused legacy of contradictory political affiliations, European-drawn borders with {{little resemblance to}} ethnic <b>and</b> tribal <b>realities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> foundations of modern political conflict.|$|R
50|$|Pouwer's {{work also}} {{demonstrates}} a consistent attempt to capture, within a strict discipline, something of life's movement. This tension {{in his work}} may have resulted from his immersion in New Guinea lived <b>realities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of fit between those <b>realities</b> <b>and</b> Western understanding. Possibly for this reason Pouwer did not embrace a purely structuralist position à la Lévi-Strauss.|$|R

25|$|The very {{functioning}} of language itself is literally a {{theme in the}} play, with particular emphasis placed {{on its ability to}} represent by means of signs (semiosis), the power of language to sway, the aggressive potential of language, the failure of language to adequately describe <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> manipulation of language so as to hide the truth.|$|E
25|$|The Schrödinger {{equation}} {{provides a}} way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schrödinger equation does not directly say what, exactly, the wave function is. Interpretations of quantum mechanics address questions such as what the relation is between the wave function, the underlying <b>reality,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> results of experimental measurements.|$|E

50|$|Holman works across {{media in}} drawings, sculpture, {{photography}} and video.

25|$|The Bangladeshi liberation {{struggle}} against Pakistan {{was led by}} secular leaders. With this <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feeling of Islamic solidarity in the background, Islamists in East Pakistan viewed Bengali nationalism as unacceptable and instead sided with the Pakistani Army's efforts to crush the Bengali independence movement. Secularists hailed the Bangladeshi victory as the triumph of secular Bengali nationalism over religion-centred Pakistani nationalism.|$|E
25|$|In some instances, {{unreliable}} narration {{can bring}} about the fantastic in works of fiction. In Kingsley Amis' The Green Man, for example, the unreliability of the narrator Maurice Allington destabilizes the boundaries between <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fantastic. The same applies to Nigel Williams's Witchcraft. An Instance of the Fingerpost by Iain Pears also employs several points of view from narrators whose accounts {{are found to be}} unreliable and in conflict with each other.|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} few years of her life, she focused on obtaining stable, adequate, {{long-term}} funding to support the maintenance and further development of her Protein Information Resource. She envisioned an online system of computer programs and databases, accessible by scientists all over the world, for identifying protein from sequence or amino acid composition data, for making predictions based on sequences, and for browsing the known information. Less than a week before she died, she submitted a proposal to the Division of Research Resources at NIH for a Protein Identification Resource. After her death, her colleagues continuing working to make her vision a <b>reality,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> protein database was fully operational by the middle of 1984.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2013, Ai debuted {{his first}} single Dumbass over the internet, with a music video shot by cinematographer Christopher Doyle. The video was a {{reconstruction}} of Ai's experience in prison, during his 81-day detention, and dives {{in and out}} of the prison's <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> guarding soldiers' fantasies. He later released a second single, Laoma Tihua, on 20 June 2013 along with a video on his experience of state surveillance, with footage compiled from his studio's documentaries. On 22 June 2013, the two-year anniversary of Ai's release, he released his first music album The Divine Comedy. Later in August, he released a third music video for the song Chaoyang Park, also included in the album.|$|E
25|$|Director Pawan Kumar {{admitted}} {{to have taken}} influence from Christopher Nolan and David Lynch. The dream and real sequences being shot in monochrome and in color to differentiate between the two stories, like the Memento to alternate between two plot-lines. The movie's relation with dream and <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interrelation between the two. There is also a scene where Nolan's movie Following is seen playing on a TV screen. Requiem for a Dream is also seen playing on a TV in the same scene which is also an influence as the movie deals with addiction. Apart from the cinematic influences, the theme of dream and illusion is also shown as an influence of the poem Nee Mayeyolago by Kanaka Dasa which is quoted {{at the beginning of}} the movie. The poem is also partially contained in the lyrics of the song Nee Toreda Galigeyali in the soundtrack.|$|E
