[58] It is questionable, however, whether Ojeda made any pretension of the kind, which could so readily be disproved, and would have tended to disgrace him with the government. It is probable that he was encouraged in his intermeddling, chiefly by his knowledge of the tottering state of the admiral's favor at court, and of his own security in the powerful protection of Fonseca. He may have imbibed also the opinion, diligently fostered by those with whom he had chiefly communicated in Spain, just before his departure, that these people had been driven to extremities by the oppression of the admiral and his brothers. Some feeling of generosity, therefore, may have mingled with his usual love of action and enterprise, when he proposed to redress all their wrongs, put himself at their head, march at once to San Domingo, and oblige the admiral to pay them on the spot, or expel him from the island.|$|E
60|$|Finding his {{attempts}} to corrupt the garrison unsuccessful, and fearing some sudden sally from the vigorous Adelantado, Roldan drew off to a distance, and sought by insidious means to strengthen his own power, and weaken that of the government.

He represented him as the tyrant of the Spaniards, the oppressor of the Indians. For himself, he assumed the character of a <b>redresser</b> of grievances and champion of the injured. He pretended to feel a patriotic indignation at the affronts heaped upon Spaniards by a family of obscure and arrogant foreigners; and professed to free the natives from tributes wrung from them by these rapacious men for their own enrichment, and contrary to the beneficent intentions of the Spanish monarchs. He connected himself closely with the Carib cacique Manicaotex, brother of the late Caonabo, whose son and nephew were in his possession as hostages for payment of tributes. This warlike chieftain he conciliated by presents and caresses, bestowing on him the appellation of brother. [25] The unhappy natives, deceived by his professions, and overjoyed at {{the idea of having a}} protector in arms for their defence, submitted cheerfully to a thousand impositions, supplying his followers with provisions in abundance, and bringing to Roldan all the gold they could collect; voluntarily yielding him heavier tributes than those from which he pretended to free them.|$|E
6000|$|The King {{presently}} {{arriving at}} Pontefract, brought Lancaster to trial before six Earls {{and a number}} of Barons; and as his treason was manifest, he was told that it would be to no purpose to speak in his own defence, and was sentenced to the death of a traitor. In consideration of his royal blood, Edward remitted the chief horrors of the execution, and made it merely decapitation; but as the Earl was led to a hill outside the town, on a gray pony without a bridle, the mob pelted him and jeered him by his assumed name of King Arthur. [...] "King of Heaven," [...] he cried, [...] "grant me mercy! for the king of earth hath forsaken me." [...] He knelt by the black with his face to the east, but he was bidden to turn to the north, that he might look toward his friends, the Scots; and in this manner he was beheaded. The inhabitants of the northern counties were not likely to think lightly of the offence of bringing in the Scots, and yet in a short time there was a strong change of feeling. Lancaster was mourned as [...] "the good Earl," [...] and miracles were said to be wrought at his tomb. The King was obliged to write orders to the Bishop of London to forbid the people from offering worship to his picture hung up in St. Paul's Church; and Drayton records a tradition that [...] "grass would never grow where the battle of Boroughbridge had been fought." [...] It seemed as if Lancaster had succeeded to the reputation of Montfort, as a protector of the liberties of the country: but to our eyes he appears more like a mere factious, turbulent noble, acting rather from spite and party spirit than as a <b>redresser</b> of wrongs; never showing the respect for law and justice manifested by the opponents of Edward I.; and, in fact, constraining the Royalists to appeal to Magna Charta against him. Still there must have been something striking and attractive about him, for, after his death, even his injured cousin Edward lamented him, and reproached his nobles for not having interceded for him. Fourteen bannerets and fourteen other knights were executed, being all who were taken in arms against the King; the others were allowed to make peace; and the Mortimers, who had been condemned to death, had their sentence changed to perpetual imprisonment. Hereford's estates passed on to the eldest of his large family, the King's own nephews. Lancaster left no children, but his brother, Henry Wryneck, Earl of Derby, did not receive his estates till they had been mulcted largely on behalf of the Despensers. The father was created Earl of Winchester, and the son received such bounty from the King, that all the old hatred against Piers Gaveston was revived, though it does not appear that Hugh provoked dislike by any such follies or extravagances.|$|E

40|$|The Yzeron basin (147 km²) {{consists}} of three major units: 1) in the west, the Monts du Lyonnais, a subdued mountain whose land is predominantly rural; 2) in the center, the Plateau Lyonnais, a plateau over {{a large part of}} which extends the current periurban belt of Lyon; 3) in the east, the paleovalley of the Rhône and Saône Rivers, most of which is occupied by a dense urbanization. Many incisions have been identified using field indicators and downstream hydraulic geometry relationships (space-time substitution technique). All incised reaches are located in headwater streams (1 st and 2 nd Strahler order). Incisions are more important on the Plateau Lyonnais where they were mainly caused by impervious surfaces and storm sewer outlets. The effect of urbanization is also emphasized by dendrochronological analyses of riparian trees showing that these incisions mostly began between 1970 and 1990. Indeed, urban areas have doubled during this period over the entire Yzeron basin, rising from 15 to 30 % (Radojevic et al. 2002), and this average increase was probably higher on the plateau which had in the same time the highest relative population growth. On the plateau, no incision was identified in the basins which impervious cover is less than 10 %, threshold already observed by several authors in different regions (Schueler 1995 after Doll et al. 2002, Booth et Jackson 1997, Bledsoe et al. 2001 a, Coleman et al. 2005). Nevertheless, one third of the incisions (as a percentage of total length of incised reaches) were also identified in the Monts du Lyonnais where urbanization is poorly developed. In this area, riparian trees growth was not affected by bed lowering so we cannot date the incisions. Nevertheless, small dimensions of incised channels and their stage of evolution suggest that it is also relatively recent incisions, although their origins can back several decades, even centuries. Indeed, the study of historical land use evolution shows that croplands, especially arable land (cereal crops mainly) and vines, were much more developed in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Moreover, the age of human settlements in the Lyon region, as well as some historical archives (Privolt 2010; N. Jacob, personal communication), suggest that these croplands were extensive well before the 19 th century. This may have contributed for centuries to soil erosion on the slopes and sedimentary fill of the valley bottoms. This is even more likely that croplands were mainly on slopes while valley bottoms, wetter, were generally in meadows. Then, higher roughness valley bottom was favorable to the deposit of particles eroded by runoff on cultivated slopes (colluviums) or carried by overflows during flood (alluviums). Land use data indicates a significant decrease in agricultural land, especially vineyards and plowed fields, during the 20 th century. In the Monts du Lyonnais, these have mainly been replaced by grasslands and, more recently, by afforestation. This change has greatly reduced runoff and soil erosion, leading to a relative sediment deficit that contributes to disrupt channel stability. In addition, bed aggradation in valley bottoms which experienced initially sedimentary fill (headwater basins, with a gentle slope and a greater width) has resulted in a local slope increase with downstream reaches whose energy is relatively stronger (no deposits), which ultimately promotes regressive incisions. In the Plateau Lyonnais, croplands have also been replaced by urban areas. Then, when urbanization extends after long-term effects of cropland, the latter two disturbances are cumulative and may result in incisions highly developed, as for example in the Chaudanne River. Furthermore, whatever the land use, artificial drainage networks (roads, trails, storm sewers) can lead to incisions. These are all longer than drains length and valleybottom slope increases. This trend could be related to the low availability of mobile sediment in the bed and banks: as water inputs increases with drain length, more distance is necessary to satisfy sediment transport capacity because it cannot be fully satisfied by erosion in the vertical and lateral dimensions; when slope increases, channels have more coarse material resistant to erosion and lower lateral dynamics, which promotes further adjustments in longitudinal dimension. The secondary influence of slope may be related to soil thickness and basin size: in general, soil thickness is lower in steep valley bottoms so that artificial drains are more able to intercept subsurface runoff; steep valley bottoms are also associated with smaller basins where subsurface runoff is usually dominant so that surface runoff increase may be higher after roads or trails development. Moreover, influence of basin size was clearly highlighted even among low order streams: there is no incision beyond 4 km², and this threshold drops to 2 km² for most streams in the Monts du Lyonnais. Small streams are thus more sensitive to hydrologic disturbances, i. e. all human interventions that help to reduce infiltration and to intercept subsurface runoff. Geomorphic sensitivity to incision depends also to valley bottom morphology that can be described by a typological approach (Schmitt et al. 2004). Our results highlight the usefulness of this hydrogeomorphic typology, combined with the drainage area, to quickly identify stream reaches potentially sensitive to incision. Hydrological effects of combined sewer overflows on streambed stability were studied in the Chaudanne River where the largest incision was identified. Combined sewer overflows increase frequency and intensity of most morphogenic floods (above the critical discharge) but it is not accompanied by an equivalent increase of their annual duration. It also tends to reduce discharges at low flow and the annual duration of low intensity floods, at least compared to largest floods. This causes a change in the relative geomorphic effectiveness of discharges of different intensities. Channels must therefore adjust to significantly higher discharges, but short, delaying the recovery of a new morphodynamic equilibrium (longer relaxation time). This may also explain the nature of the channel response, i. e. a large incision rather than a gradual adjustment of its size. Although incised reaches extend only over a relatively small part of the Yzeron hydrographic network (6 %), channel enlargement ratios are significant (11, 7 on average) and eroded banks are mainly composed of sand (53 % on average). Headwater channel incisions are therefore an important source of fine sediment for the main branches of the river system (3 rd to 5 th Strahler order), with sandy sedimentation problems. According to fluorescent sand tracking, sediment delivery from upstream incised reaches represents from 27 to 62 % of the annual sediment transport of the Yzeron River for the fraction 0, 5 - 4 mm (66 % of downstream sand deposits). Despite the uncertainties in sediment transport estimates, this result suggests that headwater channel incisions are a major problem for instream physical habitat given the low capacity of the system to remove these sediments. Transport capacity of the main branches is also greatly reduced by a large number of weirs. When the bed slope is low, these structures systematically result in a sandy bed of several tens or even hundreds of meters. Finally, we have formulated various operational recommendations to limit hydrogeomorphic impacts due to anthropization, and especially urbanization. These recommendations are based on three scales of intervention: hillslopes, headwater stream channels and main branches of the river network. The proposed measures aim in particular to slow down or temporarily store waterflows on hillslopes, to control and adjust the long profile of incised reaches in case of local issues, and to trap some of the sand load upstream reaches most sensitive to sand deposits. Le bassin de l'Yzeron (147 km²) est composé de trois grands ensembles : 1) à l'ouest, les Monts du Lyonnais essentiellement ruraux; 2) au centre, le Plateau Lyonnais, sur une grande partie duquel s'étend l'actuelle couronne périurbaine de l'agglomération lyonnaise; 3) à l'est, la paléovallée du Rhône et de la Saône, dont la majeure partie est occupée par une urbanisation dense. Un grand nombre d'incisions ont été identifiées à l'aide d'indicateurs visuels et des relations de géométrie hydraulique aval (space-time substitution technique). L'ensemble des tronçons incisés se situe sur les cours d'eau de tête de bassin (ordre 1 ou 2 selon Strahler). Les incisions sont plus importantes sur le Plateau Lyonnais où elles ont principalement été engendrées par l'imperméabilisation des sols et le développement des réseaux de drainage artificiels. Le rôle de l'urbanisation est également souligné par les analyses dendrochronologiques des arbres riverains qui montrent que les incisions ont principalement débuté entre 1970 et 1990. En effet, la superficie des zones urbaines a doublé durant cette période dans le bassin de l'Yzeron (Radojevic et al. 2002), et cette progression moyenne a probablement été supérieure sur le plateau qui a connu la plus forte croissance démographique relative. Sur le plateau, aucune incision n'a été identifiée dans les bassins dont le taux d'imperméabilisation est inférieur à 10 %, seuil déjà observé par plusieurs auteurs dans différentes régions (Schueler 1995 d'après Doll et al. 2002, Booth et Jackson 1997, Bledsoe et al. 2001 a, Coleman et al. 2005). Néanmoins, un tiers des incisions (en pourcentage de la longueur totale des tronçons incisés) se situent également dans les Monts du Lyonnais où l'urbanisation s'est très peu développée. Dans cette unité paysagère, la croissance des arbres riverains n'a pas été affectée par l'abaissement du niveau du lit si bien que nous n'avons pas pu dater les incisions. Les faibles dimensions des chenaux incisés et leur stade d'évolution suggèrent néanmoins qu'il s'agit également d'incisions relativement récentes, bien que leurs origines puissent remonter à plusieurs décennies, voire plusieurs siècles. En effet, l'étude de l'évolution pluriséculaire de l'occupation du sol a montré que l'emprise des terres cultivées, et plus particulièrement des labours et des vignes, était nettement plus importante au 19 ème et au début du 20 ème siècle. Par ailleurs, l'ancienneté des occupations humaines dans la région lyonnaise, ainsi que certaines archives historiques (Privolt 2010; N. Jacob, communication personnelle), suggèrent que ces terres cultivées étaient très étendues bien avant le 19 ème siècle. Celles-ci ont donc probablement favorisé pendant plusieurs siècles une production sédimentaire abondante des versants et des dépôts corrélatifs dans les fonds de vallée. C'est d'autant plus probable que les terres cultivées se situaient principalement sur les versants alors que les fonds de vallée, plus humides, étaient généralement en prairies. La rugosité plus élevée des fonds de vallées a donc pu contribuer au dépôt des sédiments issus du ruissellement sur les versants cultivés (colluvions) ou des débordements de crues (alluvions). Les statistiques annuelles du 20 ème siècle ont montré une importante diminution des surfaces agricoles. Dans les Monts du Lyonnais, celles-ci ont été principalement remplacées par des prairies et, plus récemment, par des boisements. Cette évolution a fortement diminué le ruissellement et l'érosion des sols, d'où un déficit sédimentaire relatif qui contribue à perturber l'équilibre des chenaux. De plus, l'exhaussement des chenaux dans les fonds de vallée propices au remplissage sédimentaire (en tête de bassin, avec une pente faible et une largeur plus importante) a entraîné une augmentation de la pente avec les tronçons aval dont l'énergie est relativement plus forte (absence de dépôts), ce qui favorise des incisions régressives. Sur le Plateau Lyonnais, les terres agricoles ont également laissé place aux surfaces urbaines. Aussi, lorsque l'urbanisation se développe sur un bassin versant ayant subi les effets à long terme des labours, ces deux dernières perturbations se cumulent et peuvent engendrer des incisions extrêmement développées, comme c'est par exemple le cas sur le ruisseau de la Chaudanne. De plus, quelle que soit l'occupation du sol, les drains artificiels (routes, pistes, réseaux d'assainissement) peuvent entraîner des incisions. Celles-ci sont d'autant plus longues que la longueur des drains et la pente du fond de vallée augmentent. Cette tendance peut être expliquée par la faible disponibilité en sédiments mobilisables dans le lit et les berges : à mesure que les volumes déversés par les drains augmentent, la recharge sédimentaire s'accomplit sur un plus grand linéaire de cours d'eau faute de pouvoir être pleinement satisfaite dans les dimensions verticales et latérales; lorsque la pente augmente, les chenaux présentent plus de matériaux grossiers résistants à l'érosion et une plus faible dynamique latérale, ce qui favorise encore davantage les ajustements dans la dimension longitudinale. L'influence secondaire de la pente peut également être liée à l'épaisseur des formations superficielles et à la taille du bassin versant : de manière générale, l'épaisseur des formations superficielles est plus faible dans les fonds de vallée à forte pente si bien que les drains artificiels peuvent intercepter plus efficacement les écoulements subsurfaciques; ces fonds de vallée drainent des bassins versants plus petits où la part des écoulements subsurfaciques est naturellement plus élevée, si bien que l'augmentation des écoulements superficiels est relativement plus intense après implantation de routes ou de pistes. Par ailleurs, l'influence de la taille du bassin versant a été clairement mise en évidence, même parmi les cours d'eau de faible rang : aucune incision n'a été recensée au-delà de 4 km², et ce seuil descend à 2 km² sur la plupart des cours d'eau des Monts du Lyonnais. Les petits cours d'eau sont donc intrinsèquement plus sensibles à toute perturbation qui contribue à réduire la capacité d'infiltration des sols et à intercepter les écoulements subsurfaciques. La sensibilité à l'incision dépend également de la morphologie des fonds de vallée qui peut être prise en compte par une approche typologique (Schmitt et al. 2004). Nos résultats soulignent l'intérêt de cette typologie hydrogéomorphologique qui, associée à la superficie des bassins versants, permet d'identifier les cours d'eau potentiellement sensibles aux incisions. Les effets hydrologiques des déversoirs d'orages sur la stabilité du lit des cours d'eau ont été étudiés sur le ruisseau de la Chaudanne qui présente la plus importante incision du bassin versant. Les déversements augmentent fortement l'intensité et la fréquence de la plupart des crues morphogènes (supérieures au débit critique) mais ne s'accompagne pas d'une augmentation équivalente de leur durée annuelle. Ils tendent également à diminuer les débits de basses eaux et la durée annuelle des crues de faible intensité, du moins par rapport aux crues plus intenses. Cela entraîne une modification de l'efficacité géomorphologique relative des écoulements de différentes intensités. Les chenaux doivent alors s'ajuster à des débits nettement plus élevés mais brefs, ce qui peut considérablement retarder le rétablissement d'un nouvel équilibre morphodynamique (temps de relaxation plus long). Cette évolution pourrait également expliquer le fait que la réponse du chenal se soit manifestée par une importante incision plutôt que par un ajustement progressif de ses dimensions. Bien que les tronçons incisés ne représentent qu'une partie relativement faible du réseau hydrographique (6 %), les taux d'agrandissement des chenaux sont considérables (11, 7 en moyenne) et les berges érodées sont majoritairement constituées de sables (53 % en moyenne). Les incisions constituent donc une importante source de sédiments fins. D'après les traçages par fluorescence, la fourniture sédimentaire depuis les tronçons incisés en amont représente 27 à 62 % du transport solide annuel de la rivière Yzeron pour la fraction 0, 5 - 4 mm (66 % des dépôts sableux). Ce résultat montre que les incisions de tête de bassin contribuent de manière significative à l'ensablement des branches principales du réseau hydrographique (ordre 3 à 5 selon Strahler) étant donné leur faible capacité à évacuer ces sédiments. Leur capacité de transport est également fortement diminuée par la présence de nombreux seuils artificiels. Quand la pente est faible, ces aménagements peuvent entraîner un ensablement du lit sur plusieurs dizaines voire plusieurs centaines de mètres. Enfin, nous avons formulé diverses recommandations opérationnelles pour limiter les impacts hydrogéomorphologiques liés à l'anthropisation du bassin en général, et à l'urbanisation en particulier. Ces recommandations reposent sur trois échelles d'intervention : les versants, les cours d'eau de tête de bassin et les branches principales du réseau hydrographique. Les mesures proposées visent notamment à ralentir ou à stocker temporairement les flux hydriques sur les versants, à contrôler et à <b>redresser</b> le profil en long des tronçons incisés dans le cas d'enjeux locaux, et à piéger une partie de la charge sableuse en transit en amont des tronçons les plus sensibles à l'ensablement...|$|E
