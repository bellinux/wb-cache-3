40|$|The {{relationship}} between free travelling speed {{and the risk}} of involvement in a casualty crash in a 60 km/h speed limit zone was quantified using a case control study design. The 151 case vehicles were passenger cars involved in crashes in the Adelaide metropolitan area which were investigated at the scene by the NHMRC <b>Road</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Research</b> Unit and reconstructed using the latest computer aided crash reconstruction techniques. The 604 control vehicles were passenger cars matched to the cases by location, direction of travel, time of day, and day of week and their speeds were measured with a laser speed meter. It was found that the risk of involvement in a casualty crash doubled with each 5 kmlh increase in free travelling speed above 60 km/h. By comparing these risks with those associated with alcohol in a study also conducted by the NHMRC <b>Road</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Research</b> Unit in Adelaide it was found that each 5 kmlh increase in speed above 60 kmlh increases the risk of a casualty crash by roughly the same amount as each increase in blood alcohol concentration of 0. 05 g/l 00 mL.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between free travelling speed {{and the risk}} of involvement in a casualty crash was explored using a case control study design in two studies conducted in South Australia by the <b>Road</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Research</b> Unit; one in 60 km/h speed limit zones in metropolitan Adelaide; and one in 80 km/h or greater speed limit zones in rural South Australia. Exponential increases in crash risk associated with high free travelling speeds were found in both studies and no evidence was found for an increase in risk at low free travelling speeds. Hypothetical calculations on the effect of lowering free travelling speeds in both these studies indicated that significant reductions in casualty crashes could be expected from even small reductions in free travelling speeds. The results of an alcohol case control study conducted by the <b>Road</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Research</b> Unit in metropolitan Adelaide were compared to the free travelling speed studies and it was found that driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 0. 05 g/lOOmL equates to roughly the same increase in risk (about double) as travelling 5 km/h faster in a metropolitan area and 10 km/h faster in a rural area.

40|$|In <b>road</b> <b>accident</b> <b>research,</b> judgements {{of overall}} {{resemblance}} between accident cases are sometimes used {{in order to}} group similar instances and to describe corresponding accident scenarios. This note deals with the degree of agreement among experts regarding such judgements of resemblance and case aggregations. We asked participants working as researchers or engineers {{in the field of}} <b>road</b> <b>accident</b> <b>research</b> to give their judgements on the resemblance of accident cases to one reference case, and then to say which cases they felt corresponded to a same accident scenario as this case. The results showed a strong agreement among these experts concerning the ranking of the cases by decreasing order of resemblance. A good agreement was obtained for cases considered by the experts as corresponding to a same accident scenario as the reference case, despite some disagreement for a few cases. These results are all statistically significant at the 0. 05 level. Overall, these findings suggest that accident research using judgements of overall resemblance between accident instances can lead to results that are robust in terms of concordance among experts. Considering the limited size of the sample used, however, further research of the same type would be useful to confirm this conclusion. family resemblance, categorization, expert knowledge, accident, road safety...|$|E

Investigations began with immediate attendance {{at the scene of}} the crash. The information collected for each crash included: photographs of the crash scene and vehicles involved, video record of the crash scene and vehicles in selected cases, examination of the road environment, a site plan of the crash scene and vehicle movements in the crash, examination and measurements of the vehicles involved, interviews with crash participants, interviews with witnesses, interviews with police, information on the official police report, information from Coroner’s reports, and injury data for the injured crash participants. The report provides an overall statistical summary of the sample of crashes investigated, followed by a detailed examination of the road infrastructure issues contributing to the crashes. This is done on the basis of crash type, with separate sections concerned with single vehicle crashes, midblock crashes and crashes at intersections.

40|$|Australia is {{contributing}} to the International Harmonised Research Activities Pedestrian Safety Expert Group (IHRA PSEG) through research undertaken at the <b>Road</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Research</b> Unit, and funded by the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services. The IHRA PSEG is charged {{with the development of}} test procedures for assessing the protection afforded by the vehicle to a pedestrian {{in the event of a}} collision. The Group is seeking to develop these test procedures based on field data on pedestrian accidents. Importantly, the test procedures will take into account different vehicle shapes and pedestrian anthropometry. As with procedures developed by the European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee, these procedures will be based on sub-systems representing the head, upper leg and full leg. The <b>Road</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Research</b> Unit has contributed field data collected in the period 1977 - 2000, showing the importance of protecting the head and lower extremities in a pedestrian collision. The Unit has also participated in an extensive computer simulation task to develop test conditions for different car shapes. A validated MADYMO model of a 50 th percentile male pedestrian was positioned in front of vehicles that represented a range of frontal shapes. The results of the computer simulations were analysed to extract the equivalent subsystem test conditions that reproduce the impacts predicted by the model. Parallel studies were undertaken in Japan and the USA with alternative models, and the results have been compiled and compared. The results showed that the test conditions required in subsystem tests depend on the profile of the car. The study will be extended to models of children and adults of different stature, to produce a comprehensive set of test conditions for pedestrian subsystem tests.

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} <b>road</b> traffic <b>accident</b> <b>research</b> is {{the resolution of}} the magnitude by which individual accident characteristics affect the risk of fatality for each person involved. This article introduces the potential of a recently developed form of regression models, known as multilevel models, for quantifying the various influences on casualty outcomes. The application of multilevel models is illustrated by the analysis of the predictors of outcome amongst over 16, 000 fatally and seriously injured casualties involved in accidents between 1985 and 1996 in Norway. Risk of fatality was found to be associated with casualty age and sex, as well as the type of vehicles involved, the characteristics of the impact, the attributes of the road section on which it took place, the time of day, and whether alcohol was suspected. After accounting for these factors, the multilevel analysis showed that 16 % of unexplained variation in casualty outcomes was between accidents, whilst ~ 1 % was associated with the area of Norway in which each incident occurred. The benefits of using multilevel models to analyse accident data are discussed along with the limitations of traditional regression modelling approaches...|$|R

Hence, this research on the relationship between the roadside features and the <b>road</b> traffic <b>accidents</b> along KM 3 until KM 27 of Jalan Kuantan - Gambang has been carried out. This research has been done in order to identify the existing critical distance of roadside features along KM 3 until KM 27 of Jalan Kuantan - Gambang and to study the relationship between the roadside features and the number of traffic <b>accident</b> cases. This <b>research</b> has been done by gathering the traffic accident data from the Polis Diraja Malaysia (PDRM).

The study found that a reduction of 5 km/h in vehicle travelling speeds in the Adelaide area could be expected to result in a reduction of 30 % of the incidence of fatal pedestrian collisions. Under this scenario 10 % of the collisions would have been avoided altogether.
