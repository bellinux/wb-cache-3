5|$|The Magyars buried their dead, {{laying the}} {{deceased}} {{on their backs}} with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their pelvises. A deceased warrior's tomb always contained material connected with his horse. These are most frequently its skin, skull, and the lower legs; these were put into its master's grave, but occasionally only the harness was buried together with the warrior, or the horse's skin was stuffed with hay. The Magyars <b>rolled</b> <b>the</b> corpses in textiles or mats and placed silver plates on the eyes and the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{entered the}} second leg with a one-goal lead, {{although}} Brugge needed to score only one clear goal {{to win the}} competition {{by virtue of the}} away goals rule. The Belgians scored the goal they needed in the 11th minute. Liverpool defender Smith was adjudged to have handled the ball in the Liverpool penalty area and Brugge were awarded a penalty kick. Lambert converted the opportunity to give Brugge a 1–0 lead and level the aggregate tie at 3–3. Responding to the setback, Liverpool equalised four minutes later. They were awarded a free-kick outside the Brugge penalty area. Hughes <b>rolled</b> <b>the</b> ball to Keegan whose right-footed shot went into the Brugge goal to level the scores at 1–1 and give Liverpool a 4–3 aggregate lead. The goal incidentally was the first Brugge had conceded at home in the UEFA Cup all season.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October, Nani {{scored a}} {{controversial}} second goal as United beat Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 at home. He scored {{into an empty}} net after Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes <b>rolled</b> <b>the</b> ball out to take a free-kick he thought had been given for handball; however, play was allowed to go on as referee Mark Clattenburg did not blow his whistle. On 27 November, Nani scored United's fifth goal in a 7–1 home win over Blackburn Rovers. Nani netted his first goal of 2011 as he scored the winning strike in a 2–1 home victory over Stoke City on 4 January.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> four-point <b>roll</b> {{is a quick}} {{series of}} quarter <b>rolls.</b> <b>The</b> pilot gives four separate, but very brief aileron inputs. <b>The</b> first <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> {{aircraft}} to knife-edge, <b>the</b> second <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> aircraft inverted, <b>the</b> third <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> aircraft to opposite knife-edge, and <b>the</b> final input <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> aircraft back to upright.|$|R

50|$|The {{ink ribbon}} {{was a long}} <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> width of the print area that was {{positioned}} between the print chain and <b>the</b> paper. <b>The</b> <b>roll</b> came in two parts, <b>the</b> feeder <b>roll</b> and take-up <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> <b>roll</b> was constantly wound and rewound during printing.|$|R
5|$|The {{seventh and}} final match was between Randy Orton and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Both Orton and Triple H {{managed to get}} the upper hand in the match. During the match, Ric Flair and Batista {{interfered}} on behalf of Triple H, as they attacked Orton while the referee was knocked out. Jonathan Coachman also took part in the match as he ran down with a referee shirt and tried to act as a guest referee. Orton {{managed to get the}} upper hand over Flair, Batista and Coachman as he delivered an RKO on all of them. Triple H, however, managed to hit Orton with a steel chair, which proceeded with a Pedigree onto the same chair. Batista then <b>rolled</b> <b>the</b> referee into the ring, as Triple H covered Orton for the win via pinfall.|$|E
5|$|In New Zealand, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances and traded the lead with Mikkola, Röhrl and Björn Waldegård. Soon after regaining {{the lead on}} stage twelve, she retired with a broken oil pump. After seven rounds, Mouton was second in the championship, 32 points behind Röhrl and 12 ahead of Eklund. The Rally of Brazil was marred by the fatal accident of Brazilian driver Thomas Fuchs, and featured chaotic conditions as parts of the course were not successfully closed for competition. Although only five teams {{made it to the}} finish, Mouton improved her title hopes by winning her duel with Röhrl after the German lost a wheel on the last day. At the 1000 Lakes, she clocked in the eighth fastest time for the famous Ouninpohja stage and placed seventh after the first day. On the following leg, Mouton drove too fast into a jump and damaged her Quattro while landing. After the next jump, her front wheels locked up and she <b>rolled</b> <b>the</b> car. Mouton was next locked in a tight battle for the win in Sanremo. Although she recorded nine stage wins and Audi took a one-two, she had to settle for fourth behind Röhrl.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} Jerry Lawler's team, known as The Royal Family (with Queasy, Sleazy, and Cheesy), and Doink's Clowns R' Us team (with Dink, Wink, and Pink) {{consisted}} of comedic action {{for much of}} the first ten minutes. Eventually, Doink attempted a crossbody, but Lawler reversed the move. He was able to pin Doink and eliminate him from the match. Lawler remained involved in the match and {{played a role in the}} elimination of two more members of Doink's team. When Wink attempted a monkey flip against Queasy, Lawler blocked the move and helped Queasy to pin Wink. Later in the match, Lawler threw Cheesy on top of Pink, which enabled Cheesy to eliminate another of Doink's teammates. After Wink and Pink were eliminated, however, they hid under the ring rather than returning backstage. The final member of Clowns R' Us was eliminated after Sleazy and Dink fought in the ring. Dink performed a crossbody on Sleazy and attempted to pin him. Queasy <b>rolled</b> <b>the</b> wrestlers over so that Sleazy was on top, however, and the referee made the three count and awarded the match to The Royal Family. As Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy celebrated after the match, Lawler criticized them for taking credit for the victory. Dink, Pink, and Wink emerged from under the ring. All six midgets turned against Lawler and chased him away from the ring. As Lawler tried to escape, Doink returned and hit him in the face with a pie.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For buliding the mathmatical {{model of}} elastic {{deformation}} for rolls {{system with a}} composite back-up <b>roll</b> assemblled by <b>the</b> shrinkage fit, <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> sleeve and roll mandrel was studied individually, the bending force was acted on <b>the</b> working <b>roll</b> and <b>the</b> load acted on the contact zone was discreted segment by segment, then the deflection model of <b>the</b> working <b>roll</b> and <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> sleeve and roll mandrel was put forward based on the influence function method. According to the force equilibrim function and the deformation compatibility function between <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> sleeve, <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> mandrel and working <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> solution matrix was listed and the solving programe was compiled to solve the deflection of working roll and composite back-up <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> pressure between <b>the</b> working <b>roll</b> and <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> sleeve and <b>the</b> cross-section thickness of rolled strip. Therefore, {{it is an important}} theoretical foundation to improve the manufacturing technology and practical application of <b>the</b> composite back-up <b>roll.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The {{three-roll}} {{variable pitch}} works by having all three rolls {{able to move}} and tilt. <b>The</b> top <b>roll</b> moves in <b>the</b> vertical plane and <b>the</b> side <b>rolls</b> move on <b>the</b> horizontal plane.When rolling, <b>the</b> top <b>roll</b> presses <b>the</b> metal plate between <b>the</b> two side <b>rolls.</b> <b>The</b> advantage of having <b>the</b> variable three <b>roll</b> is <b>the</b> ability to <b>roll</b> many thicknesses and diameters of cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rolling moment}} {{created by the}} {{side-slip}} (labelled as [...] "P") tends to <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> aircraft back to wings level. More dihedral effect tries to <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> wings in the [...] "levelling" [...] direction more strongly, and less dihedral effect tries to <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> wings in the [...] "levelling" [...] direction less strongly. Dihedral effect helps stabilise the spiral mode by tending to <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> wings toward level {{in proportion to the}} amount of side-slip that builds up. It's not the whole picture however. At the same time that angle of side-slip is building up, the vertical fin is trying to turn the nose back into the wind, much like a weathervane, minimizing the amount of side-slip that can be present. If there is no side-slip, there can be no restoring rolling moment. If there is less side-slip, there is less restoring rolling moment. Yaw stability created by the vertical fin opposes the tendency for dihedral effect to <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> wings back level by limiting side-slip.|$|R
25|$|The caliph was {{captured}} {{and forced to}} watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury was plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols <b>rolled</b> <b>the</b> caliph up in a rug, and rode their horses over him, because {{they believed that the}} earth would be offended if it were ever touched by royal blood. All but one of his sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia.|$|E
25|$|The issue {{had caused}} {{controversy}} {{right from the}} start. In 1886, Vicente Martinez-Ybor’s cigar factory {{had been the first}} to be built and equipped. However, the start of production was delayed because his Cuban workers refused to work for a Spanish foreman who had earned an anti-Cuban reputation in Key West.
