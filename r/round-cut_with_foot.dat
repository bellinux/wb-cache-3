40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effect of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor on neutrophil functions in diabetic patients <b>with</b> active <b>foot</b> infections in vitro. Twelve diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections and 12 normal volunteers were enrolled. Neutrophils from peripheral blood were incubated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, 50 ng/mL) for 20 min. Superoxide production of neutrophils {{was measured by the}} reduction of ferricytochrome C. Neutrophil phagocytosis was assayed using Staphylococcus aureus and the weighted phagocytic index was calculated. Superoxide production of neutrophils in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections was 7. 7 (unit: nmol/ 2 x 10 (5) cells/ 60 min), which was significantly lower than that in controls (12. 0) (p< 0. 05). G-CSF increased neutrophil superoxide production to 12. 1 in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections and to 19. 8 in controls (p< 0. 05 for each). Weighted phagocytic index in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections was 0. 77, which was not significantly {{different from that of the}} controls (0. 69). Weighted phagocytic index was increased significantly by G-CSF to 0. 88 in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections and to 0. 79 in controls (p< 0. 05 for each). In conclusion, G-CSF significantly enhanced neutrophil functions in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections in vitro...|$|R
