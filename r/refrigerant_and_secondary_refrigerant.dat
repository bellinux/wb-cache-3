40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} an experimental study on a freezer which has small cooling capacity. Typically a freezer uses primary refrigerant (direct cooling) to cool or freeze a product. In this study, {{a prototype of}} freezer using a compressor 250 W nominal power at 220 V was designed and constructed. The freezer is operated on two conditions, that is, using primary <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> R 22 <b>and</b> R 290 (propane) were used as primary refrigerant, whereas aqueous solution of propylene glycol as <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> Comparison of the system performance between the primary <b>and</b> the <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> werepresented. Also, the experimental {{results showed that the}} use of R 290 as primary refrigerant to replace R 22 in the freezer could save electrical power consumption by 18. 5 %. Meanwhile, the use of the <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> yielded energy savings by 33. 19 % compared with the primary refrigerant...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} {{of organic}} or inorganic salts {{are used as}} <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerants</b> in indirect refrigeration systems to transport and transfer heat. Water {{is known for its}} corrosive character <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerants</b> based on aqueous solutions have the same tendency. The least corrosive from the aqueous solutions are glycols and alcohols. Salt solutions, such as chlorides and potassium salts, are much more corrosive. Nevertheless, it is possible to minimize corrosion risks at the beginning stage while designing system. Proper design can significantly help in improving system performance against corrosion. There are several aspects which need {{to be taken into account}} while working with secondary refrigerants: design of system, selection of <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant,</b> proper corrosion inhibitors, compatible materials used to build the installation and proper preparation of system to operation. While choosing proper materials it is advised to avoid the formation of a galvanic couple to reduce the risk of the most dangerous type of corrosion. Oxygen present in installation is another important factor increasing the rate of corrosion. Even small amounts of oxygen can significantly affect the system lifetime. The methods of cleaning, charging the system with <b>refrigerant,</b> <b>and</b> deaeration procedures are extremely important. The purpose of this thesis work is to present the problems of corrosion occurring in the indirect systems with <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerants.</b> The thesis describes the mechanism of corrosion and its different types, most commonly used materials in installation, different corrosion inhibitors used to protect system. This thesis also lists the available <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerants</b> on the market <b>and</b> briefly describes them. Further, it describes the important aspects related with designing, preparing and maintaining of indirect systems. This thesis is giving some clues and shows what should be done in order to reduce risks of corrosion. Effsys 2 P 2 projec...|$|R
40|$|As well known, A chiller is a {{refrigeration}} system that cools a process fluid typically water, which is further used in {{commercial and industrial}} ways for process cooling or air-conditioning. With the help of such systems water can be cooled to temperatures as low as 5 °C (~ 40 °F) and pumped through a hydraulic circuit to reach the process equipment or the air handling units. Rather than water some other suitable primary <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerants</b> are {{also be used for}} such refrigeration purposes. For still lower temperatures glycol or brine solution may be used (also known as <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerants).</b> A chiller would use either a vapour compression or absorption cycle to cool. Once cooled or chilled water is used in air-conditioning applications for cooling/dehumidification and thus creating comfortable and productive environments. A large amount of power is required to operate these system.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a model of}} a shell-and-tube evaporator using R 1234 yf and R 134 a as working fluids. The model uses the effectiveness-NTU method to predict the evaporation pressure <b>and</b> the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> fluid temperatures at the evaporator outlet, using as inputs the geometry of the evaporator, the refrigerant mass flow rate and evaporator inlet enthalpy, <b>and</b> the <b>secondary</b> fluid volumetric flow rate and evaporator inlet temperature.

40|$|The {{off-cycle}} {{refrigerant mass}} migration {{has a direct}} influence on the on-cycle performance since compressor energy is necessary to redistribute the refrigerant mass. No studies, as of today, {{are available in the}} open literature which experimentally measured the lubricant migration within a refrigeration system during cycling or stop/start transients. Therefore, experimental procedures measuring the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> lubricant migration through the major components of a refrigeration system during stop/start transients were developed and implemented. Results identifying the underlying physics are presented. The <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> lubricant migration of an R 134 a automotive A/C system-utilizing a fixed orifice tube, minichannel condenser, plate and fin evaporator, U-tube type accumulator and fixed displacement compressor-was measured across five sections divided by ball valves. Using the Quick-Closing Valve Technique (QCVT) combined with the Remove and Weigh Technique (RWT) using liquid nitrogen as the condensing agent resulted in a measurement uncertainty of 0. 4 percent regarding the total refrigerant mass in the system. The determination of the lubricant mass distribution was achieved by employing three different techniques-Remove and Weigh, Mix and Sample, and Flushing. To employ the Mix and Sample Technique a device-called the Mix and Sample Device-was built. A method to separate the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> lubricant was developed with an accuracy-after separation-of 0. 04 grams of refrigerant left in the lubricant. When applying the three techniques, the total amount of lubricant mass in the system was determined to within two percent. The combination of measurement results-infrared photography and high speed and real time videography-provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> lubricant migration during stop-start operation. During the compressor stop period, the primary refrigerant mass migration is caused by, and follows, the diminishing pressure difference across the expansion device. The <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> migration is caused by a pressure gradient as a result of thermal nonequilibrium within the system and causes only vapor phase refrigerant migration. Lubricant migration is proportional to the refrigerant mass during the primary refrigerant mass migration. During the <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration lubricant is not migrating. The start-up refrigerant mass migration is caused by an imbalance of the refrigerant mass flow rates across the compressor and expansion device. The higher compressor refrigerant mass flow rate was a result of the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator. The lubricant mass migration during the start-up was not proportional to the refrigerant mass migration. The presence of water condensate on the evaporator affected the refrigerant mass migration during the compressor stop period. Caused by an evaporative cooling effect the evaporator held 56 percent of the total refrigerant mass in the system after three minutes of compressor stop time-compared to 25 percent when no water condensate was present on the evaporator coil. Foam entrainment led to a faster lubricant <b>and</b> <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration out of the accumulator than liquid entrainment through the hole {{at the bottom of the}} U-tube. The latter was observed for when water condensate was present on the evaporator coil because-as a result of the higher amount of refrigerant mass in the evaporator before start-up-the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator ceased before the steady state refrigerant mass distribution was reached...|$|R

40|$|Today most ice rinks in Sweden use {{secondary}} refrigeration {{systems with}} a solution of calcium chloride <b>and</b> water as <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> Due to {{the large amount of}} energy such a system uses more efficient systems would be desired. An earlier study concluded in the possibilities of using carbon dioxide as <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> with copper tubes as the loops in the ice rink. Since then 3 ice rink refrigeration systems has been built with carbon dioxide in copper tubes. Excluding the ones being direct involved in those projects there is still very little knowledge about how these system works. This study has been made primarily with the aim of adding to the knowledge concerning availability <b>and</b> cost <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> to look at possibilities for improvement. A comparison between systems with carbon dioxide, calcium chloride respective ammonium solved in water has been made by using Decision Matrix. The comparison indicates that carbon dioxide is the more appropriate successor for the calcium chloride solvent. By using carbon dioxide the pump energy can be reduced considerably. With carbon dioxide there is also potential to use self circulation most of the time, and by doing so reduce the energy consumption even more. One area where knowledge seems to be lacking with carbon dioxide systems is in the ranges and availabilities of the required components. This study has shown that even if the ranges in some cases are limited it is still considerably easy to find suitable components. The price estimation made in this study estimates the total sum of the components for a carbon dioxide system at a bit over 900 000 SEK and a bit over 600 000 SEK for a system using calcium chloride. These numbers are mainly excluding costs for pipes and work. The second area where more knowledge seems to be needed is about ensuring the safety of the public while using carbon dioxide systems. The largest risk seems to be in the relatively high pressure of 3 MPa. But by using a good control system and having safety valves in all the critical spots there shouldn’t be any real risk for accidents. The risk for leakages is relatively easily countered by installing an alarm system with detectors for carbon dioxide. The large space inside an indoor ice rink also helps negotiating any leakage of carbon dioxide to the extent of possibly making it totally harmless even if undetected. ...|$|R

For this purpose, an experimental campaign was conducted on a small adsorption test bench using 13 X/water as working couple. Cooling capacities from 640 to 2000  W were measured. The DOE is a Doelhert type with two parameters: the inlet secondary fluid temperature (from 10 to 21 °C) and the filing level of refrigerant in the evaporator (from 6 to 24  cm).

The influence of ice concentration, mass flow rate, heat exchanger length and cooled fluid temperature over pumping power and heat transfer rate is studied. The ratio between heat transfer rate and pumping power is used as the evaluation parameter, which allows us to find the most favourable operation conditions for ice slurry flow. In order to assess the improvement obtained using ice slurry, results for ice slurry are compared to those obtained for carrier fluid at same inlet temperature.

40|$|Compatibility {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on motor materials to determine if exposure to the original refrigerant/mineral oil would affect compatibility of the motor materials after retrofit to the alternative refrigerant/lubricant. The motor materials were exposed at elevated temperature to the original <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> mineral oil for 500 hours, followed by exposure to the alternative <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> lubricant for 500 hours. Measurements were also taken after 168 and 336 hours. As a control, some samples {{were exposed to the}} original refrigerant/mineral oil for a total of 1000 hours. The original <b>refrigerants</b> <b>and</b> the Alternatives tested for retrofit were as follows: Most motor materials exposed to the alternative <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> lubricant (after an initial exposure to the original <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> mineral oil) were compatible with the alternative <b>refrigerant</b> <b>and</b> lubricant. The only concern was delamination and blistering of the sheet insulation containing Nomex, especially after removal of absorbed refrigerant. This was attributed to solution of the adhesive and not to the Nomex itself. Embrittlement of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) found in Mylar and Melinex sheet and sleeving insulations was initially observed, but subsequent tests under dry conditions showed that embrittlement of the PET materials was caused by moisture present during the exposure. Compatibility tests of elastomers with R- 245 ca, retrofitted from R- 11 and R- 123, showed that the nitrile was compatible with both R- 11 and R- 245 ca, but not with R- 123. The neoprene was unsatisfactory because of shrinkage in the R- 245 ca...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{full-scale}} experiments with two different conventional cooling-coils aimed for display cabinets were performed. Heat transfer and pressure drop on the liquid side for three different single phase <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerants</b> were studied <b>and</b> compared to predictions by existing correlations. Predominantly, the laminar flow regime was studied. The {{results show that}} when predicting the heat transfer performance on the liquid side of a cooling-coil the Gnielinski correlation for thermally developing flow and uniform wall temperature boundary conditions (T) leads to good agreement for 0. 0014 <x*< 0. 017 if 50 < Re < 1700, assuming a new entrance length is formed after each U-bend. In addition, these entrance lengths must also be accounted for, when predicting the pressure drop on the liquid side of the cooling-coil. The uncertainty of measurement {{can be a problem}} in this type of investigations and this has been taken into consideration when analysing the results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.
