500|$|Praise for {{the song}} was not universal. Rob Harvilla of Village Voice wrote that the track offered [...] "nothing terribly earth-shattering" [...] and thought that [...] "the {{contrast}} between Thom's dolphin-soothing calm and lyrics like 'I've seen hell upon this earth/The next one will be chemical/But they will never learn' might just <b>ruin</b> <b>your</b> lunch." [...] David Malitz of The Washington Post complained: [...] "It's a little too Sigur Ros-y and doesn't really go anywhere" [...] but acknowledged it [...] "till kept my interest for five and half minutes".|$|E
500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or <b>ruin</b> <b>your</b> life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
500|$|Salons Andrew O'Hehir {{offered a}} mixed response, characterizing {{the film as}} a [...] "lot funnier in theory than in practice, but it won't <b>ruin</b> <b>your</b> Saturday night". Salon {{appreciated}} the [...] "effortless comic chemistry" [...] between Sudeikis, Bateman and Day and singled out Bateman, Aniston and Spacey for their performances. O'Hehir was however critical of the perceived homophobia, sexism and racism. The Hollywood Reporters Kirk Honeycutt responded negatively, stating the jokes failed to be funny, stating [...] "Seth Gordon shows no flair for turning the absurdities and cartoonish characters in the script...into {{anything more than a}} collection of moments in search of laughs." [...] Karina Longworth of The Village Voice was critical of the premise, which she felt lacked any legitimate [...] "rage" [...] against the characters' bosses, stating [...] "...there's every sign that, even without these particular emasculators, Dale, Kurt and Nick would still be—for lack of a better word—total pussies." [...] Longworth felt that the humor was [...] "rarely actually laugh-out-loud funny, and never truly dark or daring". She particularly criticized the all-white, male protagonists and a plot she deemed racist and filled with [...] "stereotypes". Justin Chang of Variety praised the performance of the ensemble cast, but considered the plot to be [...] "predictably moronic, vulgar and juvenile". Chang echoed the sentiments of The Village Voice in lamenting that the film failed to pursue the premise to [...] "darker, more daring territory" [...] and faulted it for falling back on [...] "over-the-top comic exaggeration".|$|E

2500|$|A {{backwards}} {{message was}} deliberately {{inserted into the}} album by the B-52's. The message occurs in the song [...] "Detour Thru Your Mind", in the last 30 seconds of the track: Fred Schneider says (slowly and distinctly), [...] "I buried my parakeet in the backyard. Oh no, you're playing the record backwards. Watch out, you might <b>ruin</b> <b>your</b> needle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{suggestions}} that renaming efforts stem from egotism or personal pique, Stallman has responded that his interest {{is not in}} giving credit to himself but to the GNU Project: [...] "Some people think that it's because I want my ego to be fed. Of course, I'm {{not asking you to}} call it 'Stallmanix'." [...] Stallman has admitted to irritation, although he believes it to be justified in response to seeing [...] "an idealistic project stymied and made ineffective, because people don't usually give it the credit for what it has done," [...] concluding [...] "If you're an idealist like me, that can <b>ruin</b> <b>your</b> whole decade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Newspapers such as The Virginia Gazette {{published}} the proclamation in full, and patrols were organized {{to look for}} any slaves attempting to take Dunmore up on his offer. The Gazette not only criticized Dunmore for offering freedom to only those slaves belonging to revolutionaries {{who were willing to}} serve him, but also questioned whether he would be true to his word, suggesting that he would sell the escaped slaves in the West Indies. The paper therefore cautioned slaves to [...] "Be not then...tempted by the proclamation to <b>ruin</b> <b>your</b> selves." [...] As very few slaves were literate, this was more a symbolic move than anything. It was also noted that Dunmore himself was a slaveholder.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{messages}} chastise or {{poke fun}} at the listener who is playing the song backwards. One such message was included by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic in [...] "I Remember Larry", from the 1996 album Bad Hair Day, on which Yankovic lightly chastises the listener with the backmasked remark, [...] "Wow, [...] must have {{an awful lot of}} free time on your hands" [...] (...) [...] Similarly, the B-52's song [...] "Detour Through your Mind", from the 1986 LP Bouncing off the Satellites, contains the message, [...] "I buried my parakeet in the backyard. Oh no, you're playing the record backwards. Watch out, you might <b>ruin</b> <b>your</b> needle." [...] A similar message comes from the Canadian band Frozen Ghost from their 1987 self-titled debut album: [...] "You are ruining your needle!" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought I had lost my mind. This music is going to just <b>ruin</b> <b>your</b> life... it ruined your life... But it was a music that I learned from again... You wouldn't believe the people that would come to this club. They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I felt myself {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, my ex-husband and I. And I think at the time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other. And {{it got to the point}} that we didn't know each other..." [...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E
