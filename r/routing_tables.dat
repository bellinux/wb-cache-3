25|$|While {{subnetting}} {{may improve}} network performance in an organizational network, it increases routing complexity, since each locally connected subnet must {{be represented by}} a separate entry in the <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> of each connected router. However, by careful design of the network, routes to collections of more distant subnets within {{the branches of a}} tree-hierarchy can be aggregated by single routes. Variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) functionality in commercial routers made the introduction of CIDR seamless across the Internet and in enterprise networks.|$|E
25|$|The XOR metric allows Kademlia {{to extend}} <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> beyond single bits. Groups of bits {{can be placed}} in k-buckets. The group of bits are termed a prefix. For an m-bit prefix, there will be 2m-1 k-buckets. The missing k-bucket is a further {{extension}} of the routing tree that contains the node ID. An m-bit prefix reduces {{the maximum number of}} lookups from log2 n to log2m n. These are maximum values and the average value will be far less, increasing the chance of finding a node in a k-bucket that shares more bits than just the prefix with the target key.|$|E
50|$|Using the kernel {{protocol}} this internal <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> may {{be connected}} to the actual kernel <b>routing</b> <b>table.</b> This allows BIRD to export network routes from its internal <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> to the kernel <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> and optionally also learn about network routes from the kernel <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> (created externally by the administrator or by other means) and import these routes into its internal <b>routing</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
30|$|Table 1 is {{a common}} <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> with the same {{function}} as traditional routing methods. In practical scenarios, several UEs can appear near different cluster head of beacon cluster simultaneously. Obviously, this simple <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> cannot {{deal with the situation}} anymore. Some modification is necessary for the initialization <b>routing</b> <b>table.</b> Thus, we present a conversion algorithm for converting the rough <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> to a <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> based on beacon cluster combination.|$|R
30|$|<b>Routing</b> <b>table</b> (RT): <b>Routing</b> <b>table</b> {{includes}} the source routings from current node to other nodes in the network.|$|R
25|$|Internet service {{providers}} establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks {{at various levels}} of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent {{the bottom of the}} routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via peering agreements. Tier 2 and lower level networks buy Internet transit from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement multihoming to achieve redundancy and load balancing. Internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as GEANT, GLORIAD, Internet2, and the UK's national research and education network, JANET. Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of scale-free networks. Computers and routers use <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> in their operating system to direct IP packets to the next-hop router or destination. <b>Routing</b> <b>tables</b> are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols. End-nodes typically use a default route that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the Border Gateway Protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet.|$|E
25|$|Iridium routes {{phone calls}} through space. In {{addition}} to {{communicating with the}} satellite phones in its footprint, each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites, and routes data between them, to effectively create a large mesh network. There are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them. The space-based backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space {{to one of the}} earth station downlinks ("feeder links"). Station-to-station calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station. As satellites leave the area of an earth station, the <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> are updated and packets headed for the earth station are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth station. Communication between satellites and earth stations is at 20 and 30GHz.|$|E
25|$|Kademlia <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> {{consist of}} a list for each bit of the node ID. (e.g. if a node ID {{consists}} of 128 bits, a node will keep 128 such lists.) A list has many entries. Every entry in a list holds the necessary data to locate another node. The data in each list entry is typically the IP address, port, and node ID of another node. Every list corresponds to a specific distance from the node. Nodes that can go in the nth list must have a differing nth bit from the node's ID; the first n-1 bits of the candidate ID must match those of the node's ID. This means {{that it is very}} easy to populate the first list as 1/2 of the nodes in the network are far away candidates. The next list can use only 1/4 of the nodes in the network (one bit closer than the first), etc.|$|E
50|$|BIRD {{implements}} {{an internal}} <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> {{to which the}} supported protocols connect. Most of these protocols import network routes to this internal <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> and also export network routes from this internal <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> to the given protocol. This way information about network routes is exchanged among different routing protocols.|$|R
50|$|Information in the {{topology}} table may {{be inserted}} into the router's <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> and can then be used to forward traffic. If the network changes, for example, a physical link fails or is disconnected, the path will become unavailable. EIGRP is designed to detect these changes and will attempt {{to find a new}} path to the destination. The old path that is no longer available is removed from the <b>routing</b> <b>table.</b> Unlike most distance vector routing protocols, EIGRP does not transmit all the data in the router's <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> when a change is made but will only transmit the changes that have been made since the <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> was last updated. EIGRP does not send its <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> periodically, but will only send <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> data when an actual change has occurred. This behavior is more inline with link-state routing protocols, thus EIGRP is mostly considered a hybrid protocol.|$|R
5000|$|If {{there are}} {{matching}} entries but the hop count metric {{is lower than}} the one already in its <b>routing</b> <b>table,</b> then the <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> is updated with the new route.|$|R
2500|$|Packets {{from the}} IPv6 Internet to 6to4 systems must {{be sent to}} a 6to4 relay router by normal IPv6 routing methods. The {{specification}} states that such relay routers must only advertise 2002::/16 and not subdivisions of it to prevent IPv4 routes polluting the <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> of IPv6 routers. [...] From here they can then be sent over the IPv4 Internet to the destination.|$|E
50|$|BIRD also {{supports}} multiple internal <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> and multiple instances of supported protocol types. Protocols may {{be connected to}} different internal <b>routing</b> <b>tables,</b> these internal <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> may exchange information about network routes they contain (controlled by filters) and each of these internal <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> may be connected to a different kernel routing table thus allowing for policy routing.|$|E
50|$|In {{static routing}} (or non-dynamic routing), small {{networks}} may use manually configured <b>routing</b> <b>tables.</b> Larger networks have complex topologies {{that can change}} rapidly, making the manual construction of <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> unfeasible. Nevertheless, most of the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) uses pre-computed <b>routing</b> <b>tables,</b> with fallback routes if the most direct route becomes blocked (see routing in the PSTN).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} the simulation in VPI of all-optical routing {{based on the}} pulse-position modulation header processing (PPM-HP) scheme in an ultrafast photonic packet switched core network. In this network, optical core router employing PPM-HP utilizes a dedicated multi-wavelength pulseposition <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> (MW-PPRT) which results in a significant reduction {{of the number of}} <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> entries thus reducing the header processing time compared to the existing sequential <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> looking-up schemes. The reduced <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> also offers embedding multiple transmitting modes (unicast, multicast and broadcast) in an optical layer and improves scalability of the core network where the number of core/edge nodes could be altered without changing the number of <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> entries. Details of simulation schematics and results of the router operating at 100 Gbit/s are presented. I...|$|R

5000|$|Update the <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> of nodes {{neighboring}} {{the newly}} split zone.|$|E
50|$|The <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> are {{generated}} centrally {{based on the}} known topology of the network, the numbering plan, and analysis of traffic data. These are then downloaded to each exchange in the telephone operators network. Because of the hierarchical nature of the numbering plan, and its geographical basis, most calls can be routed based only on their prefix using these <b>routing</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} was later adapted {{for use in}} the contemporary link-state routing protocols IS-IS and OSPF. Cisco literature refers to enhanced interior gateway routing protocol (EIGRP) as a [...] "hybrid" [...] protocol, despite the fact it distributes <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> instead of topology maps. However, it does synchronize <b>routing</b> <b>tables</b> at start up as OSPF does, and sends specific updates only when topology changes occur.|$|E
5000|$|When a RIP router comes online, {{it sends}} a {{broadcast}} Request Message on all of its RIP enabled interfaces. All the neighbouring routers which receive the Request message respond back with the Response Message containing their <b>Routing</b> <b>table.</b> The Response Message is also gratuitously sent when the Update timer expires. On receiving the <b>Routing</b> <b>table,</b> the router processes each entry of the <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> as per the following rules ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{there are}} no route entries {{matching}} the one received then the route entry {{is added to the}} <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> automatically, along with the information about the router from which it received the <b>routing</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
40|$|IP {{addresses}} are {{allocated to}} Internet service providers (ISPs) by four Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), in turn the ISPs further assign addresses to end users. To understand the relationship, if any exists, between the address allocation {{and the global}} <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> growth, we present a quantitative analysis of the IPv 4 address allocation and growth of the global BGP <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> {{over the last four}} and half years. Our findings show that (1) the distribution of the first-advertisement-delay, which is defined as the time period between the allocation of an IP prefix and its first BGP announcement has a heavy-tail distribution, and {{a small percentage of the}} allocated address prefixes have never been used; (2) although up to 50 % of the prefixes allocated between Jan. 1, 1998 and April 30, 2002 are advertised in the global <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> with the same prefix length as allocated, most of the rest of the prefixes are advertised as longer (more specific) prefixes; (3) the IP prefix set in the global <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> has been evolving over time. More than half of the prefixes existed in the BGP <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> In January 1998 disappeared by January 2002, while 87, 941 new prefixes were added. Among the prefixes that disappeared, 77 % of them were aggregated into shorter (less specific) prefixes; (4) the impact on <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> size is highly uneven among the allocations. If we take a snapshot of the global <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> dated on April 30, 2002, more than 70 % of the <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> prefixes came from 10 % of the allocated address blocks...|$|R

2500|$|Nodes can use {{mixtures}} of prefixes in their <b>routing</b> <b>table,</b> {{such as the}} Kad Network used by eMule. [...] The Kademlia network could even be heterogeneous in <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> implementations, {{at the expense of}} complicating the analysis of lookups.|$|R
40|$|Structured P 2 P (DHT) {{networks}} {{based on}} consistent hashing functions have an inherent load balancing problem. The problem becomes more severe {{due to the}} heterogeneity of network nodes and the non-uniform and time-varying file popularity. Existing DHT load balancing algorithms are mainly focused on the issues caused by node heterogeneity. To deal with skewed lookups, this paper presents an elastic <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> (ERT) mechanism for query load balancing, based on the observation that high degree nodes tend to receive more traffic load. The mechanism allows each node to have a <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> of variable size corresponding to node capacities. The indegree and outdegree of the <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> are also adjusted dynamically {{in response to the}} change of file popularity and network churn. Theoretical analysis proves the <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> degree is bounded. The elastic <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> facilitates locality-aware randomized query forwarding to further improve lookup efficiency. By relating query forwarding to a supermarket customer service model, we prove a 2 -way randomized query forwarding policy leads to an exponential improvement in query processing time over random walking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the elastic <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> mechanism and its related query forwarding policy for congestion and query load balancing. In comparison with the existing “virtual-server”-based load balancing algorithm and other <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> control approaches, the ERT-based congestion control protocol yields significant improvement in query lookup efficiency...|$|R

40|$|When {{a network}} failure is {{detected}} by an IP router, its <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> is updated for all affected routing entries. The packet loss resulting from this event {{depends on the}} network traffic associated with the updated <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> entries. In this paper, we model this process, define packet loss minimization heuristics relying on network traffic prediction models, and show by simulation that the resulting packet loss can be reduced compared to the default <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> update process...|$|R
30|$|After the convert process, each node in {{the sensor}} network can get its own <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> {{according}} to the beacon cluster. Thus, each sensor nodes have its pre-defined <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> with different network flow directions for different destination. Sensor nodes maintain in the idle mode, and only the cluster head beacons regularly {{for the purpose of}} minimizing power consumption. Using the conversion algorithm, <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> of node # 0 is calculated and shown in Figure 4. From the new <b>routing</b> <b>table,</b> each sensor node can decide the dissemination direction {{according to the}} priority and set of beacon cluster activated by the UE. This means each sensor nodes can make the routing decision independently.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> based on multibit trie, in other words, {{multiple}} levels of arrays (hereafter let us call it MART, Multi-Array <b>Routing</b> <b>Table)</b> has a very low and deterministic search cost of modestly higher memory consumption compared to other <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> approaches. The search cost of MART is typically 2 to 4 <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> memory accesses for IPv 4. MART has the additional benefits that {{it is easy to}} implement in hardware and its determinism allows for pipelining route lookups in hardware. The primary drawback of MART is that update operations, namely adding and deleting routes, are highly costly relative to the route lookup operation. In particular, MART has a problem at deletion which no paper has addressed. This paper proposes an extension to MART, called "Smart Multi-Array Routing Table" or just SMART, which gives a solution for this issue. SMART not only has the low cost and determinism of route lookups but also provides low cost route update operations, which always have lower than 256 <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> memory accesses regardless of both the number of routes in the <b>routing</b> <b>table</b> and the prefix length for IPv 4...|$|R
