25|$|Jain {{cosmology}} is {{the description}} of the shape and functioning of the Universe (loka) and its constituents (such as living beings, matter, space, time etc.) according to Jainism. Jain cosmology considers the universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, having neither beginning nor end. Jain texts describe the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> waist. This Universe, according to Jainism, is broad at the top, narrow at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.|$|E
25|$|A woman's legs {{can remain}} flat or raised toward her chest, or {{wrapped around the}} {{penetrating}} partner at various heights: {{at the back of}} the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the Wiener Auster or Viennese oyster. In the higher leg positions the woman's legs may need some support, which may be achieved by crossing the ankles behind the partner or <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulders. She may also hold them with her hands or cross her arms around them at the knees. Some are flexible enough to cross the legs behind their heads. Alternatively, her partner may hold her legs up. Separating straight legs carry the risk of muscle pull of thigh muscles. The laying by the partner on raised legs puts excessive pressure on the woman's back.|$|E
25|$|Richard Griffin {{was born}} August 31, 1916. He was a 29-year-old war veteran who was {{discharged}} from the Seabees in November 1945. He was a carpenter and painter and handled his own contracting. He was living with his mother, Mrs. R. H. Griffin, at 155 Robison Courts which was built for servicemen returning from World War II and has since been demolished. Griffin attended school in Linden, Texas and Union Chapel, Cass County. He was last seen alive around 10 p.m. on Saturday, March 23, in a West 7th street (US Highway 67 West) cafe with his sister, Eleanor, and her boyfriend J. A. Proctor. He was also seen earlier at another West 7th street cafe by friends around 2 p.m. He was found fully clothed on his knees between the front seats of his 1941 Oldsmobile sedan with his pockets turned inside out and his head <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> crossed hands. He was shot once {{in the back of}} the head.|$|E

25|$|As {{his years}} progressed, the {{numerous}} wounds Bazaine had received while serving France during his 40-year Army career caused the ex-marshal's health to deteriorate further each winter. The last years he spent alone. Pepita {{did not like}} Spain and took her daughter to Mexico. Pepita expected to receive compensation from the Mexican government {{for the loss of}} the couple's property. Meanwhile, Bazaine stayed in Spain with his two sons, could no longer pay his lodgings and moved to miserable rooms in the Calle Atocha. He had to cook for himself, and allowed himself only one luxury: a few small cigars each week. On 20 September 1888, he was found dead in his lodgings. At seventy-seven, his heart had given out. He had never fully recovered from an infection he contracted during the harsh Madrid winter of 1887/8. Bazaine’s remains were interred on 24 September 1888 in the San Justo Cemetery in Madrid, his sons and Marshal Campos attending the funeral, his sword and epaulettes <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> coffin. The officiating priest was a relative of his wife. French newspapers remained vitriolic in their reporting of the Marshal’s passing “Let his corpse be flung in to the first ditch. As for his memory, it is nailed forever to the pillory”. German papers refer to Bazaine kindly and repeat that he was wronged by his own people.|$|E
500|$|Beiderbecke {{joined the}} Wolverine Orchestra late in 1923, and the seven-man group first played a speakeasy called the Stockton Club near Hamilton, Ohio. Specializing in hot jazz and {{recoiling}} from so-called sweet music, the band took {{its name from}} {{one of its most}} frequent numbers, Jelly Roll Morton's [...] "Wolverine Blues." [...] During this time, Beiderbecke also took piano lessons from a young woman who introduced him to the works of Eastwood Lane. Lane's piano suites and [...] orchestral arrangements were self-consciously American while still having French Impressionist allusions, and the works are said to have deeply influenced Beiderbecke's style, especially on [...] "In a Mist." [...] A subsequent gig at Doyle's Dance Academy in Cincinnati became the occasion for a series of band and individual photographs that resulted in the most famous image of Beiderbecke—sitting fresh-faced, his hair perfectly combed, his horn <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> right knee.|$|E
500|$|Friends {{raised the}} money to pay the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but without their consent and {{contrary}} to their wishes. [...] As soon as Holmes discovered what was happening, he was able to forbid the payment of his fine as a matter of conscience, though friends attempted to pay for him as well. [...] As a result, Holmes was taken to the town's whipping post on 5 September 1651 and given 30 lashes with a three-corded whip. [...] He told the magistrates, [...] "You have struck me as with roses", and he claimed to have felt no pain during the incident; however, he could only sleep by <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees and elbows for many days afterwards. [...] Much later, Rhode Island Governor Joseph Jenckes wrote, [...] "Those who have seen the scars on Mr. Holmes' back (which the old man was wont to call the marks of the Lord Jesus), have expressed a wonder that he should live." ...|$|E

500|$|When Tom Norman {{first saw}} Merrick, he was {{dismayed by the}} extent of his deformities, fearing his {{appearance}} might be too horrific to be a successful novelty. Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on Whitechapel Road. Merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Norman observed Merrick asleep one morning and learned that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk [...] "waking with a broken neck". Norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by Hitchcock, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant. A pamphlet titled [...] "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick" [...] was created, outlining Merrick's life to date. This biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally accurate account of his life. It contained an incorrect date of birth but, throughout his life, Merrick was vague about when he was born.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jains, this loka or {{universe}} is an entity, always existing in varying forms with no beginning or end. Jain texts describe {{the shape of}} the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arms <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> waist. Thus, the {{universe is}} narrow at top, widens above the middle, narrows towards the middle, and once again becomes broad at the bottom.|$|E

These portraits were often set out of doors where Nature provides [...] "the most suitable background for spiritual contemplation" [...] or in a gloomy interior.|$|E

Hidaka, astonished, heard the dictator requesting that the Japanese Prime Minister, General Tojo, contact Hitler and convince him {{to reach an agreement}} with Stalin, and that otherwise Italy would be forced to abandon the alliance. In the afternoon, he visited the San Lorenzo quarter to observe the damage from the bombing. Afterwards, he had a frugal meal at Villa Torlonia. While he was <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sofa, his wife Donna Rachele told him not to go to the appointment, since the King could not be trusted. She concluded by telling him: [...] "You won’t be back", but he replied that the King was his best friend.|$|E

The following week, The Guardian noted that Gervais had responded with [...] "an exhilaratingly foul-mouthed tirade" [...] on his website, concluding with the sentence [...] "yes I am resting on my fucking laurels you cunt!" [...] In this video, Gervais mocked Jim Shelley typing the words [...] "resting on his laurels" [...] as Gervais jokingly lashed out by stating that he was <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> laurels {{and that he was}} not going to make another show for television, quipping: [...] "What's the point?

2500|$|The {{other work}} for which Bouré is most noted shows a strikingly {{different}} {{side of the}} artist. The white marble Le lézard or L'enfant au lezard, not quite 4 feet long and about 2 feet high (overall 61.5 by 118.5 by 39cm), depicts a nude boy lying on his stomach, ankles crossed, <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> left elbow {{with his right hand}} cocked inquisitively as he directs his absorbed gaze down at a small lizard. Bouré created this délicieux morceau during the period 1872–1874. It was praised for its fine modeling and lifelike expression, its charm and grace of attitude, and the [...] "rare suppleness of its lines." [...] Le lézard was not uniformly admired. One critic noted its [...] "poverty of imagination" [...] and thinness of execution, while admitting other qualities.|$|E
2500|$|Richard L. Griffin, age 29, and {{his girlfriend}} of six weeks, Polly Ann Moore, age 17, were found dead in Griffin's 1941 Oldsmobile sedan on Sunday, March 24, 1946 between 8:30 and 9:00a.m. by a passing {{motorist}}. The motorist saw the parked car on a lovers' lane named Rich Road (now South Robison) near a railroad spur 100yards south of US Highway 67 West close to a nightspot called Club Dallas. At that time, Club Dallas was about [...] west outside the city limits. The motorist at first {{thought that they were}} asleep. Griffin was found between the front seats on his knees with his head <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> crossed hands, and his pockets were turned inside out. Moore was found sprawled face-down in the back seat. Griffin had been shot twice while still in the car and both had been shot once {{in the back of the}} head and were fully clothed. Moore's purse was beside her in the back seat and contained the photo of her that was used in the following morning's paper. The motorist contacted the city police who then contacted Bowie County Sheriff W. H. Presley. According to a police report written by Arkansas State Trooper Max Tackett, one of the lead investigators of the Phantom cases, Moore was killed on a blanket in front of the vehicle before being placed back inside.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight next saw the Colonel in {{the main}} {{dining room of the}} Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the close of his 1915 season. Cody was having breakfast with his wife and McCreight joined them for a chat. McCreight was {{surprised}} at the Colonel’s appearance. He had aged greatly since their last meeting. His hair was a mass of straggling, wispy white and his face was deeply wrinkled. “We talked about Iron Tail's death, and Cody almost wept in his grief. He keenly regretted not receiving my wire, believing as I did that the ailing chief might have recovered among friends at The Wigwam. Tactfully I changed the subject.” “He said that he would go out again for the 1916 season, and hoped to see us at the Wigwam on that roundup. But the old Colonel was about {{at the end of the}} long trail.” [...] McCreight’s last meeting with Buffalo Bill was in 1916. “He went out as promised at the start of the 1916 campaign and I saw him at the end of the last performance. Going to his tent at the rear of the show-grounds, I found him lying on his blankets, with his snowy head <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> saddle. He was asleep, but roused at once at my greeting. He arose, shook hands, and immediately spoke of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, he said he was going to put a granite stone on the chief's grave, with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento. Cody's voice trembled as he again expressed his great regret at not receiving my telegram that might have saved Iron Tail's life. I was shocked and saddened to observe how feeble he was. I helped him to his feet, guided him to his private car and saw him to his berth. I shook hands with him for the last time. Not long after, Buffalo Bill went to his last long sleep.” [...] Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on Lookout Mountain, west of Denver, Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran Show Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the buffalo, and the scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West. Chief Flying Hawk's dear friends Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail had gone to the Sand Hills.|$|E
