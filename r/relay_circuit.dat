The Vanguard series delivered transport capabilities of multiplexing voice, legacy protocols, and IP Routing over a single Frame <b>Relay</b> <b>circuit</b> using Annex G protocol derived from X.25. The product's popularity {{led to its}} expansion of a managed services unit where existing router customers were given the option to have their network monitored in real time for Frame Relay outages, and hardware failures.

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, relay {{circuits}} {{began to be}} more widely used in automatics, defense of electric and communications systems. Every <b>relay</b> <b>circuit</b> schema for practical use was a distinct invention, because the general principle of simulation of these systems was not known. Shestakov's credit (and independently later Claude Shannon's) is {{the general theory of}} logical simulation, inspired by the rapidly increasing complexity of technical demands. Logical simulation requires solid mathematical foundations. Namely these foundations were originally established by Shestakov.|$|E

50|$|The use of relays for {{the logical}} control of complex {{switching}} systems like telephone exchanges was studied by Claude Shannon, who formalized {{the application of}} Boolean algebra to <b>relay</b> <b>circuit</b> design in A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. Relays can perform the basic operations of Boolean combinatorial logic. For example, the boolean AND function is realised by connecting normally open relay contacts in series, the OR function by connecting normally open contacts in parallel. Inversion of a logical input {{can be done with}} a normally closed contact. Relays were used for control of automated systems for machine tools and production lines. The Ladder programming language is often used for designing relay logic networks.|$|E
5000|$|No current: A {{dry contact}} is the synonym of volt free - {{it is not}} [...] "wetted" [...] by a voltage source. Dry contact can refer to a {{secondary}} set of contacts of a <b>relay</b> <b>circuit</b> which does not make or break the primary current being controlled by the relay. Usually some other contacts or devices have the job of starting or stopping the primary current being controlled. For example, a reed relay matrix switch is normally switched with all contacts dry. After the contacts are all connected, a wire spring relay is energized and connects a supervisory scan point, or main switch, through which the primary current being controlled then flows. Dry contacts are primarily employed in 49 volt or less (low voltage) distribution circuits.|$|E

50|$|If {{the yellow}} light in signal 24 fails, the signal {{displays}} a higher speed indication, {{which would be}} a wrong-side failure. To prevent this, a current transformer in the lamp circuit monitors the current through the yellow lamp. If the yellow lamp fails, a relay will also switch off the green light and the signal becomes totally dark. A capacitor in the <b>relay</b> <b>circuit</b> ensures that the relay operation is a couple of seconds delayed, to prevent the relay operating for every blink. Hence, if the yellow lamp do suddenly fail, the green light will blink alone 1-2 times before it is switched off by the relay. Note: The animated picture of signal 24 is wrongly giving the impression that the yellow light is show before the green one. This is not correct: The yellow and green light is always switched on and off simultaneously, for every blink/flash.|$|E

A <b>relay</b> logic <b>circuit</b> is an electrical network consisting of lines, or rungs, in which each line or rung must have continuity to enable the output device. A typical circuit consists of a number of rungs, with each rung controlling an output.
