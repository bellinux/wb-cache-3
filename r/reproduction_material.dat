40|$|Breeding of {{coniferous}} {{trees in the}} Czech Republic is undergoing an important development during last decades, especially thanks to molecular-genetic methods, which refine and simplify mapping of tree genotypes and the selection of superior genotypes. Recently, in the Czech Republic superior genotypes are selected based on forestry parameters (tree height, trunk diameter, and timber quality) what does not always correlate with {{the ability of a}} tree to resist abiotic and biotic stresses. Recently, there is an effort to include in the breeding also physiological parameters and select superior genotypes using nonspecific stress indicators, which are able to correspond better to tree fitness than the forestry growth parameters.

40|$|Introduction. Even though placentas from {{assisted}} reproduction programs often differ from placentas {{of women who}} conceived naturally, they are rarely examined. The aim of our investigation was to determine some gross characteristics of placentas of women who conceived with assisted <b>reproduction.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods. We examined 30 placentas from an {{assisted reproduction}} program (20 from in vitro fertilization and 10 from intrauterine insemination) and 30 placentas of women who conceived naturally. All women were age matched. All the women were at term. Results. The mean weight of placentas from assisted reproduction program was 573 g and of those after natural conception - 582. 67 g. The mean length of the umbilical cords was 64. 3 cm after assisted reproduction and 66. 3 cm after natural conception. The mean placenta thickness after assisted reproduction was 2, 22 cm and after natural conception 2. 28 cm. Eight pla­centas of the study group had a marginal insertion of the umbilical cord, which lead to {{a statistically significant difference}} when compared to placentas of women who conceived naturally: χ² = 7. 07; p> 0. 01. Discussion. Marginal cord insertion into the placenta after assisted reproduction is also often described in the literature (as a possible "consequence " of embryo-transfer). Conclusion. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean weight and dimensions of placentas, length of the umbilical cord, gross pathological features of placentas and cords, mean birth weight of babies and placental/fetal ratios between women from assisted reproduction program and those who conceived naturally. ...|$|E
40|$|Study {{was carried}} out for {{establishing}} the optimal sex ratio in Muscovy duck breeding. Four variants of {{the ratio of the}} male to the female individuals were tested: 1 : 5 (I), 1 : 6 (II), 1 : 7 (III) and 1 : 8 (IV). In the frames of each sex ratio (variant), two subgroups (sub-variants) were formed with the aim of establishing the effect of the hierarchy relations among the drakes on egg fertility: with one male in a group (A) and with more than one male in a group (B). The highest egg fertility – 97. 09 % was achieved at 1 : 5 sex ratio (with more than one drake in a group) and the lowest – 93. 41 % at 1 : 8 sex ratio (with a single male in a group). Signifi cant decrease in egg fertility was registered when increasing the sex ratio to 1 : 8, that effect being displayed more weakly at more than one male in the group. When increasing the ratio, the presence of more than one drake in the family group exerted a positive infl uence on egg fertility, due to the preference of the males to certain females and the distribution {{of the rest of the}} females among the drakes placed in the hierarchy below the “alpha”, depending on their grade in the hierarchy order. The most appropriate sex ratio for Muscovy duck species was 1 : 5, and, when there was shortage of the male <b>reproduction</b> <b>material,</b> 1 : 6 ratio was also acceptable, especially if more than one drakes were placed in the family group (effect of supporting the alpha) ...|$|E

40|$|Background. Our {{society is}} {{increasingly}} using equipment that produces and emits non-ionizing electromagnetic fields (EMF), and {{little is known}} regarding exposure to such fields and the possible impact on male reproductive health. The main objective of this thesis is to gain more knowledge regarding the possible influence of nonionizing EMFs on male <b>reproduction.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods. The Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN) had specific concerns regarding non-ionizing EMFs and reproductive health, as there were worries related to work on-board a specific vessel, namely the “Kongelig Norsk Marine (KNM) Kvikk”. Papers I and II {{were the result of}} cross-sectional studies conducted among all employees in the RNoN in 2002 by means of questionnaires. Paper I used self-reported exposures, and the questionnaire included variables regarding work history, physical health characteristics, education, diseases and reproductive health. In paper II the same questionnaire was used, and an expert panel categorized 18 work categories among the military men in the RNoN in terms of exposure or non-exposure to non-ionizing EMFs. Paper III was a dosimeter study on electric (E) fields on-board two vessels in the RNoN, a missile-torpedo boat (MTB) and a submarine. Personnel on-board wore the instrument in their breast pocket during their shifts and answered questions regarding location on-board and work tasks performed. In addition, the vessel’s activity and use of non-ionizing EMF-emitting equipment was noted. Paper IV was a prospective randomized balanced cross-over study of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and influence on hormones relevant for male reproduction. Twenty-four male medical students who met a number of inclusion criteria were investigated by means of serum-blood samples immediately before and after a real and sham MRI investigation. Results. Response rate in the cross-sectional studies (Paper I and II) was 58 per cent (n= 2265) among all personnel (military and civilian personnel) and 63 per cent (n= 1487) among the military men. The prevalence ratio (PR) of having a child with congenital anomaly was 4. 0 (confidence interval (CI) 1. 9 - 8. 6) among the personnel who had served on-board the “KNM Kvikk”. Among the same personnel, the PR of having a stillborn child or a child that died within one week of birth was 4. 1 (CI 1. 7 - 9. 9). In paper II, three work categories were classified as exposed to non-ionizing EMFs: “tele/communication”, “radar/sonar” and “electronics”. Logistic regression adjusted for age, whether the subject had ever smoked, military education and physical exercise at work displayed an increased odds ratio (OR) of 1. 72 (CI 1. 04 - 2. 85) among “tele/communication” workers and OR of 2. 28 (CI 1. 27 - 4. 09) among “radar/sonar” workers for self-reported infertility compared to unexposed workers. “Electronics” did not display an increased OR for self-reported infertility compared to the unexposed workers. In paper III, a total of 56 measurements were conducted on Efields on-board two vessels in the RNoN. The E-field values measured were very low, averaging 0 – 10 per cent of the guidelines given by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In paper IV, there was no change seen in hormone levels either immediately after exposure or within the next 11 days when persons exposed to real and sham MRI were compared. Conclusion. Paper I displayed an increased PR for having children with congenital anomalies, stillbirths or perinatal deaths after having served on-board a specific MTB vessel in the RNoN. Paper II showed an increased OR for self-reported experience of infertility among personnel serving in work categories categorized as being exposed to non-ionizing EMFs. Paper III investigated and described very low exposure for Efields measured on-board two RNoN vessels. Paper IV did not find evidence for a significant impact on hormones relevant for male reproduction after exposure in MRI. This thesis could not establish non-ionizing EMFs as a cause for the findings in paper I and II. Furthermore, the studies could not explain the findings using other factors. The difference in exposure levels and duration may be of importance, as well as confounding factors that have not been investigated in this thesis. </p...|$|E

The patient information including COH regi-mens, serum estradiol measurement, transvaginal sono-graphic scanning for ovarian follicles, oocyte retreival, and embryo transfer were recorded from the patient files retro-spectively.
