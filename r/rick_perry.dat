5|$|As Alex neared {{hurricane}} strength on {{the evening}} of June28, a hurricane warning was issued for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande. The Mexican government also issued a hurricane warning from the Rio Grande south to La Cruz. A tropical storm warning was posted for coastal Texas from Baffin Bay northward to Port O'Connor. Governor of Texas <b>Rick</b> <b>Perry</b> declared a state of disaster in 19 counties and ordered the deployment of Texas Military Forces personnel (including 80 citizen-soldiers of the Texas State Guard Medical Brigade) to the Rio Grande Valley. President Barack Obama also declared a state of emergency, freeing federal funds for 25 counties in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Governor <b>Rick</b> <b>Perry</b> {{activated}} the National Guard and mobilized emergency personnel {{to the region}} expected {{to be affected by}} the storm. Erin was expected to bring flooding to the region, which had already been declared a disaster area on August 7, 2007 due to widespread flooding on the Nueces River basin; this area remained flooded as of August 15, 2007. On August 15, oil futures rose to $74.01 (USD), due to fears of Erin disrupting oil supplies produced on Texan coasts, combined with low oil inventories. As a result of the threat from the storm, Shell Oil Company evacuated 188workers on oil platforms in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Hours after Humberto made landfall, <b>Rick</b> <b>Perry</b> {{declared}} Galveston, Jefferson, and Orange counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{state resources}} {{to assist the}} affected residents. The governor applied for a presidential disaster declaration on September 21. Four Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams assessed the hurricane damage in the three most affected counties. Following their assessment, they determined that {{the damage caused by}} Humberto was not significant enough to require a disaster declaration. As such, Governor Rick Perry's request from FEMA was denied. Across the Bolivar Peninsula, an estimated 1,500 cubic yards of structural debris and 3,000 cubic yards of tree limbs were needed to be removed {{in the wake of the}} storm.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to moving}} ashore, {{officials}} in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, advised residents in low-lying or flood-prone areas to consider {{moving to a}} safer location. A shelter was opened in Lake Charles, where 29people stayed during the storm. Flood watches and warnings were issued for portions of Mississippi and Louisiana as the storm tracked across the region. Texas Governor <b>Rick</b> <b>Perry,</b> prepared state resources for the potentially impacted areas, including the deployment of 200 Texas Military Forces soldiers and six Black Hawk helicopters and two water rescue teams for search and rescue missions. The Texas State Operations Center was activated shortly after the cyclone developed.|$|E
5|$|Romney raised $56million during 2011, {{more than}} double the amount raised by any of his Republican opponents, and refrained from {{spending}} his own money on the campaign. He initially pursued a low-key, low-profile strategy. Michele Bachmann staged a brief surge in polls, which preceded a poll surge in September 2011 by <b>Rick</b> <b>Perry</b> who had entered the race the month before. Perry and Romney exchanged sharp criticisms of each other during a series of debates among the Republican candidates. The October 2011 decisions of Chris Christie and Sarah Palin not to run effectively settled the field of candidates. Perry faded after poor performances in those debates, while Herman Cain's 'long-shot' bid gained popularity until allegations of sexual misconduct derailed it.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil {{evacuated}} about 40{{workers from}} drilling operations. BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms {{in the western}} and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas. Governor of Texas <b>Rick</b> <b>Perry</b> issued a disaster declaration for 17Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200National Guard troops, a 70member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas. Under the order, about 200buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Dow Chemical shut down their plants in Clear Lake and La Porte. The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August4. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks.|$|E

5|$|The Secretaría de Gobernación {{declared}} a state of emergency in 21 of Nuevo León's 51 municipalities, freeing federal disaster funds for use in aid operations. An additional 10 municipalities were placed under the state of emergency on July8. A similar declaration was made for 8 municipalities in Oaxaca, and for 14 municipalities in Tamaulipas; the state of emergency in Tamaulipas was later expanded to 30 municipalities. Mexican President Felipe Calderón requested adding resources to the federal disaster fund, as the $3 billion (2010 MXN; $235 million USD) it held would not be sufficient to face the damage in Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. In the months following the storm, a total of $4.8 billion (2010 MXN; $375 million USD) was released by the federal and state governments to aid in the reconstruction of the disaster areas in Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. In Texas, Governor <b>Rick</b> <b>Perry</b> activated the state's search and rescue capabilities in Laredo and San Antonio. This activation was due to the flooding on the Rio Grande Valley, which was expected to worsen due to the approach of Tropical Depression Two to the area affected by Alex.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness {{activated}} its Crisis Action Team on August 16 {{to monitor}} the storm and coordinate preparation. Governor of Louisiana Kathleen Blanco {{declared a state of}} emergency early on the evening of August 17, asking for a presidential emergency declaration to give Louisiana access to federal funds prior to any landfall. Texas Governor <b>Rick</b> <b>Perry</b> declared Dean to be an imminent threat to the state, and thus initiated a full-scale hurricane preparedness effort on August 17 when the storm was at least five days away. Prior to the storm, Texas suffered severe flooding from several June–July storms, and Tropical Storm Erin left the ground still saturated. Governor Perry feared that more rainfall from Dean would cause additional flash flooding, and had 250 Texas Parks and Wildlife Department crews on standby with boats to assist in potential evacuations. He was willing to deploy up to 10,000 Texas Military Forces soldiers, and did deploy several elements of the Texas State Guard who set up emergency shelters. The Texas fuel industry began surging fuel loads to coastal counties to ensure adequate fuel in the event of the hurricane causing a disruption to the fuel distribution system. In anticipation of evacuations, the Texas Department of Transportation began working on extra evacuation lanes and contraflow. NASA cut short the STS-118 mission as a precaution, in case Dean approached Mission Control at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. To that effect, mission managers cut the mission's final spacewalk short by two hours, allowing them to land a day earlier than originally planned.|$|E
