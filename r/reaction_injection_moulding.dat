50|$|The {{reacting}} {{system is}} formulated {{in such a}} way that two components need to be mixed at equal volume (1:1 ratio). Both components contain mainly DCPD with some additional additives. The difference between both components is crucial, but constitutes only a small fraction of the total formulation: the catalyst system is divided into two parts, each part going into a separate component. When both components are mixed, the complete catalyst system is recombined and becomes active. This is an important difference from other <b>Reaction</b> <b>Injection</b> <b>Moulding</b> (RIM) systems like polyurethane, since the reaction is not stoichiometric. The 1:1 ratio for DCPD moulding is not critical since this is not a combination of two different chemical elements to form a specific matrix. Significant changes in ratio will slow down the system's reactivity because fewer active reaction nuclei are being formed. This also changes the final properties somewhat. The current industrial pumps used on RIM equipment are accurate enough to ensure that the mixing ratio stays within the necessary limits.|$|E
40|$|Impending {{legislation}} and increasing landfill tax {{will mean that}} afar greater proportion of thermosetting polymers {{will have to be}} recycled. This paper investigates a method for the mechanical recycling of thermoset polyurethane. <b>Reaction</b> <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> (RIM) polyurethane (PU) was granulated and introduced as filler in novel moulding compounds. The polyurethane recyclate granules were compounded with polyester resin for compression moulding. A variety of different materials were moulded to demonstrate the recycling possibilities, these included non-reinforced filled thermoset, glass fibre reinforced compounds and sandwich materials with a core containing recyclate. Mechanical testing of the materials showed that the addition of polyurethane recyclate increased flexibility and toughness of the mouldings, when compared with compounds containing mineral fillers. The increased toughness is explained by the microstructure, the PU granules rubber toughen the resin by allowing micro-cracking of the thermoset resin matrix without brittle failure. Recycled polyurethane particles can be used as functional filler in thermoset-moulding compounds to improve the impact toughness of normally brittle materials. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

An expert system approach has been rued to derive the process solution for <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> over the past few years.

Design/methodology/approach: Powder metallurgy, powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding,</b> sintering, microstructure examination, symulation of <b>injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> Findings: Simulation of powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> was preceded by the rheological tests, which made obtaining possible of the data indispensable for modelling, pertaining to the polymer-powder slurry viscosity. The portion of particles reinforcing the composite is usually lower than powder portion in mixtures used for forming and next binding agent degradation and sintering. The big powder portion is often the reason for the high viscosity of the mixture and problems with its forming.

40|$|The {{effects of}} fluid {{viscoelasticity}} on {{the expansion of}} gas bubbles in polymer foams for both non-reactive and reactive polymers are investigated. Polymer foams are used extensively in consumer products, from car parts to upholstery. They are produced either by injection moulding (of non-reactive polymeric fluids) or <b>reaction</b> <b>injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> We use standard rheological models (Oldroyd B and Pompom) to investigate bubble growth driven by gas diffusion {{as a model for}} injection moulding. To model <b>reaction</b> <b>injection</b> <b>moulding,</b> we develop a new fluid model based on existing linear theory for a gelling liquid. In this case gas is produced as a by-product of the polymer reaction. At small bubble volume fractions gas bubbles remain spherical and isolated from neighbouring bubbles during expansion. In this regime we demonstrate the effects of rheology and gelation on the bubble growth. At high bubble volume fractions neighbouring bubbles compete for the available gas and become distorted in shape. The effects of viscoelasticity on the expansion of gas bubbles arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal array in a non-reacting polymeric fluid are investigated. In addition to a full finite element calculation of the two-dimensional flow, two one-dimensional approximations valid in the limits of small and large gas area fractions are presented. We show that these approximations give accurate predictions of the evolution of the bubble area, but give less accurate predictions of the bubble shape. Finally we consider how bubbles of different sizes evolve in an expanding foam. We illustrate how the surface tension driven phenomenon known as Ostwald Ripening causes large bubbles to grow at the expense of smaller ones. For the case of bubbles of two different sizes we examine the effects of viscoelasticity on the shapes of the bubbles within the structure and show that viscoelasticity has a different effect on the bubble size distribution depending upon the initial geometry.
