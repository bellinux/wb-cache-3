5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{colonisation}} of the Pacific islands and eventually Australia by the Acrocephalus warblers from Asia was complex, with multiple colonisations of even remote archipelagos.

5|$|In 2013, Steam {{began to}} accept player reviews of games. Other users can {{subsequently}} rate these reviews as helpful, humorous, or otherwise unhelpful, {{which are then}} used to highlight the most useful reviews on the game's Steam store page. Steam also aggregates these reviews and enable users to sort products based on this feedback while browsing the store. In May 2016, Steam further broke out these aggregations between all reviews overall and those made more <b>recently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last 30 days, a change Valve acknowledges to how game updates, particularly those in Early Access, can alter {{the impression of a}} game to users. To prevent observed abuse of the review system by developers or other third-party agents, Valve modified the review system in September 2016 to discount review scores for a game from users that activated the product through a product key rather than directly purchased by the Steam score, though their reviews remain visible. Alongside this, Valve announced that it would end business relations with any developer or publisher that they have found to be abusing the review system.|$|E

The club first played in Europe for the 1964–65 European season in the European Cup, and most <b>recently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2017–18 European season in the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Champions League.

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the teams is deeply {{embedded}} in British football hooliganism lore and culture, and has been depicted in films that focused specifically on the animosity between the clubs' two hooligan firms, the Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers. Violence has occurred sporadically between the fans, once resulting {{in the death of}} a Millwall supporter in 1976. Most <b>recently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2009 Upton Park riot, widespread disorder between supporters in and around West Ham's Upton Park ground led to numerous injuries and a Millwall fan being stabbed before the match began. In the last two games between the sides in the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure the games were trouble-free.|$|E

5|$|The wartime {{authorities}} in both Britain and America produced {{a wide variety}} of documentary films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda. Newsreels, ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised. More <b>recently,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Iran-Iraq War, Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.|$|E
5|$|Watford's biggest ever {{competitive}} win came in 1900, {{when the}} team defeated Maidenhead 11–0 in the Southern League Second Division. The team's biggest Football League winning margin is 8–0; this first occurred in a Third Division South match against Newport County in 1924, and was repeated in a First Division match against Sunderland in 1982. Both of these matches were at home – Watford have won an away league match by five goals on six occasions, most <b>recently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 6–1 win against Leeds United at Elland Road in 2012. The most goals scored in a Football League game involving Watford is 11, in Watford's 7–4 victories against Swindon Town, Torquay United and Burnley in 1934, 1937 and 2003 respectively.|$|E
5|$|France, {{friendly}} towards both Russia and Austria, {{suggested a}} series of territorial adjustments, in which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia, and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland (Warmia) {{and parts of the}} Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a Polish fief already under Baltic German hegemony. King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia, gained <b>recently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Silesian Wars. He was, however, also interested in finding a peaceful solution– his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria, and the Seven Years' War had left Prussia's treasury and army weakened. He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire, which could be advantageously utilized {{in the event of a}} Prussian war either with Russia or Austria. Frederick's brother, Prince Henry, spent the winter of 1770–71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg. As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 (violating the Treaty of Lubowla), Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land, such as Ermland. After Henry informed Frederick of the proposal, the Prussian monarch suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria, Prussia, and Russia, with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the recent changes in balance of power, Austria. Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and dysfunctional Poland instead of the Ottomans. Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter-proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing Silesia to Austria, but this plan was rejected by Frederick.|$|E
