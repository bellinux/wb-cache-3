5|$|Having {{become the}} Goblin, he {{generally}} views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He {{goes out of}} his way to <b>remind</b> others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to <b>remind</b> those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the Human Torch, despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself.|$|E

50|$|Finally, Uma tackles {{the raging}} {{conflict}} between Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan. She scans his expenses and <b>reminds</b> him that costs are actually reduced when items are obtained in larger quantities. She also <b>reminds</b> him that Ammaiyappan does not charge rent. She also <b>reminds</b> {{him of his}} filial responsibilities. In the meantime, Kannamma <b>reminds</b> Ammaiyappan that his family is all he has, {{and that he should}} think of his children and grandchildren as his legacy and not his adversaries. Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan are finally reconciled.|$|R
5|$|Whedon's use {{of music}} in his {{television}} shows has been regarded as 'filmic', in {{that he has been}} argued to use it to <b>remind</b> viewers at 'pivotal moments' of earlier events, resulting in a tighter continuity throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his work}} took him from Silverton, for the {{remainder}} of his life, Davenport was often melancholy for his native Oregon, and in writing to relatives there, he repeatedly told them not to send him anything that would <b>remind</b> him of Silverton, because he would be plunged into despair.|$|E
5|$|Cortana has a {{built in}} system of {{reminders}} which for example can {{be associated with}} a specific contact; it will then <b>remind</b> the user when in communication with that contact, possibly at a specific time or when the phone is in a specific location. Originally these reminders were specific to the device Cortana was installed on, but since Windows 10 Microsoft synchronises reminders across devices.|$|E

40|$|An early {{paper that}} {{explored}} personal information management (PIM) described two general needs for personal information management behaviors at work [1]. The first, finding, {{as it relates}} to search, has been explored in some depth. The second, <b>reminding,</b> has hardly been explored at all although it was clearly important to the subjects studied. <b>Reminding,</b> in digital environments, isn’t about searching- it is about triggering memory, managing tasks, and learning from experience. This paper briefly explores the notion of <b>reminding</b> and describes ongoing research under the M 2 project that will examine the role of <b>reminding</b> {{as it relates to}} how college students utilize personal documents in a learning environment...|$|R

Transfer to railway services is available at Jernbanetorget (to Oslo S) and Nationaltheatret, the latter with a considerably shorter walk.|$|E

5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to <b>remind</b> drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E
5|$|Cartman {{frequently}} teases Kenny {{for being}} poor, and derides Kenny's family {{for being on}} welfare. He will also use an awkward pause during a conversation {{as an opportunity to}} casually <b>remind</b> Kenny that he hates him. Cartman's mischievous treatment of Butters Stotch, and the relationship the duo shares has received significant focus in the more recent seasons of the series. This reflects Parker's interest; the scenes between the two are the ones he most enjoys writing.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 a Suffrage Pilgrimage was organised, to {{end with}} a rally in Hyde Park, London on 26 July. It {{was an attempt to}} <b>remind</b> the public of the larger {{constitutional}} and non-militant wing of the movement, and routes were planned from 17 British towns and cities, including Wales. Twenty-eight members from Welsh NUWSS branches left from Bangor on 2 July travelling through Wales where they were met with both support and hostility. A further branch left Cardiff on 7 July.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDementia occurs {{much more}} {{frequently}} in the elders who exhibit impairments of memory, thought and reasoning. In this paper, we present a hybrid context-aware <b>reminding</b> framework intended to help elders with mild dementia improve their level of independence and quality of life. Based on the user study in three different pilot sites, the <b>reminding</b> services are identified and classified into four types according to the nature and urgency. The framework with a novel scheduling mechanism is designed which handles both synchronous time-based and asynchronous event-based <b>reminding</b> services. In order to facilitate {{the interaction between the}} caregivers and system, we also provide a simple software tool for caregivers to create and edit the <b>reminding</b> services. Finally, we present some initial implementation result...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{context-aware}} <b>reminding</b> system to assist dementia elders for their daily activities. We particularly {{focus on the}} issue of conflict detecting and handling in the real-world <b>reminding</b> applications. We adopt a planning approach to describe the constraints of reminders, and transform the constraints into temporal constraint graph for reminder conflict detecting. In real-time reminder scheduling, we define three disruptive activities, and present a context-aware <b>reminding</b> strategy to handle the conflicts between pre-planned and disruptive activities. Finally, the system prototype is introduced...|$|R
5|$|In Harry Patch's book The Last Fighting Tommy, {{the author}} claims that Allingham planned {{to leave his}} body to medical science. In his own book, Kitchener's Last Volunteer, Allingham {{confirmed}} that he was intending to leave his body to medical science. However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change his mind, as he {{became a symbol of}} World War I to <b>remind</b> people of the sacrifices made during the conflict. To that end he agreed to a funeral and cremation.|$|E
5|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} Andini {{stated that}} she considered The Mirror Never Lies and the Bajau people symbols of unity; she expressed that the sea should not separate the {{different ethnic groups}} in the nation, but serve to connect them.

5|$|In many human {{cultures}}, {{the act of}} premastication {{and direct}} mouth-to-mouth feeding is linked with the showing of affection, known as kiss feeding. In the Manus cultures of the Admiralty Islands, the act of premastication {{has been used by}} a women to <b>remind</b> children and descendants of their obligations to her. Some human cultures such as the people of Papua New Guinea in fact use mouth to mouth contact primarily for feeding premasticated food, with sexual kissing only observed after the arrival of Europeans. This form of feeding is believed to have evolved into the modern human acts of kissing and French kissing.|$|E
