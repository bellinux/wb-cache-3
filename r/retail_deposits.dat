5|$|The cost {{of deposit}} {{insurance}} in the UK {{is not completely}} clear as of November 2008. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) paid around £3 billion to transfer deposits from Heritable Bank and Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander to ING Direct, while the UK Treasury paid an additional £600 million to guarantee <b>retail</b> <b>deposits</b> that were higher than the FSCS limit. The Treasury also paid out £800 million to guarantee Icesave deposits that were higher than the limit. A loan of £2.2 billion to the Icelandic government is expected to cover the claims against the Icelandic DIGF relating to Icesave, while the exposure of the UK FSCS {{is expected to be}} £1–2 billion.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of <b>retail</b> <b>deposits</b> in the UK.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October, {{a number}} of private interbank credit {{facilities}} to Icelandic banks were shut down. Prime Minister Geir Haarde addressed the nation in a speech that became infamous for its portentous closing words: 'God bless Iceland'. He announced a package of new regulatory measures which were {{to be put to}} the Althing, Iceland's parliament, immediately, with the cooperation of the opposition parties. These included the power of the FME to take over the running of Icelandic banks without nationalising them, and preferential treatment for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated. In a separate measure, <b>retail</b> <b>deposits</b> in Icelandic branches of Icelandic banks were guaranteed in full. The emergency measures had been deemed unnecessary by the Icelandic government less than 24 hours earlier.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 31 December 2010, {{deposits}} {{with building}} societies {{of up to}} £50,000 per individual, per institution, were normally protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), but Nationwide and Yorkshire Building Societies negotiated a temporary change {{to the terms of}} the FSCS to protect members of the societies they acquired in late 2008/early 2009. The amended terms allowed former members of multiple societies which merge into one to maintain multiple entitlements to FSCS protection until 30 September 2009 (later extended to 30 December 2010), so (for example) a member with £50,000 in each of Nationwide, Cheshire and Derbyshire {{at the time of the}} respective mergers would retain £150,000 of FSCS protection for their funds in the merged Nationwide. On 31 December 2010 the general FSCS limit for <b>retail</b> <b>deposits</b> was increased to £85,000 for banks and building societies and the transitional arrangements in respect of building society mergers came to an end.|$|E

40|$|Measuring {{value and}} {{interest}} rate risk in retail financial markets such as the market for consumer deposits {{has proven to be}} a very difficult problem for financial firms. Standard models of value and {{interest rate risk}} (duration), based on the competitive market paradigm, are inappropriate in retail markets characterized by sluggish price and quantity behavior. Although the penetration of sophisticated shareholder value-added models within the banking industry has increased markedly, the shortcomings of standard valuation models have not been well understood. In this applied paper, we analyze the economics of <b>retail</b> <b>deposit</b> markets in the context of valuation/duration practices employed by bank asset-liability managers.

5000|$|The {{liabilities}} of the Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund {{arise from}} the 2008-2012 Icelandic financial crisis, which saw Iceland's three main commercial banks collapse within {{the space of a}} week.

50|$|Since {{the credit}} channel {{operates}} as an amplification mechanism alongside {{the interest rate}} effect, small monetary policy changes can have large effects if the credit channel theory holds. Asset price boom and bust patterns in the 1980s {{may have led to}} the subsequent real fluctuations observed in many advanced economies. It has also been found that small firms, who are credit constrained relative to larger firms, respond to cash flow squeezes by cutting production and employment. Large firms, by contrast, respond to cash flow squeezes by increasing their short-term borrowing. Moreover, this empirical result still holds when controlling for industry characteristics and financial criteria. Recent research at the Federal Reserve suggests that the bank lending channel manifests itself through the mortgage lending market as well. Monetary policy tightening may force banks to shift from <b>retail</b> <b>deposits</b> insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to uninsured managed liabilities if they wish to continue financing mortgages. These sources of funding are more expensive than deposits, raising the bank's average funding costs. Banks who lend heavily in sub-prime communities will face higher external finance premiums because the risk from holding assets composed largely of subprime borrowers is relatively high. As a result, banks have to raise funds through instruments that offer higher interest payments. The empirical evidence suggests that banks that lend heavily in subprime communities and rely mostly on <b>retail</b> <b>deposits</b> reduce mortgage issuance relative to other banks {{in the face of a}} monetary contraction. No evidence was found of reductions in mortgage lending initiating from other banks who do not lend heavily in subprime communities or who do not rely heavily on <b>retail</b> <b>deposits</b> in response to monetary policy tightening.|$|E
