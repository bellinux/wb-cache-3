The WJIII COG, a theory-driven measure, purports {{to provide information about}} a child's pattern of abilities, including areas previously not measured by other cognitive instruments. Only one study has addressed the relationship between the WJIII COG and gifted children. (Rizza, et al., 2001) The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the WJIII COG's appropriateness for use with gifted children. Interpretive guidance when using the WJIII COG with gifted children was sought. The following question was addressed: Do children of high intellectual ability display distinct patterns of performance on the WJIII COG Stratum II variables. If so, do these patterns qualitatively differ from the performance of children of non-high intellectual ability?The participants for this study were taken from the standardization sample of WJIII COG participants (N= 3, 145). The participants were divided into two groups: high intellectual ability, Group 1 (N = 389), and "other," (Group 2) (N = 2756). Group 1 participants had a GIA Standard score of 120 or above. The participants were further divided into three subgroups, determined by age: preschool, school-aged, and collegeaged. Approximately half of the sample was male. White participants were the majority of the sample (77. 4 - 87. 9 %). Most participants were non-Hispanic (91. 3 - 94. 9 %). Means, standard deviations, <b>ranges,</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>values,</b> and maximum values, were obtained. WJIII COG Stratum II variables were paired and compared. The comparisons made were ranges and point differences. Cumulative percentages of point differences were calculated at the 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 point levels. Two primary findings emerged. The first finding was that Group 1 participants scored higher overall than Group 2 participants when averages were compared. The second finding was that no gifted profile emerged for Group 1. Although no gifted pattern emerged, there was a great deal of variability within individual student profiles for both Groups. It was suggested that further research be directed at whether subtypes of students with high abilities could be identified that would have clinical implications congruent with multidimensional theories of giftedness.

The vegetation canopy can absorb, scatter, and block RF signals, leading to large attenuation of signal strength and significant differences in link quality on the receiving end, which in turn affects the monitoring quality. The dynamic relationships between radio signal transmission, plant height, group range, and crop growth stages are identified through the analysis of summer corn perceptual information path loss at different growth stages. The gradual RSSI attenuation model of wireless sensor network for large-scale farmland environment is established.

Results {{of the research}} and the data analysis performed show that the model is able to evaluate factors determining the wind farm gross output and to increase the prediction accuracy. The influence of the regression equation independent variables on the dependent one {{is determined by the}} means of the Students ttest, and the levels of varying equation coefficients are established. The transformation of weather density and wind speed product corresponding to the linear stochastic dependence of the variable power characteristic part for the wind power plant is estimated. Expression of the transformation is suitable to use for predicting the wind farm power in the <b>range</b> from the <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> to the installed ones. The statistical regression model of the wind farm power prediction is presented on the basis of given technique of the linear regression analysis, the exponential regression equation, and variable coefficients of regression equation. Results of power prediction by the given model precision research show that the one-day relative average prediction error does not exceed 7. 52 % of the installed value...|$|R
40|$|A {{vegetation}} fire plume is a weakly ionised gaseous medium. Electrons in {{the plume}} are mainly due to thermal ionisation of incumbent alkali impurities. The medium is highly collisional with free electron - neutral particle been the dominant particle interaction mechanism. Signal strength of an incident millimetre wave (MM-Wave) may be significantly attenuated in the plume {{depending on the}} extent of ionisation. A numerical experiment was set to investigate signal power loss of a MM-Wave incident on a simulated weakly ionised fire plume with flame maximum (seat) temperature ranging from 1000 – 1150 K. The simulated fire plume had alkali impurities (potassium) content of 1. 0 % per unit volume. MM-Wave frequency range investigated in the experiment is from 30 – 60 GHz. The simulation has application in the prediction of MM-Wave propagation in a crown forest fire and may also be applied in remote sensing studies of forest fire environments. Simulated attenuation per unit path length for the MM-Wave frequencies ranged from 0. 06 – 24. 00 dBm− 1. Phase change per unit path length was simulated to range from 2. 97 – 306. 17 °m− 1 while transmission power coefficients ranged from maximum of 0. 9996 for a fire plume at 1000 K to a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 0. 8265 for a plume at a temperature of 1150 K over a plume depth of 1. 20 m. Absorption power coefficient <b>ranged</b> from a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 0. 0004 to maximum value of 0. 1585 at a seat temperature of 1150 K over the plume depth...|$|R
40|$|In this study, two {{computational}} approaches, Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing, {{are applied}} {{to search for a}} set of optimal process parameters value that leads to the <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of machining performance. The objectives of the applied techniques are: (1) to estimate the <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of the machining performance compared to the machining performance value of the experimental data and regression modeling, (2) to estimate the optimal process parameters values that has to be within the <b>range</b> of the <b>minimum</b> and maximum coded values for process parameters of experimental design that are used for experimental trial and (3) to evaluate the number of iteration generated by the computational approaches that lead to the <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of machining performance. Set of the machining process parameters and machining performance considered in this work deal with the real experimental data of the non-conventional machining operation, abrasive waterjet. The results of this study showed that both of the computational approaches managed to estimate the optimal process parameters, leading to the <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of machining performance when compared to the result of real experimental data...|$|R
30|$|Boulder B 3 {{represents}} the biggest boulder located in Maddalena peninsula. Using the Pignatelli et al. (2009) method, a minimum tsunami height of 5.051 m (Table 4) {{is required to}} detach the boulder from the cliff top in a JB scenario partially submerged, {{as evidenced by the}} presence of the algal rim, and transport it inland. Considering this value, the inland penetration limit has been calculated for each buffer (Table 5) resulting in a max value of 223.67 m, a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 203.95 m and an average value of 210.47 m. Estimation for boulder B 4 (Table 5) furnished a HT value a little bit lower with respect to that assessed for the boulder B 3, reaching an height of 3.174 m, inland penetration limits <b>ranging</b> between a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 81.23 m and a maximum value of 103.16 m with an average value of 91.09 m. For the boulder B 13 (Table 5), a HT of 3.566 m has been estimated; consequently, the minimum inland penetration limit is about 82.72 m, the maximum is about 104.78 m, the average value 92.19 m. Average inland penetration limit estimated for B 4 and B 13 appear to be in good agreement, suggesting that the two boulders could have been transported during the same event. This is confirmed by radiocarbon age determination performed by Scicchitano et al. (2007) on these boulders, yielding an age of 465 ± 37 age (BP) for boulder B 4 and 465 ± 35 age (BP) for boulder B 13 (not calibrated), that allowed to refer their accumulation to the December 28, 1908 tsunami.|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{determine}} whether a relationship exists between the linear measurements of overjet and overbite and the interincisal space delimited by the morphology of {{the upper and lower}} incisors. Method and Materials. 30 subjects (age range from 14. 1 to 34. 8 years, with a median age of 23. 5 years and sex ratio F/M: 5 / 10) with overjet and overbite equal to 2 [*]mm were selected from a group of 381 individuals with a full and well-aligned dentition, no previous dental treatment, and no signs or symptoms indicative of temporomandibular disorder. Computed Tomography images of vinyl polysiloxane impressions of the 30 subjects' anterior teeth were acquired. The interincisal space was defined as Immediate Overjet Angle and was calculated on the Computed Tomography images. Results. Although the 30 subjects presented overlapping measures of overjet and overbite, the values of the Immediate Overjet Angles were different in a <b>range</b> of a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 12 ° and a maximum value of 54 °. Conclusion. This study reveals that (1) only 30 (7. 9 %) of the 381 individuals considered have values of overjet and overbite equal to 2 [*]mm and (2) the Immediate Overjet Angle values of the 30 subjects are not related to the values of overjet and overbite...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustainable}} management {{of water resources}} subjected to the joined influence of transboundary basin-wide dry climatic conditions and intensive man-made river regulations in an upper riparian state on the stream flow regime of a downstream country is a serious challenge. This is particularly the case for arid and semi-arid regions where water resources are limited. The Diyala river basin, shared between Iraq and Iran, was used as an example. The study aims to develop a generic approach to isolate the relative effect of upstream man-made interventions from the mutual impacts of basin-wide dry climate environments and upstream human-induced pressures. The proposed method supports water managers in unbiased, timely and spatially relevant decision-making processes. The streamflow drought index and the monthly-based truncation level were utilized to characterize hydrological droughts, while the standardized precipitation index was used for meteorological drought interpretations. Findings revealed that the upstream river regulation schemes noticeably led to a decline in water availability of the downstream country. The relative impact <b>ranged</b> from a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 5 % in February to the highest value of 54 % in July. The average proportional impacts between April and October and between November and March were about 46 % and 17 %, respectively...|$|R
