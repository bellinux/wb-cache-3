40|$|Analysis of {{pedestrian}} circulation in buildings is usually {{performed in the}} early stages of the design process or later on with respect to a specific design problem such as fire safety. In both cases, the analysis relates more to wayfinding, i. e. search for a route on the basis of fundamental normative criteria. Wayfinding analysis in existing buildings is useful for the comparison between “rational” behaviour and actual usage but this comparison does little to explicate the observed structure of {{pedestrian circulation}}. In contrast to wayfinding, <b>route</b> <b>analysis</b> deals with the registration and assessment of actual patterns of pedestrian circulation in existing buildings. These patterns are represented topologically and geometrically. The geometric representation makes use of norms underlying building codes in order to reach an appropriate level of abstraction. Route representations are implemented on top of a building representation of relevant spatial and building elements. The building representation serves both as input and output for the <b>route</b> <b>analysis.</b> Input and output are largely automated, including production of the geometric route locally (i. e. within each space) and measurement of route distance and complexity. Use data are collected in an alphanumeric database and linked dynamically to the geometric and topological representation. <b>Route</b> <b>analysis</b> supports and refines other forms of post-occupancy evaluation by adding important dynamic aspects to activity allocation and compartmentalization...|$|R

The natural gas pipeline is planned to run from the natural gas fields in the Caspian Sea through Turkey. This project is a case study for a Geographic Information System (GIS) least-cost <b>route</b> <b>analysis</b> of a section of the proposed pipeline in Western Turkey. The <b>route</b> <b>analysis</b> comprised of weighting multiple types of criteria in a compiled risk assessment map that was analyzed by a least-cost algorithm to display the least hazardous route through the study area. Multiple varieties of criteria were considered such as, lithology, slope of terrain, environmental and social risk factors, e. g. proximity to natural reserves and urban centers, to provide the least hazardous route through the region. The derived least cost paths were more efficient than the proposed route in the relative cost associated with each route...|$|R
