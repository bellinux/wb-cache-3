40|$|Certain {{industry}} characteristics (for example, {{a relatively}} fixed capacity, varying and uncertain demand, and perishable inventories) are {{a prerequisite for}} a successful implementation of revenue management (RM) practices. Although movie theaters have these characteristics, they have failed to try RM as a pricing strategy. The current study examines the joint impact of five potential RM practices (that is, rate fences) and framing effects (surcharge versus discount) on consumers’ price fairness perceptions. Several rate fences (morning-versus-noon, weekday-versus-weekend and time-of-booking-based pricing) received relatively high fairness ratings, whereas location-based and popularity-based pricing were perceived as less fair. In addition, <b>framing</b> <b>ticket</b> prices as a discount rather than a surcharge significantly improved customers’ price fairness perceptions. The {{findings of this study}} provide guidance for movie theater operators in their pursuit of optimal pricing...|$|R
50|$|On {{the rear}} goods siding, {{one of the}} railway's three {{breakdown}} cranes was stored {{for a number of}} years, being removed in 1991 and subsequently restored and placed on display at Union Mills {{on the site of the}} former railway station. This crane was constructed in 1893 by the Birmingham-based firm Richard C. Gibbins. Inside the station's waiting room are several framed displays charting various historical aspects of the railway featuring old photographs, <b>framed</b> <b>tickets,</b> maps and other historical documentation relating to the earliest days of the railway. A headboard commemorating the centenary of the adjacent Poulsom Park in 1996 is also mounted on the wall above the fireplace, several other pieces of ephemera are available to view at the station. For many years, there also featured large advertisement hoardings lining the down platform but these were removed in 1974 having become unsafe. The Friends Of... group have plans to reinstate the hoarding in 2015 and have secured funding from Culture Vannin to proceed with the project subject to planning approval. An original signal windlass constructed by the Birmingham company A.J. Linley & Co., was also displayed on the up platform for many years, a similar version is extant and used to operate the unique slotted post semaphore signal which protects the station's southerly side.|$|R
5000|$|Garrett {{has been}} rebuilt as a cyborg with a six-inch {{removable}} portion on his skull (which a recorder {{can be placed}} in) and a cybernetic right hand. Three years after the Libya mission, Garrett and his partner Arthur Perry were sent to San Concepcion as part of [...] "Operation: Scrambled Eggs" [...] where they had to investigate the assassination of President Carlos Huevos. Garrett and Arthur Perry interrogated Julio Gonzales who confessed to hiring a woman to assassinate Carlos Huevos. Then they interrogated a political prisoner who told them about Elektra. During the research on Elektra, Garrett became {{a victim of a}} psychic link with her where he began to be influenced and manipulated by her. During Garrett's confrontation with Elektra where Arthur Perry was slain, she cut off his hand and blew up the munitions shipments in the harbor building they were in. Garrett's body was recovered by ExTechOp where they began replacing 80% of his body with cybernetics as the S.H.I.E.L.D. engineers successfully replaced Garrett's arms, legs, spine, nervous system, heart, liver, and lungs. During this time, Elektra slipped in and stole the recorder implant from Garrett's skull. Hours later, Elektra raided S.H.I.E.L.D.'s information bank where she was apprehended by the S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents. After being reactivated, Garrett filed his report on Elektra where he suspects that she is a Russian agent. This report was not believed and Garrett was reprimanded by his superior Dr. Harold Beaker. Later that night, Elektra sunk her psychic claws into Garrett in order {{to get her out of}} the chamber that she is being kept inert in. As Garrett worked to fight Elektra's control, she got him to shut down the power to her chamber. After Elektra escaped, Garrett made a false report to cover up his involvement in her escape. Garrett then recalled that Elektra was going after Ambassador Reich (who at the time was possessed by the Beast of the Hand). After Elektra sent Garrett on a wild goose chase, Reich transferred the Beast of the Hand into the USA's presidential candidate Ken Wind. When Garrett prepared to return to the United States, Elektra stole his plane <b>ticket</b> and <b>framed</b> him so that the airport security would discover a bag of drugs during a body cavity search.|$|R
