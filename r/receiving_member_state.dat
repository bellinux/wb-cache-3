40|$|Several EU Directives {{have been}} adopted which have an {{influence}} on the control of urban pollution in particular the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment and the Integrated Pollution Control and Prevention Directive. In addition, the recently adopted Water Framework Directive (WFD) will have an additional impact on the control of urban pollution in particular related to storm overflows. The present paper provides a brief discussion of the EU legislation relevant to the control of urban pollution with special emphasis on the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) and its implementation in the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The recently adopted WFD requires the achievement of good ecological and chemical status in all waters. The implementation of the UWWTD by the <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> which should be achieved by 2005, will make a significant contribution towards achieving good ecological and chemical status. However, besides the discharge of sewage effluents, storm overflows can {{have a significant impact}} on the quality of surface waters and they will therefore require adequate control in order to achieve the final goal of good ecological and chemical status. The paper, therefore, also provides a brief analysis of the permitting requirements in the different countries and of the criteria currently applied by the EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> for the design of combined sewer overflow systems. Not all countries currently require a permit for storm overflows and the design criteria for combined sewer overflows are generally based on the spill frequency or treatment capacity in terms of dry weather flow, which do not take into account the effect on the receiving water. However, in the UK a method has been developed to assess the impact of combined sewer overflows on the quality of the receiving water, which is being applied to ensure the design of the storm overflow is adequate for the protection of the <b>receiving</b> water. <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> will need to adapt their methodologies used for the design of storm overflow to ensure the requirements of the WFD, the achievement of good ecological and chemical water quality, is being met. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|While {{a number}} of {{different}} theoretical models have been advanced to explain why states implement-or, indeed, do not implement-multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), very little empirical work has been undertaken to validate their predictions. With a view to narrowing this gap, the present article adopts a large-N, econometric approach to test the explanatory power of four distinct models of compliance-domestic adjustment, reputational, constructivist and managerial-in the context of European Union (EU) environmental policy. Using data on the number of ofıcial infringements <b>received</b> by 15 <b>member</b> <b>states</b> for non-implementation of environmental directives over the period 1979 - 2000, we ınd that all four models make a statistically signiıcant contribution to explaining spatio-temporal differences in legal implementation. Thus, our results suggest that the implementation of MEAs is shaped by a combination of rational calculations of domestic compliance costs and reputational damage, domestically institutionalized normative obligations, and legal and political constraints. We conclude by suggesting a greater need for multi-causal theoretical models of supranational legal compliance. (c) 2007 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R

The economic component of the new DCF is a significant improvement compared to its predecessor (the Data Collection Regulation (DCR)), {{at least in terms of}} parameter definitions and suggested calculation methodologies, which in turn should improve the quality of the analyses undertaken. In addition to presenting the key findings of the 2010 AER, this paper will pay particular attention to the impact of income subsidies on the profitability of the sector. In 2007, the EU fleet (excluding Portuguese and Spanish fleets) is reported to have generated combined profits of around 865 million Euros (cf. 2009 AER). However, the recent EC green paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform states that most of Europes fishing fleets are either running losses or returning low profits. As a result of the introduction of the DCF, the 2010 AER should, for the first time, include new data on the amount of direct subsidies <b>received</b> by each <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> fishing fleet.
