40|$|The {{consumption}} {{of a wide}} variety of species of reptiles caught from the wild has been an important source of protein for humans world-wide for millennia. Terrapins. snakes, lizards, crocodiles and iguanas are now farmed and the consumption and trade of their meat and other edible products have recently increased in some areas of the world. Biological risks associated with the {{consumption of}} products from both farmed and wild <b>reptile</b> <b>meat</b> and eggs include infections caused by bacteria (Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp.). parasites (Spirometra, Trichinella, Gnathostoma, pentastomids), as well as intoxications by biotoxins. For crocodiles, Salmonella spp. constitute a significant public health risk due to the high intestinal carrier rate which is reflected in an equally high contamination rate in their fresh and frozen meat. There is a lack of information about the presence of Salmonella spp. in meat from other edible reptilians, though captive reptiles used as pets (lizards or turtles) are frequently carriers of these bacteria in Europe. Parasitic protozoa in reptiles represent a negligible risk for public health compared to parasitic metazoans, of which trichinellosis, pentastomiasis, gnathostomiasis and sparganosis can be acquired through consumption of contaminated crocodile, monitor lizard, turtle and snake meat. respectively. Other reptiles. although found to harbour the above parasites. have not been implicated with their transmission to humans. Freezing treatment inactivates Spirometra and Trichinella in crocodile meat, while the effectiveness of freezing of other reptilian meat is unknown. Biotoxins that accumulate in the flesh of sea turtles may cause chelonitoxism, a type of food poisoning with a high mortality rate in humans. Infections by fungi. including yeasts, and viruses widely occur in reptiles but have not been linked to a human health risk through the contamination of their meat. Currently there are no indications that natural transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) occur in reptilians. The feeding of farmed reptiles with non-processed and recycled animal products is likely to increase the occurrence of biological hazards in <b>reptile</b> <b>meat.</b> Application of GHP, GMP and HACCP procedures, respectively at farm and slaughterhouse level, is crucial for controlling the hazards...|$|E
40|$|In 2008, an {{outbreak}} of human trichinosis associated with ingestion of raw soft-shelled turtles was identifi ed and investigated in Taiwan. The data suggested that patients were likely infected with Trichinella papuae. Trichinosis is a zoonotic disease caused by species of the nematode Trichinella. In eastern Asia, human trichinosis {{has been reported in}} the People’s Republic of China, Japan, and Korea (1 – 4). Trichinosis among humans and animals has not been reported in Taiwan (1, 5, 6). Although the major source of human infection is the meat of mammals, reptiles recently have been found to serve as hosts for certain Trichinella species. T. zimbabwensis, detected in the muscles of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) in Zimbabwe in 1995, is the first species of Trichinella found in a reptile host naturally infected with Trichinella (7). No human infection has been documented. Another species, T. papuae, was detected in a farmed saltwater crocodile in Papua New Guinea in 2004 (8). A trichinosis outbreak in humans caused by T. papuae, associated with eating wild boar meat, occurred in Thailand (9). Trichinosis in humans related to consumption of <b>reptile</b> <b>meat</b> was first described in Thailand; the source was turtle and brown lizard meat (10). We report {{an outbreak}} of human trichinosis in Taiwan in which eating raw soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) was the suspected mode of infection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Throughout Brazil a {{large number}} of people seek out <b>reptiles</b> for their <b>meat,</b> leather, {{ornamental}} value and supposed medicinal importance. However, there is a dearth of information on the use of reptiles in folk medicine. In North Brazil, the freshwater turtle, Podocnemis expansa, is one of the most frequently used species in traditional medicines. Many products derived from P. expansa are utilized in rural areas and also commercialized in outdoor markets as a cure or treatment for different diseases. Here we document the use and commercialization of P. expansa for medicinal purposes in the state of Pará, Northern Brazil. Methods Data were gathered through interview-questionnaires, with some questions left open-ended. Information was collected in two localities in Pará State, North of Brazil. In the City of Belém, data was collected through interviews with 23 herbs or root sellers (13 men and 10 women). Attempts were made to interview all animal merchants in the markets visited. In fishing community of the Pesqueiro Beach, interviews were done with 41 inhabitants (23 men and 18 women) and during the first contacts with the local population, we attempted to identify local people with a specialized knowledge of medicinal animal usage. Results P. expansa was traded for use in traditional medicines and cosmetics. Fat and egg shells were used to treat 16 different diseases. Turtle fat was the main product sold. The demand for these products is unknown. However, the use of this species in folk medicine might have a considerable impact on wild population, and this must be taken into account for the conservation and management of this species. Conclusion Our results indicated that the use and commercialization of P. expansa products for medicinal purposes is common in North of Brazil. More studies regarding the use and commerce of Brazilian turtles are urgently needed in order to evaluate the real impact of such activities on natural populations. We hope that our findings about the trade and use of P. expansa in folk medicine will motivate further studies on the use of animals in folk medicine and its implications for conservation. </p...|$|R
