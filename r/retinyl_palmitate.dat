40|$|Due to its {{importance}} in many physiological {{processes such as}} cell proliferation and differentiation, vitamin A {{plays a key role}} in reproduction. The present study examines the content and distribution of retinol and retinyl esters in the blood plasma, liver, kidney, ovary and oviduct (infundibulum, magnum, isthmus and uterus) of the laying Japanese quail. (1) The results show that the stage of egg laying had no influence on the level of vitamin A (retinol or retinyl esters) in plasma, kidney and liver. (2) The results further indicate that in the oviduct there are quantitative and qualitative differences in the concentration of retinol and retinyl esters, but that these differences are not altered by the stage of egg formation. (3) The highest levels of vitamin A in the isthmus and uterus were associated with a predominance of <b>retinyl</b> esters (<b>palmitate</b> and stearate); sections with lower total levels of vitamin A (infundibulum, magnum) had retinol as the more dominant form of vitamin A. (4) Changes in the ratio of retinol to retinyl esters in the various sections of the avian oviduct might point to metabolic differences. The storage of vitamin A might therefore be the predominant function of the uterus and isthmus; in the infundibulum and magnum, where vitamin A is predominantly present as retinol, vitamin A serves rather as a precursor for the modulation of the cellular metabolism of these structures...|$|R

In this review, we identify {{factors that may}} affect the bioavailability of iron, vitamin A, zinc, and folic acid when added to seasonings and condiments and evaluate their effects on micronutrient status. We {{take into consideration the}} chemical and physical properties of different forms of the micronutrients, the influence of the physical and chemical properties of foods and meals to which fortified seasonings and condiments are typically added, and interactions between micronutrients and the physiological and nutritional status of the target population. Bioavailable fortificants of iron have been developed for use in dry or fluid vehicles. For example, sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaFeEDTA) and ferrous sulfate with citric acid are options for iron fortification of fish and soy sauce. Furthermore, NaFeEDTA, microencapsulated ferrous fumarate, and micronized elemental iron are potential fortificants in curry powder and salt.

25|$|Vitamin A, a bi-polar {{molecule}} {{formed with}} bi-polar covalent bonds between carbon and hydrogen, {{is linked to}} a family of similarly shaped molecules, the retinoids, which complete {{the remainder of the}} vitamin sequence. Its important part is the retinyl group, which can be found in several forms. In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily <b>retinyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> which is converted to an alcohol in the small intestine. Vitamin A can also exist as an aldehyde, or as an acid. The discovery of vitamin A stemmed from research dating back to 1906, indicating that factors other than carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were necessary to keep cattle healthy. By 1917 one of these substances was independently discovered by Elmer McCollum at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne at Yale University.|$|E

40|$|Defects of renal {{function}} is often {{followed by a}} change of urinary protein excretion. In the last years the investigation of urinary proteins has {{become more and more}} of diagnostic relevance. It is proposed that tubulointerstitial changes {{play an important role in}} the progression of renal failure irrespective of the underlying etiology. Tubular proteinuria and enzymuria, markers of tubular dysfunction, have been reported in humans with different forms of renal diseases. Western blotting and other immunological methods are techniques employed to identify urinary proteins. Identification of urinary proteins may lead to an enhanced understanding of renal physiology and pathopyhsiology, and thus lead to the discovery of novel markers for diseases. Despite intense research the knowledge of stone pathogenesis, which is the basis of every rational stone metaphylaxis, has remained rather scanty. Urine is normally protected from nucleation, growth and aggregation. Urine of stone formers, however, is supposedly rich in promoters, or deficient in inhibitors, thus explaining its tendency to excrete crystals in greater quantities and clustered into larger aggregates than those in the urine of healthy subjects. Urinary macromolecules play an important modifying role in stone formation and proteins appear to be responsible for most of this inhibitory activity. The objective of this clinical analytical prospective study was to investigate the changes in the metabolism of vitamin A and their carrier proteins in plasma and urine in two different diseases - canine renal insufficiency and urolithiasis. Blood and urine were collected from 19 dogs with renal disease, 25 dogs with urolithiasis and 21 healthy dogs. In addition, renal tissue samples were obtained from 4 dogs with renal disease. Uroliths from the 25 dogs were analysed. Retinol and retinyl esters were determined using a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography system (rp-HPLC). The carrier proteins retinol binding protein (RBP) and Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) were measured quantitatively in blood and urine by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for qualitative determination the detection was performed after electrophoretical separation by Western blotting. Besides RBP and THP, the urinary excretion of further urinary proteins like immunglobulin G, transferrin, albumin and vitamin D binding protein (DBP) were assessed by Western blotting for their diagnostic relevance of renal function. The results were compared with the urinary protein patterns from sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Additionally, the tissue sections of the kidneys were investigated for RBP, THP and Megalin by immunohistology. In case of urolithiasis the urine of ten healthy dogs were treated with different solutions of calcium chloride to determine a possible role of THP and vitamin A in lithogenesis. Therefore, the concentrations of THP, retinol and retinyl esters were analyzed after decantation. To investigate the protein composition of the organic matrix of the 25 urinary stones the proteins extracted from the stones were submitted to SDS-PAGE and also to a novel approach, the surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). Finally, an analysis of the urinary protein patterns of all dog groups was performed with SELDI technique. Vitamin A was present as retinol and retinyl esters in blood plasma as well as in urine of all dogs. In patients with renal disease (RD) serum concentrations of retinol, <b>retinyl</b> oleate and <b>palmitate</b> were significantly higher than the values found in healthy dogs. An enhanced urinary excretion of retinol became evident in RD dogs documented as a higher fractional clearance of retinol with 2, 96 vs. 0, 15. In contrast to healthy dogs, RBP was detected in the urine of the RD patients. Serum levels of RBP, however, did not change significantly with renal disease. When compared with controls, a significant reduction of the renal THP secretion was found for RD dogs. The immunological detection of the other urinary proteins showed the same pattern of excretion with the electrophoretic separation on SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, immunohistochemical investigations of the kidneys showed defects of the proximal receptor megalin expression and of renal handling with RBP and THP. They correlated well with the pathohistological findings. With SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry it was possible to identify further peptides and proteins which were characteristic for canine renal insufficiency. Dogs with urolithiasis (U) did not differ significantly in their vitamin A metabolism when compared with controls. Nevertheless, serum retinol was modestly elevated in U dogs while urinary vitamin A levels varied widely, as it was observed in the control urine. In most instances urinary RBP was detected but only in trace amounts, whereas serum RBP did not change with urolithiasis. The group of U dogs differed significantly from controls in a lower urinary THP. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of THP for stone formation was reduced with the binding to retinyl esters under the different calcium chloride solutions. With SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry a reflection on urine between stone patients and healthy dogs represented significant differences although the urinary protein profiles consisted of wide heterogeneity. Stone formers excreted different amounts of certain proteins when compared with healthy dogs. In typical electrophoretic patterns of proteins extracted from urinary stone matrix of the four types of stones a protein at 31 and 14 kDa appeared. A 66 kDa protein appeared to be by far as the major constituent on all types of stones. The SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry offered further peptides and proteins for each stone type. Results of this study has shown that renal disease affects the concentrations of retinol in plasma and urine of dogs. Commercial dipstick urinalysis for proteinuria or urine protein to creatinine values have been used to screen renal disease, but these methods do not provide accurate information to determine the onset to functional renal impairment. The results of this study in dogs with different renal diseases and a wide range of renal function indicate that especially RBP and THP may be appropriate markers for use in the diagnosis of tubular proteinuria in dogs. Measurements of urinary RBP provides a highly sensitive indicator of proximal renal tubular malfunction. The reduction of urinary THP pointed to the dysfunction of the distal tubules. Further, SELDI-TOF MS can be used successfully in rapid screening of a number of urinary proteins indicated as putative markers for renal dysfunction. Analyzing the vitamin A metabolism in canine urolithiasis shows that no influence on lithogenesis becomes apparent. The results of a decreased urinary THP excretion in dogs with uroliths indicate that THP plays a role as a modifier of crystal aggregation. Possibly most relevant to stone formation is the fact that THP excretion rises only in healthy subjects in response to increasing urinary calcium and oxalate concentrations, whereas this self-protective mechanism appears to be missing in stone formers as it is reported in other studies. Beside THP other urinary proteins may play an important role in lithogenesis of dogs. The possibility of examining the expression of the majority of urinary proteins simultaneously represents a significant technical advance. SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry seems to be a useful method for biomarker discovery in urolithiasis. In this study, for the first time the protein composition of the organic matrix of canine uroliths were investigated...|$|R
