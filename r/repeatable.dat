5|$|LARP {{events have}} {{a wide variety of}} styles that often overlap. Simple distinctions can be made {{regarding}} the genre used, the presence of simulated weapons or abstract rules, and whether players create their own characters or have them assigned by gamemasters. There is also a distinction between scenarios that are only run once and those that are designed to be <b>repeatable.</b> A number of other common classifications follow.|$|E
5|$|The main {{residual}} {{uncertainty in the}} early measurements was in the measurement of the isotopic composition of the silicon to calculate the atomic weight, so in 2007 a 4.8kg single crystal of isotopically-enriched silicon (99.94% 28Si) was grown, and two one-kilogram spheres cut from it. Diameter measurements on the spheres are <b>repeatable</b> to within 0.3nm, and the uncertainty in the mass is 3µg. Full results from these determinations were expected in late 2010.|$|E
5|$|Deep dives {{should be}} made only after a gradual {{training}} to test the individual diver's sensitivity to increasing depths, with careful supervision and logging of reactions. Diving organizations such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) emphasize that such sessions are {{for the purpose of}} gaining experience in recognizing the onset symptoms of narcosis for an individual , which are somewhat more <b>repeatable</b> than for the average group of divers. Scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis at a given depth or become tolerant of it.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce <b>repeatable</b> experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular genetics. After early work with Drosophila and maize, the adoption of simpler model systems like the bread mold Neurospora crassa made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with Beadle and Tatum's one gene-one enzyme hypothesis in 1941. Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like tobacco mosaic virus and bacteriophage, aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E
5|$|When {{accessing}} {{a previously}} visited region, the player {{appears in the}} location of their last visit. Upon acquiring items called seals, the player can revert regions to their previous statuses to play through them again; regions can be unsealed again at any time. Unlike in the predecessor, the game is automatically saved when players enter the Historia Crux, {{as well as at}} key moments in the plot. The player may also manually save at any time. Instead of accessing stores at save points like in XIII, the player can purchase items from a character named Chocolina, who is found throughout the game. An in-game data log provides a bestiary and incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XIII-2. When talking to characters, the game sometimes begins the Live Trigger system, in which the player chooses their response from several options; these dialogue options are generally not <b>repeatable.</b> The game also occasionally features temporal rifts, in which the player must complete a puzzle to close the rift and continue the game.|$|E
5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as <b>repeatable</b> and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a broad}} {{scientific}} {{consensus that}} PK research, and parapsychology more generally, have not produced a reliable, <b>repeatable</b> demonstration.|$|E
25|$|The {{constellation}} Virgo is {{a specific}} constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not <b>repeatable.</b> Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky is <b>repeatable,</b> so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove {{that we are talking}} about the same Virgo), and any number may be operational.|$|E
25|$|It was {{estimated}} that the missile will be operational by 2014 to 2015 after four to five <b>repeatable</b> tests. According to the Project Director of Agni V, Tessy Thomas, the missile achieved single-digit accuracy in its second test.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} ensure that {{meaningful}} regression analysis can be conducted throughout a software development lifecycle process, any exception handling testing should be highly automated, and the test cases must be generated in a scientific, <b>repeatable</b> fashion. Several commercially available systems exist that perform such testing.|$|E
25|$|Crosscut sled: A {{crosscut}} sled {{is generally}} {{used to hold}} the workpiece at a fixed 90 degree angle to the blade, allowing precise <b>repeatable</b> cuts at {{the most commonly used}} angle. The sled is normally guided by a runner fastened under it that slides in a miter slot. This device is normally shop made, but can be purchased.|$|E
25|$|Though the proving {{process has}} {{superficial}} similarities with clinical trials, it is fundamentally different {{in that the}} process is subjective, not blinded, and modern provings are unlikely to use pharmacologically active levels of the substance under proving. As early as 1842, Holmes noted the provings were impossibly vague, and the purported effect was not <b>repeatable</b> among different subjects.|$|E
25|$|Compared with a reader, a {{verifier}} measures a barcode's {{optical characteristics}} to international and industry standards. The measurement must be <b>repeatable</b> and consistent. Doing so requires constant {{conditions such as}} distance, illumination angle, sensor angle and verifier aperture. Based on the verification results, the production process can be adjusted to print higher quality barcodes that will scan down the supply chain.|$|E
25|$|Business process {{management}} (BPM) is a discipline in operations management that uses various methods to discover, model, analyze, measure, improve, optimize, and automate business processes. BPM focuses on improving corporate performance by managing business processes. Any combination of {{methods used to}} manage a company's business processes is BPM. Processes can be structured and <b>repeatable</b> or unstructured and variable. Though not required, enabling technologies are often used with BPM.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, however, a <b>repeatable</b> method of anal {{dilation}} {{proved to be}} very effective and showed a very low incidence of side effects. Since then, {{at least one other}} controlled, randomized study has shown there to be little difference in healing rates and complications between controlled anal dilation and LIS, while another has again shown high success rates with anal dilation coupled with low incidence of side effects.|$|E
25|$|Specialist {{tools and}} jigs are often {{required}} for the <b>repeatable</b> installation of knock-down fasteners (but not for assembly of prefabricated flat-pack furniture), so {{they tend to be}} limited to those who are making mass-produced items. However, there are applications in which the hobbyist can benefit from the range of fasteners that are available. They are easier and require less skill to install than some of the other more traditional techniques.|$|E
25|$|Although crankers {{are often}} {{considered}} to be more impressive to watch, strokers are often considered to have more <b>repeatable</b> and accurate shots. Strokers rely on smooth ball placement more than kinetic energy to fell pins. The all-time leader in titles and bowling earnings in the United States, Walter Ray Williams, Jr., is a stroker (though some consider his style unique and not easily classifiable). Other famous strokers include PBA Hall of Famers Norm Duke, David Ozio, and Dick Weber.|$|E
25|$|An {{operational}} definition is {{the application of}} operationalization used in defining {{the terms of a}} process (or set of validation tests) needed to determine the nature of an item or phenomenon (e.g. a variable, term, or object) and its properties such as duration, quantity, extension in space, chemical composition, etc. Since the degree of operationalization can vary itself, it can result in a more or less {{operational definition}}. The procedures included in definitions should be <b>repeatable</b> by anyone or at least by peers.|$|E
25|$|Three axioms presupposed by the {{scientific}} method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends {{on the fact that}} they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with <b>repeatable</b> experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|Taylor's {{methods have}} also been {{challenged}} by socialist intellectuals. The arguments put forward relate to progressive defanging of workers {{in the workplace and}} the subsequent degradation of work as management, powered by capital, uses Taylor's methods to render work <b>repeatable,</b> precise yet monotonous and skill-reducing. James W. Rinehart argued that Taylor's methods of transferring control over production from workers to management, and the division of labor into simple tasks, intensified the alienation of workers that had begun with the factory system of production around the period 1870 to 1890.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{important}} neo-classical economists employed more sophisticated psychological explanations, including Francis Edgeworth, Vilfredo Pareto, and Irving Fisher. Economic psychology {{emerged in the}} 20th century {{in the works of}} Gabriel Tarde, George Katona, and Laszlo Garai. Expected utility and discounted utility models began to gain acceptance, generating testable hypotheses about decision-making given uncertainty and intertemporal consumption, respectively. Observed and <b>repeatable</b> anomalies eventually challenged those hypotheses, and further steps were taken by the Nobel Prize-winner Maurice Allais, for example, in setting out the Allais paradox, a decision problem he first presented in 1953 that contradicts the expected utility hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Operationalize {{means to}} put into operation. Operational {{definitions}} are also used to define system states {{in terms of a}} specific, publicly accessible process of preparation or validation testing, which is <b>repeatable</b> at will. For example, 100 degrees Celsius may be crudely defined by describing the process of heating water at sea level until it is observed to boil. An item like a brick, or even a photograph of a brick, may be defined in terms of how it can be made. Likewise, iron may be defined in terms of the results of testing or measuring it in particular ways.|$|E
25|$|Mars' {{temperature}} and circulation vary {{from year to}} year (as expected for any planet with an atmosphere). Mars lacks oceans, a source of much inter-annual variation on Earth. Mars Orbiter Camera data beginning in March 1999 and covering 2.5 Martian years show that Martian weather tends to be more <b>repeatable</b> and hence more predictable than that of Earth. If an event occurs at a particular time of year in one year, the available data (sparse as it is) indicate that it is fairly likely to repeat the next year at nearly the same location, give or take a week.|$|E
25|$|Given {{their large}} ranges, {{it is thought}} that bees of the Euglossine tribe trapline for more {{efficient}} foraging. Traplining occurs when an insect will visit a series of flowers in a stable, <b>repeatable</b> sequence. Traplining gives the bee an advantage in that they have a series of flowers they can visit to gain nectar. There is also a benefit to the flora, which can be many kilometers from each other, but can still be cross-pollinated because they are on the same traplining path. Ef. surinamensis and other orchid bees are major players in flora gene flow, and are vital to the continued health of tropical forests.|$|E
25|$|A {{recognized}} {{skill is}} tolerance for ambiguity {{and being able}} to handle open-ended problems. For instance, a knowledge-based engineering system can enhance its operational aspect and thereby its stability through more involvement by the subject matter expert, thereby opening up issues of limits that are related to being human. As in, many times, computational results have to be taken at face value due to several factors (hence the duck test's necessity arises) that even an expert cannot overcome. The end proof may be the final results (reasonable facsimile by simulation or artifact, working design, etc.) that are not guaranteed to be <b>repeatable,</b> may have been costly to attain (time and money), and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Contrasted with Germany and the United States, {{psychology}} had a slow {{birth in}} the UK. The idea that human behaviour is follows <b>repeatable</b> patterns, {{and that it}} is possible to discover these patterns or laws by the use of scientific methods, is capable of producing deep passion. In 1877 James Ward proposed that a laboratory should be established in Cambridge to study psychophysics (the relation between the physical properties of stimuli and experienced sensations). This proposal was rejected by the Cambridge Senate on the grounds that it `would insult religion by putting the human soul in a pair of scales’. Psychology of a philosophic type in the tradition of British Empiricism has been taught at UCL since the appointment of George Croom Robertson to the Grote Chair of Mind and Logic in 1866.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 the IBM350 RAMAC {{disk storage}} unit was {{superseded}} by the IBM1301 {{disk storage unit}}, which consisted of 50 platters, each about 1/8-inch thick and 24 inches in diameter. Whereas the IBM350 used only two read/write heads which were pneumatically actuated and moved in two dimensions, the 1301 {{was one of the}} first disk storage units to use an array of heads, one per platter, moving as a single unit. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6µm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured <b>repeatable</b> positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. Access time was about a quarter of a second.|$|E
25|$|Southwick, local {{physician}} George E. Fell, and {{the head}} of the Buffalo ASPCA performed a series of experiments electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, experimenting with animals in water, out of water, electrode types and placement, and conductive material until they came up with a <b>repeatable</b> method to euthanize animals using electricity. Southwick went on in the early 1880s to advocate that this method be used as a more humane replacement for hanging in capital cases, coming to national attention when he published his ideas in scientific journals in 1882 and 1883. He worked out calculations based on the dog experiments, trying to develop a scaled-up method that would work on humans. Early on in his designs he adopted a modified version of the dental chair as a way to restrain the condemned, a device that from then on would be referred called the electric chair.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, an American, Samuel Colt {{patented}} {{the mechanism}} {{that led to}} the widespread use of the revolver, the mechanically indexing cylinder. According to Samuel Colt, he {{came up with the idea}} for the revolver while at sea, inspired by the capstan, which had a ratchet and pawl mechanism on it, a version of which was used in his guns to rotate the cylinder by cocking the hammer. This provided a reliable and <b>repeatable</b> way to index each round and did away with the need to manually rotate the cylinder. Revolvers proliferated largely due to Colt's ability as a salesman. But his influence spread in other ways as well; the build quality of his company's guns became famous, and its armories in America and England trained several seminal generations of toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century.|$|E
25|$|Since its discovery, vitamin C {{has been}} {{considered}} almost a panacea by some, although this led to suspicions of it being overhyped by others. Vitamin C has been promoted in alternative medicine {{as a treatment for}} the common cold, cancer, polio and various other illnesses. The evidence for these claims is mixed. Orthomolecular-based megadose recommendations for vitamin C are based mainly on theoretical speculation and observational studies, such as those published by Fred R. Klenner from the 1940s through the 1970s. There is a strong advocacy movement for such doses of vitamin C, and there is an absence of large scale, formal trials in the 10 to 200+ grams per day range. The single <b>repeatable</b> side effect of oral megadose vitamin C is a mild laxative effect if the practitioner attempts to consume too much too quickly. A tolerable upper limit (UL) of vitamin C was set at 2grams {{for the first time in}} the year 2000, referencing this mild laxative effect as the reason for establishing the UL.|$|E
25|$|By {{assuming}} a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides {{to walk across}} a room, it is generally understood {{that the decision to}} do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is that if there is something totally nonphysical causing a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no physical event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (<b>repeatable</b> experiment performed regarding) where the physical energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against in that it violates a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{geometry}} of the tube-sample-detector assembly constant, the sample is normally prepared as a flat disc, typically of diameter 20–50mm. This is located at a standardized, small distance from the tube window. Because the X-ray intensity follows an inverse-square law, the tolerances for this placement and for the flatness of the surface must be very tight in order to maintain a <b>repeatable</b> X-ray flux. Ways of obtaining sample discs vary: metals may be machined to shape, minerals may be finely ground and pressed into a tablet, and glasses may be cast to the required shape. A further reason for obtaining a flat and representative sample surface is that the secondary X-rays from lighter elements often only emit from the top few micrometres of the sample. In order to further reduce the effect of surface irregularities, the sample is usually spun at 5–20 rpm. It is necessary to ensure that the sample is sufficiently thick to absorb the entire primary beam. For higher-Z materials, a few millimetres thickness is adequate, but for a light-element matrix such as coal, a thickness of 30–40mm is needed.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s RTÉ One's prime time {{schedule}} {{is made up}} of nearly 100% Irish programming, some exceptions include EastEnders, The Midweek Movie, The Big Big Movie and with a few classic repeats intermittently such as Fawlty Towers and Only Fools and Horses. RTÉ One's other daytime imports are made up of soap operas (such as the Australian soaps Neighbours and Home and Away, the New Zealand soap Shortland Street, the British soaps Doctors and EastEnders), American detective dramas (including the highly <b>repeatable</b> Murder, She Wrote) and since 2001 they have broadcast American daytime chat shows (including The Doctors and Doctor Phil, they also broadcast Oprah but that is now shown on TV3). American dramas broadcast from 2000 to 2009 included ER, The Practice, Damages, Shark, Angel, Two and a Half Men, Medium, Mad Men, and The West Wing. British dramas Spooks and Waking the Dead have also aired on the Channel. During the 2000s RTÉ broadcast the ITV soap The Bill over two half-hour episodes Monday to Friday at 17:30, rather than the original hour-long episodes. RTÉ One also broadcast the revived ITV soap, Crossroads.|$|E
500|$|Working in {{both the}} {{ultraviolet}} and the visible regions of the spectrum, the model DU produced accurate absorption spectra which could be obtained with relative ease and accurately replicated. [...] The National Bureau of Standards ran tests to certify that the DU's results were accurate and <b>repeatable</b> and recommended its use.|$|E
500|$|The Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons has two further notable characteristics. First, like Accum's earlier writings, it {{was written}} with {{descriptions}} of the simple techniques of analytical chemistry he employed, thereby making them more accessible to his readers.
