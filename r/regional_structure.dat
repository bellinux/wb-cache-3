Below the branches or areas were subregions or subareas (podokręg) or independent areas (okręgi samodzielne). Smaller organizational units were 89 inspectorates (inspektorat) and 280 (as of early 1944) districts (obwód). Overall, the Home Army <b>regional</b> <b>structure</b> largely resembled Poland's interwar administration division, with an okręg being {{similar to a}} voivodeship (see Administrative division of Second Polish Republic).|$|E

During {{the course of the}} reorganisation, Strasser refashioned the NSDAP district boundaries to more closely align with those of the Reichstag and increased the authority of Gauleiters. Strasser reorganised both the party's <b>regional</b> <b>structure</b> and its vertical management hierarchy. The party became a centralized organization with extensive propaganda mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Delchev's {{involvement}} in BMARC {{was an important}} {{moment in the history}} of the Macedonian-Adrianople liberation movement. The years between the end of 1896, when he left the Exarchate's educational system and 1903 when he died, represented the final and most effective revolutionary phase of his short life. In the period 1897–1902 he was a representative of the Foreign Committee of the BMARC in Sofia. Again in Sofia, negotiating with suspicious politicians and arms merchants, Delchev saw more of the unpleasant face of the Principality, and became even more disillusioned with its political system. In 1897 he, along with Gyorche Petrov, wrote the new organization's statute, which divided Macedonia and Adrianople areas into seven regions, each with a <b>regional</b> <b>structure</b> and secret police, following the Internal Revolutionary Organization's example. Below the regional committees were districts. The Central committee was placed in Salonica. In 1898 Delchev decided to be created a permanent acting armed bands (chetas) in every district. From 1902 till his death he was the leader of the chetas, i.e. the military institute of the Organization because, he had considerable knowledge in the area of military skills. Delchev ensured the functioning of the underground border crossings of the organization and the arms depots added to them, alongside the then Bulgarian-Ottoman border.|$|E
25|$|When the State {{was created}} in 1948 the {{overwhelming}} majority of the population was concentrated in a narrow coastal strip. One of the main tasks of the newly established Government Planning Department, headed by Sharon and directly responsible to the Prime Minister’s Office under David Ben-Gurion, was to find solutions for the great waves of immigrants who entered Israel after the declaration of Independence. The team consisted of 180 urban planners, architects, engineers and economists. They set up a National Outline Plan, dividing the country into planning regions in accordance with economic resources, geographic features, communication factors and historical background. The <b>regional</b> <b>structure</b> would be completed by the development of a regional urban center – a medium-sized town. Thus the plan provided for the establishment of 20 new towns, dispersed all over the country and established guidelines for industrial estates to be located close to the new towns. Sharon's plan led to the creation of development towns for example: Beit She'an, Kiryat Gat, and Upper Nazareth. Agricultural regions were planned expanding into the southern Negev desert. A national water plan was set up that would carry water from the surplus areas in the north to the dry, water-poor areas in the south. And a network of National Parks was devised, spreading all over the country, exploiting the existing landscape features, nature reserves and historical sites. At the end of 1953, Sharon was invited by the United Nations to serve as a planning expert in a Seminar on Housing and Community Improvement, held in New Delhi, and afterwards to Burma and Japan.|$|E

500|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of the August strikes, on September 17 workers' representatives, {{including}} Lech Wałęsa, formed a nationwide labor union, Solidarity (Niezależny Samorządny Związek Zawodowy (NSZZ) [...] "Solidarność"). It was the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country. Its name was suggested by Karol Modzelewski, and its famous logo was conceived by Jerzy Janiszewski, designer of many Solidarity-related posters. The new union's supreme powers were vested in a legislative body, the Convention of Delegates (Zjazd Delegatów). The executive branch was the National Coordinating Commission (Krajowa Komisja Porozumiewawcza), later renamed the National Commission (Komisja Krajowa). The Union had a <b>regional</b> <b>structure,</b> comprising 38 regions (region) and two districts (okręg). On December 16, 1980, the Monument to Fallen Shipyard Workers was unveiled in Gdansk, and on June 28, 1981, another monument was unveiled in Poznan, which commemorated the Poznań 1956 protests. On January 15, 1981, a Solidarity delegation, including Lech Wałęsa, met in Rome with Pope John Paul II. From September 5 to 10, and from September 26 to October 7, Solidarity's first national congress was held, and Lech Wałęsa was elected its president. Last accord of the congress was adoption of republican program [...] "Self-governing Republic".|$|E

[...] At one stage in August 1913, Owen even wavered publicly in his own support for a <b>regional</b> <b>structure,</b> before being brought back into line by Wilson personally. [...] Owen's committee eventually split down the middle between Owen's {{own version of the}} bill and a more centralized alternative promoted by Senator Gilbert Hitchcock, a Nebraska Democrat who had become something of a political rival at state level of Owen's ally Bryan. [...] To break the deadlock, the committee agreed to report out both bills to the full Senate, without a recommendation. [...] Wilson, who had been maintaining a close watch over the legislation's progress, intervening when he considered it necessary, then ordered the Senate Democrats to meet in caucus to line the party up behind Owen's bill, making the vote a matter of party loyalty. [...] On December 19, 1913, the Senate first defeated Hitchcock's bill by the narrow margin of 43-41, after which six Republicans joined all the Democrats to endorse Owen's bill by a more comfortable vote of 54-34.|$|E

Meanwhile, BR was gradually reorganised, with the <b>regional</b> <b>structure</b> finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors.

2500|$|A {{parallel}} line ("B") about 15 miles (25 kilometers) to {{the west}} corresponds {{to the west}}ern limit of a zone of seismicity stretching from the WRZ to southwest of Portland. [...] Curiously, the extension of line [...] "B" [...] north of the OWL is approximately the eastern limit of Puget Sound seismicity, the rest of southwestern Washington and the North Cascades being relatively aseismic (see the seismicity map, above). This line may also mark the northwestern boundary of the SWCC. North of the RMFZ it follows a topographical lineament that {{can be traced to}} Rockport (on Hwy. 20); it includes the Cherry Creek Fault Zone NNE of Carnation, location of the 1965 Duvall earthquake. Between the Cherry Creek and parallel Tokul Creek faults is a contact between formations of the Western Melange Belt. The zone between these two lines, reflecting changes in <b>regional</b> <b>structure,</b> seismicity, fault orientation, and possibly the underlying lithospheric structure, appears to be a major structural boundary in the Puget Lowland.|$|E
