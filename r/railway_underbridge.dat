The line to the boat landing stage was not originally built due financial problems and it was 3 1/2 years before it was completed, opening on 4 July 1915. Its life was short, the last stage to open being the first to close, on 31 October 1943; the remainder closed on 31 December 1955.|$|E

5000|$|A {{subsequent}} Royal Commission (which {{reported in}} 1849) condemned {{the design and}} the use of trussed cast iron in railway bridges, but {{there were a number of}} other failures of cast-iron <b>railway</b> <b>underbridges</b> in subsequent years, such as at the Wootton bridge collapse and the Bull bridge accident. Other failures occurred in the Staplehurst rail crash, the Inverythan crash and the Norwood Junction crash. All the structures used untrussed cast iron girders, and generally failed from blowholes or other casting defects within the bulk material, and so completely hidden from external view.|$|R

50|$|Heavy rail was {{extended}} south from Central railway station to Erskineville between 1884 and 1893 via the Illawarra <b>railway</b> line. <b>Underbridges</b> located at Macdonald Street and Victoria Street are {{listed on the}} State Heritage Register as two of the oldest brick arch underbridges on the metropolitan rail network. Today, the Erskineville railway station is served by the Bankstown Line of the Sydney Trains network. Towards the city the stops are: Erskineville, Redfern, Central, Town Hall, Circular Quay, Wynyard and it takes around 5 minutes to reach Central Station. Newtown railway station and Macdonaldtown railway station are also within close walking distance.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, a pedestrian, cycle {{or animal}} tunnel beneath a road or railway {{is called a}} subway, while an {{underground}} railway system is differently named in different cities, the [...] "Underground" [...] or the [...] "Tube" [...] in London, the [...] "Subway" [...] in Glasgow, and the [...] "Metro" [...] in Newcastle. The place where a road, railway, canal or watercourse passes under a footpath, cycleway, or another road or railway is most commonly called a bridge or, if passing under a canal, an aqueduct. Where {{it is important to}} stress that it is passing underneath, it may be called an underpass, though the official term when passing under a <b>railway</b> is an <b>underbridge.</b> A longer underpass containing a road, canal or railway is normally called a [...] "tunnel", whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure. An underpass of any length under a river is also usually called a [...] "tunnel", whatever mode of transport it is for.|$|R
