5|$|Owing to his father's later {{employment}} as a roving teacher, Miliband spent two spells living in Boston, Massachusetts, one {{year when he}} was seven and one middle school term when he was twelve.

5|$|Bruce {{began to}} attract the {{attention}} of big-name clubs in late 1987, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Rangers all reported to be interested in signing him. Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to sign for the club. The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of £900,000 after initially agreeing to accept £800,000, leading to Bruce refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move. On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left Carrow Road, for a fee reported as £800,000 or £825,000. Norwich fans <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the Norwich City Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|The manga series Hibiki's Magic {{is written}} by Jun Maeda and {{illustrated}} by Rei Izumi. As stated {{at the back of}} the first volume, Maeda first conceived Hibiki's Magic as a short story he wrote as a student, and the story contains an unspecified theme that he has carried through a lot of stories since. In 2003, he wanted to collaborate with Izumi, one of his favorite artists, and <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> earlier concept that would become Hibiki's Magic. After Izumi drew some early character designs for Hibiki, Maeda wanted to continue the story and start a manga with Izumi as the artist.|$|E
5|$|The {{completed}} work, {{titled the}} Book of Mormon, {{was published in}} Palmyra on March 26, 1830, by printer E. B. Grandin. Soon after, on April 6, 1830, Smith and his followers formally organized the Church of Christ, and small branches were established in Palmyra, Fayette, and Colesville, New York. The Book of Mormon brought Smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> money-digging and the 1826 Chenango County trial. After Cowdery baptized several new church members, the Mormons received threats of mob violence; before Smith could confirm the newly baptized members, {{he was arrested and}} brought to trial as a disorderly person. He was acquitted, but soon both he and Cowdery fled to Colesville to escape a gathering mob. In probable reference to this period of flight, Smith said that Peter, James, and John had appeared to him and had ordained him and Cowdery to a higher priesthood.|$|E

Hoffmann was to regret his estrangement from his father. Nevertheless, he <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> aunts with great affection, especially the younger, Charlotte, whom he nicknamed Tante Füßchen ("Aunt Littlefeet"). Although she {{died when he was}} only three years old, he treasured her memory (e.g. see Kater Murr) and embroidered stories about her {{to such an extent that}} later biographers sometimes assumed her to be imaginary, until proof of her existence was found after World War II.|$|E

Santo beat and unmasked Black Shadow in the ring, which triggered Blue Demon's decision {{to become a}} técnico, {{as well as a}} legendary feud between Blue Demon and Santo that culminated in Santo's defeat in a well-publicized series of matches in 1952 and again in 1953. Although they appeared together in a number of action/adventure films, their rivalry never really ended in later years since Santo always <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> defeat at Blue Demon's hands.|$|E

Norris' father had taken the locomotive out for her first run in 1943 and young James always <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> late-father when he saw the engine. Despite being in his late 50s and in failing health, James Norris faithfully visited the locomotive every week to knock off the bird nests and occasionally replace some broken glass in the cab. He would open the gate on Sundays while he was there to let kids climb on the locomotive, ring the bell and answer their many questions.|$|E

However, even in death, Avelyn's name was <b>remembered.</b> <b>His</b> former Master in the Church, Master Jojonah, came to embrace Avelyn's belief that the Church was corrupted and he began preaching Avelyn's ways to other Brothers, most notably Braumin Herde. After the death of Father Abbot Markwart, Bishop Francis Delacourt of Palmaris, once the Father Abbot's most trusted advisor and staunch anti-Avelynist, recommended to Bishop of Honce-the-Bear, Je'howeth, that Avelyn be canonized as a saint of the Abellican Church. His teachings help change the Abellican Church for the better.|$|E

25|$|In 1919 Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896–1994). She was a French Swiss girl {{whom he had}} met at Garsington Manor, {{the country}} house of Lady Ottoline Morrell, a Bloomsbury Group socialite {{with a penchant for}} artists and intellectuals. The newly-weds' life {{together}} included students, faculty wives, grebes and, unfortunately, another depressive breakdown, this time rather serious. From his wife's autobiography it seems his mental illness took the form of a bipolar disorder, with the depressive phases being of moderate to severe intensity. It took a long time for him to recover on this occasion, but despite this he left a legacy of students who admired him, and who became leaders in zoology for the next thirty or forty years. E. B. Ford always <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> openness and encouragement at the start of his career.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting was {{the first}} to go, beaten by one pushed quicker through the air. Gilchrist was adjudged lbw of a similar {{delivery}} but had cause to be aggrieved; replays showed the ball pitched well outside legstump and he had some bat on the ball. With Harbhajan on a hattrick, Shane Warne was surrounded by men around the bat, with Sadagopan Ramesh at short leg the man who would eventually claim the catch from a tentative prod. The on field umpires referred it to the third umpire, who took a long time making the tough decision before finally declaring Warne out. An emotional Harbhajan later <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> father in the post match interview; his captain Sourav Ganguly would call it a performance that brought India back into the match.|$|E
25|$|If the Republic {{had been}} a Monarchy, or if the office of stadtholder had already been {{hereditary}} (as it was to become after the Orangist amendments of 1747) the posthumous child would no doubt have been acclaimed stadtholder automatically, and a Regency would have been put into place, as happened in 1751, when three-year-old William V succeeded his deceased father in office in all seven provinces. As a matter of fact, this was proposed by the Orangist faction in the Republic, and especially by Willem Frederik, who proposed himself {{in the role of}} Lieutenant-Stadtholder in the five provinces in which he was not already stadtholder in his own right, until baby William would come of age. But this proposal elicited little enthusiasm from the Holland regents, who still vividly <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> role in the recent coup.|$|E

25|$|Very {{little of}} Johnson's early life is known with certainty. Two {{marriage}} licenses for Johnson have been located in county records offices. The ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates, {{as do the}} entries showing his attendance at Indian Creek School, in Tunica, Mississippi. That he was not listed among his mother's children in the 1910 census casts further doubt on these dates. Carrie Thompson claimed that her mother, who was also Robert's mother, <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> birth date as May8, 1911. The 1920 census gives his age as 7, suggesting {{he was born in}} 1912 or 1913. Five significant dates from his career are documented: Monday, Thursday and Friday, November 23, 26, and 27, 1936, at a recording session in San Antonio, Texas; and Saturday and Sunday, June 19 and 20, 1937, at a recording session in Dallas. His death certificate, discovered in 1968, lists the date and location of his death.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} common and {{scientific}} names of many species, {{it is for the}} quality of his illustrations that he is best <b>remembered.</b> <b>His</b> friend William Elford Leach, head of zoology at the British Museum, encouraged him to experiment with lithography for his book Zoological Illustrations (1820–23). Swainson became the first illustrator and naturalist to use lithography, which was a relatively cheap means of reproduction and did not require an engraver. He began publishing many illustrated works, mostly serially. Subscribers received and paid for fascicles, small sections of the books, as they came out, so that the cash flow was constant and could be reinvested in the preparation of subsequent parts. As book orders arrived, the monochrome lithographs were hand-coloured, according to colour reference images, known as ‘pattern plates’, which were produced by Swainson himself. It was his early adoption of this new technology and his natural skill of illustration that in large part led to his fame.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to the House, President Madison called for an ambitious {{domestic}} package, including the protection of domestic manufacturing, infrastructure investment, a stable currency, and a fairly large standing army and navy. Clay eagerly embraced this program, which had much in common with Federalist proposals of the past. After the conclusion of the War of 1812, British factories were overwhelming American ports with inexpensive goods. With the help of loyal lieutenants John C. Calhoun and William Lowndes, Clay passed the Tariff of 1816, which served the dual purpose of raising revenue and protecting American goods. To stabilize the currency, Clay and Treasury Secretary Alexander Dallas proposed the creation of the Second Bank of the United States, which earned Clay criticism from some who <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> opposition to the re-chartering of the first such bank. Madison approved the Bank, which was established in 1816. Clay also passed the Bonus Bill of 1817, which would have provided a fund for internal improvements, but Madison vetoed the ground over constitutional concerns. Clay was deeply disappointed by Madison's veto, but was unable to override it.|$|E
