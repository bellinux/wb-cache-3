40|$|Vehicles {{will suffer}} various loads in the moving process, {{and under the}} {{functions}} of {{various factors such as}} the ovality of the wheel, and the impacts to the rails when the vehicle passes the curve rail, the <b>rail</b> <b>slot</b> and the turnoff, the wheels will inevitably add normal loads to the rails, and the flexural moment will influence the generating and growth of the fatigue crack. To study the influences of flexural moment on the fatigue performances of rails with various materials, the experiments about the growth performances of the fatigue cracks of two kinds of materials including U 71 Mn and PD 3 under the flexural moment are made on the NENE- 2 fretting test machine, and according to the experiment results, the measures to reduce the fatigue of rails are proposed. The research analysis and experiment results indicate that the fatigue crack generates from the focal point of stress at first, and the main shearing stress is very important, and when the static load functions, the direction of crack growth will change by a large angle, but when the dynamic load functions, the direction of crack growth will be stable, and under same loading speed, the fatigue crack of PD 3 rail more easily generates and grows than U 71 Mn rail. To prevent and reduce the fatigue of rails, the selection of rail should accord with the type of the route and the actual working environment of the rail, and in the heavy freight route, the PD 3 rail with high mechanical strength should be selected, and in the high-speed route, the U 71 Mn rail should be selected. </p...|$|E
50|$|M-LOK, {{standing}} for Modular Locking system, {{is a free}} licensed firearms accessory mounting system developed by Tim Roberts of Magpul Industries that allows for direct attachment to negative space mounting points. It is a competing standard to KeyMod in regards of replacing the MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail in some applications. Compared to the Picatinny rail system, M-LOK and KeyMod enables the user to have a slimmer and smoother handguard with accessories mounted only where needed, whereas a Picatinny handguards typically will have Picatinny <b>rail</b> <b>slots</b> for its whole length resulting in a larger handguard diameter with sharp corners.|$|R

5000|$|LR55 rail is {{a special}} rail section, {{promoted}} by Tram Power of the UK, designed for use in embedded tramway track installations. The rail itself is like a lop-sided [...] "V". It is a top-suspended rail: the load is transmitted by the rail head, rather than through a web to the <b>rail</b> foot. <b>Slots</b> are cut in the roadway and precast concrete troughs laid in the slots. A polyurethane mastic provides a resilient cushion between the rail and the concrete, minimising transmitted noise, and providing insulation against leakage currents. Since the load is spread across a wider base, it requires less depth for a sub-base than conventional tramway track avoiding the need to disturb existing underground utility services. The installation and maintenance time, and hence cost, is thus greatly reduced. Gauge is maintained by the pavement {{in which it is}} installed; {{there is no need for}} separate gauging bars between the rails. LR55 has been tested in parts of the Sheffield Supertram network.|$|R
5000|$|The true {{emergency}} brake on a cable car {{is known as}} a [...] "slot blade," [...] a steel wedge that can be forced into the slot-rail between the running rails by a strong spring. If a runaway car is moving fast enough that the slot blade is necessary, the friction has been known to weld the blade to the <b>slot</b> <b>rail,</b> disabling the transit line until the obstruction can be extracted with a cutting torch. The slot blade is controlled by the large red lever near the grip, and is not used except for emergency stops.|$|R
40|$|For {{biosensing}} applications where small {{refractive index}} {{variations of the}} surrounding medium are monitored, light {{needs to have a}} strong interaction with such a surrounding biological medium. This is not the case for classical rib and strip waveguides where light is predominantly guided in the high index material. However, in slot waveguides, light is confined in a low index slot region sandwiched between two high index rails and due to the discontinuity of the electric field at the interface between the <b>rails</b> and <b>slot,</b> a significant fraction of the electromagnetic field is localized in the slot. As such slot waveguides present an interesting alternative for biosensing applications especially when made using silicon nitride which permits slot widths of up to 200 nm and as such reachable fabrication tolerances, and reduced propagation losses compared to silicon slot waveguides with its higher refractive index contrast. Furthermore, for biosensing, the wider slot facilitates sample transport and using a multiple-slot structure, further enhancement of the optical confinement in low index slot regions is possible. In this paper we present work in progress of theoretical modeling for strip, slot and multiple-slot waveguides and compare their characteristics for sensing purposes...|$|R

50|$|Also in the 1880s, third-rail systems {{began to}} be used in public urban transport. Trams were first to benefit from it: they used {{conductors}} in conduit below the road surface (see Conduit current collection), usually on selected parts of the networks. This was first tried in Cleveland (1884) and in Denver (1885) and later spread to many big tram networks (e.g. New York, Chicago, Washington DC, London, Paris, all of which are closed) and Berlin (the third rail system in the city was abandoned {{in the first years of}} the 20th century after heavy snowfall.) The system was tried in the beachside resort of Blackpool, UK but was soon abandoned as sand and saltwater was found to enter the conduit and cause breakdowns, and there was a problem with voltage drop. Some sections of tramway track still have the <b>slot</b> <b>rails</b> visible.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, serious craftsmen/hobbyists were racing {{relatively}} large (1:16 to 1:18 scale) model cars, powered by small internal combustion engines, originally with spark-ignition, later with glow plug engines. For guidance, {{the cars were}} clamped to a single center rail, or tethered {{from the center of}} a circular track, then they were started and let go for timed runs. There was no driver control of either the speed or steering, so [...] "gas car" [...] racing was largely a mechanic's hobby. In the 1940s hobbyists in Britain began to experiment with controllable electric cars using handbuilt motors, and in the 1950s using the small model train motors that had become available. In 1954, the Southport Model Engineering Society in the U.K. was challenged by a patent-holder for using rail-guided gas-car exhibitions to raise funds, so, as a replacement, the members constructed an electric racecourse, a groundbreaking six-lane layout nearly 60 feet long, for 1:32 rail-guided cars, which is widely considered to be the progenitor of electric rail- and slot-racing. In 1955-1956, several clubs in the U.K. and U.S., inspired by the Southport layout, [...] were also racing electric cars guided by center rails, and soon after, by slots in the track surface. The term [...] "slot car" [...] was coined to differentiate these from the earlier [...] "rail cars". As the member-built club layouts proliferated, the relative advantages of <b>rail</b> and <b>slot</b> were debated for several years, but the obtrusive appearance of the rails and their blocking of the car's rear wheels when sliding through corners were powerful disadvantages. New clubs increasingly chose the slot system. By 1963, even the pioneer rail-racing clubs had begun to switch to slots.|$|R
50|$|Dallas-Arbiter {{designed}} {{their own}} cumbersome tom holder too, which {{might well have}} looked good on the drawing board, but in reality {{was something of a}} nightmare. A flat, curved and <b>slotted</b> <b>rail</b> was jacked up a little above the bass drum shell and to this was attached the body of the cast tom holder itself. This was fitted with not one, but two ratchets and by judicious use of both you could actually have exceedingly limited horizontal height adjustment. A radial-toothed block was fixed to the tom which mated with a ratchet on the holder to maintain its playing angle, and very large capstan nuts locked tom to holder and holder to bass drum rail. These capstans had an annoying tendency to crush your fingers against the drum and were neither particularly stable nor hard wearing. But at the time, it was the best around. Hayman spurs were modelled on Ludwig type outrigger designs, but with large, cast circular holder blocks which matched the nut boxes and also located the tom legs. Hayman's 'lightning-bolt' bass drum tensioners were the first that were ergonomically designed to ease operation - they were shaped to accommodate the thumbs better.|$|R
40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringOptical {{interconnection}} {{is considered}} {{as an alternative}} solution to electrical interconnection since the former can overcome limits of the latter. Low power consumption and high-speed data transmission are expected from optical interconnection. Matrix switches are {{an important element of}} optical interconnection, and conventional on-chip matrix switches are based on silicon strip waveguides. Since such switches are controlled by using the plasma dispersion effect, there are a few disadvantages such as the loss concomitant with the effect and limited switching speed. The disadvantages may be removed if on-chip matrix switches are constructed from silicon slot waveguides with electro-optic polymer filling their slots. This is because the electro-optic effect has better tuning properties than the plasma dispersion effect. For matrix switches based on silicon slot waveguides, intersections of silicon slot waveguides must be developed. This research theoretically investigates compact efficient intersections of silicon slot waveguides. The proposed intersection consists of mode transformers between slot waveguides and multimode strip waveguides, which are connected to a crossing of the multimode waveguides. In the mode transformer, the <b>rails</b> of the <b>slot</b> waveguide are linearly tapered to be connected to the multimode strip waveguide, and the slot is terminated within the tapering region. The mode transformer converts the slot waveguide mode into even transverse-electric (TE) modes. Because of multimode interference among the even TE modes in the crossing, the intersection can work efficiently. How to design the intersection is explained. The throughput, crosstalk, and reflectance of the intersection are – 0. 078 dB, – 41 dB and – 36 dB, respectively, at a wavelength of 1. 55 μm. In the wavelength interval between 1. 5 μm and 1. 6 μm, the throughput is larger than – 0. 17 dB, the crosstalk is smaller than – 40 dB, and the reflectance is smaller than – 29 dB. The performance of the intersection is better than those of previous intersections of silicon slot waveguides. The footprint is 79. 2 μm 2, which is just less than 33 % of those of previous intersections. Finally, the fabrication tolerance of the intersection is discussed. It is demonstrated that the intersection is quite tolerable to fabrication errors. ope...|$|R
