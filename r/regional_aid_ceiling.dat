In 2010 there were six major investment projects approved, four of them being in the photovoltaic sector in which three are in Germany, one is in Spain and the rest concern the mechanical industry in Germany and Italy.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the EC <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> policies to finance infrastructure investment in the poorest regions where large disparities in public infrastructure (transport, telecommunications, energy and education) exist. We show that in a model in which trade is based on increasing returns, increasing returns industries tend to locate in countries with better infrastructure. By decreasing the disparities in the levels of public infrastructure, the <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> policies lead firms to relocate from rich to poor countries. In the context of this model, the <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> policies can be interpreted as the price paid by the richest countries for the benefits of full trade integration. In the empirical section, we find that telecommunications and education infrastructures are well correlated with industry location and per capita GDP. However, transport infrastructure, on which EC <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> programmes concentrate, is poorly correlated with either industry location or per-capita GDP.

The issue is a consequence of the guarantee where BT is exempted from certain common law financial obligations, such as the payment of a levy to the Pension Protection Fund. The investigation will enable the Commission to determine whether these exemptions constitute state aid and, if so, whether such aid could be found compatible under EC Treaty state aid rules.

40|$|The {{increasing}} importance {{attached to}} {{the economic and social}} cohesion of the European Union since the 1980 s, and the role of competition policy in achieving this objective, has special significance for the control of <b>regional</b> <b>aids,</b> given the general ban on State <b>aid.</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>aids</b> are considered to have the potential to contribute to economic and social cohesion and to undermine its attainment. The notion of competition policy as an instrument of economic and social cohesion has become a standard part of Commission rhetoric in defence of its actions. This book is concerned with the influence of EU competition policy on the regional policies of the Member States. It focuses on how the European Commission has interpreted the derogations from the State aid ban to enable the conduct of <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> policies. The book takes both a historical perspective, tracing the evolution of policy, and a thematic one, examining in particular the relationship between EU competition and cohesion policies and the treatment of aid to very large projects. The author clearly demonstrates that, in reality, the competition policy control of <b>regional</b> <b>aids</b> is of much longer standing than the community¿s explicit <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> policy and, in many respects, of arguably greater influence. She shows how competition policy has for almost thirty years shaped the design, scope and implementation of national <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> policies; in no EU country has regional policy been unaffected by Commission intervention in the name of competition policy. Moreover, the policy principles developed for the EU now apply extraterritorially to members of the European Economic Area and to the current applicant countries. The study's overall perspective is policy-oriented. It considers both the impact of Commission intervention in the past and the implications of policy for the future, especially in the context of enlargement and a wider Europe. It will be an invaluable resource for all policymakers and practitioners active in the fields of economic development, regional policy and State aid law at European, national and subnational levels...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{has been devoted to}} understanding the process and outcomes of Europeanization, but the measurement of its impact and of the adaptational pressures involved remains elusive. Conventional constructs of Europeanization view 'goodness of fit' as a key indicator of the level of adaptational pressure. However, the number and variety of factors to consider casts doubt on the usefulness of this concept as a predictor of outcomes, as opposed to an ex post explanatory variable. The measurement of Europeanization and adaptational pressures can be facilitated by three elements: adopting an EU-wide perspective to enable a comparative assessment of impacts and outcomes; using a clear example of a new European level policy initiative that impacts on all Member States simultaneously; and a detailed knowledge of the ex ante and ex post situation in each Member State. The case study analysed here incorporates all these elements. In 1998 the European Commission introduced <b>regional</b> State <b>aid</b> guidelines that were explicitly modelled on the German approach to <b>regional</b> <b>aid.</b> From 2000 these rules were to be imposed on all the Member States, almost all of which had radically different <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> traditions. Over the period 1998 - 2000, this resulted in fundamental policy reviews in most countries and intense negotiations between Member States and DG Competition. Counter-intuitively, perhaps, given the apparently very limited adaptation required, the most difficult negotiations concerned German <b>regional</b> <b>aid,</b> with the dispute culminating in Germany challenging the Commission before the European Court of Justice. Against this background, this article provides a cross-country analysis and evaluation of adaptational pressures under the 1998 <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> guidelines. It contributes to the Europeanization literature by exploring the means by which policy change can be measured and by investigating whether the predictive capacity of 'goodness of fit' can be improved...|$|R

More generally, over the last year or so, the European Commission has largely completed the reform programme set out in the 2012 State aid modernisation initiative. The reach of the reforms has been considerable: almost every substantive State aid text has been subject to review and revision, and there have been important procedural changes, notably in relation to transparency and new requirements for evaluation. Overall, there has been a significant recalibration of policy. In some areas, the s cope of compatible aid has been enlarged.
