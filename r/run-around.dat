5|$|In 1864 Brookwood (Necropolis) {{railway station}} on the LSWR opened, {{immediately}} east of Necropolis Junction. In conjunction with {{the building of the}} station a <b>run-around</b> loop was added at Necropolis Junction, allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front {{to the rear of the}} train. From then on, on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned, but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of the cemetery, after which it would use the <b>run-around</b> loop to move to the other end of the train and pull it back to London. Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{line had}} been built single track throughout, with the only <b>run-around</b> loop {{provided}} at Amlwch, meaning that trains could not pass each other. To ensure safe working, the Staff and Ticket system was used in three sections: Gaerwen-Llangefni, Llangefni-Llanerchymedd, and Llanerchymedd-Amlwch, using A and B configured staffs alternately. No turntable was built, as the intended Fairlie engines would not require one. When the LNWR provided engines, they used tank engines where possible, rather than an engine with a tender.|$|E
50|$|Typsettra {{did work}} for many {{important}} designers and art directors. In {{his role as}} a Type Director, Usherwood help create the unique style of detailed ‘jigsaw’ layout typography typified by tightly spaced custom headline faces, long text with many <b>run-arounds.</b> There is a clear comparison to the work of Herb Lubalin, Ed Benguiat, and U&lc magazine.|$|R
50|$|Southwest of Himrod Junction, FGLK {{has a small}} yard {{in which}} staging and <b>run-arounds</b> for the local to Watkins Glen or Penn Yan is made. GW2 (Geneva, NY to Watkins Glen NY, round trip) serves the branch line on an as needed basis. GW2 will run to Penn Yan if needed. Runs to Watkins Glen are more regular than runs to Penn Yan.|$|R
40|$|A {{new survey}} of housing counselors and {{attorneys}} finds homeowners are facing unreasonable delays, numerous obstacles, and servicer <b>run-arounds</b> in seeking help from their mortgage servicers, despite new laws, programs, and settlements {{intended to protect}} homeowners. Housing counselors report that loan servicing transfers, single points of contact not being available, {{and a lack of}} accountability prevent homeowners from accessing much-needed relief to avoid foreclosure. In conjunction with the survey (completed by 60 + counselors), eleven homeowners who worked with Housing and Economic Rights Advocates (HERA) shared declarations that outline the many problems they and their nonprofit attorneys encountered in trying to obtain relief...|$|R
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The <b>run-around</b> loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E

On the retirement in 1956 of a Mr and Mrs Dendy, who operated North Bar from 1948 to 1956 and lived in the station apartment, North station was abandoned, and demolished in the 1960s owing to dry rot. South Bar continued to operate as a refreshment kiosk.|$|E
5|$|On {{an episode}} of Colt Cabana's Art of Wrestling podcast {{released}} in November 2014, Punk broke his silence regarding his exit from WWE. In a detailed interview, Punk {{said that he was}} suspended for two months after walking out on the company in January and that after the suspension ended, nobody from WWE contacted him. He also told that when he reached out to them for unpaid royalties, he was given a <b>run-around</b> by company executives until he was handed his termination papers and was fired by WWE on his wedding day in June 2014. The manner of firing was the last straw for Punk, stating that he would never return to WWE and that following a legal settlement with WWE, there would be no further working relationship between them. The settlement included Punk giving WWE permission to sell his remaining merchandise.|$|E
50|$|Located at Mussel Pool, the Cottesloe Cabin is {{in place}} on the Station Platform, and is fully operational. In the Cottesloe Cabin, stands the former Wagin Lever frame, with 15 levers, this frame {{turned out to be}} the perfect size for the Mussel Pool Station. 13 of the 15 levers in the frame are used, for 3 sets of points & Locks, and 12 Signals. The cabin is used mostly on {{weekends}} during <b>run-arounds</b> at mussel pool station, however during large events the cabin is used to assist sorting and preparing trains at the start of the event.|$|R
5|$|The Metropolitan Railway Act 1885 {{had given}} Watkin {{permission}} {{to extend the}} line from Chesham {{to connect with the}} LNWR at Tring. Thus, although it was the terminus of the line, Chesham station was designed with a revival of the LNWR extension scheme in mind. The small station building was set {{to one side of the}} tracks to allow for a possible extension onwards. The station had a single platform, with a <b>run-around</b> loop and turntable alongside, together with a coaling station and water tank. The station was lit by gas light until 1925; the local gas works, which consumed around 5,000tons of coal each year, threatened to withdraw their coal traffic from the line if the station were fitted with electric lighting. While Chalfont Road station initially served a sparsely populated rural area (the village of Little Chalfont had not yet grown around the station), Chesham station was busy, and at the time of its opening had a full staff of a stationmaster, two ticket inspectors, two clerks, two porters and two collectors.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the other}} side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A <b>run-around</b> loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E
25|$|The Westgate Ports sidings at Victoria Dock {{were opened}} in October 2009, with two siding tracks (650 and 580 metres long) and a <b>run-around</b> track. The sidings handles trains for Australian Paper at Maryvale in Gippsland, {{carrying}} containerised paper reels.|$|E
500|$|William Cubitt {{decided that}} the terrain of the initial {{cemetery}} site was best suited to a railway branch at {{the west of the}} cemetery. Work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854. The single-track branch was completed in time for the opening two months later, at a total construction cost of £141917s6d (about £ in terms of [...] consumer spending power). The junction with the LSWR, known as Necropolis Junction, was west-facing, meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse {{in and out of the}} branch. No <b>run-around</b> loop was provided at Necropolis Junction, and a single crossover allowed trains from the Necropolis branch to reverse onto the northern (London-bound) track of the LSWR.|$|E
500|$|At Reedness, the Fockerby Branch {{turned to}} the north, and the Axholme Light Railway route swung to the south. Reedness Junction had a brick-built water tower, a house for the station master, and sidings to the north, {{accessible}} from the Fockerby Branch. It was some [...] from the village centre of Swinefleet, and [...] from Reedness village. The Branch was [...] long. Blackers siding and Whitgift siding were passed before the line reached Eastoft station, which was [...] north of the village centre.There were two sidings to the north. After crossing the road beside the Adlingfleet Drain, the proposed line to Adlinfleet would have continued beside the drain, but the line to Fockerby as built {{turned to the}} south-east. It passed Boltgate siding to reach Luddington station, with two sidings to the south, but still [...] from the village. Next came Pindar's siding, after which the line curved to the north to reach Fockerby, where there were two sidings and a <b>run-around</b> loop.|$|E
500|$|The station {{went through}} {{numerous}} enhancements {{in the first}} part of the twentieth century. A new platform canopy and urinal were provided in 1900 at a cost of £250. Further improvements followed in 1902 at a cost of £80; and in August 1904 significant enhancements to the station buildings and an extension of the platform cost a total of £1,570. A [...] turntable was constructed in December 1903; with a signal box, known as Avonmouth Dock Passenger, installed at the end of the platform. Dedicated goods staff were employed from the start of 1904, with that year also seeing the installation of a <b>run-around</b> loop for the terminal platform. A small engine shed was added in January 1905. In 1910, some passenger trains once again began to run beyond Avonmouth Dock, continuing towards [...] on the newly opened Henbury Loop Line, which allowed goods trains to the docks to avoid the steep Clifton Down Tunnel. Other trains arrived from London via the loop, connecting with steamer services to Canada and Jamaica. At this point there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth Dock and 15 back each day; increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920. The station was well-staffed, with 25 station staff and 47 goods staff in 1913. Positions included stationmaster; booking clerks; posters; and outdoor porters, who took goods to ships in the docks.|$|E
2500|$|On August 24, the Department of Public Works noted {{a letter}} to the parents {{committee}} noting that NY214 had been placed on the 1955 program for construction, like it had three years prior. The state also noted that they would do survey and design during the winter of 19541955 and then move the project to the contract stage in 1955. By late December 1954, the district engineer for the state noted that the work would be able to be contracted by April 1. However, plans were not sent to the state until late July 1955 to the main office in Albany. To make things worse, the defeat of a $750million road bond amendment in November 1955 would potentially [...] delay the work on NY214 even further. Stating more <b>run-around</b> by the state, John Papp, the chair of the parents committee noted that the letting proposal for a contract was to start December 1, 1955, but defeating the amendment changed plans, even though part of the road was severely damaged in a storm on October 16.|$|E

50|$|A <b>run-around</b> coil {{is a type}} {{of energy}} {{recovery}} heat exchanger most often positioned within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system, or in the exhaust gases of an industrial process, to recover the heat energy. Generally, it refers to any intermediate stream used to transfer heat between two streams that are not directly connected for reasons of safety or practicality. It may also be referred to as a <b>run-around</b> loop, a pump-around coil or a liquid coupled heat exchanger.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, the Society's {{extension}} reached New Coombe Bridge, where {{a simple}} <b>run-around</b> loop was provided on the {{alignment of the}} former up line through West Hoathly, located {{just north of the}} former No.2 platform. Since then, the Society - much like the 1960s railway removal contractors - have used the site to store materials for the extension, which were delivered there by road. This allowed the rebuilding of New Coombe Bridge, and opening of the extension northwards to Kingscote in early 1994. With the installation of a <b>run-around</b> loop at Kingscote railway station, the loop just north of West Hoathly was removed, and the line returned to its current single-track, non-stopping configuration.|$|E
50|$|A Ralli car (or Rally cart) is a {{traditional}} type of horse-drawn cart, named after the Ralli family. The vehicle was commonly used as a general <b>run-around</b> for families. It has back-to-back seating with space under the seats for luggage or shopping bags.|$|E
