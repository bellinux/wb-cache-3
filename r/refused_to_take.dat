In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily.

If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
