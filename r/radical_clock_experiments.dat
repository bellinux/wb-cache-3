40|$|A {{strategy}} for the enantioselective [2 + 2] photocycloaddition of isoquinolones with alkenes is presented, in which {{the formation of a}} supramolecular complex between a chiral template and the substrate ensures high enantioface differentiation by shielding one face of the substrate. Fifteen different electron-deficient alkenes and ten different substituted isoquinolones undergo efficient photocycloaddition, yielding the cyclobutane products in excellent yields and with outstanding regio-, diastereo- and enantioselectivities (up to 99 % ee). The mechanism of the reaction is investigated by means of triplet sensitization/quenching and <b>radical</b> <b>clock</b> <b>experiments,</b> the results of which are consistent with the involvement of a triplet excited state and a 1, 4 -biradical intermediate.

40|$|The copper-catalyzed arylation of nucleophiles {{has been}} {{established}} as an efficient methodology {{for the formation of}} C-C and C-heteroatom bonds. Considering the advances during the last two decades, the ligand choice {{plays a key role in}} such transformations and can strongly influence the catalytic efficiency. The applicability of these Ullmann-type coupling reactions regarding the orthogonal selectivity of different functional groups constitutes a challenging subject for current synthetic strategies. Herein, we report a useful toolkit of Cu-based catalysts for the chemoselective arylation of a wide-range of nucleophiles in competitive reactions using aryl iodides and bromides. We show in this work that the arylation of all kinds of amides can be orthogonal to that of amines (aliphatic or aromatic) and phenol derivatives. This high chemoselectivity can be governed by the use of different ligands, yielding the desired coupling products under mild conditions. The selectivity trends are maintained for electronically biased iodobenzene and bromobenzene electrophiles. <b>Radical</b> <b>clock</b> <b>experiments</b> discard the occurrence of radical-based mechanismsThis work was supported by grants from the European Research Council (Starting Grant Project ERC- 2011 -StG- 277801), the Spanish MICINN (CTQ 2013 - 43012 -P, Consolider-Ingenio CSD 2010 - 00065, INNPLANTA project INP- 2011 - 0059 -PCT- 420000 -ACT 1), and the Catalan DIUE of the Generalitat de Catalunya (2014 SGR 862...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{tool for}} better understanding {{the complex nature}} of the cofactor of heme thiolate proteins such as Cytochromes P 450 is the investigation of model compounds. In this context a new family of iron porphyrins has been synthesized by replacing the native thiolate ligand for a SO 3 - group coordinating the heme iron. The porphyrin mimics designed and synthesized {{during the course of}} this thesis were successfully used as catalytic oxidants in <b>radical</b> <b>clock</b> <b>experiments.</b> trans- 2 -Phenyl-methylcyclopropane was oxidized using PhIO and the porphyrin model. Analysis of the product distribution revealed a ratio of 9 : 1 of the non-rearranged cyclopropyl methanol over 1, 1 -allyl phenyl methanol. Given the rate of rearrangement k = 1. 8 · 1011 sec - 1 of the phenyl cyclopropyl methyl radical in solution, the life time of the intermediate radical cluster IC- H can be calculated as 625 fsec. This time is analogous to the lifetimes observed in enzymatic hydroxylations. It was proposed that this intermediate is not a free radical but instead a cluster containing a CH 2 group carrying spin density joined to the spin system of the …H…O-Fe(III) porphyrin radical cation. The two routes to the final oxidized products, originating from this intermediate I - H, are C divergent, the unrearranged alcohol is formed via a concerted route whereas the rearranged product is produced from either a high-spin or low spin pathway.

40|$|This thesis reports {{investigations}} {{on the use}} of amidic ligands, {{in particular}} picolinamide ligands, in copper-catalysed arylation of nucleophiles with aryl halides. An introduction to the field of copper-catalysed arylations of nucleophiles, mostly focusing on the mechanistic aspects of these processes, from the early investigations to the most recent developments, is reported in Chapter 1. Following this introduction, the results of this research are presented in three chapters, each dealing with a different topic. Chapter 2 reports on the synthesis of a range of differently substituted picolinamide ligands and their use in the copper-catalysed arylation of phenols and amides. The catalytic screenings reported in this chapter are the basis for the mechanistic investigations reported in Chapter 4. A range of phenols, amides and aryl halides were tested under optimised conditions to assess the validity of the method. All the coupling products were isolated and characterised. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis of copper complexes with picolinamide ligands, to be used for mechanistic investigations. Five different types of complexes, with differently substituted ligands, were obtained, and their structural features in the solid state are summarised in this chapter. Discussion on the mechanism of formation of these complexes, and {{on the role of the}} base in the process is also included. Investigations on the mechanism of the coupling reaction between phenols and aryl halides, facilitated by picolinamide ligands, are reported in Chapter 4. The complexes synthesised in Chapter 3, used as pre-catalysts for the coupling process, and electrochemical measurements on these complexes, are employed to investigate the role of the electronic properties of the ligands in the reaction, and its influence on the metal centre. Other miscellaneous experiments, such as <b>radical</b> <b>clock</b> <b>experiments,</b> are also reported.

40|$|The copper-mediated {{aromatic}} nucleophilic substitution reactions {{developed by}} Fritz Ullmann and Irma Goldberg required stoichiometric amounts of copper and very high reaction temperatures. Recently, {{it was found}} that addition of relatively cheap ligands (diamines, aminoalcohols, diketones, diols) made these reactions truly catalytic, with catalyst amounts as low as 1 mol% or even lower. Since these catalysts are homogeneous, it has opened up the possibility to investigate the mechanism of these modified Ullmann reactions. Most authors agree that Cu(I) is the true catalyst even though Cu(0) and Cu(II) catalysts have also shown to be active. It should be noted however that Cu(I) is capable of reversible disproportionation into Cu(0) and Cu(II). In the first step, the nucleophile displaces the halide in the LnCu(I) X complex forming LnCu(I) ZR (Z = O, NR', S). Quite a number of mechanisms have been proposed for the actual reaction of this complex with the aryl halide: 1. Oxidative addition of ArX forming a Cu(III) intermediate followed by reductive elimination; 2. Sigma bond metathesis; in this mechanism copper remains in the Cu(II) oxidation state; 3. Single electron transfer (SET) in which a radical anion of the aryl halide is formed (Cu(I) /Cu(II)); 4. Iodine atom transfer (IAT) to give the aryl radical (Cu(I) /Cu(II)); 5. π-complexation of the aryl halide with the Cu(I) complex, which is thought to enable the nucleophilic substitution reaction. Initially, the radical type mechanisms 3 and 4 where discounted {{based on the fact that}} radical clock-type experiments with ortho-allyl aryl halides failed to give the cyclised products. However, a recent DFT study shows that the modified Ullmann reaction between aryl iodide and amines or primary alcohols proceeds either via an SET or an IAT mechanism. It is shown that stalled aminations can be rejuvenated by the addition of Cu(0), which serves to reduce the formed Cu(II) to Cu(I); this also corroborates a Cu(I) /Cu(II) mechanism. Thus the use of <b>radical</b> <b>clock</b> type <b>experiments</b> in these metal catalysed reactions is not reliable. DFT calculations from Hartwig seem to confirm a Cu(I) /Cu(III) type mechanism for the amidation (Goldberg) reaction, although not all possible mechanisms were calculated. ...|$|R

40|$|Solvent {{effects on}} the {{kinetics}} of the nitroxide radical trapping (NRT) of various carbon-centered radicals have been probed both by using the radical "clock" method and by the laser flash photolysis (LFP) technique. Although the rate constants for NRT, kT, are lower than the diffusion-controlled limit they are, nevertheless, influenced by solvent viscosity. Rate constants arc even more strongly influenced by {{the ability of the}} solvent to solvate the nitroxide. Thus, using the 2, 2 -dimethyl-to 1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -butenyl <b>radical</b> <b>clock</b> rearrangement, 1 * 2 ̆ 192 kC 2 *, at 80 0 C (kc = 2. 4 7 107 s- 1) with 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyl-isoindole- 2 -oxyl (TMIO) as the trap, in 32 solvents ranging from to aqueous methanol, it found that log (KT/kT) /M- 1) was strongly correlated with the nitroxide's solvation, as gauged by the solvent's effect on the nitrogen hyperfine splitting of a structurally analogous nitroxide ((r) = 0. 961 for 26 nonhydroxylic solvents, the hydroxylic solvents forming a separate group). Similar results were obtained at 80 0 C with five other <b>radical</b> <b>clocks</b> using smaller solvent sets. Comparison of these <b>radical</b> <b>clock</b> data with the kinetic results obtained by LFP at 18 0 for the NRT of benzyl (22 solvents), n-nonyl (4), and neopentyl (6) by Tempo provides the first unequivocal proof that the kinetics of commonly used alkyl <b>radical</b> <b>clock</b> rearrangements are essentially uninfluenced by solvent properties. Although NRT is primarily an activation-controlled reaction, the magnitude of kT is decreased by an increase in solvent viscosity as is clearly indicated by LFP data for the trapping of benzyl radicals by the sterically unencumbered, Bredt's rule protected nitroxide, 9 -azabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane-N-oxyl (ABNO) in saturated hydrocarbons (3 ̆b 7 = 0. 3 - 16 cP).
