5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, the castle {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board. Due to the {{expansion}} of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became surrounded by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with <b>roofing</b> <b>felt</b> to make the site waterproof.|$|E

500|$|Radcliffe became {{well known}} for its paper industry; its mills {{included}} the East Lancashire Paper Mill and Radcliffe Paper Mill. The former was founded by the Seddon family on 29 March 1860, {{along the banks of}} the Irwell. Its construction provided much-needed employment: in the 1860s living standards within the town were poor, and local mills often operated on [...] "short time". A reduction in the demand for coal had placed many colliers out of work, and the Lancashire Cotton Famine was starving Lancashire of raw materials, especially cotton. Soup kitchens were opened by local benefactors, and many local residents were on poor relief. The mill began producing low grade paper and newsprint, moving on to other products including high quality printing and writing papers. Radcliffe Paper Mill was formed during the First World War, when it took over from a paper mill and a pipe plant. It originally produced paper suitable for <b>roofing</b> <b>felt,</b> to cater for a national shortage. After World War II the mill employed over 600people and produced 70,000tons of paper annually. British Plaster Board Industries (BPB) took over the company in 1961.|$|E

Inverted U-shaped drainage tiles were inserted between the beams to help remove any water which leaked from above. A [...] thick sheet of polyethylene formed a moisture barrier above the perlite, and [...] thick layer of concrete laid atop the moisture barrier. The bottom of the pool consisted of another five layers of <b>roofing</b> <b>felt,</b> on top of which were laid a [...] thick layer of gravel. [...] The gravel-impregnated grout was laid down in alternating grey and white sections (each section separated by a brass rail), to add visual distinctiveness {{to the bottom of the}} pool.

Overflow drains were placed at intervals on the inside of the lip, just below the granite cladding. A gutter just outside the pool provided extra diversion in case water spilled over the lip. Grey granite slabs, also imported from West Germany, formed a sidewalk around the pool.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes it {{is desired}} {{not to put}} an antenna on the roof; in these cases, antennas {{designed}} for outdoor use are often mounted in the attic or loft, although antennas designed for attic use are also available. Putting an antenna indoors significantly decreases its performance due to lower elevation above ground level and intervening walls; however, in strong signal areas reception may be satisfactory. One layer of asphalt shingles, <b>roof</b> <b>felt,</b> and a plywood roof deck is considered to attenuate the signal to about half.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{environmental}} impacts and achieve sustainability, {{it is important to}} balance the interactions between the built and natural environment. The construction industry is becoming more aware of ecological concerns and the importance that biodiversity and maintenance ecosystem services has for sustainability. Bats constitute an important component of urban biodiversity and several species in the UK are highly dependent on buildings, making them particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic and environmental changes. Many buildings suitable for use as bat roosts often require re-roofing as they age and traditional bituminous <b>roofing</b> <b>felts</b> are frequently being replaced with breathable roofing membranes (BRMs). In the UK new building regulations and modern materials may substantially reduce the viability of existing roosts, yet at thesame time building regulations require that materials be fit for purpose. Reports suggest that both bats and BRMs may experience problems when the two interact. Such information makes it important to understand how house dwelling bats and BRMs may be affected. This paper considers the possible ways in which bats and BRMs may interact, how this could affect existing bat roosts within buildings and the implications for BRM service life predictions and warranties.
