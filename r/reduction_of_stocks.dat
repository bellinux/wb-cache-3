Especially for forging industry, which is characterized by long set-up times and large order quantities, the improvement of production planning and control accuracy is getting more exigent. On the one hand, forging companies aim the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> their <b>stock</b> level to minimize capital commitment. However, the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> level frequently induces missing parts or raw material and consequently the risk of decreasing the deliver reliability. On the other hand, forging {{industry is}} situated in a turbulent logistic environment caused by continuously fluctuating demands and unreliable raw material suppliers. Combined with the mentioned <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> level, achieving the desired logistic performance is barely possible. Hence, logistic risk management is needed to improve the production planning and control (PPC) through an early identification, quantification and assessment of logistic risks in the supply chain.

40|$|Nowadays {{there are}} tow main methods in {{planning}} of assembly processes. The first one {{starts with a}} detailed analysis of the assembly problem. In the second step, a rough concept will be designed which corresponds to the requirements picked up in step one. After developing a detailed concept, the layout of the assembly line and the design of the workplaces is designed in a detailed way. Also the simulation of the sequences takes places in this step. In the last step the realisation takes place. The alternative method is based on a catalogue with existing solutions. The assembly task will be divided to its basic steps. For each of the basic steps an existing solution will be selected from the known solutions and in a final step integration of the single solutions to a concept will be done. The new methods "Wertstrom" and continuous flow can be used alternatively. With the Werstrom method the analysis of the existing material and information flow in an assembly planz can be done easily. Based on the analysis an ideal concept can be developed very quickly. The aim of this method is a sequential detection of assembly problems by a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> in the assembly line. The proceeding results in lower stocks and a shorter pass-through time. The basic aim of continuous flow is the total elimination of buffer stocks between the assembly steps. This results in very short pass-through times and an increased quality level. Combined with a flexible U-shaped assembly layout this also leads to a more flexible worker employment. To implement this principle in assembly of wire harnesses, it is necessary to shift work from the jig board to subassembly places in which a connector assembly is done were planned. This leads to reduced working times on the jig boards...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} focused on the {{influence}} of advanced manufacturing technologies on company’s performance. The aim of this contribution is to suggest the suitable concept of performance management that enables to measure the influence of advanced manufacturing technologies. The introductory part of the article defines the term “advanced manufacturing technologies” (AMT) as information technologies for the storage of data and their subsequent processing. A complex and lucid view onto the company performance and generators of this performance provides the concept of Kaplan and Norton referred to as Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The goals and measures are based on the vision of a strategy of the company and monitor its performance from the four following perspectives: financial, customer-related, internal processes, learning and growth. The utilization of BSC can be amplified by the emphasis on the value-based approach to the management of performance. The value orientation of BSC can be attained by properly selecting the value-based indicator, for example Economic Value Added (EVA), as the top criterion of the financial perspective of BSC. EVA (net operative profit minus capital expenses) measures {{the extent to which the}} company contributed in the given period by its activities to the increase or decrease value for the owners. The allocation of capital should be in accordance with the fundamental goal, which is to accept only such projects that will generate value thus contributing to the creation of EVA. A great advantage of the concept EVA is the possibility of linking strategic and operative decision-making and utilizing it on all levels of management by searching for and supporting of so-called value-generators. The approach BSC allows a complex view on effects from the introduction of AMTs without any aspect to be omitted. By acquiring AMT the perspective of learning and growth is supported significantly. AMTs require an intensive utilization of sophisticated information systems, which makes demands on abilities and qualifications of the employees so that they are able to work effectively. The perspective of internal processes is also significantly influenced by utilizing AMTs. Their utilization may lead to reduced amounts of material usage, to <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> of materials, to acceleration of the manufacturing cycle, better utilization of the manufacturing equipment, acceleration of development and to an increase of the number of innovations. At the same time it is possible to assume that these technologies reduce the number of necessary employees. The result will be reduced costs, higher quality of products, lower number of defects etc. By providing a better quality product faster that meets the specific requirements of a customer, the customer can be more satisfied. However, AMT often mean high expenditures during their acquisition (negative effect on cash flow during the acquisition) and resulting higher costs in individual years of their service life due to depreciation. Investment into AMT usually ties up the long-term capital that provides the expenses. Increased revenues from sales of products or services and cost savings must exceed the disadvantage of high acquisition costs and tied-up capital bearing costs. Only in such a case the acquisition and operation of AMTs can lead to a positive EVA and to an increase of the company value. Our research suggests that these frameworks are in fact complementary and can be very affective when used together...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} have {{called into question}} the established principles of successful business management. These developments find expression in the increasing saturation of "first world" markets, where demand tends towards individualization. Reasons are a demographic shift resulting in an aging population and a fragmentation of target groups. In addition, an ongoing and deepening process of internationalization and deregulation has taken place over the past years. It has opened up new sales and supply markets, but also initiated {{a new type of}} competition at international level. From a technological point of view, the innovation cycles have steadily shortened due to new technological solutions at product and process level and in information and communication technology. Numerous expert papers on manufacturing engineering describe the trend towards a more dynamic environment, along with more customized products, using the terms "turbulence" or "environmental turbulence". A highly complex and dynamic environment makes it difficult to generate forecasts and confronts manufacturing companies with new challenges in global competition. Customers call for highly customized products with state-of-the art technology to be delivered as soon as possible, while being less and less willing to pay for it. To remain successful, companies must counteract the increasing requirements at product, price and service level. The future will only see those companies survive in the market that continue to meet the exact needs of their customers. These companies must be able, at any time, to identify new trends or spark new ones. With a lower degree of vertical integration, they need to focus on their core competencies and produce products in value chains or networks of competent, creative and innovative companies. That is why learning how to manage a network, and to think and to act in terms of a network, are essential capabilities. Many of the activities carried out by companies - often to cut down on costs - increase the significance of high-quality network management. Examples are known as "global sourcing", "outsourcing" (focus on core competencies by contracting out value-adding activities, e. g. modularization in vehicle construction), but also the ongoing <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> and the amount of capital tied-up. A greater inclusion of partners distributed across the world, as well as the reduction of safety stocks to a minimum, require a well-functioning network. To this must be added the growing market demand for short delivery times, for a more flexible handling of customer change requests and for high schedule reliability. As a result, the call for greater stability and flexibility does not only affect the network as a whole, but each individual customer-supplier interface in the network. Moreover, the number of interfaces grows with ongoing intertwining of the network. Above all, these changes require raising the quality of process synchronization in order to optimize the customer-supplier-interfaces. Several solutions have been pursued as part of supply chain management, but they do not go far enough. The following three key problems arise in industrial practice: - There are no universal indicators - resulting in a lack of visibility - which allow to measure the quality of a customer's order and call-off patterns. That's why this advance information is not considered appropriately, even though it has a considerable impact on the delivery performance of the supplier. - There are numerous turbulence germs in the companies that trigger fluctuations in the order and call-off patterns. There is a lack of methods to identify and eliminate self-induced turbulence. - Growing environmental turbulence results more often in externally driven turbulence, i. e. market- or consumer-driven turbulence. There are no appropriate approaches in science and business that enable arrangements which minimize turbulence between customer and supplier. The aim of this thesis is therefore to find concrete solutions to the three problems described above in order to contribute to the process synchronization of customer-supplier interfaces. The quality of the customer-supplier interface is a key determinant of competitiveness in a manufacturing environment where series products are manufactured at regular intervals over an extended period. Both the continuous order flow and the deliveries at short intervals provide the necessary basis for a model that allows analyzing and designing the order pattern. The model developed in this thesis is based on two key components for the analysis and design of order patterns. The first part describes a method to quantify order patterns {{so that they can be}} sorted into quality categories. A company can thus assess both its own order pattern as well as that of its customers. The outcome allows interpreting the order pattern. The interpretation determines if and how problematic the measured order pattern is for the network and if this order pattern is "logically comprehensible". The analysis model considers the four key trouble spots identified when assessing the state of the art. These four areas of action require taking into full consideration the three dimensions of order quantity, order date and delivery date, the identification of actual customer needs, the risks associated with fluctuation, and the relationship between fluctuation characteristics and possible causes of fluctuations. This interpretation provides the basis for the design part of the developed model. It recommends specific actions to eliminate self- and externally induced turbulence germs. Specific cause-and-effect relationships referring to exemplary fluctuation patterns and associated typical 'obstacles' in real life help to reduce the self-induced order fluctuations. Due to the fact that many turbulence germs are externally induced and therefore cannot be avoided, this thesis suggests how customer and supplier can handle the expected fluctuations by agreeing on fluctuation margins. The analysis of the "state of the art" revealed two major criteria: specific dependencies between products or variants in terms of flexible delivery need to be considered, and a practical approach developed for customers and suppliers to come to such an agreement. The model presented here makes an important contribution to improving collaboration at the customer-supplier interface and thus to making networks more stable. The model has been verified by an abstract data model proving that the requirements set for such a model can be satisfied. Moreover, it is also possible to apply subcomponents of the developed model in practice, for example, when working out customer-supplier agreements, which is also possible without an advance retrograde analysis of the order pattern...|$|E
40|$|Ein immer turbulenter werdendes Umfeld und die damit verbundenen höheren Anforderungen an die Stabilität und Flexibilität von ganzen Netzwerken stellt Industrieunternehmen vor eine neue Ausgangssituation. Die veränderten Umfeldbedingungen sind mit Risiken verbundenen, bieten aber allen Beteiligten auch die große Chance, sich zukünftige Wettbewerbsvorteile zu sichern. Das Thema gewinnt insofern an Bedeutung, als eigentlich jedes Industrieunternehmen ungeachtet seiner Größe tagtäglich in Netzwerken über seine zahlreichen Schnittstellen agiert. Genau hier unterstützt die vorliegende Arbeit die Schaffung einer neuen Qualität der Prozess-Synchronisation an der Schnittstelle zu anderen Unternehmen. Die hier formulierten Anforderungen und die Darstellung des Standes der Technik zeigen, dass verbesserte und neue Prinzipien, Verfahren und Modelle zur Harmonisierung von Kunden-Lieferanten-Beziehungen notwendig sind. Das in dieser Arbeit entwickelte Modell basiert auf den zwei Kernbausteinen Analyse und Gestaltung von Bestellverhalten. Im ersten Teil wird eine Methode zur Quantifizierung von Bestellverhalten beschrieben, mit deren Hilfe das Bestellverhaltens einer Güteklasse zugeordnet wird. Ein Unternehmen kann damit sowohl sein eigenes Bestellverhalten oder das seines Kunden bewerten. Auf Basis dieser Ergebnisse wird dann das Bestellverhalten interpretiert. Diese Interpretation belegt, inwieweit das gemessene Bestellverhalten ein Problem im Netzwerk darstellt, und inwieweit dieses Bestellverhalten „logisch nachvollziehbar“ ist. Das Analysemodell berücksichtigt dabei die wesentlichen vier Handlungsbedarfe, die bei der Bewertung des Standes der Technik identifiziert wurden. Diese vier Handlungsbedarfe beziehen sich auf die ganzheitliche Berücksichtigung der drei Dimensionen Bestellmenge, Bestelltermin und Zeitpunkt der Bestellung, die Identifikation des tatsächlichen Kundenwunsches, die mit einer Schwankung verbundenen Risiken sowie den Zusammenhang zwischen Schwankungscharakteristik und möglichen Schwankungsursachen. Diese Interpretation liefert damit die Basis für den Gestaltungsteil des hier entwickelten Modells. Darin werden konkrete Handlungsempfehlungen für eigen- und fremdinduzierte Turbulenzkeime vorgeschlagen. Bei der Reduzierung eigeninduzierter Bestellschwankungen helfen konkrete Ursachen-Wirkungs-Zusammenhänge zwischen beispielhaften Schwankungsmustern und dazugehörenden typischen „Stolpersteinen“ aus der Praxis. Da sich eine Vielzahl an Turbulenzen aufgrund ihres fremdinduzierten Charakters nicht vermeiden lassen, wird dargestellt, wie Kunde und Lieferant die zu erwartenden Turbulenzen mittels Schwankungskorridoren vereinbaren können. Bei der Analyse des „Standes der Technik“ wurden zwei besonders wichtige Kriterien identifiziert: die Berücksichtigung spezifischer Abhängigkeiten zwischen Produkten oder Varianten bezüglich der Lieferflexibilität sowie eine praxisnahe Vorgehensweise für Kunde und Lieferant zur Erlangung einer derartigen Vereinbarung. Das hier vorgestellte Modell leistet einen wichtigen Beitrag zur besseren Zusammenarbeit an der Schnittstelle Kunde-Lieferant und damit zur Stabilität ganzer Netzwerke. Die Verifizierung des Modells mit einem abstrahierten Datenmodell belegt, dass die Anforderungen an ein derartiges Modell erfüllt werden können. Darüber hinaus können auch Teilelemente des entwickelten Modells in der Praxis eingesetzt werden, etwa bei der Vereinbarung einer Kunden-Lieferanten-Vereinbarung, die auch ohne vorangehende {{retrograde}} Analyse des Bestellverhaltens möglich ist.

Moreover, it is also possible to apply subcomponents of the developed model in practice, for example, when working out customer-supplier agreements, which is also possible without an advance retrograde analysis of the order pattern...|$|E
40|$|In this article, we analyze {{whether the}} Softwood Lumber Agreement between the United States and Canada imposed {{significant}} economic costs on industries that use softwood lumber in the United States. To ascertain this impact, we use an event study. Our event study analyzes {{variations in the}} <b>stock</b> prices <b>of</b> lumber-using firms listed at the major stock markets in the United States. We find that the news of events leading to the Softwood Lumber Agreement had significant negative impacts on the <b>stock</b> prices <b>of</b> industries using softwood lumber. The average <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> prices for our sample of firms was approximately 5. 42 % over all the events considered.

40|$|The {{impact of}} futures {{trading on the}} {{underlying}} asset volatility, and its characteristics, is still debated both in the economic literature and among practitioners. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the effect of the introduction <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> index futures on the volatility <b>of</b> the Italian <b>Stock</b> Exchange. This study mainly addresses two issues: first, the study analyses whether the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> market volatility showed in the post-futures period, already pointed out in previous research, is effectively due to the introduction of futures contract. Second, whether the 'futures effect', if confirmed, is immediate or delayed with respect to the moment of the futures trading onset is tested. The results show that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> index futures per se has led to diminished stock market volatility and no other contingent cause seems to have systematically reduced it. Further, they also suggest that the impact of futures onset on the underlying market volatility is likely to be immediate. These findings are consistent with those theories stating that active and developed futures markets enhance the efficiency of the corresponding spot markets. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} the diploma work {{is the use of}} modern methods in the {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>stock.</b> Stock represents very important part of the company's economy; its right level contributes to the increase of competitiveness of the company. The diploma work states the theoretical basis for management <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and analyzes in detail the chosen methods [...] kanban a Just-In-Sequence, which is often understood as a next step in implementation of the pull principle [...] consumption manager inventory. The main aim of the work is the analysis of definition <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> for the system of kanban and Just-In-Sequence and definition which effect have it's parts on the stock. According to a target of the work a hypothesis was defined. The right implementation of kanban, or Just-In-Sequence and incidence on it's parts contributes to a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock.</b> The practical part of the work analyzes in detail the formulas of calculation <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> in the system of kanban, it's factors are simulated and the level <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> examined.

White clover population {{could be affected}} by changes in grasslandproduction intensity. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the white clover response on N application and stocking density. Three-year experiment was carried out on semi-natural grassland that was rotationally grazed with sheep. Three levels of N fertilizer were applied: 35, 100 and 150 kg N ha- 1 (N 35, N 100 and N 150, respectively) and two levels <b>of</b> <b>stocking</b> density were managed: 68 and 119 animal units ha- 1 (ZP 68 and ZP 119, respectively) to investigate their effect on white clover dry matter (DM) yield, white clover content, frequency and regenerative ability. White clover DM yield and its content in the sward was not affected by the stocking density. The white clover content decreased during the experiment. The effect of N application on regenerative ability parameters was not constant and depends on the part of the vegetation season. These results indicate that the white clover is an unstable floristic component in the type of grassland investigated under applied management practice. However, reduction in N inputs is necessary to improve performance and the regenerative ability of the white clover...|$|R
