50|$|Gorse flourishes on this site. Bramble and elder scrub grow on {{the eastern}} side of the site. There is cow parsley, common nettle and <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb.</b>|$|E
50|$|The oval {{eggs are}} {{laid on the}} surface of leaves, usually near the midrib. The {{caterpillars}} are yellow with a brown head. They have a thoracic plate and an anal plate. The caterpillars feed on the leaves of Epilobium angustifolium (<b>Rosebay</b> <b>Willowherb).</b> The caterpillars mine the leaves of <b>Rosebay</b> <b>Willowherb.</b> They cause a yellowish blotch on the leaves of E. angustifolium that bleach rapidly after the caterpillars leave them. The caterpillars occur in May to late July and late August to September They overwinter as a pupa. Pupation occurs among detritus on the ground.|$|E

50|$|Quarries, {{gravel and}} sand pits, roads and railways, field boundaries, walls, waste ground and rubbish tips contain such plant species as common ragwort, {{pineapple}} weed, hairy bindweed, creeping buttercup, common daisy, catsear, coltsfoot, fat hen, nettle, redshank, germander speedwell, ivy-leaved toadflax, <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb,</b> great willowherb and wall pennywort.|$|E
50|$|There is a drier area of {{heathland}} {{around the}} marsh which supports creeping willow, sneezewort, common fleabane, devil's-bit scabious, purple moor-grass, heather, cross-leaved heath heather and bell heather. The {{boundaries of the}} reserve are edged with bramble, gorse, silver birch and willow. <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> flourishes in one corner and its spread is controlled.|$|E
5000|$|The {{richness}} of the reserve is demonstrated by the recorded species which include Columbine, Greater Butterfly-orchid, Wood Anemone, Bluebell, Yellow Archangel, Primrose, Early Purple Orchid, Cowslip and the Early Dog-violet in the spring. Summer species include Common Milkwort, Oxeye Daisy, Common Knapweed and the Bulbous Buttercup. Also recorded are Foxglove, <b>Rosebay</b> <b>Willowherb</b> and flowerings of the rare Martagon Lily. Ferns grow between the stones such as Black Spleenwort and Hart's-tongue Fern.|$|E
50|$|On the plateau, brambles, bracken and <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> occupy {{extensive}} patches, {{but a more}} mixed ground flora occurs between these, including {{creeping soft-grass}} (Holcus mollis), hairy brome (Bromus ramosus), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), wood millet (Milium effusum) and wood melick (Melica uniflora). Pill sedge (Carex pilulifera), hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa) and slender St. John's-wort (Hypericum pulchrum) are found in more heathy areas, and the rushes Juncus effusus and J. conglomeratus are present in damper areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{site is a}} wide railway cutting with a {{diversity}} of habitat which provides {{a good example of}} railway ecology. The eastern bank has extensive brambles with clumps of blackthorn and hawthorn, and herbs such as <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> and Michaelmas daisy. The western bank is more natural with mature woodland of oak, ash and sycamore, and silver birch near the tunnel. The site is a useful habitat for birds such as goldfinch, wrens and dunnocks.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{organisation}} Plantlife International instituted the [...] "County Flowers scheme" [...] in 2002, for {{which members of}} the public nominated and voted for a wild flower emblem for their county. The aim was to spread awareness of the heritage of native species and about the need for conservation, as some of these species are endangered. For example, Somerset has adopted the Cheddar Pink (Dianthus gratianopolitanus), London the <b>Rosebay</b> <b>Willowherb</b> (Chamerion angustifolium) and Denbighshire/Sir Ddinbych in Wales the rare Limestone Woundwort (Stachys alpina).|$|E
50|$|Hedgecourt {{is home to}} a {{multitude}} of wildlife.In winter, bitterns {{can be seen in the}} reed beds near the yacht club, and tufted duck and pochard feed on the lake bed.In spring, nightingales have been heard singing in the old English oaks of the reserve. Many other spring migrants are found here too, such as chiffchaff, willow warbler and more rarely, Dartford warbler.In summer, many wild flowers bloom. These can include great willowherb, <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb,</b> wild strawberry, bluebell and much more.In autumn, fungi appear. The largest of these is chicken of the woods.|$|E
50|$|The fell is {{actively}} managed by Durham County Council, {{in an effort}} to maintain a broad range of heathland species, including such desirable species as heath bedstraw, Galium saxatile, and common tormentil, Potentilla erecta. Bracken is particularly troublesome because it crowds out the heather and associated species. The County Council has used a combination of burning and selective herbicides to control the bracken, and in 2007 embarked on a three-year trial of a more environmentally-friendly method, using heavy horses to pull a roller that crushes the bracken. These measures have not been entirely successful; areas that have been burnt are susceptible to invasion by <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb,</b> Epilobium angustifolium, while crushed areas have been colonised by the alien invasive heath star moss, Campylopus introflexus.|$|E
50|$|The main use of Epilobium {{by humans}} is as a herbal {{supplement}} {{in the treatment}} of prostate, bladder (incontinence) and hormone disorders.Many of the small willowherb species are nuisance weeds in gardens. Though few are regularly used as ornamental plants, the larger willowherbs may be attractive in ruderal locales. One of the most frequently recognized members of the genus is the circumboreal fireweed (E. angustifolium), known as <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> in the United Kingdom. It rapidly colonizes burnt ground; during the bombing of London in World War II many of the derelict bomb sites were soon covered with these plants, bringing a splash of colour to what was otherwise a very grim scene. It is the floral emblem of Yukon in Canada, Hedmark in Norway (where it is called geitrams) and Southern Ostrobothnia in Finland.|$|E
50|$|The {{field vole}} is a {{herbivore}} and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss and other vegetation and gnaws bark {{during the winter}} (it does not hibernate). It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. Among the plants it favours are the grasses Agrostis spp. and Festuca rubra, the yarrow (Achillea millefolium), clover (Trifolium spp.), dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and buttercups (Ranunculus spp.). The voles choose species with high digestibility where possible and avoid some common plants amongst which they live such as the tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> (Chamerion angustifolium). The animals have low energy reserves and these are only able to sustain them for five to fourteen hours. Because of the low availability of food in the winter, drier habitats are unable to sustain populations of much over two hundred animals per hectare. The number of voles expands rapidly {{with the arrival of}} spring and the better availability of food supplies.|$|E
50|$|Willowherbs {{sensu lato}} are {{typically}} very quick to carpet large swathes of ground and may become key or dominant species of local ecosystems. In the United Kingdom, for example, <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> (Chamaenerion angustifolium) is widely found on mesotrophic soils dominated by false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), cock's-foot grass (Dactylis glomerata), and red fescue (Festuca rubra), while great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum) {{is found in}} mesotrophic grassland with stinging nettle Urtica dioica). These two willowherb species also dominate open habitat early in ecological succession, to the virtual exclusion of other plant life. Broad-leaved willowherb (Epilobium montanum) is found characteristically, though not abundantly, in the mesotrophic grasslands with meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and sometimes the uncommon Greek valerian (Polemonium caeruleum). Most willowherbs will not tolerate shade trees and thus are limited to more recently disturbed patches, yielding to other plants over time. Consequently, though the genus contains many pioneer plants, rather few of them are invasive weeds of major importance.|$|E
5000|$|The vegetational {{succession}} {{following the}} coppice is being carefully monitored {{by means of}} permanent quadrats. In {{the first year after}} coppicing, more than seventy species of flowering plant have been recorded here - a gratifying increase from the original flora of a mere six species. The newcomers include heath groundsel, which is unknown elsewhere in the Borough, suggesting the possibility that its seed may have lain dormant in the soil since the last coppice was cut before the Second World War. Ring counts of the coppice poles suggest that this was done about sixty years ago. The majority of new plants, however, will have colonised from outside and many of the arrivals are widespread [...] species typical of disturbed open habitats, such as mugwort, sow-thistles and willowherbs. <b>Rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> dominates much of the area. A hundred years ago this was a rare plant in southern England and it is noteworthy that it was recorded from Coldfall Wood as early as 1901 (Kent 1975). The appearance of Sumatran fleabane was not entirely unexpected, for it has spread rapidly throughout Haringey since first being recorded from the Borough in 1985 (Wurzell 1988). It is also present in North Wood. There can be few other ancient woods in Britain that include this subtropical species in their flora.|$|E
40|$|The short {{drying time}} and low product {{temperature}} makes it suitable for drying such heat-sensitive materials as herbs and vegetables. The {{purpose of this}} work {{was to develop a}} small-scale dryer for herbs and vegetables. A prototype rotary dryer combining infrared radiation with a so-called heat pump drying method was applied in drying experiments for several herbs and vegetables. The drying experiments were performed under actual crop production conditions. The drying curves for leaves of birch (Betula spp.), <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> (Epilobium angustifolium) and dandelion (Taraxacum spp.) as well as slices of red beet (Beta vulgaris) and carrot (Daucus carota) are presented. During the drying operation, temperature and humidity of the drying air were recorded, as well as the energy consumed in drying. The quality parameters measured were water content, colour and rehydration ratio. In the present rotary dryer design, intermittent irradiation and mixing of the product enable to avoid overheating, which is particularly important for maintaining product quality. In this dryer design the drying drum slowly rotates and simultaneously mixes the product. The infrared heaters are attached to a panel, allowing the product to receive infrared radiation periodically...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how the degree of oligomerization of ellagitannins (ET) influences their ability to alter ruminal fermentation. Dimeric to heptameric ET were isolated from <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> (Epilobium angustifolium) flowers and purified. Ellagitannins were tested in vitro on a mixture of grass silage and buffered rumen fluid. Total gas production was measured in real time using an automated pressure evaluation system. Methane production was monitored at regular interval by gas chromatography for 72 h. The effect of ET was evaluated on 2 sources of rumen fluid using a randomized block design. Ammonia nitrogen, volatile fatty acid concentration, and pH were measured at the end of the experiment. Results show that oligomeric ET decreased gas production and total volatile fatty acid concentration proportionally to their degree of oligomerization. Methane production was also decreased by all the tested compounds and dimer was less effective than the larger ET, which showed similar levels of activity. Additionally, willowherb’s oligomeric ET decreased ammonia-nitrogen and branched-chain volatile fatty acid concentrations, thus indicating reduced protein degradation by ruminal bacteria. This effect showed a quadratic relationship with the degree of oligomerization and was maximal with the tetramer. In conclusion, this study shows that the degree of oligomerization of ET has more than a simple linear effect on fermentation parameters in vitro. Large oligomers, in fact, have more detrimental effects on volatile fatty acid and gas production than small ones, while being similarly effective at inhibiting methane production...|$|E
40|$|Heather (Calluna vulgaris), <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> (Epilobium angustifolium), {{wavy hair-grass}} (Deschampsia flexuosa) and {{raspberry}} (Rubus idaeus) are typical species on boreal clear-cut sites. According to our study, {{they all had}} clear and species-specific annual cycles of photosynthetic activity (Pmax). The maxima of C. vulgaris and E. angustifolium occurred around June and July, while that of R. idaeus occurred as late as in August. The photosynthetic activity of C. vulgaris followed the temperature history closely when the soil moisture was high. Deciduous D. flexuosa also followed the temperature history, unlike E. angustifolium and R. idaeus. During a short drought, some shoots decreased their Pmax levels {{but none of the}} species showed congruent reactions within individuals. In general, we noticed that the comparison of Pmax or respiration of different shoots caused less discrepancy when based on ground area than on leaf mass. Using species composition and continuous temperature and light measurements, we upscaled the species-specific process rates and integrated fixed and respired CO 2 of ground vegetation during an entire growing season 2005. The photosynthetic production of ground vegetation was 760 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the fertile site and 300 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the infertile site.

40|$|Heather (Calluna vulgaris), <b>rosebay</b> <b>willowherb</b> (Epilobium angustifolium), {{wavy hair-grass}} (Deschampsia flexuosa) and {{raspberry}} (Rubus idaeus) are typical species at boreal clear-cut sites. In this study, we measured their photosynthesis separately {{in the growing}} season of 2005 using a manual chamber. All measured species showed clear and species-specific seasonal cycles of photosynthetic activity (Pmax). The maxima of C. vulgaris and E. angustifolium occurred around June and July, while that of R. idaeus occurred as late as August. A simple model of photosynthetic activity is presented, addressing the photosynthesis of C. vulgaris was mainly explained by temperature history when the soil moisture is high. The activity of deciduous D. flexuosa also followed the temperature history, unlike the activities of E. angustifolium and R. idaeus. During a short drought, some shoots decreased their Pmax levels {{but none of the}} species showed similar reactions between individuals. We also observed that the comparison of the whole-plant Pmax or respiration of different-sized individuals were less scattered than the results based on full-grown leaf mass, implying that species-specific rates of photosynthesis at ground level are rather similar regardless of the plant size. Using species composition and continuous temperature and light measurements, we upscaled the species-specific process rates and integrated fixed and respired CO 2 of ground vegetation for the entire 2005 growing season. The photosynthetic production per surface area of soil was 760 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the fertile site and 300 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the infertile site. During the snow-free period (18 April– 21 November), the above ground parts of measured species released 75 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the infertile site.
