30|$|The {{unidirectional}} transmission of volatility between equity and currency {{market has been}} reported by following studies (Adjasi et al. 2008; Antonakakis 2012; Beer and Hebein 2011; Chkili and Nguyen 2014; Ebrahim 2000; Fedorova and Saleem 2009; Kanas 2000; Kang and Yoon 2013; O’Donnell and Morales 2009; Okpara and Odionye 2012; Yang and Doong 2004; Yang and Chang 2008). Ebrahim (2000) empirically examined the flow of volatility of exchange rate on the developed equity markets. The empirical evidence show asymmetric unidirectional price spillover for all the selected models. Kanas (2000) made an attempt to explore the developed equity countries i.e. France, Germany, US, Japan, Canada and UK for transmission of volatility between the two markets. He found significant unidirectional volatility effects flowing from equity returns to exchange rate returns for all economies except Germany. In other study, Yang and Doong (2004) extended the literature for G 7 countries for currency and equity market spillover effects. Their results show evidence of {{unidirectional transmission}} of shocks from equity to exchange rate market for United States, France, Italy and Japan. O’Donnell and Morales (2009) investigated Hungary, Slovakia, Czech republic and Poland. In case of Czech Republic and Slovakia, they reported unidirectional flow of volatility from currency rates to equity prices. Adjasi et al. (2008) empirically investigated Ghanaian stock and currency market and found significant spillover from currency returns to equity <b>returns.</b> <b>Beer</b> and Hebein (2011) made an attempt on studying the G 8 countries with South Korea, Hong Kong, India and Philippines. The unidirectional shock flow has been observed from currency market to equity market for Japan, India, US, Korea and Canada only. Yang and Chang (2008) carried out a study on Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore and USA and reported unidirectional asymmetric shock spillover from equity to currency market. Fedorova and Saleem (2009) examined the shock spillover of currency with equity market in European countries. Their empirical evidences showed currency spillover to equity market for all countries except Czech Republic. Okpara and Odionye (2012) empirically found unidirectional transmission of shocks from exchange rate to equity market for Nigeria. Antonakakis (2012) examined cross border currency shock spillover before and after Euro and other currency including Japanese yen, Swiss France and British Pound. They found evidence of cross border shock spillover for all currencies. Kang and Yoon (2013) reported unidirectional flow from exchange rate market to equity market of volatility with reference to Korea. Chkili and Nguyen (2014) recently examined the BRICS countries i.e. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. They used regime switching model and found volatility spillover from stock prices to exchange rate with no feedback from exchange rate.|$|R

5000|$|Although beer {{was a part}} {{of colonial}} life in the United States, the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1919 {{resulted}} in the prohibition of alcoholic beverage sales, forcing nearly all American breweries to close or switch to producing non-alcoholic products. After the repeal of Prohibition, the industry consolidated into a small number of large-scale breweries. Many of the big breweries that <b>returned</b> to producing <b>beer</b> after Prohibition, today largely owned by international conglomerates like Anheuser-Busch InBev or SABMiller, still retain their dominance of the market in the 21st century. However, the majority of the new breweries that have opened in the U.S. {{over the past three decades}} have been small breweries and brewpubs, referred to as [...] "craft breweries" [...] to differentiate them from the larger and older breweries.|$|R
