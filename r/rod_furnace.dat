40|$|A carbon <b>rod</b> <b>furnace</b> {{infrared}} source {{has been}} built and {{has proven to be}} a reliable and trouble-free source despite the high rod temperature of 2500 K. The furnace offers several advantages over previous furnaces. These include an increase in usable rod length to 6. 35 cm, extended rod life, and a fully automated power supply for the furnace.

40|$|We {{report the}} design of a {{radio-frequency}} induction-heated <b>rod</b> casting <b>furnace</b> that permits the preparation of polycrystalline ingots of intermetallic compounds under ultra-high vacuum compatible conditions. The central part of the system is a bespoke water-cooled Hukin crucible supporting a casting mold. Depending on the choice of mold, typical rods have a diameter between 6 mm and 10 mm and a length up to 90 mm, suitable for single-crystal growth by means of float-zoning. The setup is all-metal sealed and may be baked out. We find that the resulting ultra-high vacuum represents an important precondition for processing compounds with high vapor pressures under a high-purity argon atmosphere up to 3 bar. Using the <b>rod</b> casting <b>furnace,</b> we succeeded to prepare large high-quality single crystals of two half-Heusler compounds, namely the itinerant antiferromagnet CuMnSb and the half-metallic ferromagnet NiMnSb.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of a versatile material preparation chain for intermetallic compounds that focuses on the realization of a high-purity growth environment. The preparation chain comprises of an argon glovebox, an inductively heated horizontal cold boat furnace, an arc melting furnace, an inductively heated <b>rod</b> casting <b>furnace,</b> an optically heated floating-zone furnace, a resistively heated annealing furnace, and an inductively heated annealing furnace. The cold boat furnace and the arc melting furnace may be loaded from the glovebox by means of a load-lock permitting to synthesize compounds starting with air-sensitive elements while handling the constituents exclusively in an inert gas atmosphere. All furnaces are all-metal sealed, bakeable, and may be pumped to ultra-high vacuum. We find that the latter represents an important prerequisite for handling compounds with high vapor pressure under high-purity argon atmosphere. We illustrate operational aspects of the preparation chain in terms of the single-crystal growth of the heavy-fermion compound CeNi 2 Ge 2. Comment: 12 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Of {{the three}} infants, just one managed to survive, and {{adopted by the}} smith Gavida, was raised as his apprentice. One day, Balor {{appeared}} on the forge, and ordered some spears to be made when only the apprentice was at the workshop. Balor let slip {{the fact that he}} had killed Mac Kineely, not realising the apprentice was the bereaved son (not named, but presumably the equivalent of Lugh). The apprentice, pretending to slave away at the forge, awaited his chance and [...] "taking a glowing <b>rod</b> from the <b>furnace,</b> thrust it through the Basilisk eye of Balor," [...] thus exacting his revenge.|$|R
40|$|Disease Control were {{compared}} with those obtained by the NationalBureau of Standards (NBS) witha definitive method (mass spectroscopy-isotopic dilution) forblood lead analyses. Data were compiled from the resultsob-tainedfor 12 whole-bloodsamples Containing 1. 59 ofdi-sodium EDTA per liter. Twelve separate blood samples were obtained from cattle which had been given lead ni-trate orally. Lead concentrations in the samples ranged from 0. 628 to 4. 93 tmol/L (130 - 1020 g/L) as determined by NBS. The methods used by laboratories were classified according to six basic groups: anodic stripping voltametry; and atomic absorption spectroscopy in which either ex-traction, carbon <b>rod,</b> graphite <b>furnace,</b> tantalum strip, or Delves cup was used. For results obtained in each group a linear regression analyses of laboratory values was {{made on the basis}} of NBS values. In comparison to the definitive method, most field methods for blood lead tended to overestimate the lead concentration when the actual lead concentration was less than 1. 96 tmoI/L (400. tg/L) and to underestimate the lead concentration when the actual lead concentration was greater than 2. 45 smol/L (500 rg/L) ...|$|R

50|$|The Habsburg Monarchy, {{which then}} ruled the Banat, was {{interested}} in developing extractive metallurgy in the province, and began building furnaces for iron ore smelting in Reșița in 1769, those at Bocşa proving inadequate for its industrial needs. The works trace their origins to July 3, 1771, when the first furnaces and forges were inaugurated, making it the oldest industrial factory in present-day Romania. At first, metalworking {{was the focus of}} activity, but machinery manufacturing gradually gained prominence, becoming the main occupation {{in the last quarter of}} the 19th century. For decades, the two complemented each other within the same integrated factory. Until 1855, the works belonged to the Treasury of what had become the Austrian Empire, which exercised control through the Banat Mining Directorate in Oraviţa. By 1815, they were producing cast iron pieces coming directly from the <b>furnaces,</b> <b>rods</b> forged from iron, hoops for cart wheels, tools, nails and utensils for agricultural and home use.|$|R
40|$|Preform is an {{intermediate}} {{product in the}} optical fiber manufacturing process. There are three major processes used in the manufacturing of preform. These are MCVD (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) process, ACVD (Atmospheric Chemical Vapor Deposition) process and VAD (Vapor Axial Deposition) process. In the ACVD process {{it is difficult to}} predict the outer preform diameter as it depends on many in-process parameters like density of soot glass deposited, cross sectional area (CSA) of glass to be deposited on the target core <b>rod,</b> sintering speed, <b>furnace</b> temperature and helium flow in the sinter tube during consolidation process. Diameter of preform must be within the limits according to the set up of drawing furnace. For the uniform sintering environment i. e. at constant sintering temperature, speed and helium flow, density of soot glass {{plays a major role in}} deciding the preform diameter. We report here a linear relationship between density of soot glass, cross sectional area (CSA) of glass to be deposited on the core rod and final preform diameter after sintering process using a multiple regression technique. Total 2825 samples were taken for the study with soot density between 0. 3 to 0. 7 gm/mm 3 and CSA of glass to be deposited on the core rod between 3700 to 6500 mm 2. Data were analyzed using minitab 14 software. It has been found that 80 % variation in the preform diameter can be explained and hence can be controlled using this relationship. The equipments used in this study consist of...|$|R
