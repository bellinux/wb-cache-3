5|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, {{and the promise}} of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade.

In light of the lack of a <b>release</b> <b>of</b> an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original.
