6000|$|Richter says of Luther's words, [...] "His {{words are}} half-battles." [...] They {{may be called}} so. The {{essential}} quality of him was, that he could fight and conquer; {{that he was a}} <b>right</b> <b>piece</b> of human Valor. No more valiant man, no mortal heart to be called braver, that one has record of, ever lived in that Teutonic Kindred, whose character is valor. His defiance of the [...] "Devils" [...] in Worms was not a mere boast, as the like might be if now spoken. It was a faith of Luther's that there were Devils, spiritual denizens of the Pit, continually besetting men. Many times, in his writings, this turns up; and a most small sneer has been grounded on it by some. In the room of the Wartburg where he sat translating the Bible, they still show you a black spot on the wall; the strange memorial of one of these conflicts. Luther sat translating one of the Psalms; he was worn down with long labor, with sickness, abstinence from food: there rose before him some hideous indefinable Image, which he took for the Evil One, to forbid his work: Luther started up, with fiend-defiance; flung his inkstand at the spectre, and it disappeared! The spot still remains there; a curious monument of several things. Any apothecary's apprentice can now tell us what we are to think of this apparition, in a scientific sense: but the man's heart that dare rise defiant, face to face, against Hell itself, can give no higher proof of fearlessness. The thing he will quail before exists not on this Earth or under it.--Fearless enough! [...] "The Devil is aware," [...] writes he on one occasion, [...] "that this does not proceed out of fear in me. I have seen and defied innumerable Devils. Duke George," [...] of Leipzig, a great enemy of his, [...] "Duke George is not equal to one Devil,"--far short of a Devil! [...] "If I had business at Leipzig, I would ride into Leipzig, though it rained Duke Georges for nine days running." [...] What a reservoir of Dukes to ride into--! ...|$|E

60|$|The river-climate, {{with these}} autumnal intervals, {{was made up}} of a quick, eventful springtime, {{followed}} by the calm of a cloudless summer that seemed never to end. But the spring, short as it was, had its great attractions, and chief of these was the freshet which it brought to the river. They would hear somehow that the river was rising, and then the boys, who had never connected its rise with the rains they must have been having, would all go down to its banks and watch the swelling waters. These would be yellow and thick, and the boiling current would have smooth, oily eddies, where pieces of drift would whirl round and round, and then escape and slip down the stream. There were saw-logs and whole trees with their branching tops, lengths of fence and hen-coops and pig-pens; once there was a stable; and if the flood continued, there began to come swollen bodies of horses and cattle. This must have meant serious loss to the people living on the river-bottoms above, but the boys counted it all gain. They cheered the objects as they floated by, and they were breathless with the excitement of seeing the men who caught fence-rails and cord-wood, and even saw-logs, with iron prongs at the points of long poles, as they stood on some jutting point of shore and stretched far out over the flood. The boys exulted in the turbid spread of the stream, which filled its low western banks and stole over their tops, and washed into all the hollow places along its shores, and shone among the trunks of the sycamores on Delorac's Island, which was almost of the geographical importance of The Island in Old River. When the water began to go down their hearts sank with it; and they gave up the hope of seeing the bridge carried away. Once the river rose to within a few feet of it, so that if the <b>right</b> <b>piece</b> of drift had been there to do its duty, the bridge might have been torn from its piers and swept down the raging tide into those unknown gulfs to the southward. Many a time they went to bed full of hope that it would at least happen in the night, and woke to learn with shame and grief in the morning that the bridge was still there, and the river was falling. It was a little comfort to know that some of the big boys had almost seen it go, watching as far into the night as nine o'clock with the men who sat up near the bridge till daylight: men of leisure and public spirit, but not perhaps the leading citizens.|$|E

50|$|The two-piece tiger tallies (hu-fu, 虎符 in Chinese) {{were used}} by a king or emperor to command and {{dispatch}} the army.

50|$|Since {{the initial}} {{discovery}} of the specimen of the valley there have been additional excavations. Multiple artifacts and human skeletal fragments {{have been found in}} the valley. Excavations have found two cranial fragments that seem to fit onto the original Neandertal 1 calotte (bones of the cranial vault). Excavations performed in 1997 and 2000 found new human skeletal pieces. There are questions as to whether these remains are those of Neandertals. Two cranial pieces were unearthed: one, a left zygomatic and partial body and second, a <b>right</b> <b>piece</b> of temporal bone. These pieces appeared to fit the Neandertal 1 calotte perfectly, although these pieces are not specifically from Neandertals. These discoveries {{may or may not be}} attributable to the Neandertals but exhibit similar characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|In prototype-based {{languages}} {{that use}} delegation, the language runtime {{is capable of}} dispatching the correct method or finding the <b>right</b> <b>piece</b> of data simply by following a series of delegation pointers (from object to its prototype) until a match is found. All that is required to establish this behavior-sharing between objects is the delegation pointer. Unlike the relationship between class and instance in class-based object-oriented languages, {{the relationship between the}} prototype and its offshoots does not require that the child object have a memory or structural similarity to the prototype beyond this link. As such, the child object can continue to be modified and amended over time without rearranging the structure of its associated prototype as in class-based systems. It is also important to note that not only data, but also methods can be added or changed. For this reason, some prototype-based languages refer to both data and methods as [...] "slots" [...] or [...] "members".|$|E

Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|R

50|$|Unlike xiangqi, all pieces move identically: a piece {{may move}} only one square up, down, left, or <b>right.</b> A <b>piece</b> may never move onto a square {{that is already}} {{occupied}} unless such a move is a legal capture.|$|R
5000|$|Pieces are {{arranged}} in this section so that, if they promote, the promoted version is to the <b>right.</b> <b>Piece</b> names with a grey background are present {{at the start of}} the game; those with a blue background only appear with promotion.Abbreviations of Kanji names are not official, but for the sake of Layout.Betzas funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation xxxayyyK stands for an xxxK move possibly followed by an yyyK move, not necessarily in the same direction. Larger numbers of legs can be indicated by repeated application of a, or by numbers: thus a3K means a piece that can take up to three steps of a king. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier v ("vertical", interpreted relative to the pieces current position on its path). Similarly, the modifier f ("forward") would restrict it to a single line, and force it to always move away from its initial position. The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other possibilities are specified explicitly. Thus mKa3K means a piece that takes up to three steps of a king, but must stop when it first captures. Another extension is that inequalities can be used in place of numbers denoting range: thus, while R4 is a piece that moves like a rook, but only up to four squares, R(2≤n≤4) is a piece that moves like a rook, but only two, three, or four squares. R4! would be a rook that moves exactly four squares, and hence a3!K would be a piece that can take no more or no less than three steps of a king. Further, pn refers to cannon-like pieces that can jump at most n pieces along their path, and pp means the same as p∞ (just as WW is synonymous with W∞, both meaning a rook). Finally, x stands for [...] "shooting": the xK for instance can pass its turn (shooting empty squares), or it can shoot (capture) any adjacent enemy piece without moving.|$|E
