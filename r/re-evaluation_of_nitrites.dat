40|$|Nitrite {{has long}} been {{considered}} to be an inert oxidative metabolite of nitric oxide (NO). Recent work, however, has demonstrated that nitrite represents an important tissue storage form of NO that can be reduced to NO during ischaemic or hypoxic events. This exciting series of discoveries has created an entirely new field of research that involves the investigation of the molecular, biochemical, and physiological activities <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> under a variety of physiological and pathophysiological states. This has also led to a <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the role that nitrite plays in health and disease. As a result there has been an interest in the use <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Nitrite therapy has now been studied in several animal models and has proven to be an effective means to reduce myocardial ischaemia–reperfusion injury. This review article will provide a brief summary of the key findings that have led to the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> and highlight the evidence supporting the cardioprotective actions <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> and also highlight the potential clinical application <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> therapy to cardiovascular diseases...|$|R

40|$|Because {{one of the}} {{alternative}} processes for production of natural or organic cured meat products utilizes a slow release <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> from nitrate to achieve the cure, the reaction rates <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> with myoglobin and cysteine in a model system were assessed {{to determine if the}} rate <b>of</b> addition <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> has potential to alter the end products produced by curing. This is potentially important for natural and organic cured meats because the end products <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> reactions determine cured meat properties including color and antimicrobial protection. Results of this study showed that myoglobin is preferentially nitrosylated by nitrite before cysteine. Once maximum nitrosylation of myoglobin was achieved, then nitrite reacted with cysteine as well. These results suggest that the amount <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> produced may affect end products of meat curing based on the substrates used in this study, but the rate <b>of</b> addition <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> is not important. Thus, for natural and organic curing achieved by the alternate process involving nitrate, it may be more important to increase the amount <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> produced from nitrate rather than increasing the rate <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> production. However, additional studies with other substrates involved with nitrite in meat curing should be conducted...|$|R

40|$|The {{vertical}} and seasonal distribution <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> {{concentration in the}} north basin of Lake Biwa was investigated through the year. The concentrations <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> in the epilimnion were {{higher than in the}} hypolimnion during the stagnation periods. The characteristic peak <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> concentration was observed in the base of the euphotic layer during July to September. The highest concentration <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> was observed at 15 m depth in September,showing 0. 82 mug-at. N・ 1 - 1. The present observations indicate that the nitrite maximum layer mainly occurred through the oxidative production <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> from ammonia by nitrifying bacteria. On the other hand,the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> in the euphotic layer seemed to be produced by reduction through nitrate utilization by phytoplankton. 琵琶湖北湖において，亜硝酸イオンの鉛直・季節変化を観測した。停滞期の表層水中における亜硝酸現存量は，深水層に比較して高い値が測定された。 6 月から 9 月にかけて，亜硝酸現存量の鉛直分布に特徴あるピークが生産層下部に観察された。この亜硝酸極大層は， 9 月には水深 15 mで 0 ． 82 mug－at．N・ 1 ＾－ 1 に達した。本研究で観測された亜硝酸極大層は，アンモニアと亜硝酸現存量の鉛直分布の季節変化から，主に硝化細菌の働きによるアンモニアの酸化に伴って生産されたものであると考えることができる。一方，停滞期の生産層において観測された亜硝酸現存量の蓄積は，植物プランクトンの窒素源としての硝酸態窒素の同化に伴って排出・供給されたものと考えられる...|$|R
40|$|Demand {{is growing}} for meat {{products}} cured without the addition <b>of</b> sodium <b>nitrite.</b> Instead <b>of</b> the direct addition <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> to meat in formulation, nitrite is supplied by bacterial reduction of natural nitrate often added as vegetable juice/powder.

40|$|Nitrite {{has emerged}} as an {{endogenous}} signaling molecule with potential therapeutic implications for cardiovascular disease. Steady-state levels <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> are derived in part from dietary sources; therefore, we investigated the effects <b>of</b> dietary <b>nitrite</b> and nitrate supplementation and deficiency on NO homeostasis and on the severity of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury. Mice fed a standard diet with supplementation <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> (50 mg/liter) in their drinking water for 7 days exhibited significantly higher plasma levels <b>of</b> <b>nitrite,</b> exhibited significantly higher myocardial levels <b>of</b> <b>nitrite,</b> nitroso, and nitrosyl–heme, and displayed a 48 % reduction in infarct size (Inf) after MI/R. Supplemental nitrate (1 g/liter) in the drinking water for 7 days also increased blood and tissue NO products and significantly reduced Inf. A time course of ischemia-reperfusion revealed that nitrite was consumed during the ischemic phase, {{with an increase in}} nitroso/nitrosyl products in the heart. Mice fed a diet deficient in nitrite and nitrate for 7 days exhibited significantly diminished plasma and heart levels <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> and NO metabolites and a 59 % increase in Inf after MI/R. Supplementation <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> in the drinking water for 7 days reversed the effects <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> deficiency. These data demonstrate the significant influence <b>of</b> dietary <b>nitrite</b> and nitrate intake on the maintenance of steady-state tissue nitrite/nitroso levels and illustrate the consequences <b>of</b> <b>nitrite</b> deficiency on the pathophysiology of MI/R injury.
