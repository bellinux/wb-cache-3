25|$|In November 1922, Kellogg {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Indian Welfare League in Albany, in which Assemblyman Everett was chastised by both Indian and non-Indian reformers for his report, including his actions which allegedly stirred up false hope among Indians about the land claims issue. In a column of the Knickerbocker Press, Kellogg reacted to the meeting by defending Everett. She added that the <b>real</b> <b>question</b> was not the workings of the Everett Commission, but the legal status of the Six Nations according to Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1784 granting the Iroquois Confederacy independence. Less than a week later, Kellogg sent Everett a letter endorsing his report, condemning the Indian Welfare League, and making an offer to retain his legal services for in future litigation.|$|E
25|$|Victim's {{contribution}} R v Dear (1996) CLR 595. Believing {{that the}} victim had sexually interfered with his 12-year-old daughter, the defendant attacked the victim with a Stanley knife. The defendant argued that the chain of causation had been broken because, two days later, the victim had committed suicide either by reopening his wounds or because {{he had failed to}} take steps to staunch the blood flow after the wounds had reopened spontaneously (i.e. the potential suicide constituted a novus actus interveniens). It was held that the <b>real</b> <b>question</b> was whether the injuries inflicted by the defendant were an operating and significant cause of or contribution to the death. Distinctions between the victim's mere self-neglect (no break in the chain) and the victim's gross self-neglect (break in the chain) were not helpful. The victim's death resulted from bleeding from the artery severed by the defendant. Whether the resumption or continuation of that bleeding was deliberately caused by the victim, the defendant's conduct remained the operative and significant cause of the victim's death.|$|E
25|$|Harris was {{replaced}} by Howard S. McDonald, who had received a doctorate from the University of California. McDonald was used to an organization which placed the president {{at the head of}} decision-making, rather than a Board of Trustees. Because of this, {{he had a lot of}} trouble working with the Board, who at BYU had more power than he was accustomed to. However, he achieved several valuable things in his four-year tenure. When he first received the position, the Second World War had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, and rebuilt it to house some of the students. McDonald also did several other things. When asked by church leaders whether support for the college be dropped, he answered an adamant no, putting an end to the last <b>real</b> <b>question</b> of the school's survival. He also began a significant building program which was continued by his successors. McDonald resigned in 1949 in order to work at a Los Angeles College fitting his administrative style better.|$|E

[...] Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five [...] "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: [...] "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the future}} of the symphony genre was coming into doubt. Musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, [...] "Even symphonies by [...] {{well-known}} composers of the early 19th century as Méhul, Rossini, Cherubini, Hérold, Czerny, Clementi, Weber and Moscheles were perceived in their own time as standing in the symphonic shadow of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, or some combination of the three." [...] While many composers continued to write symphonies during the 1820s and 30s, [...] "there was a growing sense that these works were aesthetically far inferior to Beethoven's.... The <b>real</b> <b>question</b> was not so much whether symphonies could still be written, but whether the genre could continue to flourish and grow as it had over the previous half-century in the hands of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. On this count, there were varying degrees of skepticism but virtually no real optimism." ...|$|E

He was the second {{to respond to a}} question originally posed to Senator Hillary Clinton on whether Senator Harry Reid's assessment that the war in Iraq was [...] "lost" [...] is factual. Biden responded by stating the war is not a [...] "game show" [...] or a [...] "football game", which can be lost. He went on to argue that the <b>real</b> <b>question</b> that should be asked is, [...] "Are we {{going to be able to}} leave Iraq... and leave behind something other than chaos?"

[...] The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; the <b>real</b> <b>question</b> was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it. [...] After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides? [...] The answer came in December, when the bill passed third reading by a vote of twenty-five votes to fourteen. [...] Nine Liberals had reversed themselves and saved Sifton's government, though both Cross and Rutherford were among those to vote against it.|$|E
500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic {{selected}} the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, noting that it has [...] "a wide theatrical scope akin to that of The-Dream's own 'Nikki, Pt. 2/Abyss.'" [...] He further analysed: [...] "Over a swelling and receding production with echoes of Kim Carnes' 'Bette Davis Eyes,' Rihanna mourns ("Felt like love struck me in the night/I pray that love don't strike twice"), then confesses ("Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change"), then surrenders ("I'm prepared to die in the moment"). Perhaps no one should read anything into it." [...] Christina Lee of Idolator observed that the song [...] "casts out the album’s most heartbreaking line — 'I’m prepared to die at the moment' — but puts it in a context that doesn’t explain enough." [...] Esquires Miles Raymer thought that Police would have been a better band if they would have had Rihanna as their lead singer instead of Sting; however, he described [...] "Mother Mary" [...] as something to skip. Alike Raymer, Bernard Perusse for The Montreal Gazette felt that only [...] "Love Without Tragedy" [...] was worth listening to and described it as demonstrating [...] "a tiny bit of hope" [...] on the album. In a review of the album, Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "Rihanna sings a grim rhetorical: [...] "What's love without tragedy?" [...] However, according to her the <b>real</b> <b>question</b> that she and her songwriters is presenting on the record is [...] "Who is Rihanna without Chris Brown?" [...] "Nathan Slavick for DJ Booth was critical of the tracks theme, writing that [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary", along with [...] "Stay" [...] and [...] "No Love Allowed", all discuss the topic of Rihanna being a non-controversial person who is struggling to find love in a [...] "mad world". He further wrote that none of them are impressive." ...|$|E

Results were analyzed with statistical tools, showing higher performance in some questions with abridged information (reverse induced performance). Qualitative tools were used to explain this awkward phenomenon. Conclusions show that students' performance may rely more heavily on perception of subtleties in questions' alternatives, reading skills and time management ability than on previous knowledge and mental skills...|$|R

2500|$|Alvin Plantinga {{presents}} {{an argument for}} the existence of God using modal logic. Others have said that the logical and philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God miss the point. The word God has a meaning in human culture and history that does not correspond to the beings whose existence is supported by such arguments, assuming they are valid. The <b>real</b> <b>question</b> is not whether a [...] "most perfect being" [...] or an [...] "uncaused first cause" [...] exist. The <b>real</b> <b>question</b> is whether Jehovah, Zeus, Ra, Krishna, or any gods of any religion exist, and if so, which gods? On the other hand, many theists equate all monotheistic or henotheistic [...] "most perfect Beings", no matter what name is assigned to them/him, as the one monotheistic God (one example would be understanding the Muslim Allah, Christian Yhwh, and Chinese Shangdi as different names for the same Being). Most of these arguments do not resolve the issue of which of these figures is more likely to exist. These arguments fail to make the distinction between immanent gods and a Transcendent God.|$|E
