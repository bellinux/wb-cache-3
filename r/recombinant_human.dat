40|$|Objectives. Superoxide dismutase, {{acting as}} a {{scavenger}} of oxygen free radicals, has shown mixed results in increasing survival from burn wounds. We previously demonstrated that <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> copper-zinc superoxide dismutase could increase the survival of failing ischaemic flaps in a rat model. Because of the similar pathophysiology of tissue ischaemia in flaps and intermediate zone burns, we conducted a later study employing two groups of rats with standardized intermediate burns, to ascertain whether or not <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> copper-zinc superoxide dismutase could increase intermediate burn zone survival in rats. The results showed that post-burn <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> copper-zinc superoxide dismutase failed to improve intermediate burn zone survival. We decided to undertake a new study to ascertain {{whether there was a}} protective effect of <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in intermediate burns. Methods. This controlled study employed two groups of rats, one of which received prophylactic treatment with <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> copper-zinc superoxide dismutase before the induction of standardized intermediate burns. Results. The results showed that pre-burn <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> copper-zinc superoxide dismutase also failed to improve intermediate burn zone survival. Conclusions. Further studies are needed to fully understand the effect of oxygen free radicals in burn wound pathophysiology and to determine whether <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> copper-zinc superoxide dismutase has a place in the clinical management of burns...|$|R

40|$|To {{probe the}} steric {{requirements}} for deacylation, we synthesized lysine-derived small molecule substrates and examined structure-reactivity relationships with various histone deacetylases.

2500|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of animal insulins in different mammals may be similar to human insulin (insulin human INN), there is however considerable viability within vertebrate species. Porcine insulin has only a single amino acid variation from the human variety, and bovine insulin varies by three amino acids. Both are active on the human receptor with approximately the same strength. Bovine insulin and porcine insulin may be considered as the first clinically used insulin analogs (naturally occurring, produced by extraction from animal pancreas), {{at the time when}} biosynthetic human insulin (insulin human rDNA) was not available. There are extensive reviews on structure-relationship of naturally occurring insulins (phylogenic relationship in animals) and structural modifications. Prior to the introduction of biosynthetic human insulin, insulin derived from sharks was widely used in Japan. [...] Insulin from some species of fish may be also effective in humans. [...] Non-human insulins have caused allergic reactions in some patients related to the extent of purification, formation of non-neutralising antibodies is rarely observed with <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> insulin (insulin human rDNA) but allergy may occur in some patients.

40|$|The {{development}} of reliable assay systems that can measure lymphocyte activation in vitro {{has been a}} major goal of immunodiagnostics. Traditionally, tritiated thymidine incorporation has been used to monitor T-cell activation.

We have established a lymphocyte activation assay that utilizes fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -streptavidin bound to <b>recombinant</b> biotinylated <b>human</b> interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). Utilizing recombinant DNA technology, a unique monobiotinylated human IL- 2 has been created and isolated using the Promega PinPoint vector system.
