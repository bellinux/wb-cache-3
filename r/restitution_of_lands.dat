Gaelic poets in Ireland lauded James as the first [...] "Irish" [...] king of the Three Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, because of his family's Gaelic ancestry. James and his successors were also viewed as being less hostile to Catholicism than the Tudors. In the Wars of the Three Kingdoms of the 1640s, Catholics organised in Confederate Ireland pledged allegiance to Charles I and Charles II against the English Parliament. As a result, most Catholic landowners had their lands confiscated after Parliament's victory and the Catholic Church suffered harsh repression. James II, the first openly Catholic king of England in over a century, was therefore viewed as a saviour by Irish Catholics. James appointed an Irish Catholic, Tyrconnell, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, re-admitted Catholics into the army and militia and introduced toleration for the Catholic religion. During the Williamite war in Ireland, he also reluctantly agreed to proclaim the autonomy of the Irish Parliament from the English one and the <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>lands</b> confiscated from Catholics after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The demands of religious toleration, legislative autonomy and land ownership were the three key elements of Irish Jacobitism, which remained influential until the mid eighteenth century.|$|E

40|$|Restitution {{has to be}} made in {{a highly}} {{political}} environment, making the planning and design of restitution programmes in rural, peri-urban and urban areas extremely complex. The development of governance structures for restitution programmes is influenced by policy instruments that have to consider taxation effects and their impact on economic behaviour, as well as predict outcomes that transcend the objective functions. The complexity is exacerbated by limited scientific evidence and the absence of evidence-based policy-making, culminating in policy neglect and inadequate service delivery outcomes for land reform and restitution. The article explores progress made with the implementation of the Nkumbuleni Land Claim (Kwa-Zulu Natal) and examines what prevents the restitution support programme from implementing its policy objectives (guided by the <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lands</b> Rights Act, Act 22 of 1994). The authors conclude that the attainment of sustainable outcomes in post-settlement restitution support continues to be a challenge to policy-makers, as claims remain unsustainable. Poor communication between stakeholders, the narrow role municipalities play in restitution and conflicting governance structures between “traditional councils versus municipal councils” are seen as the main drivers of programme failure...|$|E

30|$|Around 1900, Montenegro mainly {{consisted}} of bare land (Kranjc 2008), as only about 35  % of its landscape was densely vegetated. The coastal and central zones were especially barren (for {{about half of}} their area), while not even one tenth of the northern zone was barren wasteland, as it had more forests, meadows (respectively almost 30 and 40  %) and farmland (as opposed to small poljes and dry fields in the other areas). During the twentieth century, especially between 1950 and 1980, the Montenegrin landscape showed an overall increase in vegetation. The share of barren lands in the coastal and central zones strongly decreased in favor of shrubland and forests, while there was less vegetation growth in the northern zone, where forests grew {{at the expense of}} farmland, which halved at least (Nyssen et al. 2014). This evolution runs parallel with large sectorial shifts in employment, as the Montenegrins working in agriculture (about 75  % in 1948) fell back to 5  % in 1981 (Radović 1981). <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>lands</b> to owners has also been playing a role in the decline of agriculture {{since the end of the}} 1980 s (Mugoša 2008). However, due to the economic crisis in the 1990 s, some marginal lands have been temporarily cultivated again (Grimes et al. 2005). Since 2000, areas occupied by infrastructure—often related to tourism—have rapidly increased in all Montenegrin regions (Nyssen et al. 2014) and regrowth of vegetation has accelerated. In 2008, dense forests covered 45  % of the country and another 9  % was under other woody vegetation types (including bushes, brushwood, maquis and stone steppes). By 2012, this had increased to respectively about 60 and 10  %, making Montenegro one of the most forested countries in Europe (Andelić et al. 2012).|$|E

Through reflecting upon my own inability to appropriately incorporate anthropological perspectives within the Ndabeni Land Restitution process, I was able to identify two constraints within the institutional context of the Commission on <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> Rights (Western and Northern Cape) which served to paralyse these perspectives.

50|$|There {{have been}} a number of cases that have come before the Constitutional Court {{requiring}} it to interpret and apply the rights and principles in the Constitution pertaining to ACL. In doing so, the CC has not only been faced with the challenge of elucidating the extent to which ACL is now recognised, but it has also had to address the issue of how to go about ascertaining what that law in fact is. The first such substantive case is Alexkor Ltd and Another v the Richtersveld Community and Others, which involved the appeal of a claim for <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by the Richtersveld Community ('the Community'), an indigenous South African community, in terms <b>of</b> the <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> Rights Act. The Constitutional Court therefore had to examine whether or not the Community had rights in land in 1913 and, if so, whether or not it was subsequently dispossessed 'as a result of past racially discriminatory laws or practices.' It was in answering the first of these questions that the Court made various authoritative comments regarding the extent to which ACL is now recognised.|$|R
40|$|Land {{reform in}} South Africa and the {{realisation}} {{of the section}} 25 property clause of the Constitution of South Africa, 1996 (hereafter the Constitution) {{is seen as an}} integral step in the democratisation process {{as well as in the}} social and economic empowerment of previously marginalised groups. For many, the true test for political transformation will be whether land needs (including protection of and care for the environment) are addressed effectively and in a sustainable manner. In recent years, however, government’s addressing <b>of</b> <b>land</b> needs has become a highly controversial issue, especially where land that vests in private owners is claimed back because of its status as ancestral land. Land reform may strongly impact on the environment and sustainable development as protected in section 24 of the Constitution since it involves vast hectares <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> other environmental media and people. <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> processes in terms of section 25 (7), as one of the components <b>of</b> <b>land</b> reform, often does not take key provisions contained in environmental and planning law into account. In many instances, for example, government’s restitution projects do not make sufficient provision for harmonisation with environmental principles contained in environmental law and no or limited systems exist whereby to inform and assist land restitution beneficiaries on compliance with environmental and planning law obligations in post settlement development endeavours. These limitations could, inter alia, be linked with the fragmentation of the environmental governance regime and a lack of role clarification. It may furthermore result in significant conflict between sections 24 and 25 (7) of the Constitution as overarching framework legislation, and between developmental objectives contained in sectoral-specific subordinate legislation. The <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> is, amongst other policies, regulated by section 25 (7) of the Constitution and the <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> Rights Act 22 of 1994 whilst section 24 of the Constitution and the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 aim at protection of the environment, the prevention of pollution, the promotion of conservation, and secured ecologically sustainable development. The conditions following land restitution settlement, including the current state of the environment on land that has been restituted, provide an interesting and factual source of reference for critical analysis of environmental policy implementation in land restitution processes and post-settlement endeavours. It further allows for a critical view on the effective or futile realisation of sustainable development in national and provincial governments’ efforts to finalise claim-driven <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> In order to limit the scope <b>of</b> this article, <b>land</b> <b>restitution</b> policy, progress with the national land restitution programme and some post-settlement accounts will be critically analysed and assessed in the light of obligations and initiatives for environmental governance derived from the legal framework concerned.

40|$|Act no 22 of 1994 promulgated a {{critically}} important legislation allowing for <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> rights in <b>land</b> to persons or communities dispossessed of such rights after 19 June 1913 {{as a result}} of past racially discriminatory laws or practices. The <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> Rights Act as it was titled was firm about the conditions which entitled claimants to lodge a claim and in return, be compensated financially or be offered compensatory State owned land. Whilst these clauses have long been amended, what is evident is that the original legislation and its subsequent versions have missed critical issues in legislating for assessing valid dispossession. Further, {{the manner in which the}} Land Claims Court currently addresses the issues of these claims increasingly allows for restitution beyond the original dispossession, effectively minimising the value of historical reports.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{theoretical}} {{interpretation of the}} dispositions on land restitution contained in the famous “Victims’ Bill”, which was debated in the Colombian Congress during the year 2008. The bill included specific mechanisms aimed at guaranteeing the <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> to victims <b>of</b> the Colombian armed conflict. At the time, the bill was endorsed by all the main political actors in the country –notably {{the government and the}} elites that support it, on the one hand, and victims’ and human rights organizations and other opposition groups, on the other–. The fact that the <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> to victims <b>of</b> the Colombian armed conflict was being considered as a serious possibility by all political actors in the country seemed to indicate the existence of a consensus among actors whose positions are ordinarily opposed, on an issue that has traditionally led to high levels of polarization. This consensus is quite puzzling, because it seems to be at odds with the interests and/or the conceptions of justice advocated by these political actors, and because the <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> faces enormous difficulties both from a factual and a normative point of view, which indicates that it may not necessarily be the best alternative for dealing with the issue <b>of</b> <b>land</b> distribution in Colombia. This article offers an interpretation of said consensus, arguing that it is only an apparent consensus in which the actors are actually misrepresenting their interests and conceptions of justice, {{while at the same time}} adopting divergent strategies of implementation aimed at fulfilling their true interests. Nevertheless, the article concludes that the common adherence by all actors to the principle of restorative justice might bring about its actual realization, and thus produce an outcome that, in spite (and perhaps even because) of being unintended, might substantively contribute to solving the problem <b>of</b> unequal <b>land</b> distribution in Colombia. Even though the article focuses in some detail on the specificities of the 2008 Bill, it attempts to make a general argument about the state of the discussion on how to deal with the issue <b>of</b> <b>land</b> distribution in the country. Consequently, it may still be relevant today, especially considering that a new Bill on land restitution is currently being discussed in Congress, which includes the same restitution goals as the Victims’ Bill and many of its procedural and substantive details, and which therefore seems to reflect a similar consensus to the one analyzed in the article...|$|R
