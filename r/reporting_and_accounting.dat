500|$|As Bradbury had promised, with {{research}} and development, nuclear weapons became smaller, simpler and lighter. They also became easier to store, assemble, test and maintain. Thus, while under Eisenhower's New Look policy the Armed Forces became more heavily involved with aspects {{of nuclear weapons}} than ever, {{the role of the}} AFSWP diminished. It began moving away from training assembly teams, which were increasingly not required, as its primary mission, and became more involved in the management of the rapidly growing nuclear stockpile, and providing technical advice and logistical support. In 1953, the AFSWP Field Command had 10,250 personnel. On 16 October 1953, the Secretary of Defense charged the AFSWP with responsibility for [...] "a centralized system of <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>accounting</b> to ensure that the current status and location" [...] of all nuclear weapons [...] "will be known at all times". The Atomic Warfare Status Center was created within the AFSWP to handle this mission.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the primary}} causes of the Panic of 1826 was {{the rise in the}} number of {{incorporations}} in New York during the 1820s. From having only one bank and no insurance corporations in 1791, by 1830, there were over 150 financial companies and 1000 businesses. With this rise in number of incorporations, there were no statutes to protect stockholders and creditors as financial <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>accounting</b> standards did not exist. This spike in financial incorporations, specifically during the period from early 1824 to mid-1825, led to a 60% increase in market value of the New York Stock Exchange from 1824-1825. The rise of these new financial companies and how they were managed led to the eventual failure of these new firms.|$|E
