40|$|The {{release of}} sodium from low rank coal during {{combustion}} {{is known to}} be an important factor in the phenomena of fouling and corrosion in industrial boilers. Although much is known about the gas phase chemistry of sodium compounds, and the likely sequence of events that lead to fouling and corrosion, very little fundamental work has been undertaken on the release of sodium from the coal particle as it is combusted. The principal objective {{of this study was to}} perform detailed quantitative measurements and mathematical modelling of sodium release during combustion of single <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> particles. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) was applied for the in-situ measurement of the atomic sodium concentration field in the plume of single Loy Yang <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> particles. Laser absorption measurements at the sodium D 1 line (589. 59 nm) were utilised to calibrate PLIF measurements of atomic sodium in a purpose designed flat flame environment. Detailed measurements of atomic sodium in the plume of single combusting <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> particles of varying amounts and forms of sodium and of varying particle sizes were then undertaken. A <b>run-of-mine</b> Loy Yang <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> sample and two samples that were processed using Mechanical/Thermal Expression (MTE), which removed a fraction of the inherent moisture and concomitant dissolved salts, were investigated. An experiment was also performed to simultaneously measure the particle temperature, particle size, and the atomic sodium concentration in the plume of a single burning Loy Yang <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> particle. From the experimental results, the proportions of sodium released during the stages of coal devolatilisation, char combustion and from the remaining ash after combustion were determined for the three coals used at various particle sizes. The relative differences between the sodium release behaviour of water-bound and organically bound sodium were also inferred. During char combustion, the release of sodium was determined to be dependent on both the particle temperature and particle size. In order to decouple these parameters and determine the true controlling parameter(s) for sodium release, a model was established for the release of sodium, the char burnout behaviour of the particles, and the particle surface temperature. By combining the modelling with further analysis of the experimental data, the temperature dependent kinetics of sodium release during <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> char combustion were established. A full mechanism was also proposed for sodium release during the various stages of coal combustion, which suggested that the rate determining step for sodium release during char combustion is the formation of a reduced form of sodium in the char, which subsequently leads to the rapid loss of sodium from the particle. The results of this study advance the knowledge of the release of sodium from <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> combustion. Two major contributions are the development of a methodology that enables the direct in-situ measurements of the concentration of atomic sodium in the plume of individual burning coal particles, and the establishment of the kinetics and mechanism for the release of sodium during Loy Yang <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> combustion. These results provide, for the first time, essential data for the development of sodium release sub-models within large scale <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> boiler Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models. Such models will help in the development of improved measures to mitigate fouling and corrosion problems in <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> fired combustion and gasification systems. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|A major {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> as a carrier material, however, is its high moisture content (typically 60 – 70  % for <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> mined in Victoria, Australia). This makes transportation of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> prohibitively expensive and thus makes drying of the coal an essential process. Dried <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> is prone to crumble into a fine dust when handled, increasing its propensity to undergo spontaneous combustion. This introduces further difficulties for handling and storage. Dried <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> granules of suitable strength and resistance to attrition may be a viable solution to these issues.

30|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>coal,</b> {{also known}} as lignite, is an {{alternative}} material with properties that make it appealing {{for use as a}} N fertiliser carrier. Previous work found that <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> incorporation into soil slightly reduced ammonium availability in one soil, but the study did not look at mineral N leaching or nitrous oxide emissions [13]. One reason that <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> may differ in their N retention behaviour compared with biochars that unlike most biochars, <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> are generally acidic rather than alkaline. Furthermore, whereas most biochars are of limited availability and relatively high cost of $ 500 – 3000 per tonne [14, 15], <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> is readily available in many countries at lower cost, for example, approximately $ 50 per tonne in Australia.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rising}} cost of energy and fuel oils, clean coal {{technologies}} will continue {{to play an important role}} during the transition to a clean energy future. Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> have high oxygen and moisture contents and hence low calorific value. This paper presents an alternative non evaporative drying technology for high moisture <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> based on osmotic dewatering. This involves contacting and mixing <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> with anionic super absorbent polymers (SAP) which are highly crossed linked synthetic co-polymers based on a cross-linked copolymer of acryl amide and potassium acrylate.

The amount of water present in Loy Yang coal was reduced by approximately 57 % during four hours of SAP contact. The extent of SAP <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> drying is directly proportional to the SAP/coal weight ratio.

40|$|The {{release of}} {{volatile}} sodium during coal combustian {{is a significant}} factor in the fouling and corrosion of heat transfer surfaces within industrial coal-fired boilers. In this paper, new measurements of sodium release from combusing South Australian <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> particles are reported for the first time using a previously established method (van Eyk et al. 2008). By applying a chemical equilibrium model, at an appropriate location in the flame, the total sodium release is estimated from the measured atomic sodium concentration profile. In comparison to Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals,</b> these South Australian <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> release sodium more rapidly and in larger absolute quantities. Using the data collected in this study, combined with previously collected data for Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals,</b> it is inferred that approximately 53 % of water-bound sodium and approximately 100 % of the organically-bound sodium is released following devolatilisation for both South Australian and Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals.</b> Further work is necessary to determine whether the mechanism and kinetics of sodium release that have previously been forumlated based on Victorian coals are applicable for thes South Australian <b>brown</b> <b>coals.</b> Philip J. van Eyk, Peter J.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the detailed mechanisms for <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> oxidation at high temperatures, a ReaxFF reactive forcefield {{was used to}} perform a series of molecular dynamics simulations from 1000 ?K to 2500 ?K. Analyses indicated that the chemical system {{tend to be more}} reactive with increasing temperature. It was found that the oxidation process of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> primarily initiates from hydrogen abstraction reactions by O 2 and related oxygenated radicals from phenolic hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, especially carboxyl groups in lower temperature to form peroxygen species, or by either thermal decomposition of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> backbone in higher temperature. These peroxygen species usually could chemically adsorb on the C-centered radicals of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> backbone. The weak OO bond in peroxygen makes them easier to break into oxygenated radical, which could also chemically adsorb on the C-centred radical to form hydroxyl group and other oxygenated compounds. In the oxidation process of <b>brown</b> <b>coal,</b> the decomposition and oxidation of aliphatic chain is easier than aromatic ring.
