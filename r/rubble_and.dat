5|$|The Levels {{contain the}} best-preserved prehistoric {{village in the}} UK, Glastonbury Lake Village, {{as well as two}} others at Meare Lake Village. Discovered in 1892 by Arthur Bulleid, it was {{inhabited}} by about 200people living in 14roundhouses, and was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> clay.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{railways}} in the 19thcentury, the area became a tourist attraction. The Duchy of Lancaster undertook maintenance in the 19thcentury to ensure the castle's condition did not deteriorate further, mostly by clearing <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> adding mortar. Sir Walter Scott's 1823 novel Peveril of the Peak, set in the mid 17th century, described the castle ruins.|$|E

40|$|The {{destructive}} {{impact of}} land degradation {{on social and}} economic endeavours {{of the residents of}} certain urban areas of Abeokuta communities in Ogun State, Nigeria calls for remedial actions to restoring the affected land areas. This becomes essential in order to ensure safe inhabitation and enhanced socioeconomic engagements of the residents. Taken remedial actions in this regard included the use of sandbags, debris <b>and</b> wood logs, <b>rubbles</b> <b>and</b> stones, construction of contours and drainages. While each of these actions, in one way or the other, effectively improves the degraded land, it was concluded that the use of <b>rubbles</b> <b>and</b> stones, and drainage construction were sustainably durable for land restoration on the premise that these actions does not allow for water logging or flooding in of the study area. It was however recommended that these sustainable remedial actions should rather be pro-actively taken for prevention of land degradation than being taken as degraded land restoration actions basically because it is much cheaper to prevent environmental degradation than to have the degraded land restored...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} fourth {{millennium}} BC the track was built between an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick {{close to the}} River Brue. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of prehistoric lake dwellings, which were {{likely to have been}} similar to those found in the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village near Godney, itself built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, <b>rubble,</b> <b>and</b> clay.|$|E
5|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is one of}} key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, {{and the absence of}} law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.|$|E
5|$|The site can be visited, {{although}} little restoration {{work has}} been done to it. Various temple pyramids, the remains of palaces (mostly reduced to mounds of <b>rubble)</b> <b>and</b> a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame {{can be seen in the}} site core. In the Greater Q'umarkaj area there were four ballcourts, one in each of the four major political divisions of the city, testifying to the central role of the ballgame ritual in the sociopolitical organisation of the city.|$|E

50|$|Rockula and Frankenstone {{eventually}} {{discover the}} Flintstones <b>and</b> <b>Rubbles,</b> <b>and</b> Rockula mistakes Wilma for his long-lost bride and vows {{to make her}} his, {{even if it means}} killing Fred. On a comedic note, Wilma mistakes Rockula for the hotel manager, Mr. Silika, who had dressed up as Rockula, for quite some time until Rockula turns into a bat in front of her. A long cat-and-mouse chase ensues all over the castle, and eventually the Flintstones <b>and</b> <b>Rubbles</b> are cornered inside the Rubbles' room. Fred challenges Rockula to a fight, using a bat statuette as a weapon, but the statuette turns out to actually be the switch for the trapdoor to Rockula's laboratory, which Rockula and Frankenstone were unknowingly standing on. As Fred raises the statuette to strike, both Rockula and Frankenstone fall through the trapdoor, and the Flintstones <b>and</b> <b>Rubbles</b> escape <b>and</b> return to Bedrock. Wilma invites Betty and Barney to stay for dinner and leaves the three of them in the living room while she goes into the kitchen to cook.|$|R

5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, a deity of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage. Like the other structures of Q'umarkaj, all the stone facing has been robbed, leaving only a <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> mud core. This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{the castle}} {{structures}} were mostly covered with <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> debris, interwoven with pathways {{created by the}} movement of visitors over the years. During the Second World War, the castle {{was used by the}} British Army, possibly as an early warning site fitted with anti-aircraft searchlights. In an area just {{to the north of the}} castle, the Starfish and Naval decoy sites were created to distract incoming German bombers from the town of Rye itself. Trenches were dug in the north bastion, and military training may have been conducted around the outskirts of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)). Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of much interest to the hungry people sifting through {{the tens of thousands of}} tons of <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to the workmen clearing away the rubble later during the rebuilding.|$|E

5|$|The {{village was}} built in about 300 BC and {{occupied}} into the early Roman period (around 100AD) when it was abandoned, possibly due to {{a rise in the}} water level. It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> clay. The village housed around 100 people in five to seven groups of houses, each for an extended family, with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade. At its maximum it may have had 15 houses with a population of up to 200 people.|$|E
5|$|To block Bruges, Keyes and Lynes {{decided to}} conduct two raids on the ports through which Bruges {{had access to}} the sea. Zeebrugge was to be {{attacked}} by a large force consisting of three blockships and numerous supporting warships. Ostend was faced by a similar but smaller force under immediate command of Lynes. The plan was for two obsolete cruisers— and —to be expended in blocking the canal which emptied at Ostend. These ships would be stripped to essential fittings and their lower holds and ballast filled with <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> concrete. This would make them ideal barriers to access if sunk in the correct channel at the correct angle.|$|E
5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory {{was not simply a}} matter of winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money in one of two outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, riots {{broke out}} {{following}} {{the election of}} Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying part of Chinatown and displacing more than 1,000 Chinese residents; the large Pacific Casino Hotel was also totally gutted. The commercial heart of Honiara was virtually reduced to <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> ashes. Three National Parliament members, Charles Dausabea, Nelson Ne'e, and Patrick Vahoe, were arrested during or {{as a result of}} the riots. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending in additional police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A vote of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with Manasseh Sogavare as Prime Minister, quelling the riots and running the government. The army part of RAMSI was removed and rebuilding took shape.|$|E
5|$|Roadways, wooden bridges, postal {{stations}}, and relay {{stations were}} occasionally repaired, while many new facilities {{such as these}} were established. As written by Han authors, roads built during the Han were tamped down with metal rammers, yet there is uncertainty over the materials used; Joseph Needham speculates that they were <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> gravel. The widths of roads ranged from narrow footpaths where only a single horse or oxen could pass at once to large highways that could accommodate the simultaneous passage of nine horse-drawn chariots abreast. Fortified Han roadways were built as far west as Shanshan (Loulan) near the Lop Desert, while Han forces utilized routes that traversed north of the Taklamakan Desert towards Kashgar. A vast network of roads, fortified passes, and wooden bridges built over rushing torrents in steep gorges of the Qin Mountains was consolidated during the Han, known as the gallery roads. During the reign of Emperor Wu, roads were built to connect newly conquered territories {{in what is now}} Yunnan in the far southwest as well as the Korean Peninsula in the far northeast.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{widening}} {{of the tower}} arches in 1270 and 1320 the tower of St.Mary's had been structurally weak. The subsequent addition of the bells and belfry and the lead-covered spire added to {{the weight of the}} tower, and the number of burials of local notables within the church and of parishioners immediately outside the church building weakened the structure further. By the 18th century the problems had become severe enough that the west arch of the south transept was blocked up in an effort the strengthen the structure, and a hollow pillar which housed the stairway to the rood loft was filled in. The tower continued to weaken, a situation made worse by the addition in 1812 of a new ring of six bells with a 17cwt(860kg) tenor bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Iron bands were wrapped around the tower to strengthen it but these soon snapped, and by the 19th century large cracks, which had appeared in the tower, were filled with broken bricks and <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> covered over with roughcast as an interim solution.|$|E
5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts {{have been shown to be}} able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> blockages, recharging the player's HEV suit or powering up electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles, although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as meat eaters; the player can observe Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in Half-Life and cooking headcrabs in Half-Life 2, although Half-Life 2 also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.|$|E
5|$|The usual tomb plan {{consisted}} of a long inclined rock-cut corridor, descending through one or more halls (possibly mirroring the descending path of the sun god into the underworld) to the burial chamber. In the earlier tombs, the corridors turn 90 degrees at least once (such as KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV), and the earliest ones had cartouche-shaped burial chambers (for example, KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV). This layout is known as 'Bent Axis', After the burial the upper corridors {{were meant to be}} filled with <b>rubble</b> <b>and</b> the entrance to the tomb hidden. After the Amarna Period, the layout gradually straightened, with an intermediate 'Jogged Axis' (the tomb of Horemheb, KV57 is typical of this {{and is one of the}} tombs that is sometimes open to the public), to the generally 'Straight Axis' of the late Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasty tombs (Ramesses III's and Ramesses IX's tombs, KV11 and KV6 respectively). As the tombs' axes straightened, the slopes also lessened. They almost disappeared in the late Twentieth Dynasty. Another feature that is common to most tombs is the 'well', which may have originated as an actual barrier intended to stop flood waters from entering the lower parts of the tomb. It seems to have developed a 'magical' purpose later on as a symbolic shaft. In the later Twentieth Dynasty, the well itself was sometimes not excavated, but the well room was still present.|$|E

After the Exposition, apartment buildings were erected on the landfill. In the 1989 earthquake, the water-saturated unconsolidated mud, sand <b>and</b> <b>rubble</b> suffered liquefaction, <b>and</b> the earthquake's vertical shock waves rippled the ground more severely.|$|R
