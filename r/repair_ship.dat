5|$|The {{converted}} Victorious {{was commissioned}} as a <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> on 22 February 1916 {{and arrived at}} Scapa Flow to replace the converted merchant ship Caribbean, which had been lost in September 1915, as <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> for the Grand Fleet. Victorious performed this role there until March 1920 when she was renamed Indus II and transferred to Devonport for a refit to prepare her for service with the Indus Establishment. She arrived at Devonport on 28 March 1920 and paid off into a care and maintenance status while she awaited {{the beginning of her}} refit. Plans for the refit, however, were cancelled; work began to convert her into a harbor depot ship but, in April 1922, that conversion was cancelled before it could be completed and she was placed on the disposal list that month. Indus II was sold for scrapping on 19 December 1922, but the sale was cancelled on 1 March 1923. She was again sold on 9 April 1923 and was towed from Devonport to Dover to be scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough {{for two or three}} weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E
5|$|Vindictive was demilitarized and {{converted}} into a training ship in 1936–1937. At {{the beginning of the}} Second World War she was {{converted into a}} <b>repair</b> <b>ship.</b> Her first role after the conversion was completed in early 1940, however, was to transport troops during the Norwegian Campaign. She was then sent to the South Atlantic to support British ships serving there and, in late 1942, to the Mediterranean to support the ships there. Vindictive returned home in 1944 and was damaged by a German torpedo off the coast of Normandy after the Allies invaded France. She was reduced to reserve after the war and sold for scrap in 1946.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to the United Kingdom in 1904, Victorious served as the second flagship of the Channel Fleet. She remained in active service with the fleet in various units until 1908, when she was modernized and then placed in reserve. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in August 1914 she was mobilized with three of her sister ships into the 9th Battle Squadron, though by January 1915 she was again withdrawn from front-line service. In September her main guns were removed to arm a pair of monitors. Victorious was subsequently used as a <b>repair</b> <b>ship.</b> After {{the end of the war}} she was renamed Indus II; plans to use her as a harbor ship were cancelled and, in April 1923, she was sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|HMS Unicorn was an {{aircraft}} <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> and light aircraft carrier {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the late 1930s. She was completed during World War II and provided air cover over the amphibious landing at Salerno, Italy in September 1943. The ship {{was transferred to the}} Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean {{at the end of the}} year. Unicorn supported the aircraft carriers of the fleet on their operations until the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed in November 1944. She was transferred to Australia in early 1945 to support the BPF's operations during Operation Iceberg, the Allied invasion of Okinawa in May. To shorten the time required to replenish the BPF's carriers, the ship was based in the Admiralty Islands and in the Philippine Islands until the Japanese surrender in August. Unicorn was decommissioned and placed in reserve when she returned to the UK in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|In October 1920, the {{question}} was finally settled when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye provided for {{the transfer of the}} obsolete coastal defence ship , eight s, four older s, the <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> Cyclop, the water carriers Najade and Nixe, the salvage vessel Gigant, three tugs, the yacht Dalmat, four hulks, four river monitors (Bosna, Enns, Körös and Bodrog), one motor launch, three river tugs, 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil lighters. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921. As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats, the new nation had to build its naval forces from scratch.|$|E

50|$|Modern cable ships differ {{greatly from}} their predecessors. There {{are two main}} types of cable ships: cable <b>repair</b> <b>ships</b> and cable-laying <b>ships.</b> Cable <b>repair</b> <b>ships,</b> like the Japanese Tsugaru Maru, tend to be smaller and more maneuverable; {{they are capable of}} laying cable, but their primary job is fixing or {{repairing}} broken sections of cable. A cable-laying ship, like the Long Lines, is designed to lay new cables. Such ships are bigger than <b>repair</b> <b>ships</b> and less maneuverable; their cable storage drums are also larger and are set in parallel so one drum can feed into another, allowing them to lay cable much faster. These ships are also generally equipped with a liner cable engine (LCE) that helps them lay cable quickly.|$|R

5|$|Interned at New Orleans, Louisiana at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Breslau was seized in 1917 by the United States after her entry into the war and commissioned into the Navy as USS Bridgeport. Originally slated to be a <b>repair</b> <b>ship,</b> she was reclassified as a destroyer tender the following year. Bridgeport completed several transatlantic convoy crossings before she was stationed at Brest, France, where she remained in a support role {{after the end of}} World War I. After returning to the United States in November 1919, she spent the next five years along the East Coast and in the Caribbean tending destroyers and conducting training missions. She was decommissioned in November 1924 and placed in reserve at the Boston Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, Scharnhorst, Tirpitz, and Lützow steamed to Altafjord {{for repairs}} to damage {{incurred}} in heavy storms. In early April, Scharnhorst, Tirpitz, and nine destroyers conducted a training mission to Bear Island in the Arctic Ocean. On the 8th, a serious internal explosion {{occurred in the}} aft auxiliary machinery space above the armor deck. The explosion killed or injured 34 men and prompted the crew to flood the magazines for turret Caesar as a precaution against a magazine explosion. A <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> completed work on the vessel in two weeks. Fuel shortages prevented major operations {{for the next six}} months, during which Scharnhorst was able to conduct only short training maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Reclassified as {{a coastal}} defence ship in 1921, Asahi was {{disarmed}} {{two years later}} to meet {{the terms of the}} Washington Naval Treaty, after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship. She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928. Asahi was recommissioned in late 1937, after the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and used to transport Japanese troops. In 1938, she was converted into a <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> and based first at Japanese-occupied Shanghai, China, and then Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, from late 1938 to 1941. The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early 1942 to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in May. She was sunk en route by the American submarine , although most of her crew survived.|$|E

5|$|Reclassified as a <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> on 16 August 1937, Asahi {{was taken}} out of reserve in November, after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that started the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was used as a {{transport}} to land troops in an amphibious landing at Hangzhou Bay. Afterwards she began conversion at Kure, Japan, into a repair ship; this was completed on 18 December 1938. Asahi was fitted with a dummy wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in Shanghai on 29 December. In May 1939 she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between 29 May and 7 November 1940. She was transferred to Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 15 November 1940 and later transported the 11th Base Unit from Kure to Camranh Bay 19 November – 7 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|She {{acted as}} a royal yacht for Crown Prince Umberto's 1924 tour of South America and then {{deployed}} to the Indian Ocean to support operations in Italian Somaliland in 1925–26. San Giorgio served as a training ship from 1930 to 1935 and was then rebuilt in 1937–38 to better serve in that role. As part of her reconstruction, she received a modern anti-aircraft suite that was augmented before she was transferred to bolster the defences of Tobruk shortly before Italy declared war on the Allies in mid-1940. San Giorgio was forced to scuttle herself in early 1941 as the Allies moved in to occupy the port. Her wreck {{was used as an}} immobile <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> by the British from 1943 through 1945. Salvaged in 1952, she sank while under tow to Italy to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|The Italian cruiser Vettor Pisani was {{the name}} ship of her class of two armored cruisers built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1890s. She often served as a {{flagship}} during her career and frequently served overseas. On one of these deployments, the ship received a radio message from Peking, {{one of the first}} long-range radio transmissions to a ship. Vettor Pisani participated in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 and the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12, during which her admiral nearly caused a diplomatic incident with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During World War I, her activities were limited by the threat of Austro-Hungarian submarines and she was converted into a <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> in 1916. Vettor Pisani was stricken from the Navy List in 1920 and scrapped later that year.|$|E

5|$|The Vettor Pisani class {{consisted}} of two armoured cruisers built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1890s. The two ships of the class, Vettor Pisani and Carlo Alberto, were frequently deployed overseas during their careers. The former served in the Far East during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 while the latter was involved in pioneering long-range radio experiments several years later before deploying to South American waters. Carlo Alberto then served as a training ship for several years. Both ships participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 191112 and played minor roles in World War I, during which time Carlo Alberto was converted into a troop transport and Vettor Pisani into a <b>repair</b> <b>ship.</b> They were both discarded in 1920 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The ships had fairly uneventful careers, owing {{in part to}} the {{restricted}} naval budgets of the 1870s and 1880s, which precluded an active fleet policy. The three ships made one major overseas cruise to Spain in 1888 {{to take part in the}} Barcelona Universal Exposition. They were withdrawn from service in the early 1900s and converted for secondary roles; Kaiser Max and Don Juan d'Austria became barracks ships and Prinz Eugen became a <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> and was renamed Vulkan. After World War I, Don Juan d'Austria sank under unclear circumstances while the other two ships were seized by Italy. Kaiser Max was transferred to the Royal Yugoslav Navy in the postwar peace negotiations and renamed Tivat. Italy refused to turn Vulkan over to Yugoslavia, however. The ultimate fate of both vessels is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Victorious was {{converted}} into a <b>repair</b> <b>ship</b> in 191516 and based in Scapa Flow, the main base of the Grand Fleet. Jupiter {{was transferred to the}} Suez Canal Patrol in mid-1915, before returning to Devonport in late 1916 to be paid off. By 1916, Illustrious had been {{converted into a}} storeship and based in Chatham; she was joined there by Prince George, by then converted into a barracks ship. From December 1914 to September 1918, Caesar was employed as a guard ship, first at Gibraltar and then in the North America and West Indies Station. She served in the Adriatic Squadron in September 1918, and then in the Aegean Squadron in October. After the war, she supported the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea as a depot ship; she was the last British pre-dreadnought to serve overseas in any capacity.|$|E
