The expected impacts of a new motorway in the given area are discussed with technical bibliography, which provided the basis for research questions and hypotheses. Field research was conducted in municipalities, which will yet be affected by the planned D 3 motorway, and in municipalities in Central and Southern Bohemia, where part of D 3 motorway had already been completed. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were used as the main research tools. The finding about the perception of the D 3 motorway in the affected municipalities were based on detailed analysis of statistical data and in-depth analysis of the interviews. The findings show that the resulting perception of the impact varies depending on various aspects like geographical aspects, such as the location of the village (with regard to the highway route) or the population size of the municipality.

40|$|From the First World War Australian port {{administration}} {{came under}} criticism from exporters, shipping {{companies and the}} Commonwealth government, all of whom argued that port authorities charges imposed an excessive burden on exporters. They sought the replacement of public port authorities by trusts <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> interests. The campaign for port administration reform also diverted farmers from criticism of shipping freights and to secure their acquiescence in anti-competitive practices in the shipping industry. The formation of the Australian Overseas Transport Association in 1929 {{was the culmination of}} this campaign. Elite conservative political support for such anti-competitive practices reflected a belief that competitive capitalism was inherently unstable. The Scullin Labor of 1929 - 31 government abandoned Labor 2 ̆ 7 s earlier hostility to shipping companies to support cartelisation. Conservative state governments, in a more competitive electoral position than their federal counterparts and under greater financial pressure, deflected business calls for port administration reform. Business groups expected the NSW conservative government elected in 1932 to reform port administration towards a representative model, but the Maritime Services Board established in 1935 merely rationalised existing administrative structures. In the 1980 s international economic instability legitimated the project of microeconomic reform, particularly in the maritime sector, but in the interwar period a different balance of capital, labour and the state meant that economic isolationism rather than integration was the policy outcome. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the study: This study {{contributes}} to the research on life satisfaction, time use and customer behavior by studying the associations between life satisfaction, use of time and exploratory buying behavior. Data {{used for this study}} is collected among the business students of Aalto University and consequently an interesting insight on how satisfied students are with their lives is revealed. Furthermore, relations of other variables such as mental health, spending, working while studying or spare time to the main variables and to each other are analyzed. Finally, this study argues for importance of studying life satisfaction and time use further. This could give plenty of useful information to marketers about consumers' behavior. Methodology: The data for the study was collected in 2013 using an online questionnaire. A total of 132 responses were obtained and the data was <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> students of both genders. The data was analyzed with quantitative research methods including correlation analysis and regression analysis. Findings: The findings of the study suggest that there is a relationship between life satisfaction and polychronic-monochronic tendency. Exploratory consumer buying behavior did not correlate with life satisfaction or polychronic-monochronic time use. In addition, relations of 14 more variables' to the main variables and to each other were analyzed. The regression models constructed revealed that spending, spare time, age and mental problems explained life satisfaction. Surprisingly, spare time correlated negatively to life satisfaction. Additionally, working while studying had positive relation to life satisfaction. Furthermore, spending and working explained polychronic- monochronic time use, and exploratory buying behavior was explained by gender and spending...|$|E

40|$|The problem being {{investigated}} is the historical situation relating to two independent MPs holding {{the balance of}} power in the Australian House of Representatives in 1940 and 1941. The two MPs, Arthur Coles and Alex Wilson, supported the conservative Menzies and Fadden governments before shifting their support (on October 3 1941) to the Labor Party led by Curtin. The procedure followed is the examination, in the form of a historical narrative, of primary evidence in private papers (such as Coles&# 146;s), analysis of Hansard (CPD), local and metropolitan newspapers. Also examined are references to the two independents in secondary literature. The key focus of interest will be the idea that chance or serendipity played a major role in achieving all the key outcomes which many Australians (and historians like Hasluck) often otherwise depict as the triumph of good sense within a supposedly non-problematic twoparty political system which self-selected the best possible leadership during time of war. Coles took over the seat of a popular Cabinet minister who had died in an air disaster. Coles&# 146;s and Wilson&# 146;s holding {{the balance of power}} was another extreme aberration, as no House of Representatives from 1906 to 1940, and none since, has not had either of the two party blocs (Labor and anti-Labor) without a majority. Hasluck, the most influential historian of Australian politics during the 1939 - 1945 war, viewed the fact of Coles&# 146;s and Wilson&# 146;s serendipity as evidence, in itself, of their wider historical, ideological and political irrelevance. The general results obtained by pursuing a critical historical narrative approach is that a strong counter-argument has been developed that suggests that Hasluck (and wider historical memory) has insufficiently valued as historical factors Coles&# 146;s and Wilson&# 146;s ideological aims. Coles was a <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> progressivism and Wilson of agrarian socialism. The major conclusion reached is that Coles&# 146;s and Wilson&# 146;s wider aims led them to adopt the tactic of timing their shift to Labor so as to maximize their ideological influence on the Labor administration that would result whenever they decided to exercise their entirely serendipitously attained balance of power...|$|E
30|$|Our study {{makes an}} {{important}} contribution to the literature by including two principal sets of factors – stocks of youth human/social capital and personality traits – in predicting entrepreneurial proclivity of college students, and by empirically assessing their relative importance in developing this propensity. However, our study has a number of limitations. First, the fact that parents were not directly queried about their stocks of social and economic capital and that student assessments of these were used as proxy measures opens our paper to criticisms of behavioral expectation bias, social desirability bias, or social acquiescence bias. Second, the sample is confined to students from private colleges, who probably have more social capital at their disposal than other college students or non-college young adults. In addition, although we have made efforts to make the colleges studied <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> students in Chennai, {{it is possible that the}} study sample differed in other, unobservable ways from the population of business students in Chennai or Tamil Nadu. It should also be noted 4 that while the variables used to predict entrepreneurial proclivity in this study follow from a careful reading of the literature, it is still possible that these variables may not reflect characteristics and traits of actual entrepreneurs in Chennai. One possible way to remedy this shortcoming and to empirically validate the study variables would have been to ascertain what attitudes and values characterize actual entrepreneurs in Chennai, and what motivated them to become an entrepreneur. Based on personal interviews with 147 entrepreneurs in six major Indian cities (Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, and Bangalore), the Indian National Knowledge Commission (NKC) found that these entrepreneurs possessed many of the characteristics and traits we have used in this study (e.g., social and family networks, risk tolerance, power, achievement orientation, stimulation or challenge, self-direction, work experience) (Goswami et al., 2008). However, the NKC also acknowledges that not all entrepreneurs generally conform to a particular set of traits or characteristics, citing a Harvard Business School study that avers that “if one could only discern the psychological profile of an entrepreneur and then hold an individual up against that profile, one could predict whether that individual has the potential to become an entrepreneur, or is one already. Yet none of the proposed ”profiles“ applies to all entrepreneurs, and many entrepreneurs refuse to conform to any of these profiles” (Stevenson and Amabile, 1999; Goswami et al., 2008). Finally, since it is abundantly clear in India, the United States, and elsewhere that college is not a necessary condition for engaging in entrepreneurship, and in some cases may even act as a deterrent, this study may overestimate the importance of social capital and underplay the significance of personality traits.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The Purpose of the Study The central {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the professional education competencies of selected community college vocational instructors. Respondents in the study included instructors of business and distributive education. Major dimensions were the construction and validation of a questionnaire for community college vocational instructors; the analysis of data to determine if there were differences among the community colleges in their responses to the competencies contained in the questionnaire; a factor analysis of the professional education competencies and the community college respondents; and the formulation of implications to be considered in the development of teacher education curriculums. The Procedures The construction and validation of the instructor questionnaire was accomplished through a review of the literature, an evaluation by a jury of experts, and a field test. A mail survey questionnaire containing 99 professional education competencies together with a five-point Likert-type scale was used to gather data. The dependent variable was the score judgmentally assigned by respondents to denote the level of proficiency they felt was necessary for each of the 99 competencies. The study's population utilized the four western states of California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington and was <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> and distributive education instructors at the community college level. A random sample of 160 instructors provided data for the study. The Data The F statistic was used to analyze contrasts between the mean scores for each competency with the. 01 level of significance being used to determine differences existing between the community colleges. A test of Least Significant Difference was used to determine where specific differences existed between means of community colleges which were rejected in the analysis of variance tests. Further analysis of the data was accomplished through the use of two factor analytic techniques, the Q-technique and the R-technique. The Q-technique ordered respondents according to the 99 competencies included in the study. The R-technique was used to cluster competencies according to respondents. Factors and subfactor names were assigned after the data were analyzed. Selected Findings Generally, the analysis of variance tests indicated that the community colleges were alike in their responses to the competencies contained in the questionnaire. The factor analysis of data revealed that the business and distributive education instructors resembled one another in their responses and demonstrated that it is possible to generate factors containing clusters of common professional education competencies. Competencies which clustered under the factors of Instructional Management and Teaching-Learning Process were judged by instructors to require the highest level of proficiency. In all, respondents indicated that 91 of the 99 professional education competencies required a moderate or higher level of proficiency in the performance of their job...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} working relationships between full-time chief negotiators in selected school districts throughout the United States and the superintendents of schools, members of the negotiating team, and school boards during the period of collective negotiations. Secondary purposes of the study were to: (1) identify the composition of board negotiation teams and to discover the special responsibilities borne by various members of the negotiation team; (2) investigate the process of internal communications carried on between the full-time chief negotiator, the superintendent, and the board during negotiations; and (3) secure opinions of the full-time chief negotiator, superintendent, and board president relative to the positive or negative effect of the negotiation process on the school district. The population of the study was comprised of eighteen responding urban school corporations throughout the United States which have an established position of full-time chief negotiator as a function of the superintendency. Data secured from the negotiators, superintendents, and school board presidents of participating school corporations were used as the basis for the study. The major findings from the study were: 1. Full-time chief negotiators have, with few exceptions, reported directly to the superintendent of schools. 2. School board negotiation teams have usually included, in addition to the full-time chief negotiator, at least one member with major responsibility for instructional and/or personnel matters within the school system. The negotiating team members <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> management and/or finance areas were reported for fewer than half of the school systems included in the study. 3. The full-time chief negotiator, with few exceptions, has been chairman of the board negotiating team and has been charged with responsibilities for setting strategy and directing the progress of negotiations. 4. The full-time chief negotiator has ordinarily served as the only spokesman for the administration and school board during negotiation sessions. On some occasions other team members may serve as a spokesman depending upon matters being discussed and expertise of the team member. The fulltime chief negotiator has served as spokesman during all crucial periods. 5. The superintendent of schools has not been an active participant in actual negotiations proceedings. 6. Although the superintendent of schools has not been an active participant in negotiating sessions he has been closely involved behind the scenes. All reports indicate that the superintendent has not been "by passed" in any way. 7. The superintendent and full-time chief negotiator as a general rule were reported as attending all school board executive sessions dealing with negotiations matters. 8. The person or persons making negotiation recommendations to the board was, as a general rule, the superintendent and the chief negotiator, but there was some conflict here in the responses of the chief negotiator, superintendent, and president of the board. There was noticeable conflict in the situations where the chief negotiator reported to someone other than the superintendent. 9. Board presidents felt that board involvement on noneconomic matters was the same as economic. Most chief negotiators felt board involvement on non-economic matters was substantially less than on economic matters. The superintendents were more inclined to agree with the board opinion. 10. The overall effect of negotiations as reported by all three groups surveyed were predominately positive. The responses of the full-time chief negotiator were almost all positive, with a lesser number of superintendents responding in the positive and even a lesser number of presidents of the school board. 11. Most superintendents felt the establishment of the position of full-time chief negotiator to have been beneficial and essential to the functioning of their school system after the advent of negotiations with employee groups. Major conclusions included: 1. More and more school systems will move to employ a full-time chief negotiator in the future. 2. The establishment of the position of chief negotiator, reporting to the superintendent of schools has not resulted in any relinquishment of authority, status or influence of the superintendent. 3. The person performing the task of chairman of the school board negotiation team should be an employee of the school system with knowledge in all areas of the school system he represents. 4. The full-time chief negotiator should be close to the superintendent and identified with him in order to have maximum effectiveness in the negotiation process. 5. The full-time chief negotiator must have intimate contact with the school board in regular and executive sessions in order to know the attitudes and desires of the board that he represents. 6. The establishment of the position of chief negotiator as a function of the superintendency is generally considered to be desirable and essential. 7. The establishment of the position of chief negotiator does not change or depreciate the relationship of the superintendent with the school board in the negotiation process so long as the chief negotiator reports directly to the superintendent of schools. If the chief negotiator reports to someone other than the superintendent, there is likely to be confusion, conflict and impairment of effective relationships. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
