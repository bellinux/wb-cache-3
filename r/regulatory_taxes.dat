Traditional explanations for the increase include rising land values and costs of construction, but a strand of literature, popularized by Glaeser et al.

In this paper, we apply and extend Glaeser and Gyourko's methodology in order to estimate the <b>regulatory</b> <b>tax</b> on an individual house level in a set of Florida metropolitan areas. Our novel data address some of the quality measurement concerns raised about the Glaeser and Gyourko methodology and allow us to look at the evolution of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>tax</b> over a 10 -year period. We find that the tax is an important component of sales price and that as a percentage of sales price has increased in a majority of Florida's MSAs. In addition, we decompose the overall house price increase into land, materials and regulatory components and find that increasing stringency in the regulatory environment within Florida represents a substantial portion of the run-up in house prices in most metropolitan areas. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>tax</b> Cost of regulation House prices Land use regulation...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to theoretically examine the impact of bank capital requirements on a borrower's choice of financing source. Our focus is on the tension between <b>regulatory</b> <b>taxes,</b> such as bank capital requirements (that reduce the value of a bank loan to a borrower), and the bank's incentive to renegotiate debt terms with financially distressed borrowers (that increases the value of a bank loan to a borrower). We show that borrowers that approach banks are necessarily of intermediate quality. This set of borrow-ers diminishes as bank capital requirements increase. Surprisingly, this happens not only because bank capital requirements increase loan prices and hence reduce the value of the loan to the borrower, but also because they weaken the bank's incentive to restructure troubled loans, thereby causing a dampened loan demand. Additionally, holding quality fixed, growth-oriented borrowers are more likely to prefer the capital market han borrowers expecting high cash flows early when facing a sufficiently high capital requirement. Finally, the effect of capital requirement increases i asymmetric- growth-oriented borrowers are more likely than 'cash cows ' to migrate from banks to the capital market when banks confront higher capital requirements...|$|E
40|$|SIP {{is defined}} as a {{protocol}} that enables end-to-end voice calls as well as for establishing multiparty, multimedia communications in IP-based networks. Presently, SIP is the most widely deployed intra-carrier VoIP protocol but it is also extensively utilized within many carrier networks for transporting voice/video calls over short and long distances. For all of these reasons, SIP can lay a claim to being the global standard for software based voice communication over IP. Furthermore, an important driving force for IP telephony is cost savings for consumers and corporations with large data networks. The high cost of long-distance and international voice calls presents both a challenge and an opportunity and must be taken into account. A significant portion of this cost originates from <b>regulatory</b> <b>taxes</b> imposed on long distance voice calls within the legacy networks. Such surcharges do not apply to long-distance circuit networks carrying data traffic; thus, for a given bandwidth, making a data call is much less expensive than a voice call. The objective of this research is to acknowledge SIP based communications as way to provide a better, reliable, cost effective, resource efficient and service flexible method for communications. The results will show certain vulnerabilities or weaknesses of the method, but also point solutions. This thesis explains the VoIP/SIP based telephony network with call routing and admission control for real time traffic flows, also considering the priority usage perspective. To accomplish the main objectives, of proving the advantages of VoIP over traditional voice communications, we will analyze concepts such as Assured Services SIP, Multi-Level Precedence, admission control and bandwidth broker network elements. Moreover, we will touch Signaling System 7 with Session Border Controller as well as a small comparison to H. 323 protocol...|$|E

5000|$|The Netherlands {{initiated}} {{a carbon tax}} in 1990. However, in 1992 it was replaced with a 50/50 carbon/energy tax called the Environmental Tax on Fuels, the taxes are assessed partly on carbon content and partly on energy content. The charge {{was transformed into a}} tax and became part of general tax revenues. As such, it fell under the administration of the Ministry of Finance. The general fuel tax is collected on all hydrocarbon fuels. Fuels used as raw materials are not subject to the tax. Tax rates are based 50/50 on the energy and carbon contents of fuels. In 1996 The <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Tax</b> on Energy, another 50/50 carbon/energy tax, was also implemented. The Environmental <b>tax</b> and the <b>regulatory</b> <b>tax</b> are 5.16 Dutch guilder, or NLG, (~$3.13) or per tonne of CO2 and 27.00 NLG (~16.40) per tonne CO2 respectively. Under the general fuel tax, electricity is not taxed, though fuels used to produce electricity are taxable. Energy-intensive industries used to benefit from preferential rates under this tax but the benefit was cancelled in January 1997. Also, since 1997 nuclear power has been taxed under the general fuel tax at the rate of NLG 31.95 per gram of uranium-235.38 The European Environment Agency put out an Executive Summary stating [...] "Although the 5th Environmental Action Programme of the EU in 1992 recommended the greater use of economic instruments such as environmental taxes, there has been little progress in their use since then at the EU level."

A tax on fuels and the {{so-called}} <b>regulatory</b> energy <b>tax</b> since 1996 are examples of indirect and non-uniform taxation of emissions. The overall tax base and rate structure corroborates recent theoretical findings that heterogeneity in production processes and transaction costs may justify optimal departures from the Pigovian corrective tax rule. Surprisingly, the Dutch revenue-raising tax matches the (modified) Pigovian policy prescription rather well, whereas the <b>regulatory</b> energy <b>tax</b> mainly follows the revenue raising Ramsey logic. Further improvements of the energy tax structure are also discussed, such as targeting the energy tax base and linking the tax rate more precisely to fuel characteristics.

40|$|The {{authors found}} that, in post-communist economies, the {{unofficial}} economy's share of GDP {{is determined by}} the extent of control rights held by bureaucrats and politicians. Exploring in detail the role of taxation and bribery, and using data from an expanded data set of 49 Latin American, OECD, and transition economies, the authors find that the unofficial economy accounts for a larger share of GDP where there is great bureaucratic inefficiency and discretion, and where firms experience a greater <b>tax</b> and <b>regulatory</b> burden, as well as more bribery and corruption. The unofficial economy is also much larger where there is less state revenue and where the rule of law is weak. They also find that countries with a larger unofficial economy tend to grow more slowly. Thus, this framework suggests an additional channel whereby corruption and ineffective <b>regulatory</b> and <b>tax</b> administration can result in lower growth: the unofficial economy. Wealthy OECD economies and some Eastern European economies find themselves the"good equilibrium"of relatively low <b>regulatory</b> and <b>tax</b> burden (not necessarily low statutory tax rates), sizable revenue mobilization, good rule of law and control of corruption, and a small unofficial economy. Several countries in Latin America and the former Soviet Union exhibit characteristics consistent with a"bad equilibrium": the discretionary application of heavy <b>regulatory</b> and <b>tax</b> burdens, the weakrule of law, heavy bribery, and an active unofficial economy. In this large country sample (unlike in the earlier framework for transition economies only), the authors find that it is the ineffective and discretionary application of <b>regulatory</b> and <b>tax</b> regimes in many countries [...] not higher tax rates by itself [...] that increase the size of the unofficial economy. The tax burden reported by firms appears to be more a function of regulatory and bureaucratic inefficiency and discretion rather than of tax rates alone.
