5|$|A {{state of}} {{national}} emergency has an {{adverse effect on}} these <b>rights.</b> <b>Under</b> such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the President may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.|$|E
5|$|However, {{it is not}} {{yet clear}} whether the {{citizenship}} rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their <b>rights</b> <b>under</b> article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms does not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC régime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen <b>rights</b> <b>under</b> article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents presently do not have a right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in Brussels in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes in the Dublin Journal.

The English, in 1735, attempted to pass a law that would allow a copyright holder to prohibit works that may violate their copyright, but this law failed to pass through Parliament.|$|E

Claiborne also argued that whatever regulatory rights which were held {{by the federal government}} were transferred to the state of Wisconsin by the termination act.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{defendant}} and the State Attorney may appeal the decision; the appeal would {{be heard by}} a panel of the Prague High Court, consisting of three professional judges. A decision of second instance court is final and enforceable. Nevertheless, an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by {{the defendant}} or the Supreme State Attorney, which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in Brno; an extraordinary appeal may, however, rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case. After exhausting all of these remedies, the defendant may also lodge a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. The petition may be based on allegation of violation of <b>rights</b> <b>under</b> the Czech Constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Gyles v Wilcox (1740) 26 ER 489 was a {{decision}} of the Court of Chancery of England that established the doctrine of fair abridgement, which would later evolve into the concept of fair use. The case was heard and the opinion written by Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, and concerned Fletcher Gyles, a bookseller who had published a copy of Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown. Soon after the initial publication, the publishers Wilcox and Nutt hired a writer named Barrow to abridge the book, and repackaged it as Modern Crown Law. Gyles sued for a stay on the book's publishing, claiming his <b>rights</b> <b>under</b> the Statute of Anne had been infringed.|$|E

The stay was lifted in September 2013, and the child was turned over to the Capobiancos the same month.|$|E
5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their <b>rights</b> <b>under</b> Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly also meant that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and a national network of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E
5|$|Minogue was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer at age 36 on 17 May 2005, leading to the postponement of the remainder of her Showgirl– The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival. Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement of support. As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's <b>rights</b> <b>under</b> Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.|$|E

In 1967, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead an investigation concerning the 1967 Detroit riot for the Kerner Commission. During the investigation, Miskovsky interviewed civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Miskovsky's report concluded that the United States was transitioning into two separate societies, one black and the other white, and that the societies were inherently unequal. In 1968, Miskovsky was appointed the director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Under</b> Law, an organization which gave legal aid to those whose civil liberties were violated. From 1977 to 1981, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Miskovsky served as {{general counsel for the}} Federal Home Loan Bank Board.|$|E
5|$|Super v. Work (1926) {{involved}} {{a challenge in}} the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (now known as the United States District Court for the District of Columbia) {{to the construction of}} federal hydroelectric dams in California. The plaintiffs, members of the Karuk and Peh-tsick tribes, alleged both that the dams would violate their aboriginal title rights and their <b>rights</b> <b>under</b> the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that both rights (if they existed) were extinguished by the 1851 statute. Unlike the plaintiffs in Barker, who were Mission Indians, the plaintiffs here were nomadic {{at the time of the}} relevant times.|$|E
5|$|The tribe {{sued the}} United States for {{compensation}} in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that tribal members still had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights.

In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing <b>rights</b> <b>under</b> the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.|$|E
