Improved {{diagnosis and treatment of}} immunologic infertility, as well as identification of proteins for targeted contraception, are dependent on the identification and characterization of relevant sperm antigens. The protein expressed by this gene is recognized by anti-sperm agglutinating antibodies from an infertile woman. Furthermore, immunization of female rats with the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> reduced fertility. This protein localizes to the plasma membrane of germ cells in the testis and to the post-acrosomal plasma membrane of mature spermatozoa. Recombinant polypeptide binds GTP and exhibits GTPase activity. Thus, this protein may regulate GTP signal transduction pathways involved in spermatogenesis and fertilization. Two transcript variants of this gene encode the same protein.|$|E

50|$|Human CUGBP1 (hCUGBP1) {{had been}} {{previously}} identified by Timchenko and colleagues {{for its ability to}} bind to CUG repeats located in the DMPK 3'UTR. A large amount of work has since described the role of hCUGBP1 on control of alternative splicing and will not be discussed here. The demonstration that hCUGBP1 is involved in the control of mRNA deadenylation and instability like xCUGBP1 came next. In mammalian cell extract as well as in xenopus egg extracts, depletion and rescue experiments showed that specific binding of CUGBP1 to the 3'UTR of mRNA is required for the targeted specific deadenylation to occur. In rescue experiments in xenopus egg extracts, the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> can replace the xenopus one making them functional homolog. Furthermore, the Poly(A) ribonuclease PARN was shown to interact with CUGBP1. In human cells, tethering of hCUGBP1 to a mRNA decreases its steadystate suggesting the destabilization of the mRNA. The first human mRNA reported to be targeted to rapid deadenylation and degradation by CUGBP1 is the oncogene c-jun. Years ago, it was shown that the class III ARE (devoid of any AUUUA motif) of the human c-jun oncogene directed rapid deadenylation and degradation to a reporter mRNA. Both xCUGBP1 and hCUGBP1 were shown to specifically bind to c-jun ARE. The binding of CUGBP1 to the 3'UTR of mRNAs bearing GU-rich element would target these mRNAs for rapid deadenylation by PARN and subsequent degradation. This was recently demonstrated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of hCUGBP1 that led to stabilization of a reporter RNA bearing the c-jun UG -rich ARE.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Production {{of complex}} <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>proteins</b> is an {{important}} issue in medical biotechnology. These proteins are mostly expressed in non-human mammalian host cells. This has some problems including non-human post-translational modifications, application of high-cost agents for inducing protein expression and low yields. Therefore, it is necessary to use new expression systems to overcome the indicated challenges. Methods: In this paper, we hypothesize the application of promoter regions of cancer genes, which have a high rate of transcription in human cancer cell lines, for designing new expression vectors. Results: After designing, these vectors could be applied to produce complex <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>proteins</b> in the <b>human</b> cancer cell lines as production hosts. Conclusion: Application of these expression vectors for the production of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> in the <b>human</b> cancer cell lines have some advantages including authentic post-translational modifications, proper-cost of commercialization, and high yields...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Alveolar fibrin {{deposition}} is {{a hallmark}} of pneumonia. It has been proposed that <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> activated <b>protein</b> C exerts lung-protective effects via anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory pathways. We investigated {{the role of the}} protein C system in pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the organism that is predominantly involved in ventilator-associated pneumonia. DESIGN: An observational clinical study and a controlled, in vivo laboratory study. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care unit and a research laboratory of a university hospital. PATIENTS AND SUBJECTS: Patients with unilateral ventilator-associated pneumonia and male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Bilateral bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in five patients with unilateral ventilator-associated pneumonia. A total of 62 rats were challenged with intratracheal P. aeruginosa (10 colony-forming units), inducing pneumonia. Rats were randomized to treatment with normal saline, <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> activated <b>protein</b> C, heparin, or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with pneumonia demonstrated suppressed levels of protein C and activated protein C in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the infected site compared with the contralateral uninfected site. Intravenous administration of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> activated <b>protein</b> C in rats with P. aeruginosa pneumonia limited bronchoalveolar generation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes, largely preserving local antithrombin activity. However, <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> activated <b>protein</b> C did not have effects on neutrophil influx and activity, expression of pulmonary cytokines, or bacterial clearance. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, the pulmonary protein C pathway is impaired at the site of infection, and local anticoagulant activity may be insufficient. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>human</b> activated <b>protein</b> C prevents procoagulant changes in the lung; however, {{it does not seem to}} alter the pulmonary host defense against P. aeruginosa pneumoni...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: Klotho, {{a protein}} mainly {{produced}} in the kidney and released into circulating blood, contributes to the negative regulation of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 formation and is thus a powerful regulator of mineral metabolism. As β-glucuronidase, alpha Klotho protein further regulates the stability of several carriers and channels in the plasma membrane and thus regulates channel and transporter activity. Accordingly, alpha Klotho protein participates in the regulation of diverse functions seemingly unrelated to mineral metabolism including lymphocyte function. The present study explored the impact of alpha Klotho protein on the voltage gated K+ channel Kv 1. 3. Methods: cRNA encoding Kv 1. 3 (KCNA 3) was injected into Xenopus oocytes and depolarization induced outward current in Kv 1. 3 expressing Xenopus oocytes determined utilizing dual electrode voltage clamp.
