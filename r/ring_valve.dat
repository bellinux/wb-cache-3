40|$|Compressor and {{refrigerant}} {{play key}} roles in a refrigeration system. Owing to the de-mands of environment protection, the CFCs and HCFCs refrigerants will {{be phased out}} in a short time, and new refrigerants such as R 600, R 134 a and R 407 C will be used. As the new refrigerant is selected, the motion regularity of the valves will be changed. The motion regularity of the ring valves of a 2 -stage refrigerating piston compressor is simu-lated, and the calculations are done respectively with refrigerants R 717 (ammonia), R 22 and R 134 a. The results show that refrigerants and working conditions of a compressor have a direct effect on {{the motion of the}} ring valves. Comparing the original design pa-rameters of the ring valves with the modified ones, the former are effective for the HCFC refrigerants, the latter have perfect motion of the valves for the new refrigerants, and the refrigeration system performance parameters, such as input power, the refriger-ating quantity and the COP value, are also better. Service life test of the compressor system using the ring valves has been done for R 717. The compressor using the modi-fied ring valves has a life exceeding 8000 hours. Hence, the valve design should con-sider the influences of the refrigerant. Key words: <b>ring</b> <b>valve,</b> compressor, refrigerant, design, simulation 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Preoperative {{knowledge}} of the aortic annular diameter could enable the preoperative selection and preparation of an appropriately sized homograft aortic valve. Objective: The aims {{of this study were}} to prospectively determine whether the combined use of transthoracic and multiplane transesophageal echocardiography allows accurate preoperative aortic annular measurements for the selection and preparation of adequately sized homograft aortic valves and to retrospectively evaluate the influence of the echocardiographic approach (transthoracic vs transesophageal) and the reader's level of experience on the accuracy of these measurements. Methods: Aortic annular measurements were performed before the operation by an experienced reader who used a combination of transthoracic and multiplane transesophageal images of 25 patients (mean age 52 ± 13 years) referred for homograft aortic valve replacement. Measurements were also performed retrospectively by three additional readers with different levels of training in echocardiography. These readers acquired aortic annular diameters from prerecorded tapes and obtained measurements from each echocardiographic modality independently. All values were compared with the surgical measurement obtained with a <b>ring</b> <b>valve</b> sizer. Results: With the combined echocardiographic approach, excellent agreement was found between preoperative echocardiographic and surgical measurements (mean difference ± 2 standard deviations = 0. 2 ± 1. 4 mm). All echocardiographic data were found to be within 2 mm of the surgical measurement. These measurements were used to select and prepare the aortic homograft valve before insertion. The accuracy of annular measurements appeared to increase in parallel to the level of experience. The aortic annular measurements obtained retrospectively by a second experienced reader were more accurate with the use of transesophageal than with transthoracic echocardiography (p 0. 2). Conclusions: Preoperative measurement of the aortic annular diameter by transthoracic and multiplane transesophageal echocardiography is accurate and clinically feasible. Preoperative {{knowledge of}} the aortic annular diameter may be used to select and prepare the aortic homograft, improving valve availability and reducing ischemic time.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine the velocity fields, magnitudes of shear stresses, and regions of stagnation of a jellyfish valve and a St. Vincent tilting-disk valve using laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). All experiments were performed in vitro and at steady volumetric flow rates of 15 and 261 /min (representing peak systole). The St. Vincent valve flow field was very unsymmetrical in the measurement plane that spanned the major and minor outflow regions of the valve and persisted at least to 1 D downstream. For both flow rates tested, a stagnation region was always observed just behind the occluder. The maximum axial velocity was in the major outflow side and reached 2. 54 m/s for peak systole flow of 261 /min. Moreover, {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the valve and for both flow rates tested, turbulence intensities and velocity gradients were higher in the minor outflow region than in the major outflow region. However, as the flow progressed downstream, the opposite was observed, with large peak velocity in the major outflow. The maximum shear stress across the St. Vincent valve occurred in the minor outflow region and increased from 30 to 60 N/m 2 as the flow rate increased from 15 to 261 /min. In the core of the larger jet, the shear stresses were very small (0 - 3 N/m 2). The flow {{at the edges of the}} jellyfish valve membrane, 10 mm (0. 5 D) downstream from the <b>ring</b> <b>valve,</b> consisted of two nearly symmetric jets in the vicinity of the tube wall. The maximum axial velocity in these jet regions increased from 1. 7 to 2. 5 m/s as the flow rates increased from 15 to 261 /min. Pressure effects due to the oscillation of the membrane of the jellyfish valve appear to generate high shear stress in the immediate vicinity of the jellyfish valve (0. 5 D downstream). The values of shear stress were 0 - 27 N/m 2 for a flow of 151 /min and 3 - 109 N/m 2 for a flow of 261 /min. However, as the flow progresses downstream, shear stresses decay rapidly and return to the upstream undisturbed level at about 4 D downstream, but at a slower rate than the RMS axial velocities. In general, for all operating flow conditions tested here, the jellyfish valve performed better than the St. Vincent valve when velocity and shear stress distributions are compared at locations more than 0. 5 D downstream from the valve...|$|E

50|$|Hydrolock {{is common}} on radial and {{inverted}} engines (cylinders pointing downwards) when the engine sits {{for a long}} period.

40|$|Abscesses of the <b>valve</b> <b>rings</b> of {{the heart}} were {{encountered}} at autopsy in 86 per cent of patients with acute bacterial endocarditis who had received antibiotic therapy. The abscesses, which ap-peared to arise from mycotic aneurysms in the <b>valve</b> <b>rings,</b> represented in most instances the onlv persistent focus of acute inflammation. They may account in part for the unsatisfactory results {{in the treatment of}} acute bacterial endocarditis, and their frequent occurrence suggests a rela-tionship to antibiotic therapy. INCE 1947 we have encountered 12 cases of acute bacterial endocarditis in which single or multiple abscesses of the <b>valve</b> <b>rings</b> {{of the heart}} were present. Abscesses were found in 86 per cent of all cases of acute bacte-rial endocarditis which came to autopsy during this period. The lesions, although of appreci-able size, were not conspicuous on routine ex-amination of the heart; in fact, they were easily overlooked if not specifically sought.

40|$|Balloon {{valvuloplasty}} {{has already}} gained its place {{as an alternative}} option {{in the treatment of}} valvar stenoses. In congenital valvar stenosis its application will be limited because of the complexity of the underlying valve deformities. Nevertheless, isolated pulmonary and aortic valve stenosis are amenable to this form of treatment. The major limitations are undeveloped arterial <b>valve</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>valve</b> dysplasia. In acquired valvar stenosis the main limitation of balloon valvuloplasty seems to be massive calcification of the affected valves. Basically, in both the arterial and atrioventricular position, balloon valvuloplasty splits fused commissures and fractures calcific deposits. Excessive radial pressures may cause tears of the leaflets. The potential of thromboembolic complications, therefore, warrants caution. The nature of the damage inflicted on pathologic valves almost by necessity dictates that restenosis will occur and - most likely - with a high incidenc...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Two {{patients}} who suffered acute failure of their St Jude Medical Masters aortic valve prostheses due to leaflet arrest that were unrelated to suture material are presented. It {{was hypothesized that}} the valves failed because force applied to bear upon the valve annulus caused the hinge mechanism to become restricted or to arrest. Methods: A {{study was designed to}} measure the force that would cause leaflet arrest in three sizes of St Jude Medical Masters valves and CarboMedics mechanical valves. A specially manufactured pushrod device was used to apply a variable force to the sewing cuff, low annulus level, or to the pivot guards of all the valves. Results: For every valve size tested, the St Jude Medical Masters valves required significantly less force applied than did the CarboMedics valves to cause one or both leaflets to arrest (P < 0. 0004). Conclusions: A force applied on the <b>valve</b> <b>ring</b> of mechanical <b>valves</b> can cause leaflet arrest. The force required to arrest the leaflets is within an order of magnitude of that measured in other in vivo animal studies. We conclude that force on the <b>valve</b> <b>rings</b> in patients after aortic valve surgery could cause leaflet malfunction and even arrest in some patients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.
