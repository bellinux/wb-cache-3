The experiment was carried out at the seedling stage, with six (6) treatments (<b>plants</b> <b>with</b> M. exigua, <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> arbuscular mycorrhizae, <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> both organisms, and the same time, first mycorrhizae plants, then nematodes were inoculated and vice versa). After 5 months the measured variables were: dry biomass (roots and shoot), nematode knots caused by M. exigua in root, nematode juvenile (J 2) found in 100. 0 g of soil, and mycorrhizal percentage. Plant nutrients (P and N) contents were analysed. Significant {{differences were found in}} all the variables, but concentration N content in <b>plants.</b> <b>Plants</b> <b>with</b> mycorrhizae and <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> mycorrhizae and then inoculated with nematodes have the same behaviour. Control <b>plants</b> and <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> nematode and then inoculated with mycorrhizae behave similarly. It is thought that arbuscular mycorrhizae are formed before the nematode infestation, allowing coffee plants to regain the energy lost by the parasitic interaction. AM may help coffee <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> lignifications of the plant cell wall cuticle. As the cuticle thickens it is more difficult for nematodes to penetrate and enter into plant roots. Therefore, arbuscular mycorrhizae help coffee plants to uptake and transport nutrients, improving its nutritional status and stabilizing nematode attacks.

40|$|Summary The {{effects of}} Agrobacterium pRiA 4 rol and aux genes, {{controlled}} by their endogenous promoters, on tree growth and wood anatomy and chemistry were studied in 5 -and 7 -year-old silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) plants. Southern hybridization confirmed the following rol and aux gene combinations: control plants (no genes transferred); <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> rolC and rolD genes; <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> rolA, rolB, rolC and rolD genes; and <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> rolA, rolB, rolC, rolD, aux 1 and aux 2 genes. Transgene mRNA was most abundant in phloem/cambium samples {{and in the}} developing xylem, whereas no expression was detected in leaves. <b>Plants</b> <b>with</b> rolC and rolD genes or with all the rol genes were significantly shorter and had smaller leaves and a more bushy growth habit than control <b>plants</b> or <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> both aux and rol genes. Mor-phological observations and wood chemistry analyses revealed that <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> rol genes produced less xylem and broke bud later than control <b>plants</b> or <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> both aux and rol genes. Tension wood was detected in both control and transgenic plants irrespective of their gene combination, probably as a re-sult of greenhouse cultivation. Xylem fibers were shorter in transgenic plants than in control <b>plants,</b> and <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> all the rol genes were characterized by shorter vessels compared <b>with</b> the control <b>plants</b> and a smaller proportional area of vessels compared with the other groups. In addition, silver birch <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> all the rol genes had approximately a 3. 3 % lower concen-tration of total acid soluble carbohydrates than control plants. We conclude that the rolC and rolD genes induced the typical “rol-phenotype, ” {{and that this was}} emphasized by concomitant expression of the rolA and rolB genes and alleviated by the presence of aux 1 and aux 2 genes.
