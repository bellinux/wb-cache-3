5|$|Without {{the means}} to {{effectively}} <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> Japanese offensive in the Solomons, the British Resident Commissioner of the Solomon Islands protectorate and the few Australian troops assigned to defend Tulagi evacuated the island just before the Japanese forces arrived on 3 May. The next day, however, a U.S. aircraft carrier task force en route to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> Japanese forces advancing on Port Moresby (later {{taking part in the}} Battle of the Coral Sea) struck the Japanese Tulagi landing force in an air attack, destroying or damaging several of the Japanese ships and aircraft involved in the landing operation. Nevertheless, the Japanese troops successfully occupied Tulagi and began the construction of a small naval base.|$|E

5|$|After Jonathan Martin's arson {{attack on}} York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, there were {{proposals}} by the dean and chapter {{to take the}} opportunity of the destruction to restructure {{the interior of the}} building.

A campaign led by Etty and other York luminaries was successful, and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831.|$|E
5|$|Belgium had {{pursued a}} policy of {{neutrality}} since its independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded Belgium. During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> occupiers through non-compliance, leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians by the German army.|$|E
5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E

The Diet was dissolved, but Sigismund's cousins convinced him not to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> Diet, which was dominated by Protestant delegates. The Diet was again summoned in late 1588; on 8December it ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits and declared Sigismund to be of age.|$|E
5|$|In Romanian historiography, the {{consensus}} describes Menumorut {{as one of}} the three Romanian rulers who attempted to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> Magyar conquest of the intra-Carpathian regions of present-day Romania. According to the Gesta, the Magyars eventually besieged and seized Menumorut's fortress at Biharia, and forced him to give his daughter in marriage to Zoltán, the son of Árpád, the Grand Prince of the Hungarians. The chronicle states that Menumorut died around 906 and was succeeded by his son-in-law.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle at}} Catraeth {{has been seen}} as an attempt to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> advance of the Angles, who had {{probably}} by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly after the fall of their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} {{controversial}} because many historians and writers {{have concluded that}} it was failures by British divisional and corps commanders that squandered an opportunity to capture Caen, rather than the Germans achieving a defensive success. To <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> offensive, the Germans had committed their most powerful armoured reserves, which deprived them of the fighting power for a counter-offensive and forfeited the initiative to the Allies.|$|E
