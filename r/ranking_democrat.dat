5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the <b>ranking</b> <b>Democrat</b> on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K.

Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E

The group is [...] "not partisan, but the Republican Party is so deeply entrenched in denying the existence of climate change that if a Republican climate hawk were to emerge, we would look hard at a Republican's willingness to buck leadership {{as well as the}} Republican's position on climate," [...] Miller said. Support would depend on not just not denying human-caused climate change but having a viable plan to do something about it.|$|R

[...] This process was also highly politicized, and the <b>ranking</b> <b>Democrat</b> on the committee, California Congressman Ronald Dellums, accused it of relying far too heavily on outside experts. [...] Many of the witnesses called before the committee were in fact strong proponents of missile defense.

[...] I couldn't help admiring his clear and incisive way of putting a question, although it appeared to me that his manner is occasionally very irritating.
