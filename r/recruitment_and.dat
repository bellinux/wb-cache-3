5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, a {{combination}} of low <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> retention rates across the RAN resulted {{in the number of}} trained submariners falling below 40% of that required. As an attempt to retain submariners, the RAN offered a one-off A$35,000 bonus in 1999. Other measures introduced around the same time included priority transfer of volunteers for submarine training and rotating submariners between sea and shore assignments to relieve them from continual sea service and prevent burnout. A year later, these measures had increased submariner numbers to 55% of requirements.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, due {{to further}} cuts in defence {{spending}} and an eagerness {{of the government}} to implement those recommendations that could assist in achieving this goal, units that were unable to meet attendance requirements were disbanded or amalgamated with others, thus further diffusing the community links units had established in their local areas and thus further impacting upon <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> retention. Further, {{the decision was made to}} abolish the old CMF divisions, as the role of the Army Reserve would no longer be to act as a skeleton force that would be filled out upon mobilisation, but rather a force that could provide individual sub-units of capability should the need arise to augment the Regular Army. Centralisation of training was also a result of the Millar Report; beforehand, recruit training had been an ad hoc process managed mainly by the units themselves. Other issues such as pay and conditions of service, protection of civilian employment and <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> retention were touched upon but remained largely unaddressed until more recently.|$|E

The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E

40|$|Aim. To map current {{selection}} <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> {{processes for}} newly qualified nurses {{and to explore}} the advantages and limitations of current selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> processes. Background. The need to improve current selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> practices for newly qualified nurses is highlighted in health policy internationally. Design. A cross-sectional, sequential-explanatory mixed-method design with 4 components: (1) Literature review of selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> of newly qualified nurses; and (2) Literature review of a public sector professions’ selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> processes; (3) Survey mapping existing selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> processes for newly qualified nurses; and (4) Qualitative study about recruiters’selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> processes. Methods. Literature searches on the selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> of newly qualified candidates in teaching and nursing (2005 – 2013) were conducted. Cross-sectional, mixed-method {{data were collected from}} thirty-one (n = 31) individuals in health providers in London who had responsibility for the selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> of newly qualified nurses using a survey instrument. Of these providers who took part, six (n = 6) purposively selected to be interviewed qualitatively. Results. Issues of supply and demand in the workforce, rather than selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> tools, predominated in the literature reviews. Examples of tools to measure values, attitudes and skills were found in the nursing literature. The mapping exercise found that providers used many selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> tools, some providers combined tools to streamline process and assure quality of candidates. Conclusions. Most providers had processes which addressed the issue of quality in the selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> of newly qualified nurses. The ‘assessment centre model’, which providers were adopting, allowed for multiple levels of assessment <b>and</b> streamlined <b>recruitment.</b> There is a need to validate the efficacy of the selection tools...|$|R
5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> retention, the growth in the proportion of female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. As of 30 June 2016, women made up 15.5% of the ADF's permanent force and 16.6% of reservists. The proportion of women in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the proportion of service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> continued participation.|$|E

5|$|In 1855, Nova Scotia {{politician}} Joseph Howe {{developed a}} plan to use Melville Island as a <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> training centre for American soldiers {{to fight for the}} British in the Crimean War. US neutrality laws prevented Americans from participating in overseas wars, so recruiters sent to the US advertised for men to work on the Nova Scotia Railway, and faced arrest if their true purpose was discovered. Upon arrival in Halifax, the men were sent to Melville Island for enlistment and basic training. The first group of 66 men arrived on 6 April 1855, but all refused to join the British Foreign Legion. However, by the end of May there were 71 newly recruited soldiers on the peninsula, and up to 158 total had enlisted. American discontent with the project forced its abandonment in June; the Melville Island depot closed, and the recruits were sent first to Halifax and then to England. Overall the recruitment project enlisted between 500 and 700 men, mostly German and Irish nationals.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Swabian League had {{completed}} its <b>recruitment,</b> <b>and</b> undertook {{a raid on}} Dornach on March 22, but suffered a defeat against numerically inferior Swiss troops {{in the battle of}} Bruderholz that same evening. In early April, both sides raided each other's territories along the Rhine; the Swiss conquered the villages of Hallau and Neunkirch in the Klettgau west of Schaffhausen. A larger attack of the Swabian League took place on April 11, 1499: the Swabian troops occupied and plundered some villages on the southern shore of Lake Constance, just south of Constance. The expedition ended in a shameful defeat and open flight when the Swiss soldiers, who had their main camp just a few miles south at Schwaderloh, arrived and met the Swabians in the battle of Schwaderloh. The Swabians lost more than 1,000 soldiers; 130 from the city of Constance alone; and the Swiss captured their heavy equipment, including their artillery.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E

However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire.

5|$|The British Army during World War I could trace its {{organisation}} to {{the increasing}} demands of imperial expansion. The framework was the voluntary system of <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> the regimental system, which had been defined by the Cardwell and Childers Reforms of the late 19th century. The British Army had been prepared and primarily called upon for Empire matters and the ensuing colonial wars. In {{the last years of}} the 19th century, the Army was involved in a major conflict, the Second Boer War (1899–1902), which highlighted shortcomings in its tactics, leadership and administration. The 1904 Esher Report recommended radical reform, such as the creation of an Army Council, a General Staff, the abolition of the office of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, {{and the creation of a}} Chief of the General Staff. The Haldane Reforms of 1907 formally created an Expeditionary Force of seven divisions (one cavalry, six infantry), reorganised the volunteers into a new Territorial Force of fourteen cavalry brigades and fourteen infantry divisions, and changed the old militia into the Special Reserve to reinforce the expeditionary force.|$|E
