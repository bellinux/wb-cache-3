5|$|In 1825, Clark {{was elected}} to fill the U.S. House seat left vacant by the {{elevation}} of Henry Clay to Secretary of State. He was twice re-elected, and chaired the Committee on Territories. He refused <b>re-nomination</b> in 1831.|$|E
5|$|Lamont won {{the primary}} with 51.79 {{percent of the}} vote as opposed to Lieberman's 48.21 percent; it was the only Senate race in 2006 where an {{incumbent}} lost <b>re-nomination.</b> In his concession speech, Lieberman announced that he would stand by his prior statements that he'd run as an independent if he lost the Democratic primary. Lieberman won the general election with approximately 50 {{percent of the vote}}; exit polls showed that Lieberman won the vote of 33 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of independents, and 70 percent of Republicans.|$|E
5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve <b>re-nomination,</b> {{as he was}} convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E
5|$|Governor John P. Richardson {{had been}} elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought <b>re-nomination,</b> to be met with {{opposition}} from Tillman's farmers. As {{had been done to}} Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman was a highly talented stump speaker, and when given the opportunity to debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, a gambler and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, which turned down Tillman's demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson's nomination be made unanimous.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, Breckinridge favored Pierce's <b>re-nomination</b> for president. When Pierce's hopes of securing the nomination faltered, Breckinridge joined other erstwhile Pierce backers by throwing his support behind his friend, Stephen Douglas. Even with this additional support, Douglas was still unable to garner {{a majority of the}} delegates' votes, and he withdrew, leaving James Buchanan as the Democratic nominee. William Alexander Richardson, a Kentucky-born Congressman from Illinois, then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice-president would balance Buchanan's ticket and placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. A delegate from Louisiana placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker Linn Boyd, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{had long}} seen a Senate seat as a logical next step once he {{concluded}} {{his time as}} governor. Senator Butler, whose term expired in March 1895, had soon after the 1890 election begun to shift his positions towards Tillman's, hoping to retain Conservative backing while appealing to the governor's supporters. The senator signed on to most demands of the Farmers' Alliance, and {{did not support the}} forces trying to prevent Tillman's <b>re-nomination</b> in 1892. Butler's seeming apostasy disheartened Conservatives, who did not bother to run candidates for the legislature in many counties in 1894, abandoning the field (and Butler's Senate seat) to the Tillmanites. The governor took nothing for granted, seeing to it that popular candidates, loyal to him, ran for the legislature. In addition to electing Tillman to the Senate, these legislators could help preserve his gubernatorial legacy, including the dispensary.|$|E
25|$|In the Republican primary, he {{had five}} opponents file against him. He won <b>re-nomination</b> with just 55% of the vote. In the general election, he {{defeated}} Democratic nominee Keith Allred 59%–33%.|$|E
25|$|Crownover won <b>re-nomination</b> in the Republican primary {{election}} held on March 4, 2014. With a low turnout, she received 6,001 votes (54.9 percent) and defeated conservative challenger Read King, who polled 4,937 votes (45.1 percent).|$|E
25|$|As vice president, Quayle made {{official}} {{visits to}} 47 countries and was appointed {{chairman of the}} National Space Council. He secured <b>re-nomination</b> for vice-president in 1992, but Democrat Bill Clinton and his vice presidential running mate, Al Gore, defeated the Bush/Quayle ticket.|$|E
25|$|Johnson handily won <b>re-nomination</b> to his 12th full term, twelfth full term, in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4. He polled 30,943 votes (80.5 percent); two challengers, Josh Loveless and Harry Pierce, {{held the}} {{remaining}} combined 19.5 {{percent of the}} votes cast.|$|E
25|$|He {{served as}} a Democratic Representative {{in the last two}} {{sessions}} of the Fifth and last Legislative Assembly of the Wisconsin Territory, and {{as a member of the}} first two Wisconsin State Senates from the 8th District, at that time consisting of Green County. He refused <b>re-nomination</b> in 1849.|$|E
25|$|In the Republican primary on March 4, Barton won handy <b>re-nomination</b> to a sixteenth {{term in the}} U.S. House. He polled 32,579 (72.7 percent); his 2012 primary opponent, Frank Kuchar, trailed with 12,260 votes (27.3 percent). On November 4, Barton handily won {{re-election}} over Democratic opponent Cozad. Barton {{serves as}} the Dean of the Texas Delegation for the 114th Congress.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Rickreall, {{he served as}} road supervisor of Polk County in 1868. Nesmith {{was elected to the}} Forty-third Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his cousin, Joseph G. Wilson, and served from December 1, 1873, to March 3, 1875. He did not seek <b>re-nomination</b> in 1874 to the Forty-fourth Congress and returned to farming in Polk County.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson's {{successful}} {{first term}} occasioned his <b>re-nomination</b> for president by the Republican party, with George Clinton replacing Burr {{as his running}} mate. The Federalist party ran Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, John Adams' vice presidential candidate in the 1800 election. The Jefferson-Clinton ticket won overwhelmingly {{in the electoral college}} vote, by 162 to 14, promoting their achievement of a strong economy, lower taxes, and the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
25|$|Born in Chambers County, Alabama, Pepper {{established}} a legal practice in Perry, Florida {{after graduating from}} Harvard Law School. After serving a single term in the Florida House of Representatives, Pepper won a 1936 special election to succeed Senator Duncan U. Fletcher. Pepper {{became one of the}} most prominent liberals in Congress, supporting legislation such as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. After World War II, Pepper's conciliatory views towards the Soviet Union and opposition to President Harry Truman's 1948 <b>re-nomination</b> engendered opposition within the party. Pepper lost the 1950 Senate Democratic primary to Congressman George Smathers and returned to private legal practice the following year.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Washington {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives in Illinois's 1st congressional district. He {{defeated}} incumbent Representative Bennett Stewart in the Democratic primary. Anticipating that the Democratic Party would challenge him in his bid for <b>re-nomination</b> in 1982, Washington spent much of his first term campaigning for re-election, often travelling back to Chicago to campaign. Washington missed many House votes, an issue that would come up in his campaign for mayor in 1983. Washington's major congressional accomplishment involved legislation to extend the Voting Rights Act, legislation that opponents had argued was only necessary in an emergency. Others, including Congressman Henry Hyde, had submitted amendments designed to seriously weaken the power of the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{economic}} calamity facing {{the nation and}} his dim hopes for re-election, Hoover faced little opposition for <b>re-nomination</b> at the 1932 Republican National Convention. Some Republicans talked of nominating Coolidge, former Vice President Charles Dawes, or Senator Hiram Johnson, but all passed on the opportunity to challenge Hoover. Curtis was re-nominated as Hoover's running mate. Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidential nomination on the third ballot of the 1932 Democratic National Convention, defeating the 1928 Democratic nominee, Al Smith. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner was nominated as Roosevelt's running mate. By 1932, the radio was in 12 million homes, changing the nature of presidential campaigns. No longer could presidents change {{the content of their}} speeches for each audience; anyone with a radio could listen to every major speech.|$|E
25|$|The 1924 Republican National Convention {{nominated}} President Calvin Coolidge without opposition. After Frank Lowden {{declined the}} vice presidential nomination, the convention chose Dawes as Coolidge's running mate. The Republican ticket won the 1924 presidential election and Dawes {{was sworn in as}} vice president in 1925. Dawes helped pass the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill in Congress, but the bill was vetoed by President Coolidge. Dawes was a candidate for <b>re-nomination</b> at the 1928 Republican National Convention, but Coolidge's opposition to Dawes helped ensure that Charles Curtis was nominated for the vice presidency instead. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover appointed Dawes to be the Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Dawes also briefly led the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which organized a government response to the Great Depression. He resigned from that position in 1932 to return to banking, and he died in 1951 of coronary thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|While some Democrats {{had opposed}} Roosevelt's {{nomination}} in 1940, the president faced little difficulty in securing his <b>re-nomination</b> at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. Roosevelt {{made it clear}} before the convention that he was seeking another term, and on the lone presidential ballot of the convention Roosevelt won {{the vast majority of}} delegates, although a minority of Southern Democrats voted for Harry F. Byrd. Party leaders prevailed upon Roosevelt to drop Vice President Wallace from the ticket, believing him to be an electoral liability and a poor potential successor in case of Roosevelt'd death. Roosevelt preferred Byrnes as Wallace's replacement but was convinced to support Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party. On the second vice presidential ballot of the convention, Truman defeated Wallace to win the nomination.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{appointed}} Wallace as his Secretary of Agriculture. Though {{raised a}} Republican, Wallace joined the Democratic Party in 1936. As Agriculture Secretary, Wallace sought to raise farm prices {{and supported the}} ever-normal granary concept. After Roosevelt dumped John Nance Garner from the ticket in 1940, he selected Wallace {{as his running mate}} in his bid for an unprecedented third term. The selection of the liberal Wallace upset many Democratic delegates, and Wallace was only nominated by the 1940 Democratic National Convention after Roosevelt threatened to decline the presidential nomination. The ticket of Roosevelt and Wallace defeated the Republican ticket in the 1940 election, and Wallace was sworn in as vice president in 1941. As Wallace remained unpopular with many Democratic leaders, the 1944 Democratic National Convention denied Wallace <b>re-nomination</b> and instead selected Harry S. Truman as Roosevelt's running mate in the 1944 presidential election. Roosevelt appointed Wallace to the position of Secretary of Commerce in March 1945 and Wallace continued to serve under President Truman after Roosevelt died in April 1945.|$|E
25|$|Though 8 {{million workers}} {{remained}} unemployed in 1936, economic conditions had improved since 1932 and Roosevelt was widely popular. An attempt by Huey Long and other individuals {{to organize a}} left-wing alternative to the Democratic Party collapsed after Long's death in 1935. Roosevelt won <b>re-nomination</b> with little opposition at the 1936 Democratic National Convention, while his allies overcame Southern resistance to permanently abolish the long-established rule that had required Democratic presidential candidates to win the votes of two-thirds of the delegates rather than a simple majority. The Republicans nominated Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a well-respected but bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover. While Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs and continued to attack Hoover, Landon sought to win voters who approved {{of the goals of}} the New Deal but disagreed with its implementation. In the 1936 presidential election, Roosevelt and Garner won 60.8% of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont. The Democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the popular vote and the electoral vote since the 1820 presidential election. Congressional Democrats also expanded their majorities, winning control of over three-quarters of the seats in both houses of Congress. The election also saw the consolidation of the New Deal coalition; while the Democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business, they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic {{for the first time since}} the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|By late 1898, Hobart {{had fallen}} ill {{with a serious}} heart ailment, which he at first {{concealed}} from the public. [...] He continued Senate duty, but nearly collapsed after delivering an address closing the session. [...] He accompanied the President on a vacation trip to Hanna's winter home in Thomasville, Georgia, but quickly contracted the flu and returned to Washington. [...] By April 1899, Hobart's illness was {{well known in the}} press, though Hanna assured the newspapers that Hobart would be on the ticket in 1900: [...] "nothing but death or an earthquake can stop the <b>re-nomination</b> of Vice President Hobart". [...] Hobart rented a home in his birthplace of Long Branch, then an upscale Jersey Shore resort. [...] Doctors prescribed complete rest, and the Vice President amused himself by feeding two pet fish, a gold one named McKinley and a silver one named Bryan.|$|E
500|$|In 1884, Hanna sought {{election}} as a {{delegate to the}} Republican National Convention {{in support of the}} presidential bid of Senator Sherman (as he was by then)—President Chester A. Arthur, Garfield's successor, was seeking <b>re-nomination,</b> but was opposed by a number of other Republicans [...] Hanna supported Sherman as the candidate favored the gold standard [...] and worked to solve the problems of business, and because he was from Ohio. The industrialist was successfully opposed by Cowles at the local convention, but was elected a delegate at-large from Ohio at the state convention. At the national convention, Hanna joined forces in support of Sherman with another delegate at-large from Ohio, former Cincinnati judge Joseph B. Foraker, whose rise in state and national politics over the next 20years would parallel Hanna's. [...] The Ohio delegation proved bitterly divided between supporters of Sherman and those supporting Maine Senator James G. Blaine. [...] Foraker gained national acclaim with his speech nominating Sherman, and Hanna worked for the senator's nomination, but Blaine won easily. [...] With a non-Ohioan the nominee, Hanna worked less energetically for the Republicans than he had in 1880. [...] Blaine lost to the Democratic candidate, New York Governor Grover Cleveland.|$|E
500|$|Tillman {{had been}} re-elected in 1901 and 1907. By 1912, the Democratic nominee, {{who would be}} elected by the {{overwhelming}} Democratic majority in the legislature, was determined by a primary. A primary was also used for governor, and Tillman ran {{at the same time}} as Governor Cole Blease, who also sought re-election. Blease, also an outspoken white supremacist, had entered politics as a Tillmanite legislator in 1890, and breaking from him, adopted similar techniques to Tillman's to appeal to poor farm workers and mill hands. Tillman faced two opponents in his <b>re-nomination</b> bid—his control over South Carolina politics had deteriorated over the years, and he had moved towards the Conservatives. He had not endorsed Blease in 1910. The two men reached an agreement that Tillman would remain neutral in the governor's race in 1912, but Tillman became convinced Blease could not win against former state chief justice Ira B. Jones. Both sides claimed to have letters from Tillman endorsing their candidate, but three days before the primary, Tillman condemned Blease and endorsed Jones. Blease, outraged, alleged betrayal, accused Tillman of [...] "insane jealousy", and said of the senator, [...] "possibly his mind has become more diseased of late than it was when I had my last talk with his confidential physician". Both men were re-elected.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Mayor Joseph P. Keating {{resigned}} {{after losing}} {{his bid for}} <b>re-nomination.</b> The city council appointed the first female mayor in the city’s history (Donna McFadden-Connors) to serve out the remainder of Keating's term. She was later succeeded in 2010 by the youngest mayor in the city’s history (Jason C. Klush).|$|E
2500|$|McCloskey {{sought the}} 1972 Republican Presidential {{nomination}} on a pro-peace/anti-Vietnam War platform, and obtained 11% {{of the vote}} against incumbent President Richard M. Nixon in the New Hampshire primary. [...] At the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, Rep. McCloskey received one vote (out of 1324) from a New Mexico delegate. [...] All other votes cast went to President Nixon, which technically meant that McCloskey finished {{second place in the}} race for the Presidential nomination. [...] Congressman John Ashbrook of Ohio had also challenged President Nixon's bid for <b>re-nomination,</b> albeit on a conservative platform.|$|E
2500|$|At the July 1940 Democratic Convention in Chicago, Roosevelt easily swept aside {{challenges}} from Farley and Vice President Garner, {{who had turned}} against Roosevelt {{in his second term}} because of his liberal economic and social policies. As a result, Roosevelt decided to pick a new running mate, Henry A. Wallace from Iowa, his Secretary of Agriculture and an outspoken liberal. That choice was strenuously opposed by many of the party's conservatives, who felt Wallace was too radical and [...] "eccentric" [...] in his private life to be an effective running mate. But Roosevelt insisted that without Wallace on the ticket he would decline <b>re-nomination,</b> and Wallace won the vice-presidential nomination, defeating Speaker of the House William B. Bankhead and other candidates.|$|E
2500|$|Deciding to {{give the}} 10th another go, Williams was unopposed in the 2008 Democratic primary to face Valihura once more. [...] His {{campaign}} was built around 'fiscal responsibility, economic development, education, senior citizens, and constituent services'. [...] In what was described as 'one of election night’s biggest upsets', Williams went on to defeat Valihura 51% to 49%, aided by an increased number of registered Democrats compared to years past, coupled with a higher Democratic turnout owing to the concurrent U.S. presidential election. Williams ran for re-election in 2010, securing a massive majority in the Democratic primary against an opponent who said he secured <b>re-nomination</b> on an environmental and base-pleasing platform, [...] and upped {{his share of the}} vote from 2008 to win the general election.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell {{was elected}} in the 1988 federal {{election}} as the member of parliament (MP) from Vancouver Centre. [...] She won the party nomination after the incumbent, Pat Carney, declined to stand for <b>re-nomination.</b> In 1989 she {{was appointed to the}} cabinet as Minister of State (Indian Affairs and Northern Development). [...] From 1990–1993 she held the post of Minister of Justice and Attorney General where she oversaw notable amendments to the Criminal Code in the areas of firearms control and sexual assault. [...] In 1990, following the Supreme Court's decision invalidating the country's abortion law, Campbell was responsible for introducing Bill C-43 to govern abortions in Canada. Although it passed the House of Commons, it failed to pass the Senate, and as of 2017 there is no national law governing abortions.|$|E
2500|$|Nixon was {{a popular}} {{incumbent}} president in 1972, as he was credited with achieving détente with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, polls showed that he held a strong lead in the Republican primaries. He was challenged in the primaries by Pete McCloskey from California, who ran as an anti-war candidate, and John Ashbrook, who opposed Nixon's détente policy. In the New Hampshire primary McCloskey garnered 19.8% of the vote to Nixon’s 67.6%, with Ashbrook receiving 9.7%. The president's <b>re-nomination</b> was never in doubt after that. At the Republican National Convention that August he received 1,347 of the 1,348 votes on the first ballot (McCloskey received one). Delegates also re-nominated Spiro Agnew by acclamation. Throughout the convention chanted [...] "Four more years! Four more years!" ...|$|E
2500|$|To keep a {{majority}} of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of [...] "family values that excluded single mothers." [...] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas. By then, Watts had become involved in a contest {{with other members of}} the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington, but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family. He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms. Watts won <b>re-nomination</b> with 81percent against James Odom and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1917, when Germany had resumed {{unrestricted}} submarine {{warfare and}} sent the Zimmermann Telegram, Wilson asked Congress to declare war {{in order to make}} [...] "the world safe for democracy." [...] The United States conducted military operations alongside the Allies, although without a formal alliance. During the war, Wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations, leaving military strategy to the generals, especially General John J. Pershing. Through the Selective Service Act, conscription sent 10,000 freshly trained soldiers to France per day by the summer of 1918. On the home front, he raised income taxes, borrowing billions of dollars through the public's purchase of Liberty Bonds. He set up the War Industries Board, promoted labor union cooperation, regulated agriculture and food production through the Lever Act, and took direct control of the nation's railroad system. Wilson asked Congress for what became the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, suppressing anti-draft activists. The crackdown was intensified by his Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to include expulsion of non-citizen radicals during the First Red Scare of 1919–1920. Early in 1918, Wilson issued his principles {{for an end to the}} war, the Fourteen Points, and in 1919, following an armistice, he traveled to Paris, promoting the formation of a League of Nations and concluding the Treaty of Versailles. Following his return from Europe, Wilson embarked on a nationwide tour in 1919 to campaign for the treaty, but suffered a severe stroke. The treaty was met with serious concern by Senate Republicans, and the Senate ultimately rejected the treaty. Due to his stroke, Wilson secluded himself in the White House, disability having diminished his power and influence, and he failed in his bid to win <b>re-nomination</b> at the 1920 Democratic National Convention. Wilson retired at the end of his presidency, and he died in 1924.|$|E
60|$|The tall, large {{figure of}} Mr. ------ {{has a certain}} air of state and dignity; he carries {{his head in a}} very awkward way, but still looks like a man of long and high authority, and, with his white hair, is now quite venerable. There is {{certainly}} a lack of polish, a kind of rusticity, notwithstanding which you feel him to be a man of the world. I should think he might succeed very tolerably in English society, being heavy and sensible, cool, kindly, and good-humored, {{with a great deal of}} experience of life. We talked about various matters, politics among the rest; and he observed that if the President had taken the advice which he gave him in two long letters, before his inauguration, he would have had a perfectly quiet and successful term of office. The advice was, to form a perfectly homogeneous cabinet of Union men, and to satisfy the extremes of the party by a fair distribution of minor offices; whereas he formed his cabinet of extreme men, on both sides, and gave the minor offices to moderate ones. But the antislavery people, surely, had no representative in the cabinet. Mr. ------ further observed, that he thought the President had a fair chance of <b>re-nomination,</b> for that the South could not, in honor, desert him; to which I replied that the South had been guilty of such things heretofore. Mr. ------ thinks that the next Presidential term will be more important and critical, both as to our foreign relations and internal affairs, than any preceding one,--which I should judge likely enough to be the case, although I heard the sane prophecy often made respecting the present term.|$|E
