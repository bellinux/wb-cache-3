Multiple pulses of laser radiation at 248 nm {{were used to}} alter {{the composition of the}} surface alloy. Hardness and modulus were not significantly affected by the treatment, but friction in dry sliding against an alumina pin was reduced.

Greater reductions in friction were obtained from a Ti rich <b>surface</b> <b>layer</b> formed by laser mixing an evaporated Ti layer into the material. The friction coefficient of the Ti alloyed surface deteriorated after approximately 1000 cycles, indicating wear=through of the modified surface.
