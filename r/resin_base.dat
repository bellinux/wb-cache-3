50|$|As part of {{the wider}} debate over the safety of {{bisphenol}} A (BPA), concerns have been raised {{over the use of}} <b>resin</b> <b>based</b> sealants. BPA is a xenoestrogen, i.e. it mimics the relative bioactivity of estrogen, a female sex hormone. Pure BPA is rarely present in dental sealants, however they may contain BPA derivatives. There is very little research about the potential estrogen-like effects of BPA derivatives. A transient presence of BPA in saliva has been reported immediately following placement of some <b>resin</b> <b>based</b> sealants. The longest duration of salivary BPA was 3 hours after placement, so there is little risk of chronic low-dose BPA exposure. The currently available evidence suggests that there is no risk of estrogen-like side effects with <b>resin</b> <b>based</b> sealants. Several national dental organizations have published position statements regarding the safety of <b>resin</b> <b>based</b> dental materials, e.g. the American Dental Association, the Australian Dental Association, the British Dental Association, and the Canadian Dental Association.|$|R

50|$|Just {{as china}} {{is a common}} name for porcelain, japanning is an old name to {{describe}} the European technique to imitate Asian lacquerware. As Asian lacquer work became popular in England, France, the Netherlands, and Spain in the 17th century the Europeans developed imitations that were effectively a different technique of lacquering. The European technique, which is used on furniture and other objects, uses finishes that have a <b>resin</b> <b>base</b> similar to shellac. The technique, which became known as japanning, involves applying several coats of varnish which are each heat-dried and polished. In the 18th century, this type of lacquering gained a large popular following. Although traditionally a pottery and wood coating, japanning was the popular (mostly black) coating of the accelerating metalware industry. By the twentieth century, the term was freely applied to coatings based on various varnishes and lacquers besides the traditional shellac.|$|E
5000|$|A {{diamond plate}} is a steel plate, {{sometimes}} {{mounted on a}} plastic or <b>resin</b> <b>base,</b> coated with diamond grit, an abrasive that will grind metal. When they are mounted they are sometimes known as diamond stones. [...] The plate may {{have a series of}} holes cut in it that capture the swarf cast off as grinding takes place, and cuts costs by reducing the amount of abrasive surface area on each plate. Diamond plates can serve many purposes including sharpening steel tools, and for maintaining the flatness of man-made waterstones, which can become grooved or hollowed in use. Truing (flattening a stone whose shape has been changed as it wears away) is widely considered essential to the sharpening process but some hand sharpening techniques utilise the high points of a non-true stone. As the only part of a diamond plate to wear away is a very thin coating of grit and adhesive, and in a good diamond plate this wear is minimal due to diamond's hardness, a diamond plate retains its flatness. Rubbing the diamond plate on a whetstone to true (flatten) the whetstone is a modern alternative to more traditional truing methods.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented thesis was the development of photopolymerizable systems, which allow the production of parts with elastic properties {{by means of a}} stereolitography apparatus. For that purpose three basically different systems have been investigated regarding their suitability for the desired purpose: A. <b>resins</b> <b>based</b> on siloxane macromonomers B. <b>resins</b> <b>based</b> on oligomeric butadiene and C. <b>resins</b> <b>based</b> on monomeric acrylates and methacrylates By means of photopolymerisation polymers with the desired elastic properties have been created using resins of the type A and C. Elongation at break values of up to 155 % were achieved using e. g. methacryloxy-propyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane / n-hexylmethacrylate / ethylenglycol-dimethacrylate / 2 -dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate. It wasn't possible to get the desired elastomeric products using resins of type B. The resins on siloxane basis proofed to be reacting to sluggish for the use in a stereolithography apparatus. The acrylate resins on the other hand polymerized fast enough for the stereolithography environment. Using an acrylate <b>resin</b> <b>based</b> on 2 -hydroxyethylacrylate / n-decyl-methacrylate / ethylenglycoldimethacrylate experiments have been carried out to write a quadratic structure in a stereolithography apparatus.

30|$|Full arch {{prosthesis}} is one {{alternative to}} rehabilitate edentulous patients. This prosthesis consists of artificial teeth {{mounted on a}} mucus supported acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>base</b> with the purpose to restore aesthetics, phonetics and mastication [1]. During chewing, the stresses induced in the denture may cause injury to the support tissue, if equilibrium conditions suitable for occlusal adjustment are not created [2]. The most common material used for artificial teeth is acrylic resin with acceptable mechanical properties and durability [3]. Acrylic resin is easily adjusted and concentrates less stress compared to ceramic teeth [4]. Furthermore, there is a chemical interaction between the <b>resin</b> <b>base</b> and artificial teeth [3]. Regarding disadvantages, acrylic resin artificial teeth exhibit often-occlusal wear, which leads to decreased masticatory efficiency and loss of vertical dimension [5].They also present clinical problems, as they suffer remolding of worn occlusal surfaces in denture teeth [5, 6], and fractures or debonding from the prosthesis base [7].|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of cavity depth, ceramic thickness, and resin bases with different elastic modulus on von Mises stress patterns of ceramic inlays. Tridimensional geometric models were developed with SolidWorks image software. The differences between the models were: depth of pulpal wall, ceramic thickness, and presence of composite bases with different thickness and elastic modulus. The geometric models were constrained at the proximal surfaces and base of maxillary bone. A load of 100 N was applied. The stress distribution pattern was analyzed with von Mises stress diagrams. The maximum von Mises stress values ranged from 176 MPa to 263 MPa and varied among the 3 D-models. The highest von Mises stress value was found on models with 1 -mm-thick composite <b>resin</b> <b>base</b> and 1 -mm-thick ceramic inlay. Intermediate values (249 - 250 MPa) occurred on models with 2 -mm-thick composite <b>resin</b> <b>base</b> and 1 -mm-thick ceramic inlay and 1 -mm-thick composite <b>resin</b> <b>base</b> and 2 -mm-thick ceramic inlay. The lowest values were observed on models restored exclusively with ceramic inlay (176 MPa to 182 MPa). It was found that thicker inlays distribute stress more favorably and bases with low elastic modulus increase stress concentrations on the internal surface of the ceramic inlay. The increase of ceramic thickness tends to present more favorable stress distribution, especially when bonded directly onto the cavity without the use of supporting materials. When the use of a composite base is required, composite resin with high elastic modulus and reduced thickness should be preferred...|$|E
