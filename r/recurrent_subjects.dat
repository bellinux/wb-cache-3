50|$|The work of Vinyoli {{is that of}} a self-taught writer. Initially {{very much}} {{influenced}} by the poetic language of German symbolism (Hölderlin, Goethe and Rilke, whose verse Vinyoli translated into Catalan), he afterwards leaned more and more towards the sort of realism that is capable of using everyday language to offer a distinctive vision of the human condition. The <b>recurrent</b> <b>subjects</b> of his poetry are love, the fleetingness of time and memory. His meditation is not so much on death -and in this he differs from Espriu- as on mutability: the way in which all things pass away, are lost, and become part of memory.|$|E

40|$|Background: The common {{detoxification}} {{method is}} replacement of long effect opiate by short effect opiate and then reducing its amount gradually. More modern method is ultra rapid opiate detoxification (UROD) by opiate antagonists, which is performed by general anesthesia. The advantages of two methods {{have not been}} confirmed. This study aimed to compare effectiveness and withdrawal rate in both methods following up to a year. Methods: 211 self-introduced patients who referred to Farabi hospital for withdrawal were enrolled in this cross sectional study during 2005 - 06. The patients underwent detoxification after psychiatry screening and addiction confirmation. They divided into two detoxified method groups (110 patients in UROD and 101 Methadone). Recurrent and suspected cases were confirmed or rejected by urinary test and more specific test respectively. Data was collected from available patients profiles and contacting with patients or their relatives and was analyzed using Chi-square & independent sample T-test. Results: The results showed that addiction recurrent in UROD and Methadone groups was 35. 7 % and 56. 4 % respectively (P= 0. 002). The average age of <b>recurrent</b> <b>subjects</b> in UROD group was younger than successful population at that same group (27. 95 ± 5. 2 vs. 31. 4 ± 7. 1 years old, p= 0. 008). Conclusion: This study suggested that chance of detoxification and successful withdrawal by UROD method is higher than Methadone method and younger patients {{are more likely to}} get the recurrence. It is recommended to compare these two methods in a prospective study by unifying both groups based on age and considering opiate use duration...|$|E
40|$|O respectivo trabalho tem como prisma analisar uma série de depoimentos dados por militares que participaram dos acontecimentos políticos no Brasil, que culminaram no 31 de março de 1964. Os depoentes tiveram um papel {{relevante}} durante os 21 anos de governo militar. A marca da análise fixa-se em apontamentos que mostrem dentro dos depoimentos os ressentimentos que os homens de farda expuseram em suas falas. Ressentimentos galgados principalmente no anticomunismo e na visão ruim que as forças armadas ficaram perante a sociedade após o fim do regime. O trabalho se estrutura mostrando como se iniciou no exército brasileiro o papel de uma instituição que deveria exercer uma participação política direta no país, além de se ver como a fonte da reserva moral da nação e guardiã dos preceitos de patriotismo e nacionalismo. Isso feito para mostrar que a intervenção ocorrida em 1964 não foi fruto de imediatismos ou por ordenação estrangeira em conluio com o capital nacional, onde os militares seriam meros joguetes. A intervenção precisa ser analisada a partir de uma ótica que perceba os motivos e intenções que fizeram as Forças Armadas destituírem do poder o presidente João Goulart. Dentro dos depoimentos também será analisada a questão da memória dos militares no tocante a assuntos estreitamente ligados ao período: o porquê da derrubada de João Goulart, a repressão aos opositores, a questão da tortura e outros assuntos recorrentes ao período analisado. O fechamento do trabalho vai dar-se a partir de uma análise direta nos depoimentos onde está exposto de maneira explícita ou implícita os ressentimentos dos militares no tocante aos ocorridos antes e após os acontecimentos do 31 de março de 1964 The respective {{work has}} as prism to analyze {{a series of}} testimonies given by military officers {{who participated in the}} political events in Brazil that culminated on the 31 st of March of 1964. The deponents had a relevant role during the 21 years of the military government. The goal of the analysis concentrates on notes that exhibit throughout the testimonies, the resentments that the men in uniform exposed in their words. Resentments intensified mostly in the anticommunism and in the bad reputation the military forces had before the society {{after the end of the}} regime. The work is structured in showing how it began in the Brazilian army the role of an institution that was supposed to practice a direct political participation in the country, besides seeing itself like the source of moral reserve of the nation and guardian of the precepts of patriotism and nationalism. Being this done to demonstrate that the intervention which occurred in 1964 was not a result of an immediacy or by foreign orders in collusion with the national capital, where the soldiers would be mere playthings. The intervention needs to be analyzed from an optics that realizes the motives and intentions that made the military forces deprive the president John Goulart from the power. Among the testimonies it will also be analyzed the question of the military officers memory regarding subjects directly connected to the period: the reason of the destitution of João Goulart, the repression to the opponents, the question of torture and other <b>recurrent</b> <b>subjects</b> to the analyzed period.

30|$|Bra’s {{symbolism}} {{has been}} changing throughout lingerie design history, sometimes being motive for sexual repression, sometimes for seduction. Body modeling {{was also a}} <b>recurrent</b> <b>subject</b> in the product’s history (Boucher 2008; Scott 2010; Thomas and Ormen 2010), {{but the fact that}} “filling” is not related to the choice of a bra as favorite may represent a current wish of a more natural silhouette. Therefore, sustenance overcomes the bra’s aesthetic function to determine a specific product as the user’s favorite. Aesthetic attributes were only correlated to the feeling of control over the user’s own experience (Dominance). This means that designing to trigger positive emotional experiences relies mostly on function, going against the common sense of focusing on appearance.|$|R

40|$|Political {{participation}} beyond elections is a <b>recurrent</b> <b>subject</b> in {{the analysis}} of politics at the domestic level. Since the beginning of the 1990 s, official discourses and academic research increasingly underlines the capacities of NGO participation in decision-making to reduce the major democratic deficits that have grown during the recent decades in the governance of global relations. The emergence of this participatory discourse has fundamental consequences for the strategies, the power and the organisational structures of non-state actors. We argue that this discourse has led to increasing inclusion of non-state actor participation in decision making processes. What follows is a process of professionalization and adaptation of nongovernmental non-profit actors. The aim of our contribution is to develop a conceptual framework which prepares the ground for the empirical analysis of this particular topic...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of political participation beyond elections is a <b>recurrent</b> <b>subject</b> in contemporary political life. Since {{the beginning of}} the 1990 s, official European Union documents stress the participation of a so-called ‘organised civil society', thought to lead to increased democratization of the national and international sphere. The paper starts from the assumption that this discourse has an effect on ‘civil society actors' and goes on to study the tools developed to analyze these effects, called institutionalization, bureaucratization or professionalization of the organized civil society. The political party and social movement literature has identified these changes empirically and theoretically already at {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century. The aim of this paper is to analyze these approaches and to draw lessons for the study of the transformation of civil society organizations' structures in the EU...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Control of {{atherosclerotic}} {{cardiovascular disease}} – a highly prevalent condition {{and one of the}} main causes of mortality in Brazil and worldwide – is a <b>recurrent</b> <b>subject</b> of great interest for public health. Recently, three new guidelines on dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis prevention have been published. The close release of these important publications is a good opportunity for comparison: the Brazilian model has greater sensitivity, the English model does not work with risk stratification, and the American model may be overestimating the risk. This will allow reflection on current progress and identification of controversial aspects which still require further research and debate. It is also an opportunity to discuss issues related to early diagnosis and its efficiency as a preventive strategy for atherosclerotic disease: the transformation of risk into disease, the gradual reduction of cut-off points, the limitations of the screening strategy, and the problem of overdiagnosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of political participation beyond elections is a <b>recurrent</b> <b>subject</b> in contemporary political life. Citizens, {{and even more}} so, economic and public interest groups demand to be heard by political actors, and to participate closely in decision making processes. This demand for participatory democracy has become of interest for the international and the European realm {{since the beginning of}} the 1990. The emergence of a participatory norm has, however, a very important influence on the strategies, the power and the organisational structures of the non-state actors associated at the policy making processes in the name of the participatory democracy. The aim of this contribution is to develop a conceptual and methodological framework based on sociological approaches and thus to propose some avenues for further research. These should allow for a detailed analysis of the influence of the participatory turn on the organisational structures of non-governmental actors and the actors working inside these structures...|$|R
40|$|Spanish {{political}} life is often marked by {{an exchange of}} attacks between Spanish and peripheral nationalisms. While the existence of peripheral nationalisms is widely acknowledged, Spanish nationalism is constantly denied by the political spectrum. This {{is often the case}} for most state nationalisms but it is remarkable in the case of Spanish nationalism. In Spain, the amount of research devoted to the study of peripheral nationalisms dwarfs that dedicated to Spanish nationalism. It was not until two renowned historians, Juan Pablo Fusi and Borja de Riquer, presented their opposing views {{in the pages of the}} journal Historia Social in the early 1990 s that Spanish nationalism became a <b>recurrent</b> <b>subject</b> of academic enquiry. ii Even though both historians agreed on the weakness of the Spanish state-building process in the nineteenth century, they differed on the level of resonance of Spanish nationalism vis a vis peripheral nationalisms.

40|$|The uneasy {{relationship}} between literary conception and political commitment is a <b>recurrent</b> <b>subject</b> of meditation in Julio Cortázar’s writings and amongst his critics. The debate revolves around two main considerations: firstly, {{to what extent}} and how (if so) Cortázar managed to reconcile his aesthetic ideas with his ethical views; secondly, whether this reconciliation attempt meant a paradigm change in his poetics or not. These deliberations reached a culmination point and appeared in its most illuminating form in Cortázar’s last three short story compilations; particularly in those stories where the need for political and ethical engagement articulates with the fantastic, one of the predominant narrative modes in his poetics. This article examines four of these short stories as prime examples of Cortázar’s attempt to reconcile the individual metaphysical search typical of his early writings with his later political pledges. The hypothesis is that these stories actually represent an excellent instance of how {{he was able to}} achieve a harmonic symbiosis between his poetics and his politics {{in the last years of}} his life...|$|R
