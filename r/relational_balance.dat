40|$|This paper reexamines {{the nature}} of the so－called topic in Philippine languages, {{specifically}} its topichood in Tagalog, from a cross－linguistic perspective by comparing it with that of prototypical topic in other languages such as Japanese. The study reveals that its topichood is remarkable in its non-occurrence rather than its occurrence in sentences. It is also shown that although it exhibits similarities with prototypical topic in discourse in terms of its actor-orientedness, they also exhibit significant differences. I argue that one of the difficulties in identifying {{the nature of}} the Philippine topic {{lies in the fact that}} its choice is made by the interaction ofits sentential and discourse topicality itself with an independent grammatical characteristics that penetrates into the grammar of Philippine languages in general, i. e. patient-orientedness, and the <b>relational</b> <b>balance</b> between these factors can be different depending on transitivity of verbs and the degree of grammaticalization among different Philippine languages...|$|E
40|$|One Of the {{dominant}} features {{shared by the}} Chinese living in Paris is their rich linguistic repertoire, closely related to their migratory history. As {{a function of the}} status of the language, the person or persons one is communicating with, and general practice, each language in which one is fluent conveys a whole series of connotations as to the rights and duties of the participants. Thus, the linguistic resources of the speakers operate as an effective means for the management of interpersonal relationships in social interaction, which {{can be viewed as a}} negotiation of various balances of power. The people involved are continually negotiating its vicissitudes in order to establish or reestablish the equilibrium of the <b>relational</b> <b>balance.</b> Some relationships can be established between the coexistence of linguistic varieties, their social functions, and the socio-economic situation of Chinese speakers in Paris.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the generalizability of psychological contract forms observed in the West (D. M. Rousseau, 2000) to China. Using 2 independent samples, results confirmed the generalizability of 3 psychological contract forms: transactional, <b>relational,</b> and <b>balanced.</b> This study also examined the nature of relationships of psychological contracts with organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). In particular, this study explored the role of instrumentality as a mediating psychological process. The authors found evidence that instrumentality mediates the relationship of <b>relational</b> and <b>balanced</b> forms with OCB; however, the transactional contract form {{is directly related to}} OCB. The authors discuss the implications of these results for the meaning of psychological contracts and OCB in China and raise issues for future research. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{identification}} algorithm to the freeway steady-state speed-density <b>balance</b> <b>relational</b> {{expression of the}} Markos Papageorgiou’s freeway traffic flow model. Two stages are involved. First, use the power series principle to transform this relational expression from nonlinear model into linear model. Second,use the least squares method to identify the linear model and further get all unknown parameters of the nonlinear model. So,the identification to the freeway steady-state speed-density <b>balance</b> <b>relational</b> expression can be achieved. Both theory analysis and simulation research show that,comparing with conventional nonlinear identification algorithm,this algorithm highly improves operating speed of model identification and can achieve arbitrary identification accuracy.

Continued scientific and technological progresses which were reached by medicine in recent years, and particularly oncologic clinical discoveries, increased the chance of not only survival but also healing. Nevertheless, cancer diagnosis is still a hard existential text that destabilizes everyday life, all the psychic and <b>relational</b> <b>balance,</b> inevitably causing a psychological and social change {{not only in the}} patient who is affected but also into the wide social network around him (family, friends, doctors, healthcare team). The aim of this review is to understand how problems, feelings, emotions, distresses or defense mechanisms could garble the relation and the communication dynamics between physician and patients and then prejudicing the efficacy of oncologic therapeutic compliance. Pubmed and Scopus were searched, using strings related to "cancer", "physician-patient relations", burn-out", "compliance", and "communication", identifying literature published from 2000 to January 2015. Extracted papers were assessed for their relevance (10 of 412 papers initially reviewed). Results indicate that a good and empathetic relationship between physician and patient were related to good therapeutic adherence. In particular, a good physician-patient relation maximizes the impact of clinical therapies and reduces psychophysical implications...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{alternate}} {{understandings of the}} <b>relational</b> <b>balance</b> between human activity and global eco-systems. This general understanding shall be conveyed as the ‘problem’ and ‘problem-solution’ for the reason of abstraction from conceptual limitation.  However, also capable of mutation and metamorphosis in terms of meaning, the ‘problem’ concept retains in essence the understanding of imbalance between human activity and the global eco-system. Via this tool, the thesis journeys on through various interpretations of the ‘problem’, from a more theoretical set to more practical interpretations with an ‘operationalization’ of one such interpretation at the business level. Simultaneously, the thesis makes use of a Genealogical and Archaeological method of analysis. Therefore, the thesis does not attest to any chronological master narrative, where one event necessarily follows on from another. This thesis seeks to reject that idea, the purpose of which is both to keep a distance and merge with the discourse itself, and to reveal the emergence of three ‘dominant’ power structures of {{the interpretation of the}} ‘problem’. In so doing the author is able to reveal several interpretations, reinterpretations of the ‘problem’, as well as the effect lesser power structures have on the various dominant power structures throughout instances in time. Furthermore, this method is able to incorporate a grand scale perspective on the ‘problem’ idea, which serves as an excellent base from which to assess, analyze and reveal assumptions, gaps and contradictions of the various power structures. Consequently the thesis is able to provide calculated solutions on a theoretical level that does not remain one-dimensional but multi-dimensional. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} the study of snails in the genus Cepaea is briefly outlined. Cepaea nemoralis and C. hortensis are {{polymorphic}} for genetically controlled shell colour and banding, which has been the main interest of the work covered. Random drift, selective predation and climatic selection, both at a macro- and micro-scale, all affect gene frequency. The usual approach to understanding maintenance of the polymorphism, has been to look for centripetal effects on frequency. Possible processes include balance of mutation pressure and drift, heterozygote advantage, <b>relational</b> <b>balance</b> heterosis, frequency-dependent predation, multi-niche selective balance, or some combination of these. Mutational balance is overlaid by more substantial forces. There is some evidence for heterosis. Predation by birds may protect the polymorphism, and act apostatically to favour distinct morphs. Although not substantiated for Cepaea, many studies show that predators behave in the appropriate manner, while shell colour polymorphisms in molluscs occur most commonly in species exposed to visually searching predators. It is not known whether different thermal properties of the shells help to generate equilibria. Migration between colonies is probably greater than originally thought. The present geographical range has been occupied for less than 5000 generations. Climatic and human modification alter snail habitats relatively rapidly, which in turn changes selection pressures. A simple simulation shows that migration coupled with selection which fluctuates but is not centripetal, may retain polymorphism for sufficiently long to account for the patterns we see today. There may therefore be a two-stage basis to the polymorphism, comprising long-term but weak balancing forces coupled with fluctuating selection which does not necessarily balance but results in very slow elimination. Persistence of genetic variants in this way may provide the conditions for evolution of a balanced genome...|$|E
40|$|Human {{resource}} practices {{represent a}} major mechanism for implementing a firm’s strategic plan. These practices create a distinct type of relationship between employee and employer {{which can be}} characterised as psychological contracts, that is, the belief people hold regarding the terms of their employment relationship (Rousseau and Wade-Benzoni, 1994). The purpose of the research {{was to examine the}} type of psychological contracts that exist within an organisation and show the impact of human resource strategies and practices on the different contracts. Human resource practices {{play a significant role in}} building the psychological contract that supports the strategy. This could help organisations to allocate investments accordingly, especially in difficult times. This research was carried out amongst knowledge workers, with a 32 % response rate. The findings reveal that it is important for the employer to realise that employees perceive themselves as contributing more than the employer to the relationship. It further highlights supervision as a dimension for establishing <b>relational</b> and <b>balanced</b> contracts. Training and development is perceived as the most important human resource practice for developing <b>relational</b> and <b>balanced</b> contracts. A model was developed to show organisations the impact of human resource practices on the psychological contract. It also depicts how investment should increase within the different human resource practices and how this translates to organisational performance.

40|$|The {{psychological}} contract {{provides a}} framework for understanding the relationship between employees and employers. The objective of the research {{was to determine the}} type of psychological contract developed by higher education academics. In addition, the research objective was to examine the effect of employees’ perception of the human resource practices of their employers on their psychological contract. There {{have been a number of}} conceptual and empirical studies on the psychological contract of employees and its relationships to other organisational variables such as human resource practices. However, there has been minimal research on the psychological contracts of academics in higher education and the effect of human resource practices on their psychological contracts. The research was based on a cross-sectional survey that comprised the Psychological Contract Inventory (Rousseau, 2000), the Human Resource Practice Scale (Geringer et al., 2002), and questions on the demographic and job characteristics of academics as employees in the higher education sector in Canada. The research involved 405 academics from Canadian higher education institutions. The response rate was 70 %. The research found that employees’ perception of the recruitment and selection, training and development and compensation and benefits HR practices had significant and positive effects on the <b>relational</b> and <b>balanced</b> psychological contracts of academics, thereby building commitment, loyalty and the desire for professional and career development. The training and development HR practices were found to have the strongest positive effect on the <b>relational</b> and <b>balanced</b> types of psychological contracts.

40|$|Feature-based {{measures}} have been suggested {{as a solution to}} some of the many issues associated with measuring psychological contracts. This study involved the refinement of an existing feature-based measure, including adding and rewriting items, to provide a concise but comprehensive and generalizable measure of transactional and relational psychological contracts. Data were collected from an online sample of full-time employees. Analyses revealed three main psychological contract feature dimensions (transactional, individual relational, and group relational) clustered into three contract types (predominantly transactional, predominantly <b>relational,</b> and <b>balanced).</b> Moreover, the balanced contract type had the highest mean score on positive workplace outcome variables, such as commitment, engagement, and organizational citizenship behaviours. The predominantly transactional contract type had the lowest mean score for each of these variables, as well as the highest mean score for turnover intentions.

40|$|ORIENTATION: Human {{resource}} practices {{influence the}} psychological contract between employee and employer and, ultimately, organisational performance. RESEARCH PURPOSE: The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the effect of human resource practices on the types of psychological contracts in an iron ore mining company in South Africa empirically. MOTIVATION FOR THE STUDY: Although there have been a number of conceptual studies on the effect of human resource practices on psychological contracts, there has been no effort to synthesise the links between these contracts and various human resource practices systematically. This study endeavoured to provide quantitative evidence to verify or refute conceptual studies on this relationship. Its findings could inform human resource strategies and, ultimately, the prioritisation of human resource practices to improve the cost-effective allocation of resources. RESEARCH DESIGN, APPROACH AND METHOD: The researchers administered two questionnaires. These were Rousseau’s Psychological Contract Inventory (2000) and the Human Resource Practices Scale of Geringer, Colette and Milliman (2002). The researchers conducted the study with 936 knowledge workers at an iron ore mining company in South Africa. They achieved a 32 % response rate. MAIN FINDINGS: The findings showed that most participants have relational contracts with the organisation. Another 22 % have balanced contracts, 8 % have transitional contracts whilst only 1 % have transactional contracts. The study suggests that there are relationships between these psychological contracts and specific human resource practices. The study found that training and development was the most important human resource practice for developing <b>relational</b> and <b>balanced</b> contracts. Employees thought that they contributed more than their employer did to the relationship. The researchers developed a model to illustrate the influence of the various human resource practices on psychological contracts. PRACTICAL/MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS: The influence of human resource practices on relational contracts could assist organisations to invest in human resource practices. During recessions, organisations tend to reduce expenditure on human resource practices, especially training and development. The findings of this study, about the relationship between training and development and relational contracts, highlight the negative effect that this trend could have on psychological contracts, individual and organisational behaviour and, ultimately, organisational performance. CONTRIBUTION/VALUE-ADD: Based on this empirical study, the researchers proposed a conceptual model to illustrate the relationship between different psychological contracts and specific human resource practices, like training and development, which had the strongest relationships with relational contracts.

40|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{challenges}} brought about by increasing global competition and rapid technological development, organizational change has become the norm. Organizational change has a profound effect on employment relationships, with a particular area of concern being any breaches of the psychological contracts (PCB) and the negative behaviours that result from these. In extant literature concerns the impact of organizational change on employment relationship, however, the perceived obligations that exist in the employment relationship have received less attention. In addition, little research has been undertaken in a Chinese government context, thus, the current study investigated the role such breaches play in determining the behavioural responses of Chinese civil servants to organizational change. The conceptual framework is formed by strategic, structural, process-oriented and people-oriented change, in relation to the psychological contracted breaches associated with the transactional, <b>relational</b> and <b>balanced</b> elements. Finally, with respect to the employees' behavioural responses, the concepts Exit, Voice, Loyalty and Neglect (EVLN) behaviours were used. A positivist approach of "testing-out" was adopted, whereby a specifically-designed questionnaire was used to collect data from 486 civil servants working for the Chinese government. Mutual expectations of both parties in the employment relationship were explored. Analysis involved traditional statistical techniques and included an assessment of biographical data. In certain areas, the outcomes supported Western findings on how, following change, a breach of the psychological contract can impact on employee behaviour. However, variations with previous studies were also found, which were related to the traditional Chinese cultural dimension, Confucius thought and the social phenomena surrounding the post 1980 's generation. The discussion resulted in a new conceptual model of PCB being presented, which applies specifically to the cultural context of Chinese civil servants. The study advanced knowledge in a number of ways. Theoretical contributions were made to the psychological contract and particularly the breaches brought about by the change process. Contributions were also made in extending knowledge in the area of employee behaviours, particularly those of Exit, Voice, Loyalty and Neglect. Finally, in investigating the various concepts in the culturally specific environment of China, a contribution was made to public management, international HRM and the general area of culture. Practical contributions were made through recommendations for improvement, with further areas for research also being added. 11 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Organizations trying to realize these benefits, however, face several security and compliance challenges. In this article, we investigate the pressure to take action with respect to such challenges and discuss avenues toward promising responses. We collected perceptions on security and compliance challenges from multiple stakeholders {{by means of a}} series of interviews and an online survey, first, to analyze the current and future relevance of the challenges as well as potential adverse effects on organizational performance and, second, to discuss the nature and scope of potential responses. The survey participants confirmed the current and future relevance of the six challenges auditing clouds, managing heterogeneity of services, coordinating involved parties, managing relationships between clients and vendors, localizing and migrating data and coping with lack of security awareness. Additionally, they perceived these challenges as affecting organizational performance adversely in case they are not properly addressed.

40|$|Purpose: – Based on the {{psychological}} contract (PC) theory, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to identify PC profiles, differentiating between permanent and temporary agency workers (TAW). Moreover, the authors analyzed whether different profiles presented different levels of work engagement. Design/methodology/approach: – A cross-sectional survey data analysis of 2, 867 workers, of whom 1, 046 were TAW, was analyzed using latent profile analyses. Findings: – Four PC profiles were identified, which differed quantitatively in terms of the overall dimension levels (i. e. <b>balanced,</b> <b>relational</b> and transactional) for PC (i. e. content and fulfillment). ANCOVAs showed that the relational/balanced dominant and transactional dominant profiles presented similar engagement levels for TAW, but for permanent workers the former profile showed higher engagement than the latter. However, for both permanent and TAW the fulfillment profile showed higher engagement than the unfulfillment profile. Research limitations/implications: – The cross-sectional design and the reliance on self-report measures are the limitations of this study, although no causality was claimed and method biases were controlled. Practical implications: – Actions that increase PC fulfillment positively affect the employment relationship of TAW with the client organization. Originality/value: – Few studies have addressed PC typologies. Furthermore, most studies have focussed on temporary workers, but not on TAW and their contract with the client organization. Finally, this study emphasizes the crucial role played by the PC in the levels of work engagement. This study is part of a larger research project “Temporary agency workers’ transitions: motives, experiences and outcomes – PTDC/MHC-PSO/ 4399 / 2012 ” founded by the Foundation of Science and Technology from Portuguese Government.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is was to explore how older women perceived their interactions with nurses after receiving care in a hospital setting. Older women are a vulnerable population subject to being overlooked or misunderstood by the nurses caring for them, hence {{the importance of this}} study. To gather the data on older women’s lived world of nursing care, I used a phenomenological approach based on a hermeneutic framework that considers linguistic, historical, and social factors to interpret older women’s lived world of nursing care while hospitalized. I personally interviewed seven {{women between the ages of}} 66 and 81 after their hospitalizations, and then analyzed the data by means of a theoretical lens derived from critical feminism and adapted to gerontology. I discovered that what the participants found most meaningful was being cared for by nurses who embraced the primacy of caring in such a complete way as to be life giving for them. All seven valued the morally grounded feminine ideal of caring that was exemplified by some of their nurses. They experienced feelings of being in control and of being powerless while interacting with their nurses. When the participants felt in control, their interactions with their nurses were characterized by mutuality, respect, and <b>balanced</b> <b>relational</b> energy. When they felt powerless, their interactions were characterized by lack of voice and agency, and by an imbalanced relational energy. This feeling of powerlessness challenged their sense of personhood. Meaningful, direct interactions with their nurses helped the participants successfully negotiate their terms of care. However, all seven women found that they could not predict when these meaningful interactions would occur. The main implication of this study is the need for further research into 1) ways of increasing nurses’ awareness of what it means to be an older hospitalized woman, and 2) nursing education endeavors that target relational work of nurses with their older generation patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{history of}} complex trauma alters basic self-structure, {{attachment}} system and core areas of interpersonal functioning and relationships. There is increasing {{recognition of the}} high proportions of complex trauma histories within substance misusers and limited research into the sequelae of complex trauma, particularly in relation to comorbid complex trauma and substance misuse. There is a distinct lack of adequate theory and guidelines for treatment. Research Aim: to explore psychologist’s experiences of and perspectives about their work with substance misusers {{with a history of}} complex trauma. Complex trauma is a term used to describe experience’s which arise from severe, prolonged and repeated trauma which is often interpersonal in nature. Courtois & Ford (2009) have defined complex trauma as “involving stressors that: are repetitive or prolonged, involve direct harm and/or neglect and abandonment by ostensibly responsible adults, occur at developmentally vulnerable times in the victim’s life, such as early childhood, have great potential to compromise severely a child’s development. ” (p 1). The prototype trauma that was first described under the term complex trauma was child abuse and neglect. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eleven clinical and counselling substance misuse psychologists working across four health boards in Central Scotland. The data was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: Six main superordinate themes emerged from the data: 1. Challenges in negotiating therapeutic relationship; 2. <b>Balancing</b> <b>relational</b> forces; 3. Walking the tightrope of comorbidity; 4. Conceptual dearth (surrounding complex trauma); 5. Emotional impact of Work, and, 6. Core role of therapeutic relationship (in treatment and recovery). Discussion: Participants accounts suggest there are many risks to balance as well as paradoxes inherent in this type of work. The nature of a history of complex trauma means that often clients have difficulties with attachment and relational aspects in their lives, which in turn affect their engagement in the therapeutic relationship. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} it is precisely because relationships seem so threatening and challenging for these clients, that the therapeutic relationship appears to form such a vital role in the therapeutic treatment and recovery process for these client...|$|R
40|$|Workforce {{diversity}} {{is a given}} fact for most organizations in an increasingly global business environment, with cultural and generational differences being among the most studied sources of diversity. Understanding young generation at work in different cultures is becoming an increasingly important challenge for employers because some research even suggests that the so-called “millennials” are the most expensive work force mostly because of high turnover costs [1]. Companies report difficulties with attracting young talents as well as managing them [2] because of lower work centrality [3]. With our paper we aim to contribute to this knowledge and help employers effectively manage young at work. We adopt the psychological contract perspective in exploring employment expectations. The psychological contract {{is seen as an}} important framework for understanding the employment relationship and thus helping organizations to design effective human resource management systems to attract, manage and retain talent. A psychological contract (PC) is an individual’s belief in mutual obligations between an employee and an employer, which can be classified either as transactional (short term and mostly with materialistic focus), relational (long term and not restricted to economic exchange) or balanced (dynamic and open-ended employment arrangements which include both, economic success of a firm and employees opportunities to develop career advantages) [4]. Research consistently shows that if a breach of the psychological contract occurs, i. e. if employees perceive that organizations failed to fulfill promises or obligations, this breach leads to negative work outcomes (e. g. lower job satisfaction, lower commitment and higher intentions to turnover) [5]. Although research related to psychological contracts and their breach has been rather intensive in the last fifteen years, both national culture and generational differences were mostly neglected [6], [2]. Thus the purpose of our study is to fill this gap by increasing general understanding of employment preferences and expectations of future young entrants to job market regarding their prospective employment relationships. We want to explore what kind of psychological contracts employers can expect from the young generation in the future. Our paper focuses on three main research questions: 1) What are employment preferences of young business students regarding the size and type of employer?, 2) What kind of psychological contract characteristics are typical for young business students?, and 3) Are there differences among types of psychological contracts regarding: a) desired future employer’s characteristics, b) career aspirations, such as entrepreneurial career, expert or managerial; c) how much they think that they can trust an employer in general, and d) their general attitude toward work. In order to answer our research questions, we used a quantitative research design. We conducted a survey among business students/recent graduates from leading universities in Korea, Slovenia, Poland and UK. For measuring features of psychological contracts we used the PCI – psychological contract inventory developed by Denise M. Rousseau [4]. It measures expectations regarding employee and employer obligations. Our sample consists of a total of 809 students (247 Korean, 249 Slovenian, 221 Polish and 91 British). We performed a comparative analysis by using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and correlations. Our main findings show that there are some significant differences among students regarding their preferred employment. For example, Korean students prefer larger corporations compared to medium size companies in EU, with the most interest is small companies in Slovenia. Also, there is more interest in public companies in Korea compared to private ones, which are of more interest to EU students. It seems that these differences reflect the structure of the respective economies. We found that overall, students expect more <b>relational</b> and <b>balanced</b> than transactional employment relationships. However, there are more elements of transactional PC present in Poland and Slovenia compared to Korea and UK. These findings are supported by differences in national cultures and work values. Finally, trust in employers seems {{to play an important role}} in expectations of more <b>balanced</b> and <b>relational</b> PC. We can also argue that general levels of trust in employers are higher for those students with more work experiences. Overall, trust in employers is the highest in Korea, followed by UK, and is significantly lower in Slovenia and Poland. With our research we could depict some national differences regarding employment preferences and prospective psychological contracts of future entrants to job market. Results suggest that building trust could be an important element for successfully managing employment relationships with young talents and that building trust could start already during the times of study through internships and co-operation between schools and business community...|$|R
