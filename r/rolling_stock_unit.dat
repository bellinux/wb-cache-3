40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the Rolling Stock Rescheduling Problem (RSRP), while taking maintenance appointments into account. After a disrup-tion, {{the rolling stock}} of passenger trains has to be rescheduled {{in order to maintain}} a feasible rolling stock circulation. A limited num-ber of rolling stock units have a scheduled maintenance appointment during the day: these appointments need {{to be taken into account}} while rescheduling. In this paper we propose three different models for this. The Extra Unit Type model extends the known Composition model by adding additional rolling stock types for every <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> <b>unit</b> that requires maintenance. The Shadow-Account model keeps track of a shadow account for all units that require maintenance. The Job-Composition model is a combination of the Job model and the Composition model, both known in the literature. Paths are created such that maintenance units are on time for their maintenance appoint-ment. All models are tested on instances of Netherlands Railways. The results show that the models are able to efficiently take maintenance appointments into account. ...|$|E

40|$|How to {{deal with}} a {{disruption}} is a question railway companies face on a daily basis. This thesis focusses on the subject how to handle a disruption such that the passenger service is upheld as much as possible. The current mathematical models for disruption management can not yet be applied in practice, because several important practical considerations are not taken into account. In this thesis several models are presented which take important practical details into account: (1) Creating a macroscopic global feasible solution for all three resource schedules, instead of focussing on one individual resource schedule. (2) Scheduled maintenance appointments required by certain <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> <b>units</b> are included while rescheduling. (3) Dead-heading trips to transfer <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> <b>units</b> from stations with a surplus of inventory to stations with a shortage of inventory. (4) Adjusted passenger demand, the passenger demand is not static, but depends on the capacity appointed to the previous trips. Finally, (5) Checking whether a <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> circulation is feasible with respect to the available depot tracks (the shunting yard) within a station. We make use of different techniques to solve the models, for instance, mixed integer linear programming, column generation, constraint programming, and heuristic models are used in this thesis. The results demonstrate that these five practical considerations can be taken into account in the disruption management models...|$|R

40|$|The {{assignment}} of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> <b>units</b> to timetable services in passenger railways {{is an important}} optimization problem that has been addressed by many papers in different forms. Solution approaches have been proposed for different planning phases: strategic, tactical, and also operational planning. In this paper we compare two approaches within two operational planning phases (i. e. the daily and the real time planning). The first exact approach {{is based on a}} Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) which is solved using CPLEX. The second approach is an extension of a recently introduced column generation approach. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of the methods on networks of two countries (Denmark and The Netherlands). We use the approaches to make daily schedules and we test their real time applicability by performing tests with different disruption scenarios. The computational experiments demonstrate that both models can be used on both networks and are able to find optimal <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> circulations in the different planning phases. Furthermore, the results show that both approaches are sufficiently fast to be used in a real-time setting...|$|R
40|$|The <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> {{circulation}} {{depends on}} two different problems: the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> assignment and the train routing problems, which up to now have been solved sequentially.

Here robustness means that difficult shunting operations are selectively penalized and propagated delays together with the need for human resources are minimized. This new integrated approach provides a huge model. Then, we solve the integrated model using Benders decomposition, where the main decision is the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> assignment and the train routing is in the second level. For computational reasons we propose a heuristic based on Benders decomposition.

30|$|Capacity is {{increased}} by higher operational speeds and train frequencies provided by DTO systems, where the headway {{can be reduced}} to 75  s, even to 60  s [19, 20]. In addition, DTO systems can reduce the turnaround times at the terminus to enable higher frequency. Therefore, additional trains can be put into the system during the peak hours to transport passengers. Moreover, DTO systems can respond immediately to congestion, running more trains without the need for extra staff. In addition, the frequency of the trains can also be enhanced in the low-traffic hours, as more and shorter trains can be inserted in traffic without the need for operational staff. Shorter headways provided by DTO systems reduce the expected waiting times of passengers. Additionally, more frequent arrivals of trains at platforms also shorten the boarding and alighting process, which results in shorter dwell times. It is stated in [7] that if the headway between trains is reduced by 42  s, then the dwell time is about 3 % less. In addition, better regularity and consistency of station stop times are also enabled by the improvements in frequency for DTO systems, while human factors can create variability and small delays in GoA 2 and GoA 3 lines [21]. The Paris Metro reported that after upgrading the traditional metro system of Line 1 to DTO system, the same level of service can be provided by fewer <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> <b>units</b> [19]. Moreover, the removal of the driver cabins enhances the physical space for passengers, which added 6 % to capacity for Paris Metro Line 1 [19].|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{identification and}} analysis of frameworks for optimizing medium-term maintenance planning and <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> rostering. Rolling Stock Management (RSM) is the main cost factor for Rail Undertakings. For example, for high-speed trains, more than 30 % of the lifecycle costs is spent for maintenance operations. In {{order to reduce the}} costs due to railway operations, every company should address the joint problem of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> rostering and maintenance scheduling since they are strongly related parts of the same problem. Maintenance optimization can be a key factor to increase the productivity of railway companies. At the same time, in a competitive globalized and multimodal market, RSM is one of the competitiveness key factors because services quality level depends on it. The strategic relevance of RSM, in particular of maintenance scheduling, is thus due to the reduction of needs (such as platforms and human resources) and to the enhancement of quality standards (such as vehicle reliability and cleaning). From our point of view the literature is focused on manufacturing setting {{in order to reduce the}} occurrence of a failure while unfortunately the coordination of maintenance and <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> scheduling is still underinvestigated. A key problem in railway planning process requires to cover a given set of services and maintenance works with a minimum amount of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> <b>units.</b> Additional objectives are to minimize the number of empty runs and to maximize the kilometres travelled by each train between two maintenance operations of the same type. First,the rostering and maintenance optimization problems are formulated by graph theoretical approaches that involve medium-term maintenance operations, the scheduling tasks related to train services and empty rides. The constraints of the maintenance optimization problem require that the different types of maintenance operations must be carried out for each train periodically. The various maintenance tasks can only be done at a limited number of dedicated sites. Starting from the solutions of the rostering and maintenance optimization problems, we developed another graph theoretical approach to optimize workshop management and in particular to minimize the number of drivers involved and to verify the feasibility of the maintenance plan at each site. For a set of timetables and <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> categories, we compare flexible versus rigid plans regarding the number of empty rides and maintenance kilometres. For different feasible frameworks and different kinds of timetables, we provide new mixed-integer linear-programming formulations for train rostering and maintenance scheduling problems and we also show how the proposed scheduling formulations could be used as effective tools to absorb real-time timetable perturbations while respecting the agreed level of service. The specific objective of our research is to related to the following questions: “How can the timetable be executed by an efficient use of resources such that the overall railway company costs are reduced? Which is the maximal improvement that can be achieved? At which cost?". In this thesis, we give an answer to these questions by performing an assessment of key performance indicators. The computational evaluation presents the efficiency of the new solutions compared to the practical solutions. Experimental results on real-world scenarios from Trenitalia show that these integrated approaches can reduce significantly the number of trains and empty rides when compared with the current plan. We use a commercial MIP solver for developing a decision support tool that computes efficient solutions in a short time...|$|R
50|$|Economic {{liberalization}} of 1991 followed by Information Technology industry explosion have taken India {{to a new}} growth scenario. Backed by strong fundamentals and commendable growth {{in the past three}} to four years, the resplendent Indian Economy is poised to grow even further at an average of 8 to 10% in the next 3 years. Transport requirement in the country, being primarily a derived demand, is slated to increase with elasticity of 1.25 with GDP growth by 10 to 12% in the medium and long term range. Riding on the waves of economic success, Indian Railways has witnessed a dramatic turn around and unprecedented financial turnover in the last two and a half years. This has been made possible by higher freight volumes without substantial investment in infrastructure, increased axle load, reduction of turn-round time of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> reduced <b>unit</b> cost of transportation, rationalization of tariffs resulting in improvement in market share and improved operational margins. Over the last 2 to 3 years, the railway freight traffic has grown by 8 to 11%, which is projected to cross 1100 million tonnes by the end of 11th Five Year Plan.|$|R
