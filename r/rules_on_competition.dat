50|$|In {{the early}} eighties the IGR GmbH got widely known for trying to {{restrict}} access of Japanese electronics companies to the German TV set market by way of patent licenses. At that time, a standard for providing stereophonic TV sound had been developed by the Institut für Rundfunktechnik. In 1980, the IGR GmbH acquired the then pending patent applications related to this standard for 150.000 DM (about 75.000 €) and granted patent licenses to its members only. The IGR GmbH planned to grant limited licenses to non-members at a later date. In 1981, Salora, a Finnish TV set manufacturer, was unable to fulfill its contracts with major German mail-order firms after the IGR GmbH obtained an injunction from a court. Following a complaint by Salora, the European Commission started antitrust investigations against IGR GmbH but terminated the proceeding when IGR GmbH agreed to immediately grant unlimited licenses to Salora. However, IGR GmbH and its members continued to leverage their position by requiring other European manufacturers to pay royalties. This led to further investigations of the European Commission in 1983 which alleged {{that this was an}} infringement of European Union's <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition.</b> IGR GmbH thereafter dropped license fees considerably which led the European Commission to close the case.|$|E

40|$|Changes in EC {{electricity}} law {{are happening}} with amazing speed, and those changes are greater still {{when compared with}} the time required to understand them. This book is designed to provide both coverage and depth in relation to Europe's newly liberalised electricity sector and to the network of rules that govern it. In an exhaustive analysis, this book explains the current law, while taking account of imminent changes and anticipating further developments. Thorough case studies relating to the electricity sectors in France and in England & Wales are also provided for a more concrete understanding. The centrepiece chapter is devoted to reflections concerning the impact which the EC Treaty <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> and the free movement of goods will have on the functioning of an internal electricity market.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of decisions made by government and market structure on productivity of innovation activities. People expect state representatives to manage public resources accurately and pursuit the most desirable community's surplus in terms of economic welfare. Businesses presume policy-takers to legislate in an effort to guarantee a favorable environment, thus backing economic growth. Based on an international empirical survey conducted in five European countries, this paper finds a sound mediating effect of new service development. The higher the propensity towards innovation activities the higher the probability of obtaining benefits from competitive pressure. In fact innovation oriented firms outperform the market by converting ideas into business, as a consequence, enhancing, updating or consolidating their offer portfolio. Results stem from two structural equation models that constitute the originality of this study. Since confidence in public policies also depends on the transparency of the procedures, this paper concludes, suggesting that policy-makers shall guarantee simple regulation frameworks if they wanted concretely support firms in the light of European <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition...</b>|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} which {{legal instruments}} the European Community has {{to support the}} establishment of an internal electricity market. The main emphasis lies on the application of the EEC Treaty <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> (Articles 85 - 90) to the electricity supply industry. The paper in particular assesses to what extent the European competition law is a suitable instrument to support the completion of an internal electricity market in relation to the present level of integration. The thesis comes to the conclusion that Art. 85 (1) as well as Art. 86 EEC Treaty can be applied and indeed have to be applied to all anticompetitive measures on the electricity market. In doing so, special consideration has to be given to the technical and economic peculiarities of this branch. Moreover i t will be shown that the commercial arrangements made in connection with the privatisation of the ESI in England and Wales do not infringe Art. 85 (1) or 86 EEC Treaty while some of the agreements on the German electricity market contradict these provisions...|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in decentralising governance is increasing worldwide. In Europe too, {{a policy of}} decentralisation is being applied. In economic law, notably in both the cases of EC competition and financial services law, new rules {{are in the process}} of being introduced. In competition law, the regulation on the implementation of the <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> has lead to a decentralised model of law enforcement. In financial services law, the directive on markets in financial instruments has proposed the introduction of a four-level rule-making model, which may represent a participative, decentralised approach, but has resulted in a centralisation of that process, while the enforcement remains decentralised. This essay provides a brief overview of these models of regulation. Then, it examines these regulatory structures and focuses on the question of the impact of the decentralisation process in the context of decentred understandings of regulation. It points to the paradox of law being decentralised where it is a centralised function and thus represents an oxymoron. The paper argues that decentralisation results in an oxymoron depending on the function of law considered. The overall purpose of the paper is to contribute to a better understanding of governance through decentralisation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{stresses}} {{the negative impact}} that the excessive levels of transparency imposed by public procurement <b>rules</b> can have <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> for public contracts and, more generally, on the likelihood of cartelisation of the markets where public procurement takes place. The paper critically assesses some recent Judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the General Court from this perspective and shows how the top EU Courts are still oblivious {{to the fact that}} excessive transparency may diminish the effectiveness of procurement by reducing competition. It also indicates that the case law itself has unused balancing tools that may help reduce the negative impact of excessive transparency, particularly if coupled with a reduction of the financial incentives offered to litigants that have no other claim than a 'mere' lack of compliance with full transparency. The paper concludes that a reform in the enforcement and oversight mechanisms oriented towards the setting up of a semi-opaque review system would overcome some of the deficiencies identified in the current case law from a law and economics perspective.

5000|$|The revenue {{management}} process begins with data collection. Relevant data is paramount to a {{revenue management}} system's capability to provide accurate, actionable information. A system must collect and store historical data for inventory, prices, demand, and other causal factors. Any data {{that reflects the}} details of products offered, their prices, competition, and customer behavior must be collected, stored, and analyzed. In some markets, specialized data collection methods have rapidly emerged to service their relevant sector, and sometimes have even become a norm. In the European Union for example, the European Commission makes sure businesses and governments stick to EU <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> fair <b>competition,</b> while still leaving space for innovation, unified standards, {{and the development of}} small businesses. To support this, third party sources are utilized to collect data and make only averages available for commercial purposes, such {{as is the case with}} the hotel sector - in Europe [...] and the Middle East & North Africa region, where key operating indicators are monitored, such as Occupancy Rate (OR), Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR). Data is supplied directly by hotel chains and groups (as well as independent properties) and benchmark averages are produced by direct market (competitive set) or wider macro market. This data is also utilized for financial reporting, forecasting trends and development purposes. Information about customer behavior is a valuable asset that can reveal consumer behavioral patterns, the impact of competitors' actions, and other important market information. This information is crucial to starting the revenue management process.|$|R
