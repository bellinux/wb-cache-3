50|$|As the {{population}} grew during the 13th to 16th century, {{a number of}} new parishes were established. For example, around Zurich in the period between 1470 and 1525 over half of the approximately 100 parishes had a new Gothic church. Many of these new churches included a polygonal choir, lit with large windows and topped with a <b>ribbed</b> <b>roof.</b> The basilica nave had smooth walls and was topped with a flat roof. Many of these new parish churches included rich stained glass windows, some of which are still in place today. A French trained school of fresco painters developed in Waltensburg/Vuorz and decorated churches throughout Graubünden with Gothic frescos.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{elements}} of all structures trends to remain same. The base model is normally circular, square or rectangular plain shapes with a <b>ribbed</b> <b>roof</b> evolved from functional consideration. The most distinctive visual form of Kerala architecture is the long, steep sloping roof built {{to protect the}} house’s walls and to withstand the heavy monsoon, normally laid with tiles or thatched labyrinth of palm leaves, supported on a roof frame made of hard wood and timber. Structurally the roof frame was supported on the pillars on walls erected on a plinth raised from the ground for protection against dampness and insects in the tropical climate. Often the walls were also of timbers abundantly available in Kerala. Gable windows were evolved at the two ends to provide attic ventilation when ceiling was incorporated for the room spaces.The science of Vastu plays {{a very important role}} in developing architecture styles. The basic concept underlines that, every structure built on earth has its own life, with a soul and personality which is shaped by its surroundings. The most important science which has Kerala has developed purely indigenously is Thachu-Shastra (Science of Carpentry) as the easily availability of timber and its heavy use of it. The concept of Thachi underlines that as timber is derived from a living form, the wood, when used for construction, has its own life which must be synthesized in harmony with its surroundings and people whom dwell inside it.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{material}} {{used for the}} building is ganch - fired brick mixed with mortar, gypsum and clay - which was made in a plant located in Sauran. Layers of clay reaching a depth of 1.5 m (4.9 ft), to prevent the water penetration, {{were used for the}} original foundation. These were replaced with reinforced concrete in modern restoration works. The main entrance to the mausoleum is from the south-east, through which visitors are ushered into the 18.2 × 18.2-m (59.7 × 59.7-ft) Main Hall, known as Kazandyk (the [...] "copper room"). The section is covered by the largest existing brick dome in Central Asia, also measuring 18.2 m (59.7 ft) in diameter. At the center of the Kazandyk is a bronze cauldron, used for religious purposes. The tomb of Yasawi is situated on the central axis {{at the end of the}} building in the northwest, with the sarcophagus located exactly at the center of the section, which has a double dome <b>ribbed</b> <b>roof</b> [...] - the inner dome being 17.0 m (55.8 ft) high and the outer dome being 28.0 m (91.9 ft) high. The dome exterior is covered with hexagonal green glazed tiles with gold patterns. The interior is adorned with alabaster stalactites, known as muqarnas. Additional rooms in the structure, totaling more than 35, include meeting rooms, a refectory, a library, and a mosque, which had light blue geometric and floral ornaments on its walls. The mausoleum's exterior walls are covered in glazed tiles constituting geometric patterns with Kufic and Suls epigraphic ornaments derived from the Qur'an. Initial plans also called for the addition of two minarets, but this was not realized when construction was halted in 1405.|$|E
5000|$|A PA {{tested by}} the British {{magazine}} The Motor in 1958 had {{a top speed of}} 89.8 mph and could accelerate from 0-60 mph in 16.8 seconds. A petrol consumption of 25.2 mpgimp was recorded. The test car cost £1073 including taxes of £358. They tested the 2.6 Litre version with overdrive in 1960 and found the top speed had increased to 94.7 mph, acceleration from 0-60 mph to 15.2 seconds and fuel consumption improved to 26.8 mpgimp. The test car cost £1077 including taxes of £317. The car without overdrive cost £1014.In August 1959 the Cresta was given a facelift, with a new, larger, grille and the replacement of the three piece rear window with a single wrap around screen. The previous <b>ribbed</b> <b>roof</b> panel was replaced with a smoothly contoured version (with structural revisions to the C pillars and rear parcel shelf area to retain structural strength). The Vauxhall flutes on the front wings finally disappeared, replaced by a straight chrome side moulding which was also the division point for the two tone colour scheme. Further changes came in August 1960 with the introduction of a new engine of square dimensions (bore and stroke were both 82.55mm) with a redesigned, longer, cylinder block and a capacity of 2651cc. A further increase in compression ratio to 8.0:1 and larger valves in wedge shaped combustion chambers contributed to a power output of 95bhp at 4,600rpm. Increased diameter wheels allowed larger brakes to be fitted, but these were still of the drum type (Ford had introduced front disc brakes as an option on the rival Zephyr/Zodiac models in September 1960 and would make them standard in June 1961). Externally, there was a redesign of the rear lights, with shallower units replacing the elongated oval ones of the previous versions. The direction indicators, previously in the rear tail fins were now incorporated in the main lamp unit and the fins were now solid with a V for Vauxhall badge. The rear bumper was now a higher mounted straight topped design. The front sidelights and direction indicators, previously separate were now in a combined housing and there were redesigned wheel trims and hub caps. Inside, a redesigned fascia with a padded top and a horizontal speedometer was featured. In October 1961 the final updates to the PA series were made. Front disc brakes became an optional extra (four months after Ford had made them standard on the Zephyr/Zodiac). Separate front seats became an option to the standard bench and there was now wood trim to the fascia and door cappings. The PA Cresta continued in production in this form until replaced by the PB series in October 1962. During the 1970s many PA Crestas were modified and customised. The model was very popular with fifties revivalists; many were driven by teddy boys and were very much seen as part of the rock 'n' roll image. A 1960 PA Cresta features in the 1981 video for [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials, in which the band are wearing '50s-style clothing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{innovative}} {{method of}} shaping free form buildings composed of many original complete parts roofed with profiled steel sheets transformed effectively into hyperbolic paraboloid strips is {{proposed in the}} paper. The method uses tetrahedral compositions of various kinds connected one to another with their relevant faces contained in planes of a spatial network called control structure. The control structures enable: a) controlling structural systems and architectural forms of the complex buildings {{as well as their}} morphological systems, b) arranging regularly the roof shells in three-dimensional space, c) integrating the roof and elevation forms as well as their consistent composition into the natural and built environments. The effectiveness of the transformations consists in the fact that displacements of adjacent folds in the sheeting are big, whereas strain is small. The effective transformations affect the fold's shape {{in such a way that}} the folds are contracted in the middle on their length and stretched at their crosswise ends depending on supporting conditions produced by curvature and a mutual location of skew directrices. The supporting conditions are diversified along each directrix, so the diversified arrangement of the supporting points of the shell folds to the skew directrices has to be calculated. For this purpose, an innovative computer program was created. Because of the diversified fold shape changes, two individual shell sheeting's cannot be connected one to another with their transversal borders to obtain a smooth shell. However, many shells can be set together with their transversal edges to achieve a compound <b>ribbed</b> <b>roof</b> of medium or large span. Thus, the resultant shell roof has to be characterized by edges disturbing its smoothness...|$|E
