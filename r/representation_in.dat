40|$|Abstract. In {{the paper}} we study {{automorphic}} duals of split classical {{groups in the}} non-archimedean case (defined in [Cl 2]), and a relation between isolated points in the unitary and automorphic duals. Particular attention {{is devoted to the}} unramified unitary <b>representations</b> ([MuT]). <b>In</b> the unramified case, we study relation between the property of being automor-phic (and isolated there), and intrinsic properties of <b>representations.</b> <b>In</b> the case of split classical groups we give combinatorial formulas for the number of isolated <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> the unramified unitary duals (these representations are also isolated <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> the automorphic duals), and for the number of so called strongly negative representations, which can be expected to be sets of isolated <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> the unramified automorphic duals. For the difference of special linear groups, we have plenty of both of these representations. We also discuss the case of automorphic duals of general linear groups...|$|R

40|$|Both {{computer}} vision and human visual system target the same goal: to accomplish visual tasks easily via {{a set of}} <b>representations.</b> <b>In</b> this thesis, we study to what extent representations from {{computer vision}} models align to human visual representations. To study this research question we used an interdisciplinary approach, integrating methods from psychology, neuroscience and computer vision. Such an approach is aimed to provide new insight {{in the understanding of}} human visual <b>representations.</b> <b>In</b> the four chapters of the thesis, we tested computer vision models against brain data obtained with electro-encephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The main findings can be summarized as follows; 1) computer vision models with one or two computational stages correlate to visual representations of intermediate complexity in the human brain, 2) models with multiple computational stages correlate best to the hierarchy of <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> the human visual system, 3) computer vision models do not align one-to-one to the temporal hierarchy of <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> the visual cortex and 4) not only visual but also semantic representations correlate to <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> the human visual system...|$|R

Their <b>representation</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons fell by over half, from 343 to 165; their lowest <b>representation</b> <b>in</b> the House since 1906.
