500|$|On March 28, Hinckley {{arrived in}} Washington, D.C. by bus and {{checked into the}} Park Central Hotel.

500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized.

Perhaps I didn't have to give my Hamlet before I died, that the world might be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact." [...] McCormack appeared in the productions A Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry V, Murder in the Cathedral and Three Sisters. McCormack later performed with the Manitoba Theatre Centre in a production of Burn This, as well as with Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre in Biloxi Blues.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{agreed to}} return {{for a few days}} in 1988 to finish off Daphne's storyline. This time, the actress asked for her {{character}} to be killed off. Smith told Robyn Harvey from The Sydney Morning Herald, [...] "I wanted Daphne to die. I didn't want to be stuck in a television series for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I'd taken Daphne {{as far as she could}} go.

Off-screen, representatives from the serial's production company tried to persuade Smith to sign a new contract, but she refused. Daphne briefly regained consciousness to say [...] "I love you Clarkey" [...] to Des, before becoming the first regular character to die.|$|E

3000|$|I can’t imagine {{something}} like this: One day (the future which is now) a pupil asked {{such a question}} in class when I taught about the HGP, “My teacher, why didn’t China {{do something for the}} HGP?” I would deeply regret for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life</b> if <b>my</b> response could only be the following: “My kids, how can you know, ah, that time, how poor our country was, how illiterate our people were, how short-sighted our decision-makers were, and how disappointing our scientists were, … we just saw our great nation thus losing another historic opportunity without doing anything, ……” No, it will never come true.|$|R

500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of The Wraith: Shangri-La, Bruce {{admitted}} that he was considering not completing the production of Hell's Pit. He is quoted as describing Shangri-La as [...] "{{the end of the}} road. It's the end of the Joker's Cards. After this I could do anything I want, for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The positivity was so unbelievable". On August 31, 2004, Insane Clown Posse released their ninth studio album, Hell's Pit, the second exhibit of The Wraith, intended to warn listeners of the horrors of Hell. Bruce described the album as the darkest, most painful work he had ever done. Two versions of the album were released, each containing a different DVD. One release featured a live concert and a twelve-minute music video for the song [...] "Real Underground Baby", and another featured a short film for the song [...] "Bowling Balls", which was the first 3-D film shot in high-definition video. In 2005, D12 and Insane Clown Posse ended their feud, with the help of member Proof. Attempts to officially end the feud between Eminem and Insane Clown Posse have been unsuccessful, but Bruce states that the rivalry has ended.|$|E

According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted [...] "extremely negatively" [...] by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that here she only encountered [...] "more Christians" [...] telling her that she was [...] "selfish and wrong" [...] and [...] "should look to God for help." [...] Aged sixteen, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, [...] "I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep." ...|$|E
5000|$|Barry Hannah's fictions contain {{situational}} {{humor that}} spans a wide gamut, from the surreal to grotesque and black humor.

Soon after that, Hannah wrote [...] "Mother Rooney Unscrolls the Hurt": And then I wrote my first truly good story, [...] "Mother Rooney Unscrolls the Hurt," [...] which was a piece <b>of</b> <b>my</b> then-forthcoming book, Geronimo Rex.

Could he suppose I'd forgotten all the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> past <b>life,</b> and his vile act as well, and yet remembered alone what little love, if any, I ever had borne him? It was incredible that any man, however wicked, however conceited, should think such folly as that--that a girl would marry her father's murderer; and yet what might not one expect from a man who, after having shot my father, had still the inconceivable and unbelievable audacity to take deliberate steps for securing my own comfort and happiness?

The freshly resurrected Federal Marriage Amendment is an obscenity even if it’s never ratified, and the cascade of states banning both same-sex marriage and civil unions presents a clear and pungent danger.
