Metro officials proceeded anyway in March 1984 with Green Line design and planning, and moved the line's completion date up to late 1986.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1986 election, the Centre Democrats {{worked on}} {{improving}} both its image and its grassroots support. The strategy paid off with Janmaat winning {{a seat in}} the House of <b>Representatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1989 general election. By contesting the election in all nineteen constituencies, the party won the right to state-sponsored television and radio time but still had no more than 300 registered members. In the 1990 local elections the Centre Democrats won eleven seats, then, in the 1991 provincial elections, three seats in the provincial parliament.|$|E

5|$|Kalonji's {{accession}} {{to the position}} of Mulopwe was heavily criticised even by many Luba in South Kasai. Kalonji remained popular among some groups, but lost the support of the South Kasaian évolués who saw his elevation as flagrant opportunism. Soon after his elevation, Kalonji was publicly condemned and disavowed by ten of South Kasai's 13 <b>representatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Léopoldville parliament, beginning the disintegration of the secessionist state.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{volatile}} issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone. The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' <b>representatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E

5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the United States House of <b>Representatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E
5|$|After the LCL lost {{government}} in 1970, primarily {{owing to the}} electoral reform, Hall managed to be re-elected as leader. He convinced {{a majority of the}} party's membership that reform was needed, and sought to remove the influence that the party's <b>representatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Legislative Council held. When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill. Internally, there was much opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences.|$|E
5|$|After the Union of Lublin, the Senate {{of general}} sejm of the Commonwealth became {{augmented}} by Lithuanian high officials; {{the position of}} the lay and ecclesiastical lords, who served for life as members of the Senate was strengthened, as the already outnumbered middle szlachta high office holders had now proportionally fewer <b>representatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper chamber. The Senate could also be convened separately by the king in its traditional capacity of the royal council, apart from any sejm's formal deliberations, and szlachta's attempts to limit the upper chamber's role had not been successful. After the formal union and the addition of deputies from the Grand Duchy, and Royal Prussia, also more fully integrated with the Crown in 1569, there were about 170 regional deputies in the lower chamber (referred to as the Sejm) and 140 senators.|$|E

5|$|Atlético Mineiro did {{not qualify}} for any {{continental}} competitions in 2001 or 2002, a season in which Brazil did not have <b>representatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first edition of Copa Sudamericana, the new cup which replaced Copa Mercosur and Copa Merconorte. The club qualified for the 2003 Copa Sudamericana, {{taking part in a}} single round-robin preliminary group stage for Brazilian clubs, with Fluminense and Corinthians. Atlético defeated the latter 20 in São Paulo, but lost to the former 20 at home, and did {{not qualify for}} the second preliminary stage. The club became a regular participant in the Copa Sudamericana in the 2000s, but failed to advance from the Brazilian preliminary round in most tournaments. In 2004, Atlético fell to Goiás with a 42 away loss and a 11 home draw. Going through a bad period in its history, which included relegation in 2005, the club was absent from continental football for three years between 2005 and 2007.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} <b>representatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper house would be the same for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E
