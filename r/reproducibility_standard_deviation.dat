Precision criteria were calculated applying robust statistic methods with algorithms A and S (ISO 5725 - 5 and ISO 13528) and DIN 38402 A 45 (Q-method/Hampel-estimator) The robust means calculated according to both algorithms were checked for significant difference (student's t-test) and equivalence test.

40|$|Reproducibility {{conditions}} of the replication of a measurement include several circumstances. In chemical measurement ‘reproducibility’ is mostly taken to refer to an interlaboratory study, either a collaborative trial (that is, with a strictly defined analytical procedure) or a proficiency test (with no prescribed procedure). At first sight, we might expect the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of the proficiency test to be the greater for the same determination: the various procedures used by the participants will each introduce an extra uncertainty related to their specific biases. No comprehensive study of this potential disparity has been undertaken hitherto. The issue is important because <b>reproducibility</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> {{is closely related to}} standard uncertainty. Here a comparison is made between the trend of collaborative trial outcomes (standard deviation as a function of concentration) and individual values from the FAPAS proficiency testing scheme in the food analysis sector. Contrary to expectations, the general tendency is for proficiency tests to provide slightly smaller standard deviations than do collaborative trials at mass fractions of the analyte greater than 10 − 7, and slightly higher at lower concentrations. However, there is considerable variation around the median level of the ratio at all mass fractions...|$|E

For the water and sand, 10 and 9 laboratories, respectively, agreed to analyse three samples of each reference material strictly according to the pre-normative protocol. The interlaboratory test programme showed that for both reference materials the values for the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> were 1. 5 - 6 times larger than those for the repeatability standard deviation. This extra variation is caused by the parameter 'laboratory. For both reference materials the repeatability standard deviation was found in the range 0. 9 - 2. 0 % of the mean activity concentration: the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> ranged from 2. 5 - 6. 0 %. Bias of the test method was found for Cs- 134 (- 6. 8 %) and Ba- 133 (- 2. 3 %) in case of the spiked water and for Cs- 134 (- 7. 8 %) in case of the spiked sand. This bias is attributed to no or insufficient correction for coincidence summing. In general, the interlaboratory test showed satisfactory agreement between laboratories, In the light of regulations on radioactivity in materials it is concluded that for measurement of this activity the Dutch protocol may serve as a blueprint for an (European Community) protocol.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringDynamic {{mechanical}} analysis (DMA) is {{the most}} preferred thermal analysis technique for determining the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymer matrix composites {{because it is more}} sensitive to Tg measurements than other thermal analysis techniques. An interlaboratory study was developed and conducted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for its D 7028 - 07 test standard (Tg by DMA). The results of the study indicated that reproducibility was poor between DMA instruments and laboratories. A <b>reproducibility</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 15. 09 degree F and 14. 72 degree F for dry Tg and wet Tg measurements, respectively, was found. Poor reproducibility of Tg measurements creates uncertainty in cases where Tg measurements are utilized. Service temperature and process control determinations may be difficult to establish if reproducibility of Tg measurements remains poor. The goal of this research was to improve laboratory-to-laboratory and instrument-to-instrument reproducibility. To accomplish this, several potential influencers of Tg measurements, such as, thermocouple positioning, dimensional variation of specimens, and temperature calibration configurations and methods were evaluated. These evaluations were the framework to the development of thermocouple guidelines and temperature calibration procedures to aid test operators in areas where the test and calibration standards are not specific. To assess whether this goal was achieved, a follow-on interlaboratory study was conducted. A <b>reproducibility</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 7. 86 degree F and 7. 30 degree F for dry Tg and wet Tg measurements, respectively, was determined. When compared with the interlaboratory study conducted by ASTM, the follow-on interlaboratory study indicated a 50 % improvement in the reproducibility of Tg measurements was achieved with the implementation of the developed thermocouple guidelines and temperature calibration procedures...|$|E

Polyethylenimine/glutaraldehyde/silicalite-modified biosensors showed higher sensitivity compared with others type of biosensors.

40|$|We report {{results of}} the studies {{relating}} to the fabrication and characterization of a conducting polymer based molecularly imprinted para-nitrophenol (PNP) sensor. A water pollutant, para-nitrophenol is electrochemically imprinted with polyvinyl sulphonic acid (PVSA) doped polyaniline onto indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate. This PNP imprinted electrode (PNPI-PANI-PVSA/ITO) prepared via chronopotentiometric polymerization and over-oxidation is characterized by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, contact angle (CA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) studies. The response studies of PNPI-PANI-PVSA/ITO electrode carried out using DPV reveal a lower detection limit of 1 × 10 - 3 mM, improved sensitivity as 1. 5 × 10 - 3 AmM- 1 and stability of 45 days. The PNPI-PANI-PVSA/ITO electrode shows good precision with relative <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 2. 1 % and good <b>reproducibility</b> with <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 3. 78...|$|R
