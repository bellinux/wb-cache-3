40|$|Blood parasites {{of small}} mammals living in Białowieża Forest (eastern Poland) were {{investigated}} between 1996 and 2002. The following haemoparasite species were found: Trypanosoma (Herpetosoma) evotomys in bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus and <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus oeconomus; Babesia microti in root vole; Hepatozoon erhardovae in bank vole and Hepatozoon sp. in <b>root</b> <b>vole.</b> Some non-identified Bartonella species {{were found in}} bank vole, <b>root</b> <b>vole,</b> field vole Microtus agrestis, yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis, common shrew Sorex araneus, Eurasian water shrew Neomys fodiens, and Mediterranean water shrew N. anomalus. The prevalence and diversity of blood parasites were lower in shrews than small rodents. Totally, 52. 0 % of bank voles, 50. 0 % of root voles, 32. 5 % of common shrews, and 41. 2 % of Eurasian water shrews were infected {{with any of the}} blood parasites. Mixed infections were seldom observed in bank vole (17. 3 % of investigated individuals) and <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> (14. 7 %). No animals were infected with three or four parasites simultaneously. Infection of Białowieża small mammals with haemoparasites seemed to be similar to those described in other temperate forest regions rather than boreal ones. Infection rates of rodent species seem to be higher in their typical habitats: for bank vole it was the highest in mixed forest, whereas for <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> in sedge swamp.

40|$|To {{learn more}} about the {{processes}} that lead to genetic erosion and population extinction we studied genetic variation in the <b>root</b> <b>vole,</b> Microtus oeconomus. In The Netherlands the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> is a species that has become endangered because of severe habitat reduction. <b>Root</b> <b>vole</b> populations across north-west Europe have been studied using 29 allozyme loci. The low levels of genetic variation found in this study are discussed and are thought {{to be the result of}} multiple bottlenecks in population size during the last Pleistocene glacials in combination with bottlenecks resulting from population fluctuations. No significant departures from random mating were found, indicating that inbreeding currently does not pose a major problem for the larger populations in The Netherlands. However, isolation between populations seems to be substantial, indicating that problems may arise in the near future at least for small populations, unless appropriate nature management measures are carried through.

If dispersers have kin recognition mechanisms, the prediction is that the focal animal will choose an unfamiliar mate over a familiar mate. Alternatively, if the dispersal itself is enough to avoid inbreeding, dispersers may not have evolved kin recognition mechanisms and do not show any mate preferences. The results showed no difference in time spent with familiar and unfamiliar individuals neither for females nor males. These results may indicate that dispersing <b>root</b> <b>voles</b> do not have evolved kin recognition mechanisms.

40|$|Behavioral {{differences}} between dispersers and residents {{have long been}} recognized in animal species, but it remains unclear whether these dispersal syndromes represent consistent differences over time and in different contexts (i. e., personalities) or short-term changes in behavior during dispersal. We analyzed interindividual differences in sociability (attraction to unfamiliar adult males or females), exploration, and locomotor activity in disperser and resident <b>root</b> <b>voles,</b> Microtus oeconomus. We recorded these behavioral traits in 50 animals before weaning, around weaning age but before dispersal, and after a dispersal test in the field. Dispersing <b>root</b> <b>voles</b> displayed marked social behavior at the youngest age, being more attracted to unfamiliar adult males than residents. Dispersers were also, on average, faster explorers and were more active than residents. However, the observed variation between individuals in terms of social, exploration, and activity behaviors was not consistent over early life stages.

40|$|Isolated by {{hundreds}} of kilometers from the main population, the southernmost populations of root voles (Microtus oeconomus) are vulnerable to extinction in Hungary. Due to restrictions imposed by their protected status, {{only a limited number}} of surveys have been conducted to assess the status of the Hungarian populations. Our goal was to understand the historical relationship between Hungarian populations by analyzing morphological skull similarities. We examined skeletal materials deposited in the Hungarian Natural History Museum using geometric morphometric methods. We postulated that greater similarities would be observed among populations that were connected for longer time and smaller populations would exhibit a higher rate of morphological divergence. Individuals from northern Germany were used as an out-group to estimate the ancestral shape of <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> skulls. Comparison of mandibles and skulls indicates that <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> populations form four regional clusters in Hungary. Two distinct northern groups occupy the Szigetköz and Hanság area. Populations near Lake Balaton form a third, and animals from Kiskunság represent the fourth, highly divergent group.

40|$|A species-wide phylogeographical {{study of}} the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus oeconomus) was {{performed}} using the whole 1140 base pair mitochondrial (mt) cytochrome b gene. We examined 83 specimens from 52 localities resulting in 65 unique haplotypes. Our results demonstrate that the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> is divided into four main mtDNA phylogenetic lineages {{that seem to have}} largely allopatric distributions. Net divergence estimates (2. 0 - 3. 5 %) between phylogroups, as well as relatively high nucleotide diversity estimates within phylogroups, indicate that the distinct phylogeographical structure was initiated by historical events that predated the latest glaciation. European root voles are divided into a Northern and a Central mtDNA phylogroup. The mtDNA data in concert with fossil records imply that root voles remained north of the classical refugial areas in southern Europe during the last glacial period. The currently fragmented populations in central Europe belong to a single mtDNA phylogroup. The Central Asian and the North European lineages are separated by the Ural Mountains, a phylogeographical split also found in collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx) and the common vole (M. arvalis). The Beringian lineage occurs from eastern Russia through Alaska to northwestern Canada. This distribution is congruent with the traditional boundaries of the Beringian refugium and with phylogeographical work on other organisms. In conclusion, similarities between the phylogeographical patterns in the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> and other rodents, such as Arctic and subarctic lemmings, as well as more temperate vole species, indicate that late Quaternary geological and climatic events played a strong role in structuring northern biotic communities...|$|E
40|$|Neighbour–stranger {{discrimination}} {{occurs when}} individuals respond with more aggression to strangers than to territorial neighbours—a phenomenon termed the “dear enemy phenomenon” (DEP). We investigated the DEP with {{male and female}} <b>root</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus oeconomus Pallas 1776) using field dyadic arena tests conducted in enclosures where we could test {{for the effects of}} familiarity (familiar versus stranger), ownership (resident versus intruder status) and resource-holding potential (body mass) on territorial behaviours. The results showed that males put more effort into territorial defence than females, and males could discriminate between neighbours and strangers. In males, aggressiveness was influenced by a significant two-way interaction between treatment and ownership. Male residents were more aggressive towards stranger intruders than towards neighbour intruders, while male intruders were less aggressive towards stranger residents than towards neighbour residents. In females, neither treatment nor ownership status had a significant effect on aggressiveness. Familiar males performed more social behaviours but less non-social behaviours than stranger males. Furthermore, there was a clear dominance hierarchy between residents and intruders in stranger dyads, with the male territory holders dominating the intruder in pairwise interactions. To our knowledge, these results demonstrate for the first time DEP in a small mammal with a known pedigree and present the first evidence for “prior resident advantage” in voles. We argue that both ownership status and familiarity status affect how much an individual invests in territory defence. The benefits of neighbour–stranger discrimination for male <b>root</b> <b>voles</b> and the absence of neighbour–stranger discrimination in female <b>root</b> <b>voles</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} framework to map species’ distributions (realized density) using occurrence-only data and environmental predictors is presented and illustrated using a textbook example and two case studies: distribution of <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtes oeconomus) in the Netherlands, {{and distribution of}} white-tailed eagle nests (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Croatia. The framework combines strengths of point pattern analysis (kernel smoothing), Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and geostatistics (logistic regression-kriging), as implemented in the spatstat, adehabitat and gstat packages of the R environment for statistical computing. A procedure to generate pseudo-absences is proposed. It uses Habitat Suitability Index (HSI, derived through ENFA) and distance from observations as weight maps to allocate pseudo-absence points. This design ensures that the simulated pseudo-absences fall further away from the occurrence points in both feature and geographical spaces. The simulated pseudo-absences can then be combined with occurrence locations and used to build regression-kriging prediction models. The output of prediction are either probabilitiesy of species’ occurrence or density measures. Addition of the pseudo-absence locations has proven effective — the adjusted R-square increased from 0. 71 to 0. 80 for <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> (562 records), and from 0. 69 to 0. 83 for white-tailed eagle (135 records) respectively; pseudo-absences improve spreading of the points in feature space and ensure consistent mapping over the whole area of interest. Results of cross validation (leave-one-out method) for these two species showed that the model explains 98 % of the total variability in the density values for the <b>root</b> <b>vole,</b> and 94 % of the total variability for the white-tailed eagle. The framework could be further extended to Generalized multivariate Linear Geostatistical Models and spatial prediction of multiple species.

40|$|Aim It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> subspecies, Microtus oeconomus finmarchicus, survived the last glacial period on islands on the north-west coast of Norway. The Norwegian island of Andoya may have constituted the only site with permanent ice-free conditions. Geological surveys and fossil finds from Andoya demonstrate that survival throughout the last glacial maximum was probably possible for some plants and animals. In this study we aim to infer the recent evolutionary history of Norwegian <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> populations and to evaluate the glacial survival hypothesis. Methods DNA sequence variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was studied in 46 root voles from 19 localities. Location Northern Fennoscandia and north-west Russia {{with a focus on}} islands on the north-west coast of Norway. Results The phylogeographical analyses revealed two North European phylogroups labelled 'Andoya' and 'Fennoscandia'. The Andoya phylogroup contained root voles from the Norwegian islands of Andoya, Ringvassoya and Reinoya and two localities in north-west Russia. The Fennoscandian phylogroup encompassed root voles from the three Norwegian islands of Kvaloya, Hakoya and Arnoya and the remaining specimens from Norway, northern Sweden and Finland. Nucleotide diversity within the Andoya and Fennoscandian phylogroups was similar, ranging from 0. 5 % to 0. 7 %. Main conclusions Both our genetic data and previously published morphological data are consistent with in situ glacial survival of root voles on Andoya during the last glacial maximum. However, the level of genetic diversity observed in the extant island populations, the past periods of severe climatic conditions on Andoya and the ecology of the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> are somewhat difficult to reconcile with this model. A biogeographical scenario involving late glacial recolonization along the northern coasts of Russia and Norway therefore represents a viable alternative. Our results demonstrate that complex recolonization and extinction histories can generate intricate phylogeographical patterns and relatively high levels of genetic variation in northern populations...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{microsatellite}} markers for the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus oeconomus) {{were developed}} to assess the amount of genetic variation for nine Dutch <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> populations from four different regions, and to evaluate the degree of differentiation and isolation. All eight microsatellite loci {{were found to be}} highly variable with observed heterozygosity values ranging from 0. 61 to 0. 82. These values are similar to those observed for more distant populations from Norway, Finland and Germany. Therefore, the populations seem not particularly depauperate of genetic variation at the microsatellite level. Genetically, the Dutch populations were found to have diverged considerably. Pairwise comparisons of all populations studied revealed F(ST) values significantly greater than zero for most comparisons. However, the magnitude of these values considerably depends on the compared population pair. The level of differentiation between local populations within Dutch regions is generally significantly lower than the differentiation between Dutch regions. The level of differentiation between Dutch regions, however, is not significantly different from that between populations of larger geographical distance. This implies that the regional Dutch populations are both isolated from each other and from other European populations. The observation that even local populations show low but significant genetic differentiation may be indicative for progressive isolation of these populations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Based on {{published}} {{information about}} the glacial, postglacial, and recent distribution of the <b>root</b> <b>vole,</b> Microtus oeconomus, we hypothesized that a population inhabiting the pristine wetland in eastern Poland (Bialowieza Primeval Forest) might comprise a high diversity of haplotypes. The support for this hypothesis was provided by an analysis of partial cytb gene sequences from 149 voles sampled within a two-hectare plot during a nine-year study. In this population, we identified eight haplotypes (PLB 1 –PLB 8), four of which were new to the <b>root</b> <b>vole.</b> These haplotypes were character-ized by low nucleotide diversity (π 00. 0054, SE 00. 0019), the absence of transversional differences between sequences, and no changes in the encoded amino acid sequence: features suggesting a lack of immigration from the distant populations. The haplotype number and their frequency distribution in males and females did not differ significantly. An assessment of the persistence of matrilines in the local population throughout the study period revealed that the haplotype composition was relatively stable for only about 3 years. A more com-plete haplotype network for root voles in Europe was constructed by combining the newly identified haplo-types with the 45 previously described haplotypes. Two of the haplotypes detected in this study occupy key positions in this network: PLB 5, as the closest link to the North European group, and PLB 8, as an ancestor to many other Central European haplotypes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Anti-predation {{behaviour}} in many rodents has mainly {{been studied}} under laboratory conditions, and less in naturally {{conditions in the}} field. Here we studied {{the results of an}} experiment specifically designed for testing the effect of avian predators on <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus oeconomus sub-populations. We compare the frequency of risk-prone behaviour in six protected versus six unprotected sub-populations, and study possible costs connected to such risky behaviour. More specifically, we predicted that <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> are able to detect the current risk of predation by avian, and therefore we assume that the degree of risk prone behaviour in root voles will be higher in areas protected from avian predators compare with unprotected areas. Additionally, we also investigate the possibility that the preceding mortality rate of the sub-populations is the specific cue used for detecting the current predation level and risk of being killed by a predator. In accordance with our hypothesis, the results showed that adults root voles performed less out-of-patch excursions when inhabiting areas with high levels of predation. Juveniles, on the other hand, did not differ between high and low predation levels. The frequencies of adult out-of-patch excursions were also positively correlated with the preceding mortality rate of the sub-population, we therefore suggest that mortality rate may be the cue used by the individuals as a demographical indicator of the current risk of predation...|$|E
40|$|Cyclic {{population}} dynamics of small mammals are {{not restricted to}} the boreal and arctic zones of Eurasia and North America, but long-term data series from lower latitudes are still less common. We demonstrated here the presence of periodic oscillations in small mammal populations in eastern Poland using 22 -year (1986 – 2007) trapping data from marginal meadow and river valley grasslands located in the extensive temperate woodland of Białowieża Primeval Forest. The two most common species inhabiting meadows and river valleys, <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus oeconomus and common shrew Sorex araneus, exhibited synchronous periodic changes, characterised by a 3 -year time lag as indicated by an autocorrelation function. Moreover, the cycles of these two species were synchronous within both habitats. Population dynamics of the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius was not cyclic. However, this species regularly reached maximum density 1  year before the synchronized peak of root voles and common shrews, which may suggest the existence of interspecific competition. Dynamics of all three species was dominated by direct density-dependent process, whereas delayed density dependent feedback was significant only in the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> and common shrew. Climatic factors acting in winter and spring (affecting mainly survival and initial reproduction rates) were more important than those acting in summer and autumn and affected significantly only the common shrew.

40|$|According to the {{classical}} model of a polygynous mating system, male-biased dispersal {{is a consequence of}} inbreeding avoidance and sexual asymmetries in competition.

Here, we report from an experimental study designed to tease apart the effects of competition, cooperation, and inbreeding avoidance on natal dispersal in juvenile <b>root</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus oeconomus). We manipulated the presence of opposite-sex littermates and tested how interactions among siblings influence dispersal and sexual maturation. We also manipulated the juvenile sex ratio to compare the strength of intrasexual versus intersexual competition. Natal dispersal was unrelated to the juvenile sex ratio, females aggregated in space, and there was a consistent spatial overlap among sisters. Males dispersed more in the absence of their sisters, resulting in stronger spatial segregation between sexes, than in the presence of their sisters. Thus, natal dispersal did not reduce the risks of interactions with siblings and intrasexual competition. We suggest that kin clusters in females function as a defense against aggressive or infanticidal behavior by unfamiliar males.

Here we report from an experiment with <b>root</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus oeconomus) specifically targeted at quantifying the process of colonization of empty patches from distant source patches and its resultant effect on local vole deme size variation in a patchy landscape. Three experimental factors: habitat quality (1), predation risk (2) and inter-patch distance (3) were employed among 24 habitat patches in a 100 x 300 m experimental area. The first born cohort in the spring efficiently colonized almost all empty patches irrespective of the degree of patch isolation and predation risk, but dependent on habitat quality. Just after the initial colonization wave the deme sizes in patches of the same quality were underdispersed relative to Poission variance, indicating regulated (density-dependent) settlement. Towards the end of the breeding season local demographic processes acted to smooth out the initial post colonization differences among source and colonization patches, and among patches of initially different quality. However, at this time demographic stochasticity had also given rise to a large (overdispersed) variation in deme sizes that may have contributed to overshadow the effect of other factors. The results of this experiment confirmed our expectation that the space-filling capacity of voles is large.

Although {{a number of studies}} have shown a relationship between the MHC and parasitic infections, the fitness consequences of such associations are less well documented. In the present paper, we characterised the variation in exon 2 of MHC class II DRB gene in the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> and examined the effects of that gene on parasite prevalence and winter survival. We identified 18 unique exon 2 sequences, which translated into 10 unique amino acid sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three distinct clusters, and allele distributions among these individuals suggested that the clusters correspond to three different loci. Although the rate of synonymous substitutions (dS) exceeded the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) across sequences, implying purifying selection, dN was significantly elevated at antigen-binding sites, suggesting that these sites could be under positive selection. Screening for parasites revealed a moderate prevalence of infection with gastrointestinal parasites (24 % infected), but a high infection rate for blood parasites (56 % infected). Infection with the blood parasite Babesia ssp. decreased survival almost twofold (25. 7 vs. 13. 9 %). Animals possessing the amino acid sequence AA* 08 survived better than others (44. 9 vs. 22 %), and they were infected with Babesia ssp. less often (13. 9 vs 25. 7 %). In contrast, individuals carrying allele AA* 05 were infected more often (31. 7 vs. 15. 3 %). Heterozygosity at one of the putative loci was associated with a lower probability of infection with Babesia ssp., but at the other locus, the association was reversed. The unexpected latter result could be at least partly explained by the increased frequency of the susceptible allele AA* 05 among heterozygotes. Overall, we demonstrate that infection with Babesia ssp. is a strong predictor of winter survival and that MHC genes are important predictors of infection status as well as survival in the <b>root</b> <b>vole...</b>|$|E

Voles {{spend most of their time}} underground in their burrow systems and seldom venture into the surface. This makes them safe from hawks and owls. [...] Other predators of voles include snakes. They are also susceptible to ectoparasites like lice, fleas, mites, and chiggers.|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{apple tree}} <b>roots</b> by pine <b>voles</b> is {{believed}} to occur primarily during the winter months. Cengel et a 1. (1978) found that the stomachs of pine voles contained significant amounts of root material only during January and March sampling periods. In addition, the diet of pine voles at that time consisted primarily of less preferred grass species because preferred forb species were unavailable. Therefore, apple tree roots {{may serve as a}} food source in the winter when preferred forages are unavailable. If, in fact, pine <b>voles</b> are consuming <b>roots</b> in response to reduced food supplies, then one would expect the nutritional quality of the diets of pine voles to be its lowest during the winter. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if there was a winter decline in the digestibility of the diet of the pine vole...|$|R
40|$|Marshlands are {{important}} ecosystems that provide valuable habitats for wildlife communities. We investigated the small mammal community-level response to different human disturbances {{and land use}} in the Kis-Balaton Landscape Protection Area, which is an endangered marshland ecosystem of Hungary. Land use, conservation management and other human disturbances (burning, mowing) together with unfavorable weather conditions have caused the degradation of the original homogeneous sedgy marshland on both sampled areas. We measured the species turnover between the different periods separated by the habitat changes. Our results suggest that populations of the habitat-specialist species of marshland areas (e. g. endangered Hungarian subspecies of <b>root</b> <b>vole)</b> {{are sensitive to the}} negative effects of environment and human disturbances. The combined effect of human disturbances and the stochastic processes of the environment can cause the disappearance and substitution of character species stabilizing the communities, which in turn leads to the modification of species composition and structure of small mammal assemblages...|$|E
40|$|According to kin {{selection}} and inbreeding avoidance hypotheses, natal dispersal should be facultatively adjusted to balancing {{the costs and}} benefits of mother [...] offspring interactions. In polygynous mammals, it is hypothesized that female offspring should seek to avoid local resource competition with their mother, whereas male dispersal should be determined by inbreeding avoidance. We tested these hypotheses with a field experiment investigating the relationship between territory acquisition and mother's presence in the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus oeconomus. This species has a flexible social system in which sisters' and mother's home ranges overlap substantially, whereas sons disperse to a greater extent. Immature sibling voles aged 20 days were released for 20 days together with an unrelated adult male in a 2 -patch system either in the presence of their mother or in the presence of an unrelated adult female. Offspring movements were not influenced by mother's presence, but offspring, especially females, avoided the patch occupied by the adult female irrespective of kinship. Offspring remaining in contact with their mother were reproductively suppressed at the middle, but not by the end, of the experimental period. These results indicate that juvenile root voles adopted an opportunistic settlement strategy where they avoided the adult female irrespective of kinship and inbreeding risks.

40|$|In {{small mammals}} living in highly {{seasonal}} environments, observational {{studies show that}} female home range size and exclusiveness are smaller in the nonbreeding winter season than in the breeding summer season. This {{has led to the}} notion that nonbreeding females are more social and decrease territorial behavior during winter. However, because territoriality decreases with increasing population density, and density normally increases during the breeding season, the effects of density and season on social structure are usually confounded. To find out which of the 2 factors explains space use, we experimentally established 3 high-density and 3 low-density <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus oeconomus) populations in late spring and monitored the populations into the nonbreeding winter season. Population sizes were controlled throughout the breeding period to minimize seasonal variation in density. Home range sizes were larger in founder females than in field-born females but did not change with season or density. Area exclusively used by individual females was lower in winter than summer, and founder females decreased exclusiveness as density increased. We argue that this seasonal pattern of space use might be caused by variation in benefits of group living, whereas founder females also responded to density-dependent competition by reducing area exclusively used.

40|$|There are {{two species}} of voles that cause damage in Swedish fruit production: the water vole (Arvicola terrestris) and the field vole (Microtus agrestis). Both species make the most damage during the winter season. The water vole makes {{subterranean}} burrows and cause serious damage by gnawing on the tree <b>roots.</b> The field <b>vole</b> seldom makes burrows and gnaws the bark {{at the base of}} the tree trunk. 	In recent years there have been several reports about increasing vole damage. The main purpose of this thesis was to estimate the size of the damages, to bring knowledge about the biology of the voles and to give examples of control techniques. 	By visiting fruit growers and by making a telephone survey, data about damage and experiences from growers were collected. 	The results show that 36 % of the fruit growers in Sweden think that voles are a problem in their orchard. Many growers reported that the outbreak started in the mid 00 ’s and growers who already had problems say that it is increasing. Orchards with severe damage seemed to be more frequent in Scania and apple was the most affected species. The water vole caused the most severe damage, especially on young trees in modern, high-density orchards. Damage made by the field vole was only common when there was enough snow on the orchard floor. There was no clear connection between soil texture or surrounding landscape and the presence of voles. 	According to the fruit growers there was no control technique that was good enough to apply on large areas with high density of water voles. There was a great demand for more research and new solutions for the vole problem...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of local}} habitat {{geometry}} (habitat area and isolation) in predicting species distribution {{has become an}} increasingly more important issue, because habitat loss and fragmentation cause species range contraction and extinction. However, it has also become clear that other factors, in particular regional factors (environmental stochasticity and regional population dynamics), {{should be taken into}} account when predicting colonisation and extinction. In a live trapping study of a mainland-island metapopulation of the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus oeconomus) we found extensive occupancy dynamics across 15 riparian islands, but yet an overall balance between colonisation and extinction over 4 years. The 54 live trapping surveys conducted over 13 seasons revealed imperfect detection and proxies of population density had to be included in robust design, multi-season occupancy models to achieve unbiased rate estimates. Island colonisation probability was parsimoniously predicted by the multi-annual density fluctuations of the regional mainland population and local island habitat quality, while extinction probability was predicted by island population density and the level of the recent flooding events (the latter being the main regionalized disturbance regime in the study system). Island size and isolation had no additional predictive power and thus such local geometric habitat characteristics may be overrated as predictors of vole habitat occupancy relative to measures of local habitat quality. Our results suggest also that dynamic features of the larger region and/or the metapopulation as a whole, owing to spatially correlated environmental stochasticity and/or biotic interactions, may rul...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} reveals opposing views {{regarding the}} importance of intrinsic population regulation in mammals. Different models have been proposed; adding importance to contrasting life histories, body sizes and social interactions. Here we evaluate current theory based on results from two Scandinavian projects studying two ecologically different mammal species with contrasting body sizes and life history traits: the <b>root</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus oeconomus and the brown bear Ursus arctos. We emphasize four inter-linked behavioral aspects—territoriality, dispersal, social inhibition of breeding, and infanticide—that together form a density-dependent syndrome with potentially regulatory effects on population growth. We show that the two species are similar in all four behaviors and thus the overall regulatory syndrome. Females form matrilineal assemblages, female natal dispersal is negatively density dependent and breeding is suppressed in philopatric young females. In both species, male turnover due to extrinsic mortality agents cause infanticide with negative effects on population growth. The sex-biased and density-dependent dispersal patterns promote the formation of matrilineal clusters which, in turn, leads to reproductive suppression with potentially regulatory effects. Hence, we show that intrinsic population regulation interacting with extrinsic mortality agents may occur irrespective of taxon, life history and body size. Our review stresses the significance of a mechanistic approach to understanding population ecology. We also show that experimental model populations are useful to elucidate natural populations of other species with similar social systems. In particular, such experiments should be combined with methodical innovations that may unravel the effects of cryptic intrinsic mechanisms such as infanticid...|$|E
