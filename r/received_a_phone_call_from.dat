Robinson finished sixth in the Drivers' Championship standings, making her the first woman to finish within the top-six final standings in an American national oval track motor sports series. In 2001, Robinson returned to NASCAR to drive the No. 99 Michael Waltrip Racing car for three races in the Busch Series with the objective of obtaining a season-long drive in 2002.

She later <b>received</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> team owner/driver Michael Waltrip who arranged a three-race agreement, but did not reply being under contact with Kranefuss.

She continued a strong run in ARCA Series with two top-ten finishes in the season's first two races.|$|E

Led by captain Danny Kovacs and standout running back David Showell, the team had a record of seven wins and two losses.

Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character to be diagnosed with MS and for them to then show the impact MS can have on a community.

The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation in her hands.
