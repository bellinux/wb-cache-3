40|$|Background &Objective:  Nowadays {{uncontrolled}} uses {{of chemical}} fertilizers which have many heavy metals such as Cadmium, Lead and Zinc in addition have economic problems, cause to serious damages in the environment. Therefore uncontrolled application of fertilizers can cause accumulation contaminants in soil, water sources and increasing in plants and human & animals’ food chain. The main {{objective of this}} research was to investigate the effects of chemical fertilizers application to increase heavy metals in agricultural soils at directions to prevent contamination in water sources, agricultural products and the best uses of chemical fertilizers. Methods: In this study, 20 soil samples and 5 useful chemical fertilizer samples were collected and investigated. After fertilizer and soil samples were prepared, digested and filtered, heavy metals were determined with using atomic absorption. Results: The results of this study showed that, Cd in Diammonum phosphate  fertilizer 1. 25 times, Super phosphate triple 1. 7 times and in Macro granular fertilizer 1. 5 times were as much as <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration</b> in chemical fertilizers. Cadmium concentration in all of the Jarghoye (Isfahan) agricultural soil samples 3 to 7 times and in the Mobarake village (Najaf abad) agricultural soil samples 10 to 35 times were as much as <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration</b> in agricultural soils. But Pb and Zn concentration in all of the agricultural soil samples was less than the amount of <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentration.</b> Conclusion: Phosphate chemical fertilizers were positive effects to increase concentration of Pb and Zn in agricultural soils. Therefore, application of the fertilizer must be more attention because of increasing heavy metals in the agriculture soils and probably increasing heavy metals in food chain.   ...|$|R

40|$|Heavy metals such as zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), {{chromium}} (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), {{and lead}} (Pb) are potential bioaccumulative toxins of the dairy production system. The heavy metal content of dairy feeds, however, remains poorly documented, {{particularly in the}} United States. This survey determined the heavy metal content of 203 typical dairy ration components sampled from 54 dairy farms in Wisconsin. Lowest heavy metal concentrations were found in homegrown alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay and haylage, and corn (Zea mays L.) grain and silage. Highest metal concentrations were found in purchased feeds, particularly mineral supplements, {{and to a lesser}} extent corn- or soybean-based concentrates. Zinc and Cu were found at the highest concentration in complete dairy (total mixed and aggregated component) rations and reflected the deliberate addition of these metals to meet animal nutrient requirements although more than half the farms fed Cu and Zn above US recommended levels. Concentrations of Cr, As, Cd, and Pb were present in much lower concentrations and decreased in the order Cr>As>Pb>Cd. No complete Wisconsin dairy ration contained heavy metal <b>concentrations</b> above US <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> and would be unlikely to induce any toxic effects in dairy cattle. Concentrations of Cd in complete dairy rations were closest to US <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations,</b> suggesting the greatest potential long-term risk to exceed US <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> if whole farm levels of Cd were to increase in the future. With the exception of Pb, the main sources of Zn, Cu, Cr, As, and Cd in the complete dairy feed ration originated from imported feed. The continued importation of heavy metals in dairy feed is likely to be associated with accumulation of these metals in soils where manure is applied. Although the cycling of many heavy metals through the dairy food chain will be limited by factors such as a soil's cation exchange capacity, pH, salinity, and phytotoxicity of the metal, these may be less limiting for Cd. It is important that sources of Cd in the dairy system are identified and minimized to prevent problems associated with Cd accumulation in the dairy soil system arising over the long-term...|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands {{since the}} late nineties reuse of {{drainage}} water is obligatory for all soil less growing systems, to reduce the environmental pollution. However, this strategy has some important bottlenecks. Apart from technical and phytopathological aspects, accumulation of Na, Cl or other residual ions could be a problem. Accumula-tion will occur if the uptake rates are lower than the concentrations in the input. Recently a database was established with the <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the root environment and water sources, {{for a number of}} crops. In all cases Na showed to be the bottleneck element. A high tolerance for Na not necessarily means a high uptake rate for this ion, as was found for sweet pepper. Water sources differ highly in Na concentrations. In general, for completely closed growing systems only rainwater or desalinated water is suitable. For some crops (rose, chrysanthemum, sweet pepper) the natural background concentrations of Na in rainwater is sometimes even higher than the uptake rate. Accumulation above the <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>concentrations</b> inevitably should be followed by discharge of a fraction of the nutrient solution to prevent yield reduction or decline in produce quality. This will result in lower water and nutrient use efficiencies than required. However, the water and nutrient losses depend highly on water management strategies accomplished by the grower. Smart strategies were developed for discharge of drainage water as low as possible for N and P. These are based on the uptake dynamics of Na and Cl and minimal required N and P levels observed with different crops. These strategies have been tested for rose and resulted in significant reduction in the nutrient losses...|$|R
