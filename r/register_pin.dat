5000|$|Konvas {{cameras are}} reflex, using a {{spinning}} mirrored shutter, allowing the operator {{to view the}} scene through the main lens during filming. Because of the camera's movement mechanism, the shutter opening is 155° {{as opposed to the}} 180° which is standard on many other cameras. Consequently, the shutter speed is slightly higher, for which the exposure must be compensated from the usual 24fps frames per second light meter setting by 1/3 of an f/stop. It has an extended dwell time for film transport like in ARRI 35 series, thus provides more steadiness despite it has no <b>register</b> <b>pin.</b> Some models including -2M and 8M accept a single OCT-19 mount lens, others have a three lens turret including -1M and 7M.|$|E
50|$|Just {{as with a}} {{standard}} motion picture camera, the intermittent <b>register</b> <b>pin</b> camera actually stops the film in the film gate while the photograph is being taken. In high-speed photography, this requires some modifications to the mechanism for achieving this intermittent motion at such high speeds. In all cases, a loop is formed {{before and after the}} gate to create and then take up the slack. Pulldown claws, which enter the film through perforations, pulling it into place and then retracting out of the perforations and out of the film gate, are multiplied to grab the film through multiple perforations in the film, thereby reducing the stress that any individual perforation is subjected to. Register pins, which secure the film through perforations in final position while it is being exposed, after the pulldown claws are retracted are also multiplied, and often made from exotic materials. In some cases, vacuum suction is used to keep the film, especially 35 mm and 70 mm film, flat so that the images are in focus across the entire frame.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} ongoing work on {{an advanced}} flexible circuit interconnect substrate featuring a 24 x 24 (576 element) pad grid array pattern at 300 micron pitch. This eight metal layer circuit is being developed as a highdensity, pixel-level interconnection substrate for a two-dimensional (2 D) ultrasound imaging transducer MEMS device. The flexible circuit substrate is constructed using laminate fabrication methods, whereby multiple sets of two-sided metallized and patterned 1 mil polyimide circuit pairs are laminated together using dielectric adhesive sheets to form a multilayer structure. UV laser-drilled via-in-pad blind vias are used to connect buried trace elements in the circuit stack to the array pattern on the top surface. The flex circuit has feature patterns as small as 35 µm traces and spaces. The UV laser (Electro Scientific Industries, Portland, OR) is used in several other process steps to fabricate the multilayer device including patterning precisely <b>registered</b> <b>pin</b> alignment features in the circuit pairs. Construction of the multilayer device is also possible using advanced substrate materials with improved electrical performance characteristics, including laminate materials such as liquid crystal polymers (LCPs). LCP substrates have a significantly lower dielectric constant, improved dimensional stability and lower TCE compared to polyimide. Although being developed {{as part of an}} ultrasound transducer imaging array project, the advanced substrate has wide applicability to new chip-scale packaging and MEMS electronic integration efforts...|$|R

Pin 15 is the transmitter clock, or send timing (ST); the DTE puts the next bit on the data line (pin 2) when this clock transitions from OFF to ON (so it is stable during the ON to OFF transition when the DCE <b>registers</b> the bit). <b>Pin</b> 17 is the receiver clock, or receive timing (RT); the DTE reads the next bit from the data line (pin 3) when this clock transitions from ON to OFF.|$|R
40|$|Swedish {{health care}} and {{national}} health registers are dependent {{on the presence of}} a unique identifier. This paper describes the Swedish personal identity number (PIN) and explores ethical issues of its use in medical research. A ten-digit-PIN is maintained by the National Tax Board for all individuals that have resided in Sweden since 1947. Until January 2008, an estimated 75, 638 individuals have changed PIN. The most common reasons for change of PIN are incorrect recording of date of birth or sex among immigrants or newborns. Although uncommon, change of sex always leads to change of PIN since the PIN is sex-specific. The most common reasons for re-use of PIN (n =  15, 887), is when immigrants are assigned a PIN that has previously been assigned to someone else. This is sometimes necessary since {{there is a shortage of}} certain PIN combinations referring to dates of birth in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Several ethical issues can be raised pro and con the use of PIN in medical research. The Swedish PIN is a useful tool for linkages between medical registers and allows for virtually 100 % coverage of the Swedish health care system. We suggest that matching of <b>registers</b> through <b>PIN</b> and matching of national health registers without the explicit approval of the individual patient is to the benefit for both the individual patient and for society...|$|R
25|$|For {{the thermal}} vision, {{infrared}} film {{could not be}} used because it did not register in the range of body temperature wavelengths. The filmmakers used an inframetrics thermal video scanner as it gave good heat images of objects and people. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from glow sticks used by campers and mixed with personal lubricant for texture. The electrical sparks were rotoscoped animation using white paper <b>pin</b> <b>registered</b> on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were composited by the optical crew for the finished effects. Additional visual effects, mainly for the opening title sequence of the Predator arriving on Earth, were supplied by Dream Quest Images (later Oscar-winners for their work on The Abyss and Total Recall). The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Visual Effects.|$|R

40|$|To {{effectively}} {{address the}} memory bottleneck and thereby achieve high packet throughputs, Network Processors (NPs) can rely upon three mechanisms: multiprocessing, multithreading, and data caching. In this paper, we first {{demonstrate that the}} relative effectiveness of these three mechanisms varies significantly across deployments (combinations of application, packet traffic and other system characteristics). We show that, a malleable architecture, that includes a fixed number of cores but allows, within each core, cache capacity to be traded off {{for the number of}} threads, can achieve impressive throughput gains compared to current fixed architectures that statically partition the area at chip-design time. We then present a novel NP architecture that realizes this malleability by combining two concepts. First, we propose an architecture consisting of a small multiported register cache and a primary data cache; the data cache holds thread-specific <b>registers</b> in <b>pinned</b> lines as well as normal cached data. Second, to ensure high-bandwidth, low-latency access to thread contexts as well as to minimize the data transfer bandwidth required between the multiported register cache and primary data cache, we propose a novel prediction mechanism that overlaps, with a thread’s execution, the prefetching of only those registers that are likely to be accessed by the next thread. Finally we show that, in as many as 30 % of the deployments we consider, our malleable architecture improves the packet throughput by at least 300 % when compared to Intel’s IXP 2800 —a state-of-the-art commercial NP, and by at least 60 % when compared to the fixed architecture that optimally partitions the chip area among the three mechanisms: multiprocessing, threading and caching. ...|$|R
50|$|R/Greenberg Associates {{created the}} film's optical effects, {{including}} the creature's ability to become invisible, its thermal vision point-of-view, its glowing blood, and the electric spark effects. The invisibility effect {{was achieved by}} having someone in a bright red suit (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and {{the blue of the}} sky) the size of the creature. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape. For the thermal vision, infrared film could not be used because it did not register in the range of body temperature wavelengths. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from chem-lite sticks used by campers. The electrical sparks were rotoscoped animation using white paper <b>pin</b> <b>registered</b> on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames.
