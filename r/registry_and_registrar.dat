40|$|The {{elephant}} in the room One of the most important but least-studied aspects of Internet policy is the emergence of a trading market for previously allocated Internet number blocks. Without unique Internet protocol numbers for the networks and devices attached, the Internet simply doesn’t work. The original Internet Protocol standard, known as IPv 4, specified a 32 -bit numbering space, which provided slightly less than 4 billion unique numbers that could be used as addresses (Postel, 1981). A large part of that number space has already been handed out to organizations. The available supply is dwindling, and the Asia-Pacific region is already reduced to rationing its last / 8 in tiny, 1024 -address chunks, one to an organization, while the European region is only a few months from that status. Recent market developments and policy changes by Internet number registries now allow organizations with more numbers than they want to sell them to another organization. In other words, a market for IPv 4 numbers is now possible. This is a major change in the political economy of Internet governance. It is likely that the commercial forces unleashed will have far-reaching consequences for Internet businesses, users and governance institutions. In a related area, domain name registration, the emergence of a commercial market led to the growth of a domain name industry and major changes in policies and institutions, such as the formation of ICANN, the separation of <b>registries</b> <b>and</b> <b>registrars</b> <b>and</b> the new gTLD program...|$|R

50|$|Lookups of IP address {{allocations}} {{are often}} {{limited to the}} larger Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks (e.g., /24, /22, /16), because usually only the regional Internet <b>registries</b> (RIRs) <b>and</b> domain <b>registrars</b> run RWhois or Whois servers, although RWhois {{is intended to be}} run by even smaller local Internet registries, to provide more granular information about IP address assignment.|$|R
40|$|The process {{introduced}} by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to assess and allocate new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) offers a vehicle for content regulation at two levels. First, regarding the gTLD itself, objection procedures were set up to allow third parties to challenge an applied-for gTLD deemed to be contrary to “general principles of international law for morality and public order” or detrimental to broadly defined communities. The real target of these objections managed by the International Chamber of Commerce was not the gTLD itself, but the potentially controversial content that might be published under it. Second, these preventive measures were coupled with a strengthened anti-abuse policy for new gTLDs. ICANN amended its standard agreements with domain name <b>registries</b> <b>and</b> <b>registrars</b> to impose additional safeguards, compliance with “all applicable laws”, and remedies such as suspension of the domain name, which is a powerful tool to deny access to online content. Surprisingly these amendments were not discussed under ICANN’s consensus policy development process but added {{at the request of}} governments after the launch of the New gTLDs Program. These provisions, if actually enforced by ICANN, could lead to content policing by private entities without any measure to ensure due consideration of domain name holders’ freedom of expression. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) is a {{flexible}} protocol designed for allocating objects within registries over the Internet.

Prior to its introduction, registries had no uniform approach, and many different proprietary interfaces existed. While its use for domain names was the initial driver, the protocol is designed to be usable for any kind of ordering and fulfilment system.|$|R

In a related area, domain name registration, the emergence of a commercial market led to the growth of a domain name industry and major changes in policies and institutions, such as the formation of ICANN, the separation of <b>registries</b> <b>and</b> <b>registrars</b> <b>and</b> the new gTLD program. After a highly publicized deal in which Microsoft bought Nortel’s number assets in a bankruptcy proceeding, the reality of an IP number market can no longer be denied. But many in the Internet technical community still feel uncomfortable about it. One reporter with attitudes typical of the technical community, has predicted that “a functioning market won't form at all, or will break down very quickly after it forms" (van Beijnum, 2011). This is partly due to an ideological resistance to the commodification of a critical Internet resource, and partly due to their fears that an IPv 4 market might delay or even prevent a migration to a new Internet protocol (IPv 6). Either way, few wish to openly acknowledge the market’s existence. Thus the topic of number markets brings to mind the phrase “the elephant in the room. ” Moreover, the information we have about this elephant is fragmented and unsystematic. IP number allocation is controlled on a contractual basis by five separate regional Internet registries (RIRs). Each has different policies toward transfers, different <b>registry</b> databases, <b>and</b> different disclosure practices. It is difficult, therefore, to obtain a comprehensive picture of the emerging market for IPv 4 number blocks. This recalls the old fable about the five blind men and the elephant, with each one having access to {{a small part of the}} body and none of them quite grasping the nature of the beast as a whole. Based on this double-elephant metaphor, this paper tries to make a less than elephantine but much-needed empirical contribution to the literature on the economics and institutions of IP addressing. While several papers already discuss IP number markets in theoretical or policy terms, no one has actually compiled and analyzed the transactions themselves. This paper draws on the records of the RIRs to compile as much information about traded IP number blocks as possible, and then conducts some very basic analysis of stocks, flows and proportions to assess the nature of this emerging market and explore some of its implications for Internet governance. Although it is early days for IP number markets, the data we have gathered already seem to have interesting implications for certain policy issues currently being debated.

40|$|The com, net, and org TLDs contain roughly 150 million regis-tered domains, and domain registrants {{often have}} a {{difficult}} time finding a desirable and available name. In 2013, ICANN began delegation of a new wave of TLDs into the Domain Name Sys-tem with the goal of improving meaningful name choice for regis-trants. The new rollout resulted in over 500 new TLDs in the first 18 months, nearly tripling the number of TLDs. Previous rollouts of small numbers of new TLDs have resulted in a burst of defensive registrations as companies aggressively defend their trademarks to avoid consumer confusion. This paper analyzes the types of do-main registrations in the new TLDs to determine registrant behav-ior in the brave new world of naming abundance. We also exam-ine the cost structures and monetization models for the new TLDs to identify which registries are profitable. We gather DNS, Web, and WHOIS data for each new domain, and combine this with cost structure data from ICANN, the <b>registries,</b> <b>and</b> domain <b>registrars</b> to estimate the total cost of the new TLD program. We find that only 15 % of domains in the new TLDs show characteristics consistent with primary registrations, while the rest are promotional, specu-lative, or defensive in nature; indeed, 16 % of domains with NS records do not even resolve yet, and 32 % are parked. Our financial analysis suggests only half of the registries have earned enough to cover their application fees, and 10 % of current registries likely never will solely from registration revenue...|$|R

50|$|At first, CZ.NIC had {{fulfilled}} {{the role of}} both <b>registry</b> administrator <b>and</b> the <b>registrar.</b> A fundamental change in this respect occurred in 2002, {{when there was a}} transition to more efficient decentralized domain administration. Thanks to this transition, other entities could enter the domain registration process. The aim of this measure was to separate the technical aspects of the operation of the registration system from the operation by domain names’ end holders and to introduce competitive environment, which would bring better services and lower prices, into the registration process. The decentralized domain administration system started its operation in autumn of 2003 and was immediately entered by first commercial registrars. Apart from commercial environment and price decrease, the decentralized system has brought other intriguing changes. The users have been enabled to register domains for a period longer than one year (up to 10 years), and the system have been further secured, in particular with respect to domain holder’s rights. Due to the decentralization and making domains accessible to public, domain disputes have become a frequent occurrence. That is why the association introduced an arbitration clause into the Registration Rules in 2004. This clause allows for resolving disputes through Arbitration Court attached to the Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic. The registration now includes accepting the commitment to respect the decisions of the Arbitration Court, which has simplified and accelerated the dispute resolution.|$|R
