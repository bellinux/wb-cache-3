The model that we use considers particles performing thermal <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion</b> in a hydrodynamic solvent. Using particle-based, mesoscopic simulations that maintain local momentum conservation, we analyze quantitatively how the coupling to the surrounding fluid affects <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion.</b> We find that coupling can increase the mean velocity of the moving particles by almost two orders of magnitude, precisely because <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion</b> has both a diffusive and a deterministic component.

40|$|We {{show that}} ac driven skyrmions {{interacting}} with an asymmetric substrate provide a realization {{of a new}} class of ratchet system which we call a vector ratchet that arises due to the effect of the Magnus term on the skyrmion dynamics. In a vector ratchet, the dc motion induced by the ac drive can be described as a vector that can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the substrate asymmetry direction. Up to a full 360 ^∘ rotation is possible for varied ac amplitudes or skyrmion densities. In contrast to overdamped systems, in which <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion</b> is always parallel to the substrate asymmetry direction, vector ratchets allow the <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion</b> to be in any direction relative to the substrate asymmetry. It is also possible to obtain a reversal in the direction of rotation of the vector ratchet, permitting the creation of a reversible vector ratchet. We examine vector ratchets for ac drives applied parallel or perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction, and show that reverse <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion</b> can be produced by collective effects. No reversals occur for an isolated skyrmion on an asymmetric substrate. Since a vector ratchet can produce motion in any direction, it could represent a new method for controlling skyrmion motion for spintronic applications. Comment: 10 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} large DNA {{molecules}} adopt a stretched conformation {{as they pass}} through gels suggests a simple mechanism for the separation of DNA by crossed field electrophoresis: at each change in field direction a DNA molecule takes off in the new direction of the field by a movement which is led by what was formerly its back end. The effect of this <b>ratcheting</b> <b>motion</b> is to subtract from the DNA molecule's forward movement, at each step, an amount which is proportional to its length. We find that this model explains most {{of the features of}} the separation, and we describe experiments, using a novel electrophoresis apparatus, which support the model. The apparatus turns the gel between two preset orientations in a uniform electric field at preset time intervals. This separation method has the practical advantage over some others that the DNA molecules follow straight tracks. A further advantage is that the parameters which determine the separation are readily predicted from the simple theory describing their motion...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of kinetic data on {{ribosome}} protein synthesis, the mechanical energy for translocation of the mRNA–tRNA complex {{is thought to be}} provided by GTP hydrolysis of an elongation factor (eEF 2 in eukaryotes, EF-G in bacteria). We have obtained cryo-EM reconstructions of eukaryotic ribosomes complexed with ADP-ribosylated eEF 2 (ADPR-eEF 2), before and after GTP hydrolysis, providing a structural basis for analyzing the GTPase-coupled mechanism of translocation. Using the ADP-ribosyl group as a distinct marker, we observe conformational changes of ADPR-eEF 2 that are due strictly to GTP hydrolysis. These movements are likely representative of native eEF 2 motions in a physiological context and are sufficient to uncouple the mRNA–tRNA complex from two universally conserved bases in the ribosomal decoding center (A 1492 and A 1493 in Escherichia coli) during translocation. Interpretation of these data provides a detailed two-step model of translocation that begins with the eEF 2 /EF-G binding-induced <b>ratcheting</b> <b>motion</b> of the small ribosomal subunit.

The ratchet is connected by an axle to a paddle wheel that is immersed in a fluid of molecules at temperature [...] The molecules constitute a heat bath in that they undergo random Brownian motion with a mean kinetic energy that is determined by the temperature. The device is imagined as being small enough that the impulse from a single molecular collision can turn the paddle. Although such collisions would tend to turn the rod in either direction with equal probability, the pawl allows the ratchet to rotate in one direction only. The net effect of many such random collisions would seem to be that the ratchet rotates continuously in that direction.

40|$|A {{periodically}} driven {{system with}} spatial asymmetry can exhibit a directed motion facilitated by thermal or quantum fluctuations(1). This so-called ratchet effect(2) has fascinating ramifications in engineering and natural sciences(3 - 18). Graphene(19) is nominally a symmetric system. Driven by a periodic electric field, no directed electric current should flow. However, if the graphene {{has lost its}} spatial symmetry due to its substrate or adatoms, an electronic <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion</b> can arise. We report an experimental demonstration of such an electronic ratchet in graphene layers, proving the underlying spatial asymmetry. The orbital asymmetry of the Dirac fermions is induced by an in-plane magnetic field, whereas the periodic driving comes from terahertz radiation. The resulting magnetic quantum ratchet transforms the a. c. power into a d. c. current, extracting work from the out-of-equilibrium electrons driven by undirected periodic forces. The observation of ratchet transport in this purest possible two-dimensional system indicates that the orbital effects may appear and be substantial in other two-dimensional crystals such as boron nitride, molybdenum dichalcogenides and related heterostructures.

The ratchet efficiency is nonmonotonic since the ratcheting is enhanced by increased activity but diminished by the onset of self-clustering of the active particles. Increasing the particle density decreases the ratchet efficiency for weak substrates but increases the ratchet efficiency for strong substrates due to collective hopping events. At the highest particle densities, the <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion</b> is destroyed by a self-jamming effect. We show {{that it is possible to}} realize reversals of the ratchet effect, where the net flux of particles is along the hard rather than the easy direction of the substrate asymmetry. The reversals occur in the strong substrate limit when multiple rows of active particles can be confined in each substrate minimum, permitting emergent particle-like excitations to appear that experience an inverted effective substrate potential. We map out a phase diagram of the forward and reverse ratchet effects as a function of the particle density, activity, and substrate properties. Comment: 11 pages, 10 pdf figure...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{recent studies}} {{demonstrate}} how the PA63 pore allows the EF and LF into the cytoplasm when its lumen is so small. The lumen on the PA63 pore is only 15 Å (1.5nm) across, {{which is much}} smaller than the diameter of LF or EF. [...] Translocation occurs through a series of events which begin in the endosome as it acidifies. LF and EF are pH sensitive, and as the pH drops, their structures lose stability. Below a pH of 6.0 (the pH in an endosome), both LF and EF become disordered molten globules. When a molecule is in this conformation, the N-terminus is freed and drawn into the pore by the proton gradient and positive transmembrane potential. A ring of seven phenylalanines at the mouth endosome side of the pore (phenylalanine clamp) assists in the unfolding of LF or EF by interacting with the hydrophobic residues found in LF or EF. The proton gradient then begins to lace the protein though the pore. The lacing mechanism is driven by the gradient, but requires the phenylalanine clamp for a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>motion.</b> The first 250 residues of EF and LF have an irregular alternating sequence of basic, acidic, and hydrophobic residues. The interplay between the phenylalanine clamp and the protonation state cause a ratcheting effect that drives the protein though until enough has crossed into the cytoplasm to drag the rest through the pore as the N-terminus refolds (Fig. 11).|$|R

40|$|Muller's ratchet {{operates}} in asexual populations without intergenomic recombination. In this case, deleterious mutations will accumulate and population fitness will decline over time, possibly endangering {{the survival of}} the species. Mutator mutations, i. e., mutations that lead to an increased mutation rate, will play a special role for the behavior of the ratchet. First, {{they are part of the}} ratchet and can come to dominance through accumulation in the ratchet. Second, the fitness-loss rate of the ratchet is very sensitive to changes in the mutation rate and even a modest increase can easily set the <b>ratchet</b> in <b>motion.</b> In this article we simulate the interplay between fitness loss from Muller's ratchet and the evolution of the mutation rate from the fixation of mutator mutations. As long as the mutation rate is increased in sufficiently small steps, an accelerating ratchet and eventual extinction are inevitable. If this can be countered by antimutators, i. e., mutations that reduce the mutation rate, an equilibrium can be established for the mutation rate at some level that may allow survival. However, the presence of the ratchet amplifies fluctuations in the mutation rate and, even at equilibrium, these fluctuations can lead to dangerous bursts in the ratchet.

40|$|Future {{applications}} of antiferromagnets (AFs) in many spintronics devices {{rely on the}} precise manipulation of domain walls. The conventional approach using static magnetic fields is inefficient due to the low susceptibility of AFs. Recently proposed electrical manipulation with spin-orbit torques is restricted to metals with a specific crystal structure. Here we propose an alternative, broadly applicable approach: using asymmetric magnetic field pulses to induce controlled <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion</b> of AF domain walls. The efficiency {{of this approach is}} based on three peculiarities of AF dynamics. First, a time-dependent magnetic field couples with an AF order parameter stronger than a static magnetic field, which leads to higher mobility of the domain walls. Second, the rate of change of the magnetic field couples with the spatial variation of the AF order parameter inside the domain and this enables synchronous motion of multiple domain walls with the same structure. Third, tailored asymmetric field pulses in combination with static friction can prevent backward motion of domain walls and thus lead to the desired controlled ratchet effect. The proposed use of an external field, rather than internal spin-orbit torques, avoids any restrictions on size, conductivity, and crystal structure of the AF material. We believe that our approach paves a way for the development of new AF-based devices based on controlled motion of AF domain walls. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

We examine the transport of colloidal particles in response to modulation loops of the external field. We classify the modulation loops into topologically distinct classes causing different transport. We show that the lattice symmetry has a profound influence on the transport modes, the accessibility of transport networks, and the individual addressability of paramagnetic versus diamagnetic colloidal particles. We show how the transport of colloidal particles above a two fold symmetric stripe pattern changes from universal adiabatic transport at large elevations via a topologically protected <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion</b> at intermediate elevations toward a non-transport regime at low elevations.

The application presented considers the motions of the tRNAs: free, bound to the ribosome and to a synthase. We observe that both the rigid body and nonrigid body motions of the structural subunits are highly controlled by the large ribosomal assembly and are important for the functional motions of the assembly. For the intact ribosome, its major parts, the 30 S and the 50 S subunits, are found to have counterrotational motions in the first few slowest modes, which are consistent with the experimentally observed <b>ratchet</b> <b>motion.</b> The tRNAs are found to have on average ∼ 72 – 75 % rigid body motions and principally translational motions within the first 100 slow modes of the complex.

The direction of the translational motions of the tRNAs are {{in the same direction as}} the requisite translocation step, especially in the first slowest mode. Surprisingly the small intrinsically flexible mRNA has all of its internal motions completely inhibited and shows mainly a rigid-body translation in the slow modes of the ribosome complex. On the other hand, the required nonrigid body motions of the tRNA during translocation reveal that the anticodon-stem-loop, as well as the acceptor arm, of the tRNA enjoy a large mobility but act as rigid structural units.

5000|$|Foot {{clutches}} with tank shifters were {{standard on}} American motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson and Indian {{up to the}} mid-20th century and many custom bikes today still employ this system. The system used by Harley-Davidson arranged the controls with the tank shifter {{on the left side}} of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the right hand and the shifter, spark contol and front brake operated by the left hand. The Harley-Davidson rocker clutch was operated with the left foot with the heel down position to disengage the clutch (with an over-center spring to hold the clutch disengaged) and the toe down position to engage it ("Toe-to-go"). The right foot operated the rear brake, as is the practice in modern times. Indian, meanwhile arranged things differently. On an Indian, the tank shifter was located on the right side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the left hand and the shifter, spark control and front brake operated by the right hand. (Indian promoted their system to police departments saying that the officer could fire his service weapon with his right hand while riding) The Indian rocker clutch was also operated by the left foot, but the toe down position disengaged the clutch and the heel down position engaged it. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 Panhead, and simultaneously on the K model, their all-new sport model. The transmissions of the foot shift and the hand shift models were different. The hand shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "jockey top" [...] or [...] "jockey lid." [...] On this transmission, the gears were selected in a linear fashion with the selector arm moving further and further forward with each successive gear and the gear lever moved in a slotted gate on the side of the tank. When modified to operate as a [...] "jockey shifter," [...] The lever would be pushed back for 1st gear and then step by step more forward for each subsequent gear. The foot shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "ratchet top". On this transmission, the gears were selected in a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>motion,</b> returning to its default, central position after each shift. When modified to operate with short, transmission mounted hand lever and a foot suicide clutch, this type of set-up was referred to as a [...] "slap shifter" [...] or [...] "slapper". In contrast to the jockey shifter, the slap shifter would always stay in one central position between shifts. Throughout the 50s and 60s on the Panheads and subsequent Shovelheads, foot clutches and hand clutches coexisted, with the hand clutch being progressively more popular over time. After foot clutches had all but disappeared from Harley-Davidson civilian models, the last holdout of foot clutches were the police models up to the early 70's, presumably because the police officers could use their 2-way radio with the left hand while clutching with their foot.|$|R

Such a simple quantum machine can be used to manipulate the excitations of the Mott insulator. For suitably chosen parameters, for example, holes and doublons move in opposite direction.

40|$|The active {{transport}} of ions and molecules across cell membranes {{is essential to}} creating the concentration gradients that sustain life in all living organisms, be they bacteria, fungi, plants, animals or Homo sapiens. Nature uses {{active transport}} everywhere for everything. Molecular biologists have long been attracted {{to the study of}} active transport and continue to this day to investigate and elucidate the tertiary structures of the complex motor proteins that sustain it, while physicists, interested in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, have developed theoretical models to describe the driven <b>ratcheting</b> <b>motions</b> that are crucial to its function. The increasingly detailed understanding that contemporary science has acquired relating to active transport, however, has yet to lead to the design and construction of artificial molecular motors capable of employing ratchet-driven motions that can also perform work against concentration gradients. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) in the form of pseudo- and semirotaxanes are showing some encouraging signs in meeting these goals. This review summarizes recent progress in making artificial molecular motors that can perform work by “pumping” tetracationic rings into high-energy states. The launching pad is a bistable [2]rotaxane whose dumbbell component contains two electron-donating recognition sites, one, a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) unit, which interacts more strongly with the ring component, cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT 4 +), containing two electron-accepting bipyridinium units, than does the other 1, 5 -dioxynaphthalene (DNP) unit. Switching can be induced electrochemically by oxidizing the TTF unit to a TTF•+ radical cation, whereupon Coulombic repulsion takes care of moving the ring to the DNP unit. Reduction of the radical cation resets the switch. Molecular switches operate at, or close to, equilibrium. Any work done during one switching event is undone during the reset. Molecular motors, on the other hand, rely on a flux of energy, and a ratchet mechanism to make periodic changes to the potential energy surface of a system in order to move molecules uphill to higher energy states. Forging a path from molecular switches to motors involved designing a molecular pump prototype. An asymmetric dumbbell with a 2 -isopropylphenyl (neutral) end and a 3, 5 -dimethylpyridinium (charged) end with a DNP recognition site to entice CBPQT 4 + rings out of solution exhibits relative unidirectional movement of the rings with respect to the dumbbell. Redox chemistry does the trick. During the oxidative cycle, the rings enter the dumbbell by passing over the neutral end onto the recognition site; in the reduction cycle, much of the recognition is lost and the rings find their way back into solution by leaving the dumbbell from the charged end. This on-one-end, off-the-other process can be repeated over and over again using light as the energy source {{in the presence of a}} photosensitizer and a compound that shuttles electrons back and forth. Although this prototype demonstrates ratchet-driven translational motion, no work is done. A ring enters the dumbbell from one end and leaves from the other end. Another deficiency of the prototype is the fact that, although the recognition site is muted on reduction, it retains some attraction for the ring. What if the recognition site was attractive initially and then became repulsive? This question was answered by turning to radical chemistry and employing the known stabilization behavior of a bipyridinium radical cation and the bisradical dication, generated on reduction of the CBPQT 4 + ring, to pluck rings out of solution and thread them over the charged end of the pump portion of a semidumbbell. On subsequent oxidation, the pump is primed and the rings pass through a one-way door, given a little thermal energy, onto a collecting-chain where they find themselves accumulating where they would rather not be present. In this manner, an artificial molecular pump mimics the pumping machinery commonplace in biological systems. Looking beyond this state-of-the-art artificial molecular pump, we discuss, from a theoretical standpoint, the measures that would need to be taken in order to render its operation autonomous...|$|R

By combining information derived from the low-resolution x-ray structure of the 70 S ribosome (providing the overall fold), high-resolution structures of the ribosomal subunits (providing the local structure), sequences, and secondary structures, we have developed an atomic model of the T. thermophilus ribosome using a homology modeling approach. Our model is stereochemically sound with a consistent single-species sequence. The overall folds of the three ribosomal ribonucleic acids in our model are consistent with those in the low-resolution crystal structure (root mean-square differences are all < 1. 9 Å). The large overall interface area (∼ 2500 Å 2) of intersubunit bridges B 2 a, B 3, and B 5, and the inherent flexibility in regions connecting the contact residues are consistent with these bridges serving as anchoring patches for the <b>ratcheting</b> and rolling <b>motions</b> between the two subunits during translocation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In recent single-particle {{tracking}} (SPT) {{measurements on}} Listeria monocytogenes motility in vitro, the actin-based stochastic {{dynamics of the}} bacterium movement is analyzed statistically (Kuo and McGrath, 2000). The mean-square displacement (MSD) of the detrended trajectory exhibit a linear behavior; {{it has been suggested}} that a corresponding analysis for the Brownian ratchet model (Peskin, Odell, & Oster, 1993) leads to a non-monotonic MSD. A simplified version of the Brownian <b>ratchet,</b> when its <b>motion</b> is limited by the bacterium movement, is proposed and analyzed stochastically. Analytical results for the simple model are obtained and statistical data analysis is investigated. The MSD of the stochastic bacterium movement is a quadratic function while the MSD for the detrended trajectory is shown to be linear. The mean velocity and effective diffusion constant of the propelled bacterium in the long-time limit, and the short-time relaxation are obtained from the MSD analysis. The MSD of the gap between actin and the bacterium exhibits an oscillatory behavior when there is a large resistant force from the bacterium. The stochastic model for actin-based motility is also mathematically equivalent to a model for integrate-and-firing neurons. Hence our mathematical results have applications in other biological problems. For comparison, a continuous formalism of the BR model with great analytical simplicity is also studied.

40|$|Biological {{functions}} of macromolecules and their assemblages play critical roles {{in a living}} cell. Comprehending such a biological mechanism helps us understand better the biological phenomena of the human body, in part, the mysteries of its functions. More importantly, it enables us to propose many viable suggestions for improving human life {{in a variety of}} ways (e. g. medical innovation). ^ Computational approaches such as molecular dynamics (MD) and various coarse-grained elastic network models (ENMs) have emerged as powerful tools to comprehend and analyze biological functions and malfunctions otherwise inaccessible, thereby contributing to understanding functional disorders which may eventually cause diseases in the human body. Despite their technical and theoretical contributions, some drawbacks such as a limitation of computational efficiency in MD or the loss of local dynamics information in coarse-grained ENMs have also been observed in utilizing those computational tools. ^ In the study of molecular dynamics, functional conformational changes can be largely resolved into hinge and shear motions (Gerstein 1998) and they are associated with the collective behavior of rigid domains involved (i. e. secondary structures). Therefore, we hypothesize that the global dynamics of large macromolecules can be described by using only several DOFs strongly related to collective motions of the systems rather than bringing their full DOFs into play, which is computationally so expensive. ^ From this hypothesis, we develop a reduced DOF model called hybrid ENM in which rigid domains are represented as rigid clusters while all of the flexible regions (i. e. hinge, loop, and etc) are modeled in atomic detail to present the local dynamics. Hybrid ENM enables us to not only handle very large macromolecules in a PC but also represent global and local dynamics efficiently without loss of generality. A variety of applications addressed in this study show its potential and effectiveness as an innovative tool for the study of macromolecular structure and dynamics. ^ In this dissertation, the mathematical description for hybrid ENM is fully derived from conventional coarse-grained ENM and applied to 70 S ribosome, a very large macromolecule containing over ten thousands residues, in order to understand the global <b>ratchet</b> like <b>motions</b> and the complete cycle of tRNA translocation. Hybrid ENM is also utilized to predict folding pathways of antithrombin (1 E 05). A nascent polypeptide chain of antithrombin which includes at least the first four Cysteine residues is modeled using hybrid ENM to investigate the topological role of disulfide bonds (SS) and the effect of Carbohydrate (CHO) structure in the co-translational folding of antithrombin. ^ Hybrid ENM is also applicable to fracture mechanics. The interaction between polymer matrix and nano/micro size particles is modeled at atomic level in order to understand the physics of the deformation and the fracture processes at crack tips of polymer composites. Even a 2 -D simple lattice model explains well the phenomena observed in many previous experiments. A 3 -D ENM is also investigated to obtain more realistic simulation results. ^ Another contribution of this dissertation is the development of UMass Morph Server (UMMS) which provides both harmonic and anharmonic analysis tools online for anyone who are not mathematically oriented to directly adopt these methodologies to his/her studies. UMMS cannot only cross-validate the NMA and/or pathway generated by other morph servers, but also provide several unique features such as symmetry-constrained, rigid-cluster, and hybrid ENMs. ^ Consequently, hybrid ENM can play an important role in the study of macromolecular dynamics and fracture mechanics of polymer composites by achieving both computational efficiency and physical realism of the simulation. ...|$|R
