40|$|Abstract Irradiance at a {{point on}} a {{receiver}} due to a uniformly emitting polygon luminaire, or equivalently, thedifferential area to polygon form factor, is of fundamental interest in computer graphics. An elegant closed-form expression attributed to Lambert, dating from the 18 th century, is the most commonlyused formula for the problem. This document provides several alternatives to Lambert's formula, {{all of which are}} summations on the vertices of the source polygon rather than the edges. A term ina vertex-based summation {{is a function of the}} vertex position and the local behavior of the incident edges. The summations may be evaluated in any order and are therefore suited to algorithms wherepolygon contours are constructed incrementally. 1 Introduction The fundamental <b>radiometric</b> <b>quantity</b> is radiance, the radiant power carried along a line [2].

40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{determine}} the electron density, n(e), of an argon plasma jet using the continuum radiation. The radiation measurements are calibrated with a standard tungsten filament lamp. Due to the filamentary nature of these plasmas, {{it is not possible}} to use the spectral radiance Wm(- 2) nm(- 1) sr(- 1) as the <b>radiometric</b> <b>quantity.</b> Instead we work with the spectral irradiance Wm(- 2) nm(- 1). As the ionization degree is low, the continuum radiation is predominantly generated by interactions of electron with atoms; the influence of electron-ion interactions can be neglected. The method provides n(e) values of about 7 x 10 (19) m(- 3) in the active zone for an argon plasma created by a sinusoidal peak to peak voltage of 10 kV. Comparison with the n(e) values determined via the current density shows a fair agreement; this comparison can only be done for the region between the electrodes. In the afterglow region, where the current-density method cannot be applied, we can still use the continuum radiation to determine n(e). It is observed that n(e) decreases in the afterglow direction down to 2 x 10 (17) m(- 3) ...|$|E

Although the GOCI has shown excellent radiometric performance with little long-term radiometric degradation {{and a high}} signal-to-noise ratio, there are radiometric artefacts in GOCI Level 1 products caused by stray light detected within the GOCI optics.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{technique is}} presented for computing radiance distributions in natural waters that have wind-blown surfaces and depth-dependent inherent optical properties. Input to the numerical model {{consists of the}} radiance distribution incident on the air-water surface from above, the wind velocity, which specifies the state of randomness of the air-water surface via a wind speed-wave slope spectrum, the volume scattering and volume attenuation functions of the water body as functions of depth and wavelength, {{and the type of}} bottom boundary. Primary output from the model consists of directionallv discretized radiances as functions of wavelength, direction, and depth throughout and above the water body. General knowledge of the radiance dis-tribution in a water body is a prerequisite for solving more specific problems, such as those occurring in studies of underwater vis-ibility, remote sensing of the oceans from aircraft or satellites, heating of the upper layers of the oceans, or photosynthesis. Moreover, since radiance is the fundamen-tal <b>radiometric</b> <b>quantity,</b> if the radiance is known then all other quantities of interest, such as the irradiance, are easily obtained. Unfortunately, measurement of radiance is a difficult and expensive task in the ocean environment, and few systematic studies of radiance have been made in natural waters.

The {{purpose of}} this mise en pratique, {{prepared}} by the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR) of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and formally adopted by the CIPM, is to provide guidance on how the candela and related units used in photometry and radiometry can be realized in practice. The scope of the mise en pratique recognizes {{the fact that the}} two fields of photometry and radiometry and their units are closely related through the current definition of the SI base unit for the photometric quantity, luminous intensity: the candela. The previous version of the mise en pratique was applied only to the candela whereas this updated version covers the realization of the candela and other related units used for photometric and <b>radiometric</b> <b>quantities.</b> Recent advances in the generation and manipulation of individual photons show great promise of producing radiant fluxes with a well-established number of photons. Thus, this mise en pratique also includes information on the practical realization of units for photometric and <b>radiometric</b> <b>quantities</b> using photon-number-based techniques. In the following, for units used for photometric and <b>radiometric</b> <b>quantities,</b> the shorter term, photometric and radiometric units, is generally used. Section 1 describes the definition of the candela which introduces a close relationship between photometric and radiometric units.

40|$|Actinic flux is a <b>radiometric</b> <b>quantity</b> {{of great}} {{importance}} for atmospheric chemistry due to its necessity for the calculation of photolysis rates of different compounds. The photolysis of important species such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde is activated in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum and regulates the oxidizing ability of the atmosphere. However, systematic actinic flux measurements are not available, since ultraviolet radiation measurement stations usually measure global irradiance. Evidently, it is {{of great importance}} not only {{to examine the relationship}} between the two quantities, but also to enable the use of irradiance measurements in order to calculate photolysis rates. In the framework of the present thesis, a theoretical study of actinic flux variations was made using the TUV radiative transfer model. This study included the effect of different atmospheric parameters such as ozone, aerosol optical depth, ground albedo etc. to spectral actinic flux and photolysis rates of ozone J(Ο 1 D) and nitrogen dioxide J(NO 2). Differences appear in the way that actinic flux and global irradiance are affected by the changes of these parameters. Specifically, actinic flux variations tend to be more solar zenith angle dependent than variations of irradiance. Consequently, an empirical method to calculate photolysis rates of ozone J(Ο 1 D), nitrogen dioxide J(NO 2) and formaldehyde J(HCHO) from spectral irradiance measurements in Thessaloniki was developed and tested. The method can reproduce ozone and formaldehyde photolysis rates with an acceptable standard deviation (2 σ). Namely, the ratio of photolysis rates calculated by this method to those calculated by actinic flux, was found to be 1. 001 ± 0. 052 (2 σ) for J(O 1 D), 1. 001 ± 0. 124 (2 σ) for J(NO 2) and 1. 001 ± 0. 06 (2 σ), 1. 001 ± 0. 068 (2 σ) for the two photolysis reaction of formaldehyde. Using both the measured and calculated photolysis rates, the effect of clouds and aerosols on J(Ο 1 D) and J(NO 2) photolysis rates was examined. These two parameters seem both to effect photolysis rates more profoundly as the solar zenith angle increases while for J(NO 2) and low solar zenith angles the effect it is very small. Enhancements of photolysis rates were observed even for cases with extensive cloud cover when the solar disk is visible. Finally, the implementation of the empirical method mentioned above to the spectral irradiance measurements from the Brewer spectroradiometer working in LAP, for the period 1993 - 2003 can produce a photolysis rates time series (J(Ο 1 D), J(NO 2). and J(HCHO)) for this period. Mean values and standard deviation was examined for monthly values from a mean year extracted from these measurements, as well as the trends for this period for solar zenith angles of 63 and 30 degrees for the J(NO 2). If the annual variability of the photolysis rates values is approached using the TUV model, it is essential to use variable single scattering albedo values and not a standard value throughout the year. Moreover, the increasing trend of the J(NO 2) can not be reproduced by the model simply by taking into account the aerosol optical depth variability, but also the use of higher single scattering albedo values seems to be necessary, implying less absorbing aerosols than previous years in the atmosphere of Thessaloniki. ...|$|E
