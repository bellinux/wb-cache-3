2500|$|The song is not {{recorded}} earlier than 1876, {{when it was}} published in Boston, Massachusetts. The song's placement in the section of the book entitled [...] "Songs from English and German Universities" [...] suggests a British origin. [...] It was also published by Francis Brothers and Day in London in 1884 as a work written and composed by James Yorkston, of Edinburgh, with music arranged by Edmund Forman. The London edition states that it was <b>reprinted</b> <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> of Kohler and Son of Edinburgh, implying that the first edition was in Scotland, though no copies of it have been located. According to Siobhán Marie Kilfeather the song is from the music hall style of the period, and while one cannot wholly dismiss the possibility that it is [...] "based on an older folk song", [...] "neither melody nor words bear any relationship to the Irish tradition of street ballads." [...] She describes the story of the historical Molly as [...] "nonsense". The song is in a familiar tragi-comic mode popular in this period, probably influenced by earlier songs with a similar theme, such as Percy Montrose's [...] "My Darling Clementine", which was written in about 1880.|$|E
