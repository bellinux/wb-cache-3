As most local coral growth stops at about 150 feet below the ocean surface, such a massive stony coral base suggests a gradual isostatic subsidence of the underlying extinct volcano, which itself rises 10,000 feet from the surrounding ocean floor. Shallow water fossils taken from just above Enewetak's basalt base are dated to about 55 mya.|$|E

40|$|Abstract––This paper {{presents}} the experimental <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> 10 mm diameter holes in 20 mm thick CFRP composite laminate using HSS, Solid Carbide (K 20) and Poly Crystalline Diamond insert drills. The effect of feed rates, cutting speeds and {{the geometry of}} drill on delamination, surface roughness, cutting forces and chip formation are studied. The experimental results show that delamination free drilling process may be obtained by the proper selections of drill point geometry and the process parameters. However, at high spindle speed and lower feed rate the heat generation due to friction between cutting edges and the work material facilitate softening of the matrix which resulted in poor surface finish and lower delamination. Carbide drill produced serrated or non homogeneous chips at low speeds. Reduced number of cutting edges resulted in increased force. Hardness of drill material also influences variation in cutting forces. Keywords––Drilling, Tool geometry, CFRP, Delamination. I...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of high tool wear {{concerning}} machining of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), it is desirable to study new processes and techniques which are able to lower the wear and thus induced costs.
