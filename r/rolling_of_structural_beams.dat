40|$|Measurement and {{monitoring}} <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> components such as beams and columns under loading {{are important in}} structural analysis and design assessment. Presently, the assessment on structural components on deformation or displacement measurement is carried out through LVDTs or dial gauges. The LVDTs or dial gauges were installed {{in contact with the}} structural components, also known as contact method. However, present contact method is subjected to some limitations such as s displacement points of measurement are highly depend on the position of LVDTs available, reliability of LVDTs and dial gauges to measure during the experiments due to possibility of damage sensors and consumption of time on the installation the sensors. Due to the limitations of contact method, this study demonstrates the use of a noncontact method using digital close range photogrammetry technique to measure the deformational behaviour <b>of</b> full-scale <b>structural</b> <b>beams</b> and columns. In this study, a full-scale load tests on structural components were performed under laboratory conditions. A series of digital images <b>of</b> the <b>structural</b> <b>beams</b> and columns under various loads were captured using Nikon DSLR cameras. The digital images then processed and analyzed using digital close range photogrammetric technique to measure and extract the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>structural</b> <b>beam</b> and column displacements. The deformation and displacement of beam and columns have been validated by comparing the photogrammetric outputs against the results obtained from the LVDTs. The statistical analysis shows the differences obtained between the photogrammetric technique and contact method used were not significant...|$|R

Indeed, when NIST published its final report, it noted [...] "the scarcity of physical evidence" [...] that it had had at its disposal to investigate the collapses.

40|$|A new {{generation}} composite sandwich {{made up of}} glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and lightweight but high strength core material has been developed in Australia. Experimental investigation was conducted to determine the behaviour of this composite sandwich {{with a view of}} using this material for <b>structural</b> <b>beam.</b> As these sandwiches are produced in limited thicknesses, the <b>structural</b> <b>beam</b> section could be attained by gluing a number of sandwiches in the flatwise (horizontal) or edgewise (vertical) positions. Characterisation of the behaviour of individual sandwiches as well as beams with 2, 3 and 4 composite sandwiches glued together was conducted. The results showed that the composite sandwiches in the edgewise position has a 9 % lower effective modulus of elasticity in bending than in the flatwise position. However, it failed at a 20 % higher load with a different failure mode. The specimens in the edgewise position failed with greater ductility due to progressive failure of the fibre composite skins while the specimens in the flatwise position failed in a brittle manner due to core shear failure followed by delamination between the skin and the core. These initial results are very encouraging. With further investigation, the development <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>beams</b> from these fibre composite sandwiches could be realised...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicromechanical schemes {{based on}} the {{discrete}} homogenization method are developed to predict the effective mechanical properties of 3 D dry textiles, including the bending moduli, and accounting for internal scale effects by the consideration of additional rotational degrees of freedom at the mesoscopic level. The unit of repeat identified for a given interlock is represented as a set <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>beam</b> like elements that defines the representative volume element (RVE), with periodicity boundary conditions. The complex interactions between yarns within the RVE lead to a non affine motion of the yarns responsible for internal scale effects, which are accounted for by a micropolar anisotropic continuum obtained by the discrete homogenization method. The Cosserat moduli are identified together with the associated internal bending lengths versus the microstructural geometrical and mechanical parameters that characterize the internal organization of yarns within each preform. A satisfactory agreement is obtained between the effective classical and nonclassical moduli predicted by homogenization and those computed by finite element simulations...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{composite}} {{sandwich structure}} {{made up of}} glass fibre composite skins and modified phenolic core material has been developed for civil engineering applications. The satisfactory performance of this composite sandwich material as structural panels in several building and residential projects has shown {{the possibility of using}} this material in the development <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>beams.</b> As these composite sandwich panels are manufactured in limited thicknesses, the <b>structural</b> <b>beam</b> section could be attained by gluing a number of sandwich panels together in the flatwise or edgewise positions. An experimental study of the flexural behaviour of the glue-laminated (glulam) composite sandwich beams with different orientations of sandwich laminations was evaluated to determine the most effective use of this composite material for <b>structural</b> <b>beam</b> applications. The effects of wrapping the glulam sandwich beams with one-layer of tri-axial glass fibres on the flexural behaviour were also examined. The glulam sandwich beams with edgewise laminations showed better structural performance compared to the beams with flatwise laminations due to the introduction of the vertical fibre composite skins. The glulam beams with edgewise sandwich laminations failed with 25 % higher bending strength and almost similar bending stiffness than beams with flatwise laminations. The glulam sandwich beams with fibre wraps behaved slightly stiffer compared to the sandwich beams without wraps. In addition, the presence of fibre wraps prevented the immediate failure of the glulam beams which resulted in a higher strength and more ductile failure behaviour. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Castellated beam {{is a kind}} of holed {{web plate}} <b>structural</b> <b>beam,</b> since it has many advantages: savings in steel, light self-weight, resists bending and easy to deploy, the {{application}} <b>of</b> this <b>structural</b> <b>beam</b> becomes more and more widely. Due to its weakened web plate, castellated beam would be affected by shear effects greatly. The deformation of components increased under the affects of external loads. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of finite element analysis model, by consideration of the shearing effects and the bending stiffness affected under opened structure, this issue made improvement based on the theory of curved beams. By compare the results from this issue and the result from the analytical model of shell elements; we verify the feasibility of this method...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{the level}} and pattern of moments applied in the manual {{assembly}} of a space structure were made in extravehicular activity (EVA) and neutral buoyancy simulation (NBS). The Experimental Assembly of Structures in EVA program included the repeated assembly of a 3. 6 m tetrahedral truss structure in EVA on STS- 61 B after extensive neutral buoyancy crew training. The flight and training structures were of equivalent mass and geometry to allow a direct correlation between EVA and NBS performance.

40|$|Current {{methods used}} to monitor the strain and stress within {{structures}} such as bridges and high-rise buildings are not suitable over a 24 -hour or weekly period. Furthermore, these methods are not mobile or compact. This study aims to determine whether using photogrammetric techniques with both colour and NIR (near-infrared) images are suitable for <b>structural</b> <b>beam</b> deformation monitoring during loading in a low-light environment. The following are the objectives this study aims to achieve: 1. To determine whether 3 D measurements captured from NIR images and colour images are in similar context in different lighting conditions. 2. To evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} measurements obtained by Near Infrared and Colour Images. 3. To evaluate the suitability of Near Infrared and Colour photogrammetry for various <b>structural</b> <b>beam</b> materials. In order to achieve these requirements, research was conducted to determine the best way to use these techniques. There were two experiments conducted. One experiment was conducted in the laboratory on testing strain and stress <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>beams,</b> whilst the other was conducted on a bridge to determine if the structure could be observed. Photographs were obtained from these simulations and were examined using the photogrammetric program ‘Australis’. With this program, photogrammetric bundle adjustments were conducted for experiments which were taken with both colour and NIR imagery. These bundles produced coordinates that were examined to view the beams at various levels of strain as well as the bridge structure to determine if the coordinates were in the same parameters. To conclude, this study was successful in determining whether colour and NIR imagery were in similar context in monitoring <b>structural</b> <b>beams</b> and a bridge structure. Further work is recommended in relation to considering additional factors, such as rain and foggy weather conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the behaviour <b>of</b> innovative <b>structural</b> <b>beams</b> made by gluing together a number of composite sandwich panels in the flatwise and in the edgewise positions is presented in this paper. The building block of these innovative beams is a composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and modified phenolic foam core material. Four-point static bending and asymmetrical beam shear tests were conducted to evaluate the strength and stiffness <b>of</b> these <b>structural</b> <b>beams.</b> The effect <b>of</b> the number and orientation of sandwich laminations on the behaviour of the glue-laminated sandwich beams is investigated. Results showed that beams tested in the edgewise position failed with higher strength but have slightly lower bending stiffness than beams in the flatwise position. More importantly, the specimens in the edgewise position failed with greater ductility due to the progressive failure of the vertical fibre composite skins while the specimens in the flatwise position failed in a brittle manner due to compressive failure of the fibre composite skins. Under shear loading, the behaviour of the sandwich beams in the flatwise position is governed by the shear strength of the core while in the edgewise position by the shear strength of the fibre composite skin. The results of the theoretical {{evaluation of}} the flexural and shear strengths of the sandwich beams were in good agreement with the experimental results.

40|$|The moment {{capacity}} <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>beams</b> {{is influenced}} by the presence of shear in the beam. In general, the presence of shear reduces the moment carrying capacity of the beam. Thus, the design of beam-to-column connections using capacity design concept should consider the presence of shear in the beam. Current design code specifications for design of beam-to-column connections do not consider the effect of reduction in maximum developable moment capacity in the beam, due to the presence of shear. This may result in the heavier connections. In this paper, the interaction between shear and moment, for various AISC beam sections is investigated. Shear-moment curves are analytically developed for a spectrum of AICS sections. It is observed that the shear-moment interaction for the AISC sections may be represented using straight lines. This interaction is used to estimate the maximum shear and moment that is likely to be developed in the beam during extreme earthquake shaking. These shear and moment estimates can be used to design the connections for the beam-column interface. Beam length-to-depth ratios for which the shear-moment interaction becomes significant are calculated. It is shown that for deep beams, neglecting the presence of shear can overestimate the design moment demands, and underestimate the design shear demands for the beam-to-column connections...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental investigation into the flexural and shear behaviour of glue-laminated (glulam) fibre composite sandwich beams with a view of using this material for structural applications. The building block <b>of</b> these <b>structural</b> <b>beams</b> is a new generation composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and high strength core material. In the experimental investigation, beams with 1, 2, 3, and 4 composite sandwich panels glued together were subjected to 4 -point static bending and asymmetrical beam shear tests in the flatwise and in the edgewise positions. The results of the flexural test showed that the glulam sandwich beams in the edgewise position failed with higher strength but have slightly lower bending stiffness than beams in the flatwise position. The results however indicated that the bending stiffness of the flatwise specimens converges to that of the edgewise specimens with increasing laminations. More importantly, the specimens in the edgewise position failed with greater ductility due to the progressive failure of the fibre composite skins while the specimens in the flatwise position failed in a brittle manner due to debonding between the skin and core. Under shear loading, the behaviour of the sandwich beams is significantly influenced by the shear strength and modulus of the fibre composite skin. It has been demonstrated that the glue-laminated sandwich beams exhibited better performance than the individual sandwich beams. The results of the study suggest the high possibility of using composite sandwich construction in the development <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> laminated <b>beams...</b>|$|R

Experiments {{have been designed to}} measure the time-to-failure of notched samples under near-constant load. Cracking during galvanizing is caused by liquid-metal embrittlement, and occurs for critical combinations of stress and susceptible material. Sources of stress are residual stresses including those from flame cutting, and thermal stresses from thermal gradients during hot dipping. Material susceptibility is related primarily to surface hardness, and correlates well with micro-hardness measured at 100 µm depth. Remedial measures to eliminate cracking require either reduction of the hardness below a critical level (270 Vickers), or reduction of residual and thermal stresses...|$|R
