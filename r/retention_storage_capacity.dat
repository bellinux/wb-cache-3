40|$|Soil {{moisture}} recharge was {{studied in}} quaking aspen and Gambel oak forest areas of central Utah. The rate, timing, {{and duration of}} the recharge period was observed. Soil moisture readings were taken periodically throughout the winter of 1966 - 1967. Soil moisture recharge begins in October and continues until May. The period of most rapid increase in recharge is between February and May. This corresponds to a rapid decrease in the zenith angle of the sun at {{the surface of the}} area and also to a decrease in cloud cover over the area. Deep soils and high infiltration capacities prevent surface runoff from the area. Both detention storage and <b>retention</b> <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> of the soils are high. Soil freezing was not present during the winter months. Some patchy soil freezing is found in the spring but it is not extensive enough to influence the recharge phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Greens roofs, {{also known}} as ecoroofs or living roofs, provide {{numerous}} ecosystem services and are becoming widely integrated into urban stormwater management systems. Despite a long and robust history of green roof projects in Portland, Oregon, there is a distinct lack of research on in situ performance. This thesis addressed this gap by investigating the hydrologic performance of five green roofs in Portland for a time period spanning November through February. Despite difficulty with the sensor calibrations, our analysis of moisture content data from these roofs revealed variation in: (1) total evapotranspiration, {{which serves as a}} proxy for total stormwater <b>retention,</b> and (2) <b>storage</b> <b>capacity,</b> which was defined as the difference between average maximum and minimum substrate volumetric water content measured under field conditions. Evapotranspiration was predicted by <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> following first order growth using non-linear regression analysis, suggesting that increasing <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> should correspond with increases in evapotranspiration and retention up until an inflection point of possibly 8 - 9 mm beyond which the effect diminishes. <b>Storage</b> <b>capacity</b> was further shown to be correlated with substrate properties such as organic matter content and coefficient of curvature. Finally, retention values of 13. 4 % - 32. 8 % for Portland’s rainy season in 2015 - 2016 were found to be substantially lower than optimal annual values reported in other studies in Portland as well as cities around the world. This suggests that Portland’s green roofs may not perform as well as expected during months of high precipitation, which are the times when hydrologic performance is most critical. Further research should consider seasonal green roof performance in the Pacific Northwest and also revisit <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> as a parameter to include in future design standards...|$|R
40|$|Green roofs {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the volume of {{polluted}} stormwater that is generated by cities. Modelling rainfall retention is critical, but green roof water balance models often rely on the physical properties of substrates. In these models, substrate water holding capacity (WHC) determines the depth of water which can be stored before runoff is generated; whereas, the permanent wilting point (PWP) limits evapotranspiration. The WHC and PWP, as well as plant available water (PAW; where PAW = WHC − PWP), as determined from laboratory tests, may not truly reflect how substrates perform on green roofs. We therefore ran a simulated rainfall experiment on green roof modules to (i) compare the rainfall retention of vegetated and non-vegetated substrates with different WHC and PAW, and (ii) relate <b>retention</b> to substrate <b>storage</b> <b>capacity,</b> as calculated from laboratory measures of WHC and PAW. We found that the PAW of a substrate is a better indicator of evapotranspiration and retention when compared with WHC. However, we also found that substrates always retained less water than their calculated <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> would suggest, most likely being due to their high permeability. Our results indicate that using laboratory-derived measures of WHC and PAW in green roof models may be over-estimating both evapotranspiration and rainfall retention...|$|R

The research work carried out in 2011 in an experimental area on Haplic Chernozem/FAO, medium-heavy loam soil. The experimental area was divided into two parts, the topsoil layer on these surfaces was processed by both classic and minimization technologies. The plots were sown by spring barley. The applied measurements of water infiltration into the soil were two-cylinder method and MiniDisc. Within {{the vicinity of the}} infiltration experiments with intact soil were collected samples for laboratory determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity. From the field measurements and laboratory experiments were determined values of hydraulic conductivity (saturated and unsaturated), and other infiltration characteristics, the cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate. To evaluate the infiltration of the heats was used three-paramether Philp type equation that provides a good estimate of saturated hydraulic conductivity. For the evaluation of the MiniDisc there was used the Zangova method that provides the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The laboratory evaluation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity was compared with the estimated values obtained from the field measurements. The values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity from the laboratory measurements are closely comparable with estimates obtained from the steady infiltration rates from the field experiments. The research results also showed that medium-heavy loam soil, when being processed by minimization including modification of the soil surface by digging, {{have a positive effect on}} the infiltration of water into the soil.

Estimation of the CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is straightforward {{and is based on}} recoverable reserves, reservoir properties and in situ CO 2 characteristics. In the case of CO 2 -EOR, the CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> can be roughly evaluated on the basis of worldwide field experience or more accurately through numerical simulations. Determination of the theoretical CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> in coal beds is based on coal thickness and CO 2 adsorption isotherms, and recovery and completion factors. Evaluation of the CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> in deep saline aquifers is very complex because four trapping mechanisms that act at different rates are involved and, at times, all mechanisms may be operating simultaneously.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mathematical analysis of water supply reservoir operation. The analysis illustrates one-stage, two-stage, and three-stage formulations of multiple-period reservoir operation {{depending on the}} effects of operational constraints. There is a one-stage model when <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> constraints are nonbinding. Release decisions depend on total water availability and exhibit equal marginal utilities. Binding upper (lower) <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint blocks the effect of decreased (increased) water availability in the subsequent stages on release decisions in the preceding stages. When one <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint is binding, multiple periods become two stages and a gap occurs between marginal utilities of water.

40|$|As a {{promising}} technology to improve shale gas (SG) recovery and CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>capacity,</b> the multi-well pads (MWPs) scheme has gained {{more and more}} attention. The semi-analytical pressure-buildup method {{has been used to}} estimate CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>capacity.</b> It focuses on single multi-fractured horizontal wells (SMFHWs) and does not consider multi-well pressure interference (MWPI) induced by the MWPs scheme. This severely limits the application of this method as incidences of multi-well pressure interference have been widely reported. This paper proposed a new methodology to optimize the injection strategy of the MWPs scheme and maximize CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>capacity.</b> The new method implements numerical discretization, the superposition theory, Gauss elimination, and the Stehfest numerical algorithm to obtain pressure-buildup solutions for the MWPs scheme. The solution by the new method was validated with numerical simulation and pressure-buildup curves were generated to identify MWPI. Using the new method, we observed that the fracture number and fracture half-length have a positive influence on CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>capacity.</b> Both can be approximately related to the CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> by a linear correlation.
