40|$|Continuous “always-on ” {{monitoring}} {{is beneficial}} {{for a number}} of applications, but potentially imposes a high load in terms of communication, storage and power consumption when a large number of variables need to be monitored. We introduce two new <b>filtering</b> techniques, <b>swing</b> <b>filters</b> and slide filters, that represent within a prescribed precision a time-varying numerical signal by a piecewise linear function, consisting of connected line segments for <b>swing</b> <b>filters</b> and (mostly) disconnected line segments for slide filters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>swing</b> and slide <b>filters</b> in terms of their compression power by applying them to a reallife data set plus a variety of synthetic data sets. For nearly all combinations of signal behavior and precision requirements, the proposed techniques outperform the earlier approaches for online filtering in terms of data reduction. The slide filter, in particular, consistently dominates all other filters, with up to twofold improvement over the best of the previous techniques. 1...|$|R

60|$|Daily {{life in a}} {{house where}} there are young and old is full of curious little ceremonies and pieties, which are {{discharged}} quite punctually, though the meaning of them is obscure, and a mystery has come to brood over them which lends even a superstitious charm to their performance. Such was the nightly ceremony of the cigar and the glass of port, which {{were placed on the}} right hand and on the left hand of Mr. Hilbery, and simultaneously Mrs. Hilbery and Katharine left the room. All the years they had lived together they had never seen Mr. Hilbery smoke his cigar or drink his port, and they would have felt it unseemly if, by chance, they had surprised him as he sat there. These short, but clearly marked, periods of separation between the sexes were always used for an intimate postscript to what had been said at dinner, the sense of being women together coming out most strongly when the male sex was, as if by some religious rite, secluded from the female. Katharine knew by heart the sort of mood that possessed her as she walked upstairs to the drawing-room, her mother's arm in hers; and she could anticipate the pleasure with which, when she had turned on the lights, they both regarded the drawing-room, fresh swept and set in order for the last section of the day, with the <b>red</b> parrots <b>swinging</b> on the chintz curtains, and the arm-chairs warming in the blaze. Mrs. Hilbery stood over the fire, with one foot on the fender, and her skirts slightly raised.|$|R

She was immediately overwhelmed by the décor; the walls adorned with fine paintings, the ornate, carved furniture, and the heavy red velvet draperies, which were drawn against the afternoon light. The only illumination {{in the room was}} the glow of soft light emanating from concealed lighting in the room. The other guest in attendance was an older man whom White introduced as Reginald Ronalds. The luncheon table was laid with food, which to Evelyn was an exotic delight — gourmet dishes prepared by Delmonico's restaurant. She was allowed one glass of champagne. Afterwards, they all ascended two flights up into a room decorated in green where a large, <b>red</b> velvet <b>swing</b> was suspended from the ceiling by ropes entwined with ivy-like vines. Evelyn was amused by the swing and consented to sit in it as White, with increasing momentum, propelled her vigorously into the air. A game ensued whereby Edna Goodrich held a Japanese paper parasol by a cord; the object was for Evelyn's foot to target the parasol, repeatedly swinging and aiming until the parasol was shredded. Nothing improper took place that day other than an aesthetic delight in the day’s festivities.|$|R
40|$|Ceramic filters have {{revealed}} {{to have good}} thermal resistance and chemical corrosion resistance, but they are brittle and lack of toughness, and liable to rupture under large temperature <b>swings.</b> Metallic <b>filters</b> with their high strength and toughness and good heat conduction ability have showed good thermal shock resistance, 310 S and FeAl intermetallic filter elements have exhibited additionally good chemical corrosion resistance in oxidizing and sulfidizing atmosphere(Sawada 1999 and Sunil et al. 1999). The behavior of metallic filter elements at high temperature was investigated and the filtration efficiency of the filter units for hot gas from a coal gasifier unit was tested. Pulse-jet cleaning of filter elements is a key component {{in the operation of}} the filtration unit. The pulse-jet is introduced into the filter element cavities from the clean side, and the dust cakes on the outer surfaces of the filter elements are detached and fall into the filter vessel. Sequential on-line cleaning of filter element groups yields a filter operation with no shutdown for filter regeneration. Development of advanced technologies in the design and operation of the pulse cleaning is one of the important tasks in order to increase the system reliability, to improve the filter life and to increase the filtering performance. The regeneration of filter element in gas filtration at high temperature plays a very important role for the operation of the process. Based on experimental observation and field operation, a numerical model is set up to numerically simulate the momentum and heat transport phenomena in the regeneration process, which is essential for understanding of the process, the optimization of process parameters and improvement of the design of the structure of venturi nozzle and the configuration of the apparatus...|$|R
5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a <b>red</b> flag would <b>swing</b> into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{considers}} how the LGBT movement might pursue legal equality — alongside lived equality — {{now that}} same-sex couples enjoy {{the freedom to}} marry across the United States. In particular, it focuses on the passage of antidiscrimination laws in <b>swing</b> states and <b>red</b> states. While this objective may sound familiar — perhaps even passé — the political dynamics and strategic dilemmas that it presents are unprecedented.

Next, it argues that the LGBT movement will undergo two strategic shifts in pursuing this work — first, an increased investment in local rather than national lobbying, and second, an increased investment in <b>red</b> states and <b>swing</b> states, as opposed to blue states. Finally, the chapter claims that the LGBT movement will confront two strategic dilemmas in pursuing this work — whether to lobby for piecemeal bills or package deals, and how to use litigation and lobbying in ways that support each other. Without attempting to resolve the first dilemma, it argues that lobbyists must not entertain exemptions that apply only to claims brought by LGBT plaintiffs — or more broadly, any protections that fall short of what might reasonably be achieved through litigation under existing antidiscrimination laws...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen is an {{important}} element in the chemistry of the solar system objects given its abundance and its presence in many molecules including H 2 O 80 % of cometary ices). The analysis of oxygen atoms in comets can provide information not only on the comets themselves but also on the solar system. These atoms have been analyzed using the 3 forbidden oxygen lines [OI] observed in emission in the optical region at 5577. 339 Å (the green line), 6300. 304 Å and 6363. 776 Å (the <b>red</b> lines) (<b>Swings,</b> 1962). Our analysis is based on a sample of 12 comets of various origins. The observing material is made of 53 high signal-to-noise spectra obtained with the high-resolution UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT from 2002 to 2012 (Manfroid et al, 2009). After noticing that the green line is blended with one C 2 line, we built synthetic spectra of C 2 for each observing circumstances and we subtracted its contribution to the cometary spectra in order to ensure the decontamination of the 5577 Å line. Then, we measured the intensity of the 3 [OI] lines at different heliocentric distances. By comparing the green to red lines ratio (G/R) with the Bhardwaj & Raghuram (2012) effective excitation rates, we found that H 2 O is the main parent molecule when the comet is observed at 1 au. When the comet is located beyond 2. 5 au from the Sun, CO 2 also contributes to the production of oxygen. Studying forbidden oxygen lines could be a new way to estimate the abundances of CO 2 in comets, a very difficult task from the ground (Decock et al. 2013). In order to estimate the effect of the quenching on our results, we analyzed the evolution of the G/R ratio at different nucleocentric distances. For nearby comets, we divided the extended 2 D spectrum into several zones in order to analyze the oxygen lines {{as close as possible to}} the nucleus (down to ~ 10 km for the closest comets). Their analysis will allow us to study the link of the oxygen lines with the nucleocentric distance. We found a clear variation of the G/R ratio close to the comet nucleus that is in agreement with a contribution from CO 2 as predicted by Raghuram & Bhardwaj (2013) ...|$|R

At the same time, she also appeared with Spanish revue-star Perlita Greco at the Teatro Fuencarral. The revue was revised and re-opened in the summer with the title Modern Melodies at the Teatro Avenida with Myrtle dancing {{in front of the}} band in a costume with <b>red</b> feathers <b>swinging</b> on her backside. One visiting journalist for the Afro-American described her as the Josephine Baker of Spain: “Miss Watkins is a very good dancer, with plenty of pep, and a pretty shapely figure. She is making conquests in high society and on her string is the marquis of one of Spain’s bluest blue bloods. She lives at the Hotel Florida, one of the best hotels in the city, has a fine roadster, records for Spanish gramophone and radio, and entertains at one of the leading cabarets.” In July, after the revue closed, Myrtle appeared at the Florida Bar in Zaragoza and the Cine Odeon in Huesca with Cuban saxophonist, El Negro Aquilino and his troupe. Returning to Madrid in October, Myrtle appeared in a show that might have been filmed, Movietone 1933 with Perlita Greco and Scrappy Jones (from Douglas’s revue). Shortly after, Myrtle joined Louis Douglas on a tour of Italy. Myrtle soon left the tour in March to appear in Seville , Spain. In June 1933, she was in Belgium with the bandleader Robert de Kers. While there, she recorded a new song, Lonely Brown Rose [...] and appeared on the front of Belgian magazines alongside Josephine Baker. In September, while in Barcelona, she appeared at the Teatro Romea, Jazz-Show organized by Italian Impresario Max Guido. The show was a huge success and Myrtle was recognized as Spain’s latest vedette. In November, she moved over to the Pompeya Musichall where she danced all evening, and then after midnight would climb downstairs and sing at the Hollywood nightclub which would be broadcast over the radio. In the winter she appeared at the exclusive Casa Llibre Tea Rooms singing for some of Spain’s elite. That winter, Myrtle accompanied by pianist Tommy ‘Puss’ Chase and his band for a tour of the southern coast of France. “Myrtle was a very enterprising, always had some kind of band with her, and was a very good looking and talented singer and dancer.” They travelled to Cannes, Nice and ended in Monaco during the Rallye Monte Carlo.|$|R
6000|$|The {{particular}} {{success of}} the village was its brace of chestnut trees which, with that noble disregard of triteness {{which is one of}} the charms of villages the whole world over, shadowed the village smithy. On either side of the roadway between it and the paths was a careless width of vivid grass protected by white posts, which gave way to admit a generous access on either hand to a jolly public house, leering over <b>red</b> blinds, and <b>swinging</b> a painted sign against its competitor. Several of the cottages had real thatch and most had porches; they had creepers nailed to their faces, and their gardens, crowded now with flowers, marigolds, begonias, snapdragon, delphiniums, white foxgloves, and monkshood, seemed almost too good to be true. The doctor's house was pleasantly Georgian, and the village shop, which was also a post and telegraph office, lay back with a slight air of repletion, keeping its bulging double shop-windows wide open in a manifest attempt not to fall asleep. Two score of shock-headed boys and pinafored girls were drilling upon a bald space of ground before the village school, and near by, the national emotion at the ever-memorable Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria had evoked an artistic drinking-fountain of grey stone. Beyond the subsequent green--there were the correctest geese thereon--the village narrowed almost to a normal road again, and then, recalling itself with a start, lifted a little to the churchyard wall about the grey and ample church.

40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} I {{introduce}} Callio Lab, an underground centre {{for science and}} R & D in the Pyhäsalmi Mine, Finland, and the new underground measurement hall Lab 2. Furthermore I present the world’s deep underground laboratories (DULs). In addition I cover the main sources of the background radiation for underground laboratories including their effects to specific low background research topics. As a case study I describe the required steps for the concretisation of a deep underground measuring hall and the methods to reduce the radiative background in Lab 2, especially related to radon. Callio Lab {{is one of the}} few deep underground laboratories in the world offering facilities with over-burden of more than 2 000 m. w. e (metres water equivalent), maximum being at 4 000 m. w. e. The deepest currently operating facilities are in Canada (SNOLab, 6 000 m. w. e.) and China (JingPing underground laboratory, 6 800 m. w. e.). The new experimental hall Lab 2 is located at the depth of 1 430 m (approx. 4 000 m. w. e.) in the Pyhäsalmi Mine. The overburden makes the Lab 2 an optimal site for low (muon) background experiments. The value is based on the measurements presented in the Measurements of muon flux in the Pyhäsalmi underground laboratory (T. Enqvist et al., NIM A 554, 2005). Lab 2 was finished during the spring 2016. The Lab 2 consists of two halls: the entrance hall (120 square metres) for handling cargo and the experimental hall (120 square metres). My involvement in the realization of the Lab 2 started in spring 2015 with the preliminary design and ended with the final design. During the design phases I contacted several Finnish suppliers to find documented, low background construction materials to be used in the construction. At the end of the construction I was also involved in the instrumentation of the experimental hall. In the preliminary design the idea was to build a low background experimental hall using low background materials. As these materials were rather expensive the requirements had to be lowered. The main background source in the Lab 2 is the shotcrete walls and the ceiling due to relatively high concentration of uranium and thorium in the additive used in the concrete. Radon, Rn- 222, emanating from the surrounding rock and concrete is the biggest challenge for the low background experiments. The radon is radioactive, noble gas and it can diffuse into every setup. The problem comes with the radioactivity of radon, as also the progenies of radon are radioactive all the way to the stable Pb- 206. Other DULs have also been challenged by the radon contamination, and several methods have been developed to mitigate the radon levels. Based on the example radon traps presented in the Low background techniques and experimental challenges for Borexino and its nylon vessels (A. Pocar, Ph. D. Thesis, Princeton University, 2003), a decision was made on the type of a radon trap most suitable for Lab 2. I made a schematic design for an active radon trap, a pressure <b>swing</b> adsorption <b>filter.</b> Although first experiment, C 14, is already using the Lab 2, background screening of the site has to be performed to fully understand the different background sources. This would help to define what kinds of experiments are feasible to be hosted in the Lab 2, and to define the types and thicknesses of radiation shielding needed for these experiments...|$|R
