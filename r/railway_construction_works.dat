5000|$|The first Ottoman railroads {{were opened}} between İzmir-Aydın and Alexandria-Cairo in 1856, {{during the reign}} of Sultan Abdülmecid I. The first large railway {{terminal}} within present-day Turkey, the Alsancak Terminal in Izmir, was opened in 1858. However, these were individual, unconnected railroads, without a railway network. Sultan Abdülaziz established the first Ottoman railway networks. On 17 April 1869, the concession for the Rumelia Railway (i.e. Balkan Railways, Rumeli (Rumelia) meaning the Balkan peninsula in Ottoman Turkish) which connected Istanbul to Vienna was awarded to Baron Maurice de Hirsch (Moritz Freiherr Hirsch auf Gereuth), a Bavaria-born banker from Belgium. The project foresaw a railway route from Istanbul via Edirne, Plovdiv and Sarajevo to the shore of the Sava River. In 1873, the first Sirkeci Terminal in Istanbul was opened. The temporary Sirkeci terminal building was later replaced with the current one which was built between 1888 and 1890 ({{during the reign of}} Abdülhamid II) and became the final destination terminus of the Orient Express. In 1871, Sultan Abdülaziz established the Anatolia <b>Railway.</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>works</b> of the [...] on the Asian side of Istanbul, from Haydarpaşa to Pendik, began in 1871. The line was opened on 22 September 1872. The railway was extended to Gebze, which opened on 1 January 1873. In August 1873 the railway reached Izmit. Another railway extension was built in 1871 to serve a populated area along Bursa and the Sea of Marmara. The Anatolia Railway was then extended to Ankara and eventually to Mesopotamia, Syria and Arabia during the reign of Sultan Abdülhamid II, with the completion of the Baghdad Railway and Hejaz Railway.|$|E

Posebnu pozornost posvetio je pruzi Osijek-Đakovo-Vrpolje, za žitelje ovog dijela Slavonije izuzetno značajnoj prometnici koja je, uz mnoštvo teškoća, dovršena tek u drugoj polovici 1905. godine. Đakovo was for {{the first}} time {{mentioned}} in the railway construction plans in Croatia in the mid- 19 th century, as one of the towns of a fictitious transversal supposed to connect the eastern parts of the country with Zagreb, that is, with the ports of the Adriatic Sea. Due to the narrow-minded political gaols of Vienna and Budapest the projects were not put into practice, i. e. they were carried out much later, with more or less radical adjustments, in which the railway passing through the centre of Slavonia, including Đakovo, did not gain support of the highest centres of decision-making. The railway reached Đakovo only in 1905, instead of in the mid- 19 th century or at the latest during {{the first decades of the}} second half of the 19 th century. The narrow-gauge Osijek-Đakovo-Vrpolje railway was built rather fast, within somewhat more than a year, but the work permit for the beginning of the construction works was long in coming, nearly a quarter of a century. Several reasons for thus could be found, but political considerations seem to have been dominant. The intention of Hungarian ruling circles was to keep the town of Osijek cut off from Bosnia as long as possible. Antagonism towards the opposition politician, Josip Juraj Strossmayer, the bishop of Đakovo, who (at least in the beginning) actively promoted railway construction, should also not be neglected. Thanks to ongoing intercessions from the representatives of the town of Osijek, Virovitica County and the Slavonian chamber of trades, the work permit for the beginning of the works was issued in 1904, at a time when the <b>railway</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> could no longer be delayed, especially because, under the new political and social circumstances, they were in the interest of the Hungarian entrepreneurial elite. The railway was built with only a negligible prolongation of the agreed deadline. According to the ministry’s instructions given in the permit (“Dozvolna izprava”) that was obligatory for concessionaires, the construction works had to be performed properly. After the railway was opened to traffic, certain failures were noticed, but they were not of such significance as to throw doubt upon the wholeproject. The railway was, during the first years of its existence, and also later, of inestimable significance for the town of Osijek and the entire area of Đakovo, with respect to economic and integration processes. It was significant within the region as well as for its connection to other parts of Croatia...|$|E

Na početku starijega željeznog doba primjetni su utjecaji s prostora dolenjske i grupe Martijanec - Kaptol, uz koje se povezuju slučajni nalazi fibula iz Vinkovaca i Orolika te pojava tumula u Starim Jankovcima, Ilači i Gabošu. Utjecaji ovih grupa kao i s prostora glasinačkoga kulturnoga kruga prisutni su i u mlađoj fazi starijega željeznog doba kojoj pripadaju ravna groblja s kosturnim ukopima srijemske kulture u Vinkovcima i Novim Jankovcima. U završnu fazu starijega željeznog doba datiraju se naselja Damića gradina u Starim Mikanovcima i Dirov brijeg u Vinkovcima koja predstavljaju najzapadnija do sada poznata nalazišta najmlađe faze bosutske kulture. Keramički nalazi s tih naselja ujedno dokumentiraju kulturnu i etničku osnovu koju su Kelti zatekli pri naseljavanju prostora srednjeg Podunavlja krajem 4. st. pr. Kr. The Early Iron Age {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{investigated}} and little known prehistoric periods in the region of Vinkovci, as well as in eastern Slavonia and western Srijem. On the territory of the town of Vinkovci and its surroundings, intensive rescue excavations were conducted in the past three decades, in which settlements and cemeteries were uncovered which enable a more clear cultural and chronological picture of the Early Iron Age in the broader south-Pannonian area (Fig. 1.). Apart from the results of the excavations, the understanding of the material heritage is supported by isolated and chance finds from the Early Iron Age, preserved in the City Museum in Vinkovci, {{as well as in the}} Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, on the basis of which it is possible to assume the continuous habitation of the area of Vinkovci and its surroundings from the very beginning of the Early Iron Age in the 8 th century BC up until the settlement of the Celts by the end of the 4 th century BC. The older phase of the Late Bronze Age in the Vinkovci area is marked by the Belegiš II culture, known on the basis of the excavations of settlements in Vinkovci and Privlaka. From the period of the younger phase of the Late Bronze Age only isolated finds are known, which do not make possible their clear cultural classification. Thus the basis for the coming period of the Early Iron Age, to whose initial phase the chance find of a fragment of a bronze fibula of the Vače type from Vinkovci is dated, remains unknown. According to the classification by S. Gabrovac, the Vinkovci fibula belongs to the type Va of two-looped arched fibulae with an iron core and a bronze coating. The dissemination center of those fibulae was in the areas of Bela Krajina, Dolenjska and Gorenjska. A fibula of the Vače type (type Vb) was found on the cemetery Lijeva bara in Vukovar in the skeleton grave 269, in which a man with a spear and a sharpening iron was buried, whose handle was fashioned in the Thraco- Cimmerian style. On the sites of the Martijanec-Kaptol group, those fibulae appear throughout the first horizon, belonging to the end of the 8 th and the beginning of the 7 th century BC, into which period the Vinkovci fibula should be dated as well. Two fibulae chance finds from the area of the village of Orolik testify to the existence of links between the Vinkovci area in the early phase of the Early Iron Age and the dissemination area of the Dolenjska and Martijanec-Kaptol groups. On the site Rajterovo Brdo a fragment of a bronze fibula with a boat-shaped arch was found, whose terminals are decorated with engraved lines (T. 1., 3), whereas on the neighboring site called Zadružno dvorište (Cooperative Yard) a small bronze boat-shaped fibula with a transversal rip on its arch was unearthed, which is also decorated with engravings (T. 1., 1). Boat-shaped fibulae with transversal rips are characteristic of the eastern Alpine-Pannonian Region, and they belong to the first half or the middle of the 7 th century BC. The fibula from Orolik can probably be dated into the same period. The existence of tumuli, uncovered already by the end of the 19 th century, and systematically recorded in the Vinkovci area in 1951, testify to the links of the eastern Slavonian and the Srijem regions with the dissemination area of the Martijanec-Kaptol group in the West during the early phase of the Early Iron Age. The largest group, consisting of five tumuli, was uncovered near Stari Jankovci, whereas one tumulus was registered between the villages Ostrovo and Gaboš, northwest from Vinkovci. In the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb objects from the destroyed earth tumulus in Ilača are preserved, in which an iron spear, a bronze knob as part of horse-riding equipment, a rounded wether-bell and a part of a doublethreaded wire were found. Considering the excavation results in Stari Jankovci, where cremation and possibly skeleton burials were registered, we should look for analogies in the first place within the framework of the neighboring Martijanec-Kaptol group. The find of a bronze knob as part of horse-riding equipment from the destroyed tumulus in Ilača testifies to the dating of eastern Slavonian and Srijem tumuli, dating the knob into the 8 th century BC, when on the right Danube bank a concentration of hoards containing horse-riding equipment is registered. The Dalj culture finds, uncovered in 1951 during the leveling of the southern part of the prehistoric multi-layer settlement on Tržnica (the Market) in the center of Vinkovci, belong to the earlier phase of the Early Iron Age. On this occasion, a pot with an S profiled body was unearthed with a striped grip and a shoulder decorated by vertically set cannelures divided into metopes. On the basis of the shape and the ornaments, the pot is classified as belonging to the Dalj culture and dated in the period from the year 700 until 600 BC. In trial excavations on the same site in 1962 in the surface strata new pottery finds of the Dalj culture were registered, collected also on Borinci near Jarmina. The early phase of the Early Iron Age in the Vinkovci area is represented by a larger number of sites (Fig. 1.), consisting of settlements as well as grave sites with skeleton burials, testifying to the complex ethnic and cultural activities going on in the region of southern Pannonia from the beginning of the 6 th century BC until the Celtic settlement at the end of the 4 th century BC. In the site Silos on Ervenica in the southeastern part of Vinkovci, in rescue excavations in 1972 two skeleton graves were unearthed. Grave 1 contained a woman’s burial with rich vaults representing Late Hallstatt I southern Pannonian costume, consisting of a bronze astragalar belt with 73 pieces preserved; a bronze Certosa fibula of the V group, decorated on its arch with the engraved motif of a firbranch; and a necklace with 24 beads. In grave 2 there was a biconical pot, which on the spot where the shoulder enters into the body is decorated with four knob-shaped protrusions, between which there are transversal cannelures. On the basis of vaults, the graves are dated into the devel- oped 5 th century BC and classified as belonging to the Srijem culture of the western Balkan cultural complex. A richly vaulted female burial, which according to its inventory completely corresponds to grave 1 from Ervenica, was found near Novi Jankovci during <b>railway</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> in 1890. Of the vaults, 11 bronze pieces of the astragalar belt, a bronze Certosa fibula of the V group and 4 beads made of yellow glass paste were preserved. On the basis of the find of the astragalar belt, J. Brunšmid ascribes the burial from Novi Jankovci to a man, but other contemporaneous burials with astragalar belts in the area of southern Pannonia suggest that we are dealing with female burials with characteristically extraordinarily rich costumes. Graves from Vinkovci and Novi Jankovci are dated on the basis of Certosa fibulae of the V group, which was one of the leading forms in the 5 th century BC. On an unknown location in Vinkovci two astragalar belt pieces were found (T. 1., 8 - 9), whereas a fragment of another piece (T. 1., 4) was found during rescue excavations in Duga Street 23 in the center of Vinkovci. J. Brunšmid mentions a piece and a buckle of an astragalar belt with three loops and a fibula with two spirals and a plateshaped arch. The large number of chance finds of pieces of astragalar belts and other artifacts of the earlier phase of the Early Iron Age testify to the existence of a larger number of graves from this period on a couple of sites in Vinkovci. Chance finds of beads made of yellow glass paste with an ornamentation in the shape of a white-andblue eye-motif, found on Rajterovo brdo in Orolik (T. 1., 5 - 6) and in Vinkovački Banovci (T. 1., 7), most probably belong to the same period to which the graves from Ervenica and Novi Jankovci are dated. Graves from Ervenica and Novi Jankovci, as well as other chance finds from the same period from the Vinkovci area belong to the Srijem culture of the western Balkan cultural complex. Of particular significance for the understanding of the complex cultural and ethnic picture of the southern Pannonian area at the end of the Early Iron Age was the uncovering of the cemetery on the site of the department store Nama in the western, peripheral part of the multilayer prehistoric settlement on Tržnica in Vinkovci. In the rescue excavations in 1976 and 1977 eight skeletal burials and three horse burials were unearthed. In the graves of men, women and children bronze Certosa fibulae of the XIII group were found, as well as bronze and iron crossbow fibulae with a slightly bowed foot and a bronze fibula with a drum-shaped arch. An iron lance with a narrow web and a long sheath belongs to weapon finds. In grave 1 a bronze scepter was found, decorated with incised geometrical motifs. Among objects intended for every-day use there are finds of iron knives, whereas bracelets made of glass paste beads were worn around the neck. Vaults of pottery vessels were registered in the graves too, including a cantharus from grave 3 with a smoothed surface covered by miniature graphite particles. Burials of two horses contained parts of bronze horse-riding equipment. One piece of equipment consisted of bronze phalera produced in three sizes and of radially bowed parts of bronze metal sheet originating from the dissemination area of phase Early La Tène culture. The burial of the other horse contained forged bronze equipment with Thraco-Scythian characteristics, consisting of appliqués stylized in the shape of a griffin or a deer and of two polygonal sheets that served as metal fittings at rein endings. On the basis of the described vaults, the cemetery is dated into the late 5 th and the first half of the 4 th century BC, and it testifies to various influences from the territory of the lower Danube area and from the northern parts of the Pannonian Valley. The find of a bronze Certosa fibula of group XIII (T. 1., 2), found in 1977 on the southern part of the prehistoric tell Tržnica, is dated to the same period. The results of the rescue excavations of the prehistoric multi-layer settlement Damića gradina in Stari Mikanovci, conducted in 1980, are of particular importance for the understanding of the typology of pottery shapes of the younger phase of the Early Iron Age on the territory of eastern Slavonia and western Srijem. The greatest concentration of finds was registered in quadrant 20 and those surrounding it, where the remains of a house with a burned-down clay floor were found at 1. 40 m, in which there were pottery fragments laid as terrazzo. The house was destroyed in a vigorous fire, as evident from large lumps of burned daub, as well as from finds of pottery fragments which were almost totally misshaped due to exposure to high temperature. Among the most interesting finds from Damića gradina is certainly that of the bronze Dux fibula, for which there are no exact data as to the location and depth of the find. Since the La Tène culture settlement is dated into the younger stage of Middle La Tène phase and the Late La Tène phase, i. e. into the second half of the 2 nd and the 1 st century BC, the fibula most probably belongs to the Early Iron Age layer, which, used in conjunction with the analysis of pottery finds, plays a significant role in the final dating of the settlement. In order to determine a clear cultural and chronological position of the Early Iron Age settlement on Damića gradina, a detailed typological-statistical processing of all pottery finds was carried out, on the basis of which basic functional forms were isolated with their respective types and versions. In a descriptive analysis a total of 5, 109 fragments were processed, out of which number it was possible to define the functional form for 1, 361 (26. 64 %), whereas this was not possible with 3, 748 fragments (73. 36 %). When defining the typological table of functional forms, the basic criterion was sorting the forms based on the outline of the vessel, followed by the defining of the versions, which were sorted according to different rim shape and according to different decorating techniques (T. 2. - 4.). Out of 1, 361 distinct forms, 632 were pots (46. 44 %), 642 were bowls (47. 17 %), 22 canthari (1. 62 %), in one case a jug was registered (0. 07 %), and cups are represented with 34 samples (2. 50 %), whereas vessels of small dimensions with one grip were recognized as spoons and registered in 30 cases (2. 20 %). On Damića gradina 703 functional forms or fragments were sorted, which makes 13. 76 % of the total number of processed frag-ments, which are decorated in seven various decorating techniques appearing in different combinations on a single vessel. The largest number of forms and fragments is ornamented in the combination of the application of a plastic ribbon, on which fingerprints are applied (T. 2., 2, 5; T. 3., 4). Next come imprinting, engraving (T. 4., 4), appliqué, gouge (T. 4., 1) and modeling. The smallest number of forms and fragments is decorated with canneluring or a smoothed ornament (T. 2., 6). On the surface of a couple of fragments miniature graphite particles were registered. Characteristics similar to Damića gradina in selecting the position for constructing a settlement are also evident with Dirov brijeg in Vinkovci, where, during rescue excavations, pottery finds were unearthed which according to their forms and ornaments completely correspond with the finds from Damića gradina. Dirov brijeg is a prehistoric hillfort on the confluence of the Nevkoš Stream and the Bosut River. During rescue excavations in 1951 a fragment of a cup with a grip was found, on whose top there is a plastic protrusion decorated with a smoothed ornament (T. 1., 8). In conservation excavations in 1996 in J. Kozarca Street 74, which runs through the eastern part of Dirov brijeg, a trench was investigated, in whose filling, apart from plenty of La Tène pottery, pottery fragments were found which are dated into the younger phase of the Early Iron Age (T. 5.). A settlement form the Early Iron Age was uncovered in a survey in 1954 on the site Gradac, situated on the Bosut River near the village Podgrađe. It is a multi-layer settlement, from which a find of a cup with a rounded body and a grip with two plastic protrusions on the top is known (T. 1., 11). The find of a cup with an identically shaped grip is known from Gradina on Bosut, which is not surprising considering the fact that the settlement in Podgrađe is situated some ten kilometers to the west of the eponymous site of the Bosut culture. The comparatively closest functional forms and decorating techniques and motifs to pottery finds from Damića gradina and Dirov brijeg may be found on sites of the horizon of cannelured pottery in Srijem, i. e. phase III of the Bosut culture. This relates particularly to the rich and various pottery repertoire sorted in layers belonging to the settlement horizon Bosut IIIc of the eponymous Gradina on Bosut. In the youngest phases of the horizon IIIc fragments decorated with net-like or ribbon-like smoothed ornaments were registered, thus forming a base for the dating of identical fragments from Damića gradina and Dirov brijeg. Certain pottery forms may be compared to finds from other sites form the Early Iron Age in eastern Slavonia, as well as in a broader southeastern Alpine Pannonian area. Pottery finds from Damića gradina have numerous corresponding forms, decoration motifs and techniques in the finds from settlements in Osijek, as well as in the phases IIc and IIIa of Donja Dolina according to the classification by Z. Marić, i. e. with finds of the phases 3 a- 2 and 3 b according to the classification by B. Čović. Correspondences with certain forms from Damića gradina may be found on the hillfort Klinac southern from Petrinja, as well as the hillfort Kiringrad. Considering numerous described comparisons, the pottery finds from Damića gradina, Dirov brijeg and Gradac in Podgrađe can be dated into the younger phase of the Early Iron Age. The mentioned settlements according to the typological characteristics of pottery forms as well as decoration motifs and techniques belong to the dissemination area of the phase III of the Bosut culture, i. e. the horizon of cannelured pottery. In order to support the suggested dating of settlements we can take the finds of pots with a rounded body and the grips overtopping the rim (T. 4., 6), which have one or two differently shaped plastic protrusions on the top, out of which the two from Dirov brijeg are decorated with a smoothed ornament (T. 1., 8; T. 5., 8). The fragment of a grip from Damića gradina with a somewhat clearer presentation of two small animal heads proves that we are dealing with highly stylized presentations of animal protomes. Significant for the dating of the settlements Damića gradina and Dirov brijeg are also fragments of cups with a rounded body whose inner surface is decorated with a smoothed ornament. Direct comparisons as to the form of the cup and the decoration technique and motifs are found on Gradina on Bosut, where the described form belongs to the horizon of cannelured pottery. Decorating by smoothing is to become characteristic of the ceramography of La Tène culture of the Scordiscs. In determining the chronology of the Early Iron Age strata from Damića gradina and recognizing the base of certain cultural influences, the appearance of a jug and of fragments with rippled decorations is significant (T. 4., 5). The appearance of the rippled ornament on Damića gradina points to the existence of cultural influences from the west, from the dissemination area of the Dolenjska and the Martijanec-Kaptol groups, which were already registered in the younger phase of the Early Iron Age in the description of the finds from the graves of the Srijem culture. Certain differences between the pottery finds from Damića gradina and Gradina on Bosut are visible in the first place in the small number of forms and fragments, which on Damića gradina are cannelured, and an entire phase of the Bosut culture was named after this decorating technique. The described difference, as well as the fact that only a slightly larger number of fragments from Damića gradina was decorated in similar gouge technique, probably corresponds to certain chronological differences, i. e. it is supposed that the settlements Damića gradina and Dirov brijeg belong to the younger part of phase III of the Bosut culture, when decorating by canneluring, after which the entire phase was named, was not that common any longer. Pottery became mostly undecorated, and even if there was an ornament, it was mostly a combination of a plastic ribbon and a set of stamps. The assumptions on dating are supported also by the lack of finds of horizontally facetted everted pot rims, as well as of bowls with a rounded body and an inverted rim, transversally or horizontally cannelured and facetted on Damića gradina, from where a significant quantity of pottery material originates, as well as on Dirov brijeg. The Early Iron Age sites in Vinkovci and its surroundings offer a possibility for studying the relationship of the Bosut and the Dalj culture, two neighboring cultural phenomena that in the central Danube Region marked the period of the Early Iron Age. In settlements and grave sites of the Dalj culture from the early phase of the Early Iron Age in Dalj and Vukovar the appearance of pottery fragments of Bessarabian style was registered, which belong to phase II of the Bosut culture, whereas fragments of Dalj pottery are known from Gradina on Bosut. The appearance of skeletal burials on cremation grave sites of the Dalj culture in Vukovar and Dalj reflects the influence of the neighboring Bosut culture, as well as the eastern Alpine and the northern Balkan area, of which the inhumation rite is characteristic. The southern border of the Dalj culture dissemination was mainly drawn along the line Ilok-Vukovar-Županja or Vukovar-Vinkovci, with the penetration of the Dalj culture up to the western slopes of Fruška gora near Ilok and Šid. Thus the area between Vukovar and Šid might have been a transitional zone between the Bosut and the Dalj cultures, and the basis for making a distinction was pottery, whereas metal finds such as horse-riding equipment appear on sites of both cultures. The supposed differentiation could thus be related to the early phase of the Early Iron Age, into which pottery finds of the Dalj culture from Tržnica in Vinkovci are dated. In the younger phase of the Early Iron Age the Bosut culture was spread to the west in its phase III or the horizon of cannelured pottery, to which the settlements Dirov brijeg in Vinkovci and Damića gradina in Stari Mikanovci belong.

50|$|The Portuguese, {{already well}} {{established}} in the coastal areas of East Africa since the 15th century, also ventured into these interior lands seeking the famous Mwenemutapa Empire and gradually settled there as colonists. This region of Mozambique was then granted by charter to the Mozambique Company, one of whose main objectives was to foster agricultural colonization. Hence, the Company undertook to settle Portuguese and their descendents in its territory. One of the first towns to be created was Vila Barreto. Established on 24 February 1893, close to the current Chimoio city, it arose {{out of the building}} of the Beira-Zimbabwe railway. The town was named after the Portuguese capitão-mor (governor/military captain) Francisco Barreto, who, in 1572, commanded the first military expedition to the Mwenemutapa Kingdom. For several years, the railway line terminated at Vila Barreto, which contributed to its impressive growth. The town enjoyed a period of opulence, with its hotels and permanently travellers heading to Manica and Rhodesia or, in the other direction, to Beira. However, by the end of 1897, <b>railway</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> reached the frontier with Zimbabwe, interrupting the dynamics that had taken root in Vila Barreto.|$|R
