40|$|A progressive-ratio {{reinforcement}} schedule, {{in which}} successive reinforcements required an additional 50 responses, was programmed on one key. A response {{on a second}} key reset the progressive-ratio schedule to the first step. Before punishment, all pigeons consistently reset the schedule after reinforcement on the first step, thereby minimizing the number of responses required for reinforcement. Punishment was a brief electric shock contingent upon each response on the <b>reset</b> <b>key.</b> The first effect of punishment was to change the frequency of extra responses on the <b>reset</b> <b>key.</b> Under higher intensities of punishment, the pigeons completed the advanced steps of the progressive-ratio schedule before resetting to the first step.

40|$|Three {{behavioral}} {{options were}} available to food-deprived pigeons: (1) pecking one key resulted in food reinforcement according to a 50 -response progressive-ratio schedule, (2) pecking a second key reset the progressive-ratio schedule to the initial progressive-ratio step, and (3) pecking a third key produced a 3 -min timeout period. Pecks on the <b>reset</b> <b>key</b> were shocked. Under low and intermediate shock intensities, timeouts were not produced; under high shock levels, timeouts were produced regularly. Timeouts occurred during the initial period of a progressive-ratio step and were more frequent during the longer steps of the progressive-ratio schedule.

40|$|Abstract While {{measuring}} action spectra for phase-shifting the circadian clock of Chlamydomonas, {{we observed}} that light pulses started near the phase response curve (PRC) "breakpoint " caused {{a reduction of}} the amplitude of the phototactic rhythm and two unexpected effects: (1) nonmonotonic fluence response curves (FRCs), and (2) shortening of {{the period of the}} subsequent free-running rhythm. The reduction of the rhythm’s amplitude is dependent upon both the fluence and wavelength of the light pulse. The results are consistent with the amplitude being dependent upon the perceived "strength" of the stimulus, and with the nonmonotonic FRCs and reduced amplitude reflecting a light-induced change of the pacemaker’s state variables to a region of the phase plane close to the "singularity. " The period change that is evoked by single stimuli exhibits novel characteristics: large changes in period and a phase specificity that correlates with "singular " behavior. These period changes also appear to be a function of the stimulus strength, but indirectly; the magnitude of the period change is most strongly correlated with the magnitude of the light-induced phase shift. These results are interpreted in the context of limit cycle models of circadian clocks, and are used to suggest new tactics for measuring action spectra of light-induced clock <b>resetting.</b> <b>Key</b> words Chlamydomonas, action spectra, circadian clocks, period aftereffects, singularity, limi...|$|R

40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) {{has been}} {{strongly}} {{implicated in the}} regulation of the mammalian circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN); however, its role in behavioral (nonphotic) circadian phase resetting remains elusive. Central to this issue are divergent lines of evidence that the SCN may, or may not, be a target for the phase-resetting effects of 5 -HT. We have addressed this question using a novel reverse-microdialysis approach for timed perfusions of serotonergic and other agents to the Syrian hamster SCN with durations equivalent to the increases in in vivo 5 -HT release during phase-resetting behavioral manipulations. We found that 3 hr perfusions of the SCN with either 5 -HT or the 5 -HT 1 A, 7 receptor agonist 2 -dipropylamino- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro-naphthalene (8 -OH-DPAT) at midday advanced the phase of the free-running circadian rhythm of wheel-running assessed using an Aschoff type II procedure. Phase shifts induced by 8 -OH-DPAT were enhanced more than threefold by pretreatment with the 5 -HT synthesis inhibitor para-chlorophenylalanine. Phase advances induced by SCN 8 -OH-DPAT perfusion were significantly inhibited by the 5 -HT 2, 7 receptor antagonist ritanserin and by the more selective 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonist DR 4004, implicating the 5 -HT 7 receptor in mediating this phase resetting. Concurrent exposure to light during the 8 -OH-DPAT perfusion abolished the phase advances. Furthermore, coperfusion of the SCN with TTX, which blocked in vivo 5 -HT release, did not suppress intra-SCN 8 -OH-DPAT-induced phase advances. These results indicate that 5 -HT 7 receptor-mediated phase resetting in the SCN is markedly influenced by the degree of postsynaptic responsiveness to 5 -HT and by photic stimulation. Finally, 5 -HT may act directly on SCN clock cells to induce in vivo nonphotic phase <b>resetting.</b> <b>Key</b> words: suprachiasmatic nucleus; serotonin; 8 -OH-DPAT; DR 4004; ritanserin; circadian rhythm; hamster; in vivo brain microdialysis; phase-resetting; behavioral rhythm The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) are the primary center for the generation of circadian rhythms in mammals (Rusak and Zucker...|$|R
40|$|Most {{cryptographic}} systems {{carry the}} basic assumption that entities {{are able to}} preserve the secrecy of their keys. With attacks today showing ever increasing sophistication, however, this tenet is eroding. “Advanced Persistent Threats” (APTs), for instance, leverage zero-day exploits and extensive system knowledge to achieve full compromise of cryptographic keys and other secrets. Such compromise is often silent, with defenders failing to detect the loss of private keys critical to protection of their systems. The growing virulence of today’s threats clearly calls for new models of defenders’ goals and abilities. In this paper, we explore applications of FlipIt, a novel game-theoretic model of system defense introduced in [14]. In FlipIt, an attacker periodically gains complete control of a system, with the unique feature that system compromises are stealthy, i. e., not immediately detected by the system owner, called the defender. We distill out several lessons from our study of FlipIt and demonstrate their application to several real-world problems, including password <b>reset</b> policies, <b>key</b> rotation, VM refresh and cloud auditing...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} design of the eXtreme Scale Mote, a new sensor network {{platform}} for reliably detecting and classifying, and quickly reporting, rare, random, and ephemeral events in a largescale, long-lived, and retaskable manner. This new mote was designed for the ExScal project which seeks to demonstrate a 10, 000 node network capable of discriminating civilians, soldiers and vehicles, spread out over a 10 km 2 area, with node lifetimes approaching 1, 000 hours of continuous operation on two AA alkaline batteries. This application posed unique functional, usability, scalability, and robustness requirements which could not be met with existing hardware, and therefore motivated {{the design of}} a new platform. The detection and classification requirements are met using infrared, magnetic, and acoustic sensors. The infrared and acoustic sensors are designed for low-power continuous operation and include asynchronous processor wakeup circuitry. The usability and scalability requirements are met by minimizing the frequency and cost of human-in-the-loop operations during node deployment, activation, and verification through improvements in the user interface, packaging, and configurability of the platform. Recoverable retasking is addressed by using a grenade timer that periodically forces a system <b>reset.</b> The <b>key</b> contributions of this work are a specific design point and general design methods for building sensor network platforms to detect exceptional events. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} response-reinforcer {{relation}} {{in maintaining}} operant behavior under conditions of delayed reinforcement was investigated by using a two-operandum (i. e., two-key) procedure with pigeons. Responding on one key was reinforced under a tandem variable-interval differential-reinforcement-of-other-behavior (tandem VI DRO) schedule. The schedule defined a resetting unsignaled delay-of-reinforcement procedure in that a response was required when the interfood interval of the VI schedule lapsed, but further responding during the DRO component on either <b>key</b> <b>reset</b> the time interval. This ensured a fixed delay duration between any response and reinforcement. Responding on another key, physically identical to the first one except for spatial location, otherwise was without consequence. The location of the key correlated with the delay-of-reinforcement procedure varied between sessions according to a semirandom sequence. Differences in response rates between the two keys were greater, with proportionally higher rates on the key correlated with the delay-of-reinforcement procedure, the longer the delay-of-reinforcement procedure remained correlated with the same key. Differences in responding on the two keys also increased within individual sessions. These {{results suggest that the}} response-reinforcer relation is the primary determinant of responding when responding is acquired and maintained with delayed reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{technique}} for edge-suppressing operations on images. We introduce cross projection tensors to achieve affine transformations of gradient fields. We use these tensors, for example, to remove edges in one image based on the edge-information in a second image. Traditionally, edge suppression is acieved by setting image gradients to zero based on thresholds. A common application is in the Retinex problem, where the illumination map is recovered by suppressing the reflectance edges, assuming it is slowly varying. We present a class of problems where edge-suppression can be a useful tool. These problems involve analyzing images of the same scene under variable illumination. Instead of <b>resetting</b> gradients, the <b>key</b> idea in our approach is to derive local tensors using one image and to transform the gradient field of another image using them. Reconstructed image from the modified gradient field shows suppressed edges or textures at the corresponding locations. All operations are local and our approach does not require any global analysis. We demonstrate the algorithm {{in the context of}} several applications such as (a) recovering the foreground layer undervarying illumination, (b) estimating intrinsic images in non-Lambertian scenes, (c) removing shadows from color images and obtaining the illumination map, and (d) removing glass relections...|$|R
