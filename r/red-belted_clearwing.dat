40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in Ash-Shoubak area of Jordan from June 2003 to September 2005 to study the effect of three apple rootstocks {{on the development of}} the small <b>red-belted</b> <b>clearwing</b> borer, Synanthedon myopaeformis (Borkh.) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), under field conditions. Mondial Gala apple trees grafted on the dwarfing rootstock M 9 and the semi-dwarfing rootstock M 26 were equally infested, whereas those grafted on MM 106 showed significantly lower infestation levels. S. myopaeformis bore into burr knots that develop below a graft union on rootstocks and girdle the tree. There was a significant effect of rootstock on the numbers of burrs present, and the percentage of burr knots infested by S. myopaeformis, with M 106 having significantly fewer burrs, and a lower percent infested...|$|E
