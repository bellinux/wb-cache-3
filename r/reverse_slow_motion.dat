40|$|We {{present the}} 3 D Video Recorder, a system capable of recording, processing, and playing three–dimensional video from {{multiple}} points of view. We first record 2 D video streams from several synchronized digital video cameras and store pre-processed images to disk. An off-line processing stage converts these images into a time–varying three– dimensional hierarchical point–based data structure and stores this 3 D video to disk. We show {{how we can}} trade–off 3 D video quality with processing performance and devise efficient compression and coding schemes for our novel 3 D video representation. A typical sequence is encoded at less than 7 megabit per second at a frame rate of 8. 5 frames per second. The 3 D video player decodes and renders 3 D videos from hard–disk in real–time, providing interaction features known from common video cassette recorders, like variable–speed forward and <b>reverse,</b> and <b>slow</b> <b>motion.</b> 3 D video playback can be enhanced with novel 3 D video effects such as freeze–and–rotate and arbitrary scaling. The player builds upon point–based rendering techniques and is thus capable of rendering high–quality images in real–time. Finally, we demonstrate the 3 D Video Recorder on multiple real–life video sequences. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective {{measures}} of canine gait quality via force plates, pressure mats or kinematic analysis are considered superior to subjective gait assessment (SGA). Despite research demonstrating that SGA does not accurately detect subtle lameness, {{it remains the}} most commonly performed diagnostic test for detecting lameness in dogs. This is largely because the financial, temporal and spatial requirements for existing objective gait analysis equipment makes this technology impractical for use in general practice. The utility of <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> video as a potential tool to augment SGA is currently untested. To evaluate a more accessible way to overcome the limitations of SGA, a <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> video study was undertaken. Three experienced veterinarians reviewed video footage of 30 dogs, 15 with a diagnosis of primary limb lameness based on history and physical examination, and 15 with no indication of limb lameness based on history and physical examination. Four different videos were made for each dog, demonstrating each dog walking and trotting in real time, and then again walking and trotting in 50 % <b>slow</b> <b>motion.</b> For each video, the veterinary raters assessed both the degree of lameness, and which limb(s) they felt represented {{the source of the}} lameness. Spearman’s rho, Cramer’s V, and t-tests were performed to determine if <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> video increased either the accuracy or consistency of raters’ SGA relative to real time video. Raters demonstrated no significant increase in consistency or accuracy in their SGA of <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> video relative to real time video. Based on these findings, <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> video does not increase the consistency or accuracy of SGA values. Further research is required to determine if <b>slow</b> <b>motion</b> video will benefit SGA in other ways...|$|R
