40|$|Abstract]: The {{ability of}} {{internal}} tides to resuspend and advect sediment over continental shelfs and slope regions is investigated by applying an internal wave and sediment transport model. Numerical experiments are carried out, firstly, with {{the ratio of}} bathymetry and internal waves characteristics creating critical, subcritical, and supercritical conditions, and secondly, for an observed section of the Australian North West Shelf. In the former cases, the model is forced with an internal tide propagating through the model domain. The latter application involves forcing by a barotropic tide which in turn generates internal waves at the shelf slope. Internal wave generated bottom layer shear stresses are large enough to resuspend sediment. The application of a turbulence closure scheme results in the creation and maintenance of a thin nepheloid layer. The thickness of the suspended sediment layer is controlled by vertical diffusion which is large within the bottom boundary layer, but very small outside. The residual velocity and the asymmetry associated with the velocity field, result in both down- and upslope net suspended sediment fluxes, and deposition of <b>resuspended</b> <b>material</b> onto the shelf. These suspended sediment fluxes are largest for critical bottom slopes. The parting point between down- and upslope net sediment flux {{is found to be}} sensitive to the formulation of vertical mixing with the parting point moving downslope for increased mixing. At the Australian North West Shelf, near the shelf break and upper slope, the net flux of <b>resuspended</b> <b>material</b> is influenced by both the barotropic and internal tide. The phase relationship in bottom layer shear stresses generated from those two tides causes regions of both enhancement and reduction in the resuspension rates and net suspended sediment fluxes...|$|E

The UV-fluorescence {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} determination was carried out after Soxhlet extraction with hexane from the sedimentary matrices followed by clean-up on aminosilica minicolumns. Four sampling campaigns at five representative stations of the Venice lagoon were conducted to ascertain temporal and spatial variability of the examined chemicals. A portable resuspending device allowed us to analyse the first 0. 01 - 0. 15 -mm sediment layer, where the sum of NP, NP 1 EO and NP 2 EO was in the range 0. 15 - 13. 7 μg g- 1 (dry weight basis), {{at least five times}} higher than in the underlying 5 cm of sediment. Amounts of <b>resuspended</b> <b>material,</b> and concentrations of NP, NP 1 EO, NP 2 EO bound to it, showed a marked seasonal dependence: as much as twice the <b>resuspended</b> <b>material,</b> per unit of sediment surface, was measured in April and July, compared with that in February, but resuspended NP, NP 1 EO and NP 2 EO per unit of sediment surface were in February one order of magnitude higher. A major factor responsible for this trend was related to the proliferation of macroalgae which contained an average NP+NP 1 EO+NP 2 EO concentration of 0. 25 ± 0. 15 μg g- 1 (dry wt.).

40|$|The role of Posidonia oceanica in {{promoting}} sediment stability and accretion was studied in a 15 m deep meadow at Fanals Point (NW Mediterranean, Spain) by comparing particle deposition within the meadow and adjacent bare sediment. Small sediment traps {{were used to}} measure deposition within and above the meadow and over bare sand. A model, based on measurements of particle deposition at increasing distances from the bottom, was used to partition the total depositional flux between primary (sediment particles deposited {{for the first time}} at the measuring site) and resuspended deposition (sediment particles that have been previously deposited at the measuring site). Measurements were conducted monthly over a year to establish the magnitude and seasonality of deposition, and to form a balance of particle transport at the annual time scale. Significant differences in total deposition were found over time, ranging from 1. 5 to 500 g DW m- 2 d- 1, including those between bare and vegetated sediments. The effect of P. oceanica in increasing primary deposition at an annual scale was modest, however, P. oceanica significantly buffered sediment resuspension, which was reduced more than three fold compared to the unvegetated bottom. The annual flux of deposition was dominated by settling of <b>resuspended</b> <b>materials,</b> which represented 85 % of the total flux within the meadow, but 95 % of the total deposition on bare sand. Thus, seagrass meadows reduce resuspension in the NW Mediterranean littoral, thereby contributing to increased sediment retention and, therefore, reducing erosion in the coastal zone. © 2001 Academic Press.

40|$|The {{eruption}} in June  2011 of the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle Volcanic Complex in Chile impacted {{air traffic}} around the Southern Hemisphere {{for several months}} after the initial ash emissions. The ash deposited in vast areas of the Patagonian Steppe was subjected to the strong wind conditions prevalent during the austral winter and spring experiencing resuspension over various regions of Argentina. In this study we analyze the meteorological conditions {{that led to the}} episode of volcanic ash resuspension which impacted the city of Buenos Aires and resulted in the closure of the two main airports in Buenos Aires area (Ezeiza and Aeroparque) on 16 October 2011. A relevant result is that <b>resuspended</b> <b>material</b> (volcanic ash plus dust) imprints a distinguishable feature within the atmospheric thermodynamic vertical profiles. The thermodynamic soundings show the signature of "pulses of drying" in layers associated with the presence of hygroscopic ash in the atmosphere that has already been reported in similar episodes after volcanic eruptions {{in other parts of the}} world. This particular footprint can be used to detect the probable existence of volcanic ash layers. This study also illustrates the utility of ceilometers to detect not only cloud base at airports but also volcanic ash plumes at the boundary layer and up to 7  km altitude. Aerosol properties measured in the city during the resuspension episode indicate the presence of enhanced concentrations of aerosol particles in the boundary layer along with spectral signatures in the measurements at the Buenos Aires AERONET site typical of ash plus dust advected towards the city. The mandatory aviation reports from the National Weather Service about airborne and deposited volcanic ash at the airport near the measurement site (Aeroparque) correlate in time with the enhanced concentrations. The presence of the <b>resuspended</b> <b>material</b> was detected by the CALIOP lidar overpassing the region. Since the dynamics of ash resuspension and recirculation are similar to the dynamics of dust storms, we use the HYSPLIT model with the dust storm module to simulate the episode that affected Buenos Aires. The results of the modeling agree qualitatively with satellite lidar measurements...|$|E

Wastewater processing starts in the sewer is continued in the treatment plant and generally ends after disposal of final products (sludge and treated effluent).

These studies how that slumping and turbidity currents are active and effective rosional agents in the area. Massive large-scale failure has occurred where the slope steepens from a gradient of 1. 4 ° to 7. 6 °, producing scarps hundreds of meters in relief. Smaller scale slumps have occurred on other parts of the continental s ope. Some of the material removed by slumping is emplaced {{at the foot of the}} continental slope as relatively intact blocks of 1 to more than 100 meters in thickness. Turbidity currents apparently initiated by slumping have eroded V-shaped gullies on the lower portions of the slope. Bottom current activity is most influential at the shelf break, where it has sorted bottom sediments and <b>resuspended</b> fine <b>material.</b> Laboratory flume experiments and direct observations of the bottom, (using ALVIN and ALCOA SEAPROBE) indicate that the sediments on much of the continental slope generally are not normally affected by bottom currents. Biological activity, however, can cause both roughening and smoothing of the sediment surface, and the irregularities made by organisms will be reworked by currents.

40|$|Cold-water {{coral reefs}} and mounds are {{observed}} mainly on slopes and topographic highs, {{in areas with}} high current speeds. Previous investigations of the near-bed hydrodynamic regime around cold-water coral mounds at the Southwest Rockall Trough margin have revealed {{the presence of internal}} waves with a diurnal tidal frequency. Hitherto only short-term measurements existed on the particle supply to the corals and data are lacking on the seasonal variability. Bottom landers equipped with sensors recording near-bottom current dynamics were deployed at two sites in a mound area on the Southwest Rockall Trough margin, one with a dense coral cover and one without coral cover. At both sites a similar seasonal variation in internal-wave activity was recorded with high activity during winter and summer months and less dynamic conditions in spring and autumn. Increased intensity of internal-wave activity, reflected in higher average near-bottom current speed and amplitude of daily temperature fluctuations, results in higher mass fluxes as recorded in the sediment traps.

Samples were collected in November 1991, when the Amazon hydrograph was at its annual minimum and the North Brazil Current had retroflected into the equatorial North Atlantic. The DIC Δ 14 C results revealed postbomb carbon in river and ocean waters, with slightly higher values at the river mouth. The low DIC δ 13 C signature of the river end-member (− 11 ‰) demonstrates that about half of the DIC originated from the remineralization of terrestrially derived organic matter. A linear relationship between DIC and salinity indicates that DIC was mixed nearly conservatively in the transition zone from the river mouth to the open ocean, though there was a small amount (≤ 10 %) of organic matter remineralization in the mesohaline region. The POC Δ 14 C values in the river mouth were markedly lower than those values from the western Amazon region (Hedges et al., 1986).

40|$|Abstract We {{identify}} the mechanisms controlling fine deposits on the inner-shelf {{in front of}} the Besos River, in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. This river is characterized by a flash flood regime discharging large amounts of water (more than 20 times the mean water discharge) and sediment in very short periods lasting from hours to few days. Numerical model output was compared with bottom sediment observations and used to characterize the multiple spatial and temporal scales involved in offshore sediment deposit formation. A high-resolution (50 m grid size) coupled hydrodynamic-wave-sediment transport model was applied to the ini-tial stages of the sediment dispersal after a storm-related flood event. After the flood, sediment accumulation was predominantly confined to an area near the coastline as a result of preferential deposition during the final stage of the storm. Subsequent reworking occurred due to wave-induced bottom shear stress that <b>resuspended</b> fine <b>materials,</b> with seaward flow exporting them toward the midshelf. Wave characteristics, sediment availabil-ity, and shelf circulation determined the transport after the reworking and the final sediment deposition loca-tion. One year simulations of the regional area revealed a prevalent southwestward average flow with increased intensity downstream. The circulation pattern was consistent with the observed fine deposit depo-center being shifted southward from the river mouth. At the southern edge, bathymetry controlled the fine deposition by inducing near-bottom flow convergence enhancing bottom shear stress. According to the short-term and long-term analyses, a seasonal pattern in the fine deposit formation is expected. 1...|$|R

A one-month simulation for December 2001 {{has been carried out}} with a set of nested domains. The model inputs include tides, winds, surface waves, and idealized initial sediment conditions for sand and non-cohesive silt. Apart from the control run, the sensitivity of the results to surface waves, ripple roughness and bed armoring has been analyzed. From the control experiment, the horizontal transport of sand turns out to be limited to within a few km of the nearshore erosion zones. During high wave events, silt is transported over further distances and also partly offshelf in distinct plumes. The effectiveness of horizontal silt transport depends strongly on vertical mixing due to both surface wind stress and wave-enhanced bottom stress. High wave events coincident with strong winds (hence strong vertical mixing) are the most optimal conditions for sed iment- transport. Excluding wave effects in the simulation shows that surface waves are the dominant factor in <b>resuspending</b> bed <b>material</b> on the Southern Californian shelves. The sensitivity experiments also show that the direct influence of additional ripple roughness on erosion and deposition is relatively weak.

40|$|Balanophyllia europaea is an endemic Mediterranean sublittoral zooxanthellate solitary coral. Given {{the broad}} {{distribution}} of the species throughout {{many areas of the}} Mediterranean surprisingly little is known of preferred habitat niches or susceptibility of the species to environmental change. In this study we investigated in the laboratory the net prey capture rates of the coral achievable under a range of flow velocities (2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 15 cm s− 1) and under exposure to different suspended particulate concentrations (0, 7. 3 and 170 mg l− 1). In recirculation flumes we simulated both commonly occurring and the occasionally high flow velocities and various suspended particulate concentrations reported from the Gulf of Lions (north-west Mediterranean). We then delivered ca 500 A. salina nauplii l− 1 as food (Artemia salina nauplii) to the flumes and monitored net prey capture over time. We found net prey capture rates by the species to be highest under flow velocities of 5 cm s− 1, with 230 µg C coral individual− 1 h− 1 achieved. The presence or absence of even environmentally high particulate concentrations (up to 170 mg l− 1 <b>resuspended</b> seabed <b>material)</b> did not significantly affect the net prey capture rates achieved by the coral polyps.

Flux at 90 mab is usually higher than the primary flux at 3100 m depth, and this enhancement is especially pronounced during the winter.

The ratio of tracer flux at 90 mab to that at 3100 m depth was taken as a measure of the strength of the resuspension process (the resuspension factor RF) and reflects clearly the enhanced resuspension in winter.

The extreme seasonality of food supply from phytoplankton at high latitudes, combined with very stable temperatures has not, however, reduced {{the range of}} life history adaptations. Some species extend feeding and growing periods by concentrating on smaller, lower biomass but longer duration, fractions of phytoplankton. Here we show that shallow-water Antarctic brachiopods can switch from pelagic to benthic food sources when required.

40|$|PURPOSE: Dredging and {{disposal}} of dredged material in aquatic environments can expose animals and plants to episodic pulses of suspended sediment. <b>Resuspended</b> <b>material</b> can be deposited in thin layers adjacent to the dredging or disposal areas in some cases as much as several thousand meters distant (LaSalle et al. 1991). While {{our understanding of the}} potential effects of such far-field deposition is limited, some estuarine organisms may be highly sensitive to suspended sediments and certain life stages (eggs, juveniles) may be particularly affected by resuspension and deposition. In this report potential impacts of sedimentation (bedded materials) are reviewed with emphasis on those habitats believed to be most sensitive. BACKGROUND: Ambient conditions for estuarine organisms are rarely static, and most organisms are adapted to varying concentrations of suspended sediment (see bibliography in Kerr (1995)). The intensity and duration of resuspension from dredging {{and disposal}} operations is highly dependent on the type of equipment, operator, character of sediment, and local hydrodynamic conditions (Collins 1995; Clarke and Wilber 2000). While the effects of elevated concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and thin layers of sediment on estuarine organisms are poorly understood (Wilber and Clarke 2001, Wilber et al. in preparation), we do know that some of the defining characteristics of an estuarine environment are highly variable conditions in the water column for temperature, salinity, and particulate flux. The direct measurement of TSS is straightforward and can be complemented with indirect optical and acoustic measurements (optical backscatter sensors, transmissivity, acoustic doppler profiling) to achieve rapid characterization of large volumes of water over relevant spatial scale...|$|E
40|$|AIM: Quantify {{sedimentation}} {{rates in}} Rio Grande II reservoir, his temporal fluctuation, {{and the degree}} of mineralization of the material that reaches the sediment; METHODS: A system of five sedimentation traps was used to evaluate temporal variability of seston flux and the total sedimentation in the dam of Río Grande II reservoir Antioquia-Colombia (6 ° 32, 62 ' N, 75 ° 27, 27 ' W); RESULTS: The flux total solids presented a mean value of 4540 g. m- 2. d- 1 with a range oscillating between 229 and 18573 g. m- 2. d- 1, being the fixed and suspended fraction the most of the total solids. It was evidenced that the largest fluxes were presented between the fourth and the fifth trap (the nearest to the bottom) due to hypolimnetic fluxes which contain materials of the tributaries and <b>resuspended</b> <b>material.</b> The first three traps collected particles that settled from the column of water without evaluate the overtrapping for resuspension. In some samplings the mineralization between the third and fourth trap was maximum (100 %). The fluxes of seston particles presented a mean value of 3554 g. m- 2. d- 1 with a range between 810 and 18955 g. m- 2. d- 1, being predominant the inorganic fraction; CONCLUSIONS: The seston is mainly of allochthonous origin and variated in the time and in the vertical level. There was not found a significant relationship between level of the reservoir and the mixing depth with the fluxes of total sedimentation and seston; however there was relation between seston concentration and wind speed...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{incubation}} experiments {{was performed to}} investigate the release of caesium from either undisturbed or resuspended freshwater sediment which had not been previously dried. Ammonium and potassium ions readily released caesium from <b>resuspended</b> <b>material,</b> {{in keeping with the}} results of other workers, but treatment of the overlying water with hydrochloric acid (pH 4) or nitrilo triacetic acid did not enhance release of caesium from undisturbed sediment. Caesium was released from undisturbed sediment when it was treated with 0 · 5 mol litre− 1 NaCl, but the release of 0 · 5 % (as dry weight of sediment) was low compared with the release which occurs from resuspended sediment treated with lower concentrations of sodium chloride. The smaller release observed in the experiments with undisturbed rather than resuspended sediments was attributed to the interstitial waters being buffered by redox and solid phase reactions. There was minimal release (0 · 5 %) from undisturbed sediment after 40 days of either oxic or anoxic incubation, but the magnitude of the release was consistent with assumed ammonia concentrations in the pore-waters of the surface sediments and experiments which investigated the ammonia-induced release from resuspended wet sediment. It was suggested that the observed elevated contributions in the bottom waters of lakes could be largely due to remobilization from sinking particles rather than release from the sediment. The results indicate that the caesium present in lacustrine sediments is unlikely to be appreciably remobilized in response to acidification, eutrophication or occasional industrial accidents. However, inundation of coastal freshwater basins by seawater could reintroduce into the aqueous environment considerable burdens of formerly safely bound caesium...|$|E
40|$|Suspended {{particulate}} matter (SPM) measurements obtained along a cross-section {{in the central}} English Channel (Wight-Cotentin transect) indicate that the area may be differentiated into: (1) an English coastal zone, associated with the highest concentrations; (2) a French coastal zone, with intermediate concentrations; and (3) the offshore waters of the Channel, characterised by a very low suspended-sediment load. The SPM particle-size distribution was modal close to the English coast (main mode 10 – 12 ?m); {{the remainder of the}} area was characterised by flat SPM distributions. Examination of the diatom communities in the SPM suggests that <b>material</b> <b>resuspended</b> in the intertidal zone and the estuarine environments was advected towards the offshore waters of the English Channel. Considerable variations in SPM concentrations occurred during a tidal cycle: maximum concentrations were sometimes up to 3 times higher than the minimum concentrations. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the SPM concentration time series indicates that, although the bottom waters were more turbid than the surficial waters, this was not likely {{to be the result of}} in situ sediment resuspension. Instead, the observed variations appear to be controlled mainly by advective mechanisms. The limited resuspension was probably caused by: (1) the limited availability of fine-grained material within the bottom sediments; and (2) ‘bed-armouring’ processes which protect the finer-grained fractions of the seabed material from erosion and entrainment within the overlying flow during the less energetic stages of the tide...|$|R

Briefly, the endotoxin has been extracted from salmonellae with hypertonic solutions. The crude endotoxin was shown to contain several antigens, mainly r 1, r 2, r 3, or heterologous antigen. The heavy endotoxin was isolated and purified previously by enzymatic digestion, followed {{by a series of}} gel filtrations on Sephadex or Sepharose columns. We report the isolation and purification of heavy endotoxin in sucrose gradients, {{with the use of a}} B XIV titanium zonal rotor. From 150 to 300 mg of the crude <b>material</b> <b>resuspended</b> in a solution containing 1 m sodium chloride, 0. 1 m sodium citrate, and 2. 5 % (w/w) sucrose, has been submitted to zonal centrifugation in gradients consisting of 5 to 25 % (w/w) sucrose, also containing 1 m sodium chloride and 0. 1 m sodium citrate. An overlay of 200 ml of 1 m sodium chloride- 0. 1 m sodium citrate was introduced after the sample. The separations were obtained after centrifugation for 3. 5 hr at 35, 000 rev/min (∫w 2 dt = 1. 66 × 1011) at 4 C; the heavy endotoxin sedimented as heterogeneous material, from the middle toward the distal portions of the gradient. The heterologous antigens (r 1, r 2, r 3), as well as bacterial proteins, remained in the sample zone. The heavy endotoxin recovered from the gradients was quite pure, as revealed by immunodiffusion tests against several antibacterial sera...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{observations}} on the nature and concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) are presented for a cross-section of the English Channel, between the Isle of Wight (UK) and Cotentin peninsula (France) i. e. the western boundary of the eastern English Channel. The highest concentrations of suspended material are found adjacent to the English coastline, whereas the offshore waters are associated with low concentrations. Seasonal variations in the concentration and nature of suspended material are identified, with highest concentrations in winter. At this time, the suspended particles are characterised generally by peaked grain size spectra and an enrichment in coarse silt particles; in summer, the distributions are generally flat. The diatom communities found within the suspended matter indicate that <b>material</b> <b>resuspended</b> in the coastal zone and the estuarine environments is transported offshore. SPM fluxes (based upon the observed SPM concentrations and the output from a 2 -D hydrodynamic model) from the western Channel through the Wight–Cotentin Section, ranged between 2 and 71 × 106 t a? 1 {{with a mean of}} around 20 × 106 t a? 1 over the period of the observations (1994 – 1995). These fluxes are comparable to the order of magnitude and mean value reported as output through the Dover Strait. Therefore, {{it is possible that the}} eastern English Channel may be characterised as an area of fine-grained sediment ‘bypass'. This interpretation is corroborated by: (a) the absence of fine-grained sediment deposits over the area; and (b) correlation between the potential resuspension time of the fine particles and the seabed sediment distribution...|$|R

The first SPM climatology over this region is provided and the SPM temporal variation schemes (irregular variability, seasonal variability, and long term trend) are described using the Census-X- 11 time series decomposition method. The different spatio-temporal patterns are then analyzed with regard to regional oceanographic and hydrologic conditions. The origin of the processes controlling the seasonality of the Mekong Delta plume is characterized. The increase of turbidity observed from June to December, starts with the Mekong sediment inputs which are maximum during the summer monsoon (the water discharge reaches its maximum in September/October). While the Mekong water discharge decreases, the concentration of suspended sediment keeps increasing in coastal waters during the following two/three months (November to January). This increase is explained by resuspension effects occurring in the shallow coastal areas. Due to higher wave energy and oblique orientation of the waves breaking near the coast, the winter monsoon triggers {{a high level of}} agitation and high value of <b>resuspended</b> <b>material</b> concentration which are submitted to a longshore current directed towards the South-West. Deposition (in front of the Delta) and erosion (northern and southern areas of the delta) areas are identified in good agreement with recent results obtained from a prognostic model. While the temporal variability is strongly dominated by the seasonal component, a long term trend of about − 5 % SPM concentration per year is observed in the pro-delta area and is attributed to the decrease of the Mekong river sediment output during the high flow season...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} origin and {{degradation}} state of the organic particles sinking towards the sea bottom of the Mallorca continental slope, the major inorganic and organic components of the total mass flux and its biochemical compo- sition (in terms of protein, carbohydrate, lipid and phytopigment contents) have been analysed. Two instrument- ed lines were deployed at the western (Sóller station, Balearic sub-basin) and southern (Cabrera station, Algerian sub-basin) slopes of Mallorca Island, 900 m depth from November 2009 to January 2011. The two locations are characterized by putatively different environmental settings. Settled material at Sóller station has higher lithogenic contents {{when compared with the}} Cabrera one. Such difference {{can be explained by the}} synergistic presence in the Sóller station of large inputs of <b>resuspended</b> <b>material</b> due to the mesoscale variability of the Balearic current and the impact of bottom trapped waves. On the other hand, at the Cabrera station sinking particles are characterized by OM and opal percentages higher than those recorded at the Sóller station. This result points out that organic particles reaching the sea floor at the Cabrera station have a pre-eminent pelagic origin. Based on analyses of the C and N stable isotopes of the sinking material, our results also highlight that, overall, the OM reaching the sea floor at the Mallorca slope is mostly of marine origin. In general, the OM settled at the Sóller station has a higher nutritional value than that at the Cabrera one. Such a difference, occurring across a relatively reduced spatial scale, let us hypothesizing that the nutritionally richer particles descending in the Cabrera station are exposed to a less energetic environment than that in the Sóller setting. This would lead to higher settling velocity of particles in the Sóller setting which in turn would result in lower degradation rates of particles during their descent towards the sea bottom...|$|E

30|$|Suspension feeding {{bivalves}} feed {{on living}} and non-living available material in their habitat (i.e., generalist filter feeders) (Ward and Shumway 2004). They select particles from seston, separating the grain from the chaff, and acquire the optimum energetic budget (Ward and Shumway, 2004). Seston consists of plankton {{of a wide}} range of sizes and palatability, <b>material</b> <b>resuspended</b> from the benthos, aggregates, detritus, fecal pellets as well as microorganisms (Ward and Shumway 2004, Karayücel et al. 2010). Fatty acids (FA) have been successfully used as trophic markers of bivalves to identify food sources, habitat preferences, feeding strategies and trophic links (Kharlamenko et al. 1995, 2001; Prato et al. 2010). Several studies on mussel Mytilus galloprovincilais Lmk. (Freites et al. 2002 a, b; Ezgeta-Balić et al. 2012; Irisarri et al. 2014 a) found that variability in nutritional quality of seston was explained by the variance of FAs found in mussels. Bivalves have some capability to synthesize FAs independently of diet (Ventrella et al. 2013), but they are not capable of biosynthesizing de novo polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) (Fernández-Reiriz et al. 2011). In addition, fatty acids transferred from primary producers, when incorporated by bivalves, do not undergo major changes (Graeve et al. 1994; Xu and Yang 2007), and thus, fatty acid measurements are a qualitative measurement of both energy transfer and assimilation of nutrients in mussel tissue. FA signature in mussel tissues can reveal the food source of the bivalve (i.e., several weeks prior) (Ezgeta-Balić et al. 2012) and thus, certain FA and their ratios can be used as biomarkers of the diet of the mussel. With these FA ratios, the seasonal contribution of bacteria, phytoplankton classes, as well as microzooplankton to the diet of the mussel can be assessed (Budge et al. 2001; Handå et al. 2012). Such analysis is an important factor in understanding the feeding physiology of mussels (Xu and Yang 2007).|$|R
40|$|Sommerfield, Christopher K. Tropical {{cyclones}} have a {{major influence}} on the hydrodynamics of MidAtlantic rivers and estuaries, and by extension on processes and rates of sediment transport. In 2011 the passage of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee through the Delaware River Basin was recorded by sensors deployed throughout the region, and the resulting observations provided unique insights into the coupled hydrodynamic and sedimentary response of the Delaware Estuary. The combined suspended sediment input of the two main tributaries, the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, was over 1, 300, 000 metric tons during the two-week storm period. Time series records of sediment transport along the axis of the estuary suggested that most of the sediment transported during the storms was bed <b>material</b> <b>resuspended</b> within the estuary, not new material delivered from above the head of tide. Significantly, the resuspended sediment flux was equal to or greater than the river influx. Despite the large volume of freshwater delivered to the estuary, salt was not completely flushed from the mouth of Delaware Bay, and the resident suspended sediment inventory was retained. The storm-produced sediment pulse was attenuated and assimilated during passage from the upper to lower estuary, and near the head of Delaware Bay was strongly buffered by mixing associated with the large intertidal volume of the bay. Salinity and velocity measurements indicated that, although the salt intrusion was pushed ~ 55 km downestuary during Tropical Storm Lee, the two-layer estuarine circulation remained sufficiently vigorous to trap suspended sediment supplied from the upper estuary. A shipboard survey conducted shortly after the storms suggested that much of the suspended sediment was transported laterally from the axial channel to the adjacent subtidal flats, thereby increasing the potential for permanent deposition.

40|$|Organic matter (OM) burial {{in marine}} sediments is a {{potentially}} important control on global climate {{and the long-term}} redox state of the earth’s surface. Still, we have only a limited understanding of the processes that stabilize OM and facilitate its preservation in the geologic record. Abiotic reactions with (poly) sulfides can enhance the preservation potential of OM, but for this process to be significant it needs to compete with OM remineralization, the majority of which occurs before sinking particles reach the sea floor. Here we investigate whether OM sulfurization occurs within sinking particles in the Cariaco Basin, a modern sulfidic marine environment with high rates of OM burial. Proto-kerogen in sinking particles is frequently more sulfur-rich and ^(34) S-depleted than expectations for biomass, with a composition {{that is difficult to}} explain by mixing with <b>resuspended</b> or terrigenous <b>material.</b> Instead, it appears that sulfur is being incorporated into OM on a timescale of days in sinking particles. The flux of this abiogenic organic S from particles is equivalent to approximately two-thirds of the total amount of proto-kerogen S at 10 cm depth in underlying sediments (ODP Core 1002 B); after 6000 years of more gradual sulfurization reactions, potential water column sources are still equivalent to nearly half of the total proto-kerogen S in Cariaco sediments. Water column sulfurization is most extensive during periods of upwelling and high primary productivity and appears to involve elemental S, possibly via polysulfides. This process has the potential to deliver large amounts of OM to the sediments by making it less available for remineralization, generating OM-rich deposits. It represents a potentially dynamic sink in the global carbon cycle that can respond to changes in environmental conditions, including the size and intensity of O_ 2 -depleted environments. Water column OM sulfurization could also have played a more significant role in the carbon cycle during ocean anoxic events, for example during the Cretaceous...|$|R
