40|$|Airborne Early Warning (AEW) systems rely on <b>rotary</b> <b>couplers</b> (RC) to {{interface}} rotating antenna elements on aircraft exteriors with stationary onboard systems. The demand for additional channels in new generation AEW systems increases {{the complexity of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>couplers</b> significantly. On the other hand, if signals in separate frequency bands use the same channel, existing AEW designs could incorporate additional channels with only minor changes. Passive RF diplexers can accomplish this task. Required characteristics include low-loss (3 ̆c 0. 5 dB), wideband (4. 4 : 1), and high-power (3 ̆e 6 kW) handling capability. Two diplexer candidates are synthesized and characterized {{with the aid of}} a commercial circuit simulation package that includes a 3 D full-wave EM solver. A semi-lumped coaxial and a digital elliptic diplexer are proposed, both of which have theoretically low-loss and acceptable VSWR characteristics. However, only the latter diplexer meets operating requirements without the excessive tuning or analysis required by the former. Further studies of the semi-lumped diplexer characteristics may make it useful in other applications. This thesis defines diplexer design goals, provides a brief introduction to filter theory, and compares performance characteristics of the semi-lumped and digital elliptic diplexers. Simulation results for both designs demonstrate that the digital elliptic diplexer is an optimum solution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{new design}} for single-channel {{waveguide}} rotary joints for high-power applications is presented. In {{order to obtain}} correct signal phase conditions along the ring and, at the same time, reduce {{the diameter of the}} rotary joint, tapered ridged wave-guide sections are introduced. Design guidelines with respect to general transmission characteristics,-plane aperture couplers, and ridge waveguide analysis are presented. Measurements of a 9. 05 -GHz prototype show less than 1 -dB insertion loss over a 250 -MHz bandwidth and, hence, verify the design concept.

40|$|The {{temperature}} on {{the rake}} face of a binder-less cBN tool tip in end-milling was measured using a fiber-optic two-color pyrometer. The radiation of the interface between the tool tip and the chip is transmitted through the binder-less cBN and accepted by the optical fiber located behind the tool tip. The radiation accepted is transmitted to a two-color detector, which consists of a InAs and InSb detector, through a <b>rotary</b> fiber <b>coupler.</b> The coupler {{makes it possible to}} transmit the radiation outside the milling machine. The fundamental transmission characteristics of the coupler was investigated theoretically and experimentally. This method was found to be very practical to measure the tool tip temperature in end-milling. The results obtained are as follows. The rake face temperature in the up-milling of 0. 55 % carbon steel ranged from 480 degrees centigrade to 560 degrees centigrade for the cutting speeds of 2. 2 m/s to 4. 4 m/s. The cutting temperature increases with the increase of cutting speed. The temperature in down-milling is higher a little than that in the up-milling. バインダレスcBNによるエンドミル加工時の工具刃先温度を光ファイバ型 2 色温度計を用いて測定している. 工具すくい面から放射される赤外線を工具裏面から受光し, 2 本の光ファイバを連結する回転型ファイバカプラを介して伝送することにより, 高速回転している刃先の温度測定を可能にしている. 切削速度や切削方式の相違が刃先温度に及ぼす影響について検討している...|$|R
40|$|The Johnson Space Center (JSC) {{initiated}} a dynamic {{study to determine}} possible improvements available through advanced technologies (not used on previous or current human vehicles), identify promising development initiatives for advanced active thermal control systems (ATCS's), and help prioritize funding and personnel distribution among many research projects by providing a common basis to compare several diverse technologies. Some technologies included were two-phase thermal control systems, light-weight radiators, phase-change thermal storage, <b>rotary</b> fluid <b>coupler,</b> and heat pumps. JSC designed the study to estimate potential benefits from these various proposed and under-development thermal control technologies for five possible human missions early in the next century. The study compared all the technologies to a baseline mission using mass as a basis. Each baseline mission assumed an internal thermal control system; an external thermal control system; and aluminum, flow-through radiators. Solar vapor compression heat pumps and light-weight radiators showed the greatest promise as general advanced thermal technologies which can be applied {{across a range of}} missions. This initial study identified several other promising ATCS technologies which offer mass savings and other savings compared to traditional thermal control systems. Because the study format compares various architectures with a commonly defined baseline, it is versatile and expandable, and is expected to be updated as needed...|$|R
