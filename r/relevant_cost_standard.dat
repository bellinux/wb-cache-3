40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} the <b>relevant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>standard</b> {{for the economic}} replicability test for Next-Generation Access (NGA) networks, described in the “Recommendation on consistent non-discrimination obligations and costing methodologies” adopted by the European Commission. According to the Recommendation, in order to reconcile investment and competition, wholesale prices should have nonlinear characteristics and only partly vary {{by the number of}} accesses. It demonstrates that a cost standard for the economic replicability test, which implies fully fixed and variable cost recovery for the access seeker, including the total wholesale price, would be incompatible with the economics of NGA networks and that such a test would deter NGA investment. Therefore, the cost standard should include only the variable part of the wholesale price. However, this paper underlines that during a transition phase, until competitors have secured access to NGA infrastructure, a second temporary test called the “competition migration test” should be added to ensure incumbent NGA retail prices do not foreclose efficient copper-based entrants. The two proposed tests surpass the limits of the “ladder of investment” theory by including the “business migration effect” developed by Bourreau, Cambini, and Dogan (2012) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Relevant</b> <b>costing</b> is a {{management}} accounting term {{that relates to}} focusing on only the <b>costs</b> <b>relevant</b> to a specific decision being made. It simplifies the decision-making process as it ignores cost data that is irrelevant, or will not {{have an impact on}} the specific decision being made. This study adopts an observation of quantitative methodology with primary and secondary data in view of the nature of the analysis. <b>Relevant</b> <b>costing</b> is often used in short-terFm decision making and a number of specific practical examples are illustrated in this study. This study has been designed to achieve the objective of assessing the level of perceptions of four areas such as (i) making & buying, (ii) dropping or retaining a segment, (iii) constrained resources and (iv) special orders in using <b>relevant</b> <b>costing</b> in Ready-made Garments Industry (RMG) of Bangladesh.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} <b>relevant</b> <b>cost,</b> its relevance in decision making analysis, its decision advantage in both short and long-term planning decisions and how it influences the decision maker’s choice of preference/priorities. The study is based on primary information (data) tailored to allow individual respondents comprehend the concept of “relevant cost”. Forty (40) closely related questionnaires were prepared and administered in some business retail traders in “ALABA INTERNATIONAL MARKET”. A review of related literature was also applied to have a general over-view {{of the concept of}} <b>relevant</b> <b>cost</b> ideology. It was revealed that <b>relevant</b> <b>cost</b> or costs are costs appropriate to a specific management decision. They are estimated future costs, that are different under alternative courses of action for a specific problem. It consist of both fixed and variable costs. Relevance in decision making is independent of cost behavior pattern. It influences the decision maker’s choice of preference and priority. If a decision is to be taken to either add a product or drop a product, salary of a supervisor or managing director is irrelevant. It is a differential (or incremental) cash flow that forms a component of <b>relevant</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R

40|$|Management {{accounting}} {{focuses on}} the use of accounting information as applied {{within the context of a}} model of rational decision making. Normative models in management accounting postulate that only <b>relevant</b> <b>cost</b> information should be considered in the course of managerial decision making. In addition, decisions should follow the economic theory of maximising utility. <b>Relevant</b> <b>costs</b> are those future costs that differ between decision alternatives. As well as prescribing the <b>relevant</b> <b>cost</b> information, behavioural factors (such as past experience) are ignored. This paper reports on an empirical survey of the influence of sunk cost and asset specific information on outsourcing decisions made by managers in public and private hospitals which also investigates the influence of behavioural factors such as prior experience. The results suggest that decision makers are influenced by the presence of information about sunk costs and asset specificity. In addition to demonstrating support for the sunk cost effect, this research provided evidence that the level of sunk cost and not just the absence of sunk cost information influences decisions. However, neither years of experience as a manager nor past experience with outsourcing decisions proved to be significant predictors of the decision to outsource...|$|R
40|$|Some {{economic}} {{considerations for}} order acceptance decisions are discussed. The relevant economic considerations for order acceptance are widely {{discussed in the}} literature: only those <b>costs</b> are <b>relevant</b> which would be avoidable by not accepting the order incremental costs plus opportunity costs. Many costs are unavoidable in single-order acceptance decisions since often the long-term investment decisions have already been made, employees have been appointed, long-term contracts with suppliers have been signed, etc. It is, however, still difficult to apply the concept of <b>relevant</b> <b>costs</b> to practical order acceptance decisions. Some suggestions are made for improving {{the usefulness of the}} <b>relevant</b> <b>cost</b> approach. The production planning and control function can provide some of the information that is required for calculating the <b>relevant</b> <b>costs</b> involved in a particular order acceptance decision. This information concerns capacity cost behaviour to calculate incremental costs and planned capacity utilization to calculate opportunity costs. Furthermore, the production planning and control function can provide information that enables an assessment of the reliability of such calculations. This is information on planned versus actual capacity utilization, planned versus actual cost behaviour and on the variation of contribution margins...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this case study is to understand and explain fundamental difficulties of employing <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in the case company operating globally in manufacturing industry. It is crucial to understand the problematic areas since <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> system is used for product costing, decision-making and operational control. The secondary objective is to analyse findings and develop solution suggestions for the identified challenging areas. The research used mainly foreign literature and articles from scientific publications to build a sound theoretical framework. The empirical {{part of the study}} used the case company's internal material, interviews, observations, informal discussions and information systems. The data was gathered in 2013 - 2014. The results of this thesis suggest that operational factors, <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> system and <b>standards</b> maintenance are the areas where most of the <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> difficulties stem from. Based on the case study, the main problems within the areas are complex operating conditions, lack of tools to control operations, standardized SCS, <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> deviations from actuals, non-optimal system use, lack of variance analysis on product group level, partial negligence of <b>standards</b> thorough <b>cost</b> audit, and <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> inadequateness with continuous improvement.
