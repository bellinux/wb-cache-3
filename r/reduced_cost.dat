Due {{in part to the}} outbreak of World War I and the end of his appointed term, any recommendations may have stalled. On 20 August 1925, Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon {{appointed a}} similar committee and in May 1927 accepted their recommendations for the size reduction and redesign of U.S. banknotes. On 10 July 1929 the new small-size currency was issued.|$|E
5|$|Due to tank sales, Rheinmetall's L/44 {{tank gun}} has been {{manufactured}} for other nations. For example, the Leopard 2 {{armed with the}} 44 caliber long gun, has been sold to the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Finland, and other countries. Egypt had manufactured 700–800 M1A1 Abrams by 2005, and in 2008 requested permission to build another 125 tanks; their M256 main guns (the US version of the L/44) were manufactured by Watervliet Arsenal. The M1A1 has also been exported to Australia, while the M1A2 Abrams has been exported to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The American license-built M256 has also been offered by General Dynamics Land Systems {{as part of the}} M60-2000 Main Battle Tank which would upgrade older M60 Patton tanks to have capabilities of their M1A1 Abrams at a <b>reduced</b> <b>cost,</b> though the company has not yet found a buyer.|$|E

For geotechnical soil investigations, CPT is more popular compared to SPT {{as a method of}} geotechnical soil investigation.

This study uses Deutsch 2 ̆ 7 s theory of cooperation and competition to examine the critical mediating variable of the interaction as employees discuss how to <b>reduce</b> <b>costs.</b> Results of structural equation analyses on data collected from interviews when employees participated in <b>reducing</b> <b>costs</b> indicate that cooperative goals contributed to constructive discussion among employees that resulted in productive work and stronger relationships, which in turn led employees to be committed to <b>reducing</b> <b>costs.</b> Competitive goals were negatively correlated with dynamics and outcomes.

25|$|Commissaries still sell {{products}} at cost {{today as they}} have since 1825. Today's customers also pay a surcharge on their purchases, which was mandated by Congress in 1952 to make commissaries more self-sustaining. The surcharge, which has been set at 5 percent since April 1983, provides modern shopping facilities for service members at a <b>reduced</b> <b>cost</b> to taxpayers. Unlike a tax, surcharge funds go right back into the commissary to work for commissary customers, paying {{for the cost of}} building new stores, renovating and repairing existing ones and purchasing equipment and store-level information technology systems such as cash registers.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} contemporary techniques, microarrays and RNA-Seq, {{were developed}} in the mid-1990s and 2000s. Microarrays that measure the abundances of a defined set of transcripts via their hybridisation to an array of complementary probes were first published in 1995. Microarray technology allowed the assay of 1000s of transcripts simultaneously, at a greatly <b>reduced</b> <b>cost</b> per gene and labour saving. Both spotted oligonucleotide arrays and Affymetrix high-density arrays were the method of choice for transcriptional profiling until the late 2000s. Over this period, a range of microarrays were produced to cover known genes in model or economically important organisms. Advances in design and manufacture of arrays improved the specificity of probes and allowed more genes to be tested on a single array. Advances in fluorescence detection increased the sensitivity and measurement accuracy for low abundance transcripts.|$|E
25|$|The {{joint company}} {{obtained}} Acts of Pariament in 1846 {{to cover the}} first {{three of the four}} railways, and to reform itself as the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company (SUR). The new company was authorised to take over the Shrewsbury Canal and to buy the Montgomery Canal and the Shropshire Canal. The intent behind the acts was to build railways at a <b>reduced</b> <b>cost,</b> by using the existing routes of the canals the company owned. New share capital of £3.3 million could be raised, with an additional £1.1 million if required. Holders of shares in the existing canal companies exchanged them for new shares. The Ellesmere and Chester was valued at £250,004, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction at £150,000, and the Shrewsbury at £75,000. The company carried forward debts and liabilities of £800,207.|$|E

25|$|In Australia, {{there are}} no {{quantitative}} performance targets for rainwater tanks, such as size of tank or targeted reductions in potable water demand, in policies or guidelines. The various guidelines provided by state governments however, do advise that rain water tanks be {{designed to provide a}} reliable source of water to supplement mains water supply, and maintain appropriate water quality. The use of rainwater tanks should consider issues such as supply and demand, water quality, stormwater benefits (volume is <b>reduced),</b> <b>cost,</b> available space, maintenance, size, shape and material of the tank. Rainwater tanks must also be installed in accordance with plumbing and drainage standards. An advised suitable configuration may include a water filter or first flush diversion, a mains water top-up supply (dual supply system), maintenance drain, a pump (pressure system), and an on-site retention provision.|$|E
25|$|From June 2002 a factory-approved {{dual fuel}} petrol-liquid {{petroleum}} gas conversion {{was available in}} the UK on 1.8 and 2.5 litre models. The LPG conversion was an after-market undertaking approved by MG Rover. Developed by EcoGas Systems Ltd and Landi Renzo S.R.L. in conjunction with MG Rover Powertrain Limited, the conversion was ordered from Rover dealerships, the cars retaining the three-year factory warranty. The retail price of the conversion was £2,195, but {{in an effort to}} encourage LPG use for transport for ecological reasons the UK Government offered a Powershift Rebate of some 60% of the conversion cost. When running on LPG the Rover 75 suffers only a slight reduction in performance compared to running on petrol; LPG fuel consumption is also slightly higher than when running on petrol but this is more than offset by the greatly <b>reduced</b> <b>cost</b> of the fuel.|$|E

The Drugs Payment Scheme ensures that every household only has to pay a maximum of €144 per calendar month for up to one month's supply of prescribed medicines and medical appliances. Some private health insurance plans provide partial reimbursement up to the Drugs Payment Scheme threshold. Those who {{are entitled to a}} medical card pay a government levy for each item dispensed. The levy is €2.50 for under 70s and €2.00 for over 70s, up to a maximum of €25/€20 per family per calendar month. Those who are suffering from one of a list of 16 long-term illnesses do not have to pay for medicines or medical appliances related to their conditions.
