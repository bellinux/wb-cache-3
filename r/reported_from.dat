40|$|This report {{presents}} the workshops and recommendations from the Community Response seminar held in Kevin Street College of Technology in 1990. The seminar was proposed {{as a means}} of attracting more members from the south inner city community and other agencies to join Community Response in an attempt to try to build an effective response to drug abuse in the community. Prior to the seminar a questionnaire was circulated to tenants and community organisations seeking information on {{the nature and extent of}} the local drug problem. The seminar was introduced by Hugh Cahill and chaired by Mary Ellen McCann. Recommendations include a need to address the socio-economic causes of the drug problem, examination of the school curriculum, the appointment of a drugs co-ordinator for Dublin, concentration of state resources in areas most affected by drugs and early prevention by education in primary schools. <b>Report</b> <b>from</b> Workshop 1 – Socioeconomic Roots of Drug Problem Page 8 <b>Report</b> <b>from</b> Workshop 2 - Drug Problems Page 9 <b>Report</b> <b>from</b> Workshop 3 - Treatment Page 10 <b>Report</b> <b>from</b> Workshop 4 - Drugs, crime and law Enforcement Page 11 <b>Report</b> <b>from</b> Workshop 5 - AIDS/HIV Page 12 <b>Report</b> <b>from</b> Workshop 6 - Early Prevention & Youth Work Page 13 <b>Report</b> <b>from</b> Workshop 7 - Drugs and the Elderly Page 14 <b>Report</b> <b>from</b> Workshop 8 - Models of Response Page 1...|$|R
