50|$|A rim mount is a drum kit {{accessory}} {{that allows}} a drum to be supported without any contact to its shell. The rim mount attaches instead to the drum rim or hoop.Most commonly used for hanging toms, they are also available for floor toms, and more rarely for bass drums and snare drums. Hanging tom and snare drum rim mounts use a standard hanging tom mount, but attached to the rim mount rather than directly to the drum. Bass drum rim mounts use special-purpose clamps to attach to a drum <b>rack.</b> <b>Floor</b> tom rim mounts may be attached to a rack, or provide places for the three traditional floor tom feet to attach.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{evaluate}} thermal management performance of data center with cold-aisle containment by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The main challenge of containment modeling in CFD is to consider the air leakage across the containment, which was neglected or considered based on the researchersâ€™ subjective assumption or complex measurement process. To properly evaluate the thermal management performance of containment, this study utilizes the building airtightness measurement data from building airflow simulation program (CONTAM) to model air leakage across containment. Based on the modeling strategy, the CFD simulation is conducted on modular data center test bed, and an experiment is also implemented in identical condition of CFD simulation. As a result, pressure distribution in the data center is properly modeled with the air leakage model, and the temperature measurement data are in good agreement with CFD results. Unlike intuition, the thermal management performance of containment is not excellent since there is some hot air recirculation through gaps between <b>racks</b> and the <b>floor.</b> This study also suggests that this recirculation can be alleviated by sealing the gaps between <b>racks</b> and the <b>floor</b> through CFD simulation...|$|R
50|$|The SM57 is {{a popular}} musicians' choice due to its sturdy {{construction}} and ability to work well with instruments that produce high sound pressure levels, such as percussion instruments and electric guitars. The School of Audio Engineering (SAE) recommends the SM57 (along with other makes and models) for four roles in a drum kit: kick drum, snare drum, <b>rack</b> toms, and <b>floor</b> tom. The cardioid pickup pattern of the microphone reduces the pickup of unwanted background sound and the generation of acoustic feedback. SM57s have also been a staple when reinforcing the sound from guitar amplifiers.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the thermal profile of truck with {{different}} levels of box placement during one day-old chicks transport. An experiment was conducted through monitoring of 11 transport loads. A acclimatized truck was used in this research, with maximum capacity of 630 one day-old chicks boxes, totalizing 63, 000 animals. The assessment of thermal environment was performed in 5 min intervals, through the following variables: temperature, relative humidity and specific enthalpy. The treatments were registered at two levels of the load (first <b>rack</b> and <b>floor)</b> where 17 data loggers were distributed throughout the truck. The experiment used a completely randomized design and geostatistics was used for spatial dependency and Kriging interpolation. The microclimatic conditions of the truck were not as per recommended values, which confirm a heterogeneous distribution of heat and moisture in environment. Regarding the box positioning, the mean values of thermal variables associated with thermal comfort of one day-old chicks was found in the floor area. The most stressful environment for birds inside the truck was located in front and at the center of the truck...|$|R

40|$|Goods and {{products}} are often stored in framed systems, such as pallet racks, {{which are used}} for industrial and commercial activities. Recently, pallet rack provisions have been significantly improved {{but there are still}} relevant aspects that need urgent attention for guaranteeing safe structural design. Among them, the interaction between the rack and the supporting surface (i. e. concrete foundation or floor slab) plays a non-negligible influence in routine design, owing to the high degree of redundancy of the skeleton frames. In addition, rack design is usually carried out using analysis packages unable to capture the behaviour of mono-symmetric cross-section members and hence all the warping effects are generally ignored. This paper summarizes a study on the influence of floor displacements on the performance of medium-rise steel storage pallet racks. In order to obtain a reasonably wide range of data of practical interest for routine design, numerical analyses have been carried out by varying several key parameters such as the position of the <b>rack</b> on the <b>floor</b> slab, the <b>rack</b> geometry, the <b>floor</b> span length and the degree of rotational stiffness of both beam-to-column and base-plate connections. Moreover, attention has been focused on the influence of the accuracy of the structural model used in the design and two commercial analysis packages, differing for the degree of refinement of the implemented finite element beam formulation, have been considered. Finally, a suitable equation is presented to estimate the reduction of performance with respect to the ideal case of racks supported by rigid floor slab...|$|R

30|$|Practitioners showed {{very low}} {{interest}} in this category. Only 2 out of 15 interviewees mentioned their potential concern about storage allocation and re-allocation. Most of the published research on determination of storage policy and location is dedicated to unit-load and single-deep rack setup. Further studies are required to address double/multiple deep <b>racks</b> and <b>floor</b> storage with multiple deep lanes. In order to apply class-based storage, products should be categorized into different classes based on different factors including their characteristics and storage/retrieval requirements, but this classification needs to be dynamic because of the classification parametersâ€™ dynamism. In addition, implementation of class-based storage must be elaborated, telling, for instance, {{what to do if}} the zone for one class of product is filled and an incoming shipment is assigned to that class. In most of the reviewed papers, planning for storage operation was done with the goal of minimizing picking time. Such studies can be extended to target less congestion and better spread of workload by considering replenishment operation during idle or non-peak time. Extension of these studies can be on planning for restock time of the forward picking area.|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} herein described {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} performance characteristics of the oscillating vane-type fan. The fan was the invention of Mr. Van Dorn and Mr. Cornwell, primarily for use in circulating air in railroad refrigerator cars. In the present system of railroad refrigeration for the transportation of perishable foodstuffs, the refrigerator car is a heat insulated car, with bunkers at each end for the cakes of ice. When the car is loaded and the doors shut, cooling is obtained only due to the natural circulation of air in the car, caused by the difference in temperature between the ice in the bunker and the fruit. This circulation has not been found sufficient, in {{that there is a}} large temperature difference between the top and bottom fruit (see Appendix B) and the top half is too warm, often spoiling during transportation. Also, because of this, the car cannot be filled to its volumetric capacity. Therefore the requirements which led to the invention of this type of fan were as follows: 1. To provide a sufficient volume of air, against the resistance developed in passing through the fruit, to obtain the cooling characteristics required. 2. To provide a fan which would not require major changes in the structural design of the car, or lessen the amount of fruit which could be carried. 3. To provide a fan, simple in construction and installation, and in its drive mechanism from the car axle. The oscillating vane-type fan met conditions 2 and 3 in that it could be situated in the four and one half inch space between the <b>floor</b> <b>racks</b> and the <b>floor</b> of the car, through which the air naturally circulated, and in that it could be driven by a simple wheel and crank drive directly off the axle.
