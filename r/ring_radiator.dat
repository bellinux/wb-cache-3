40|$|A compact planar {{monopole}} ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with dual band-notched characteristics {{is proposed}} {{in order to}} minimize the interference between UWB systems and existing world interoperability for microwave access and wireless local area network operating bands. The antenna has a microstrip line-fed circular <b>ring</b> <b>radiator</b> with one etched partial concentric annular slot and one semi-circular slot. Two rectangular slots are also etched to connect the slots to the outer and inner periphery of the circular <b>ring</b> <b>radiator.</b> The desired dual band-notched UWB operation can be obtained by choosing the size and location of the etched slots. Experimental results show that with a compact size of 24 [*]mm[*]×[*] 26 [*]mm the proposed antenna achieves a wide impedance bandwidth from 2. 79 to more than 11 [*]GHz with two frequency notched bands of 3. 3 – 3. 8 and 5. 1 – 6 [*]GHz for WiMAX and WLAN, respectively.

40|$|An {{annular ring}} {{microstrip}} antenna (ARMSA) with a {{defected ground structure}} for multi-band operation is being proposed. Defected ground structure is produced by integrating a circular slot in the ground plane having different centre with the annular <b>ring</b> <b>radiator</b> patch. Microstrip line feed is used to excite the annular ring patch antenna placed on an FR 4 substrate (dielectric constant εr = 4). Results of the proposed antenna are carried out using Ansoft HFSS simulation software, and compared with the measured results, which shows good agreement. It is observed that the proposed antenna shows four bands at f 1 = 2. 92 GHz, f 2 = 5. 64 GHz, f 3 = 8. 21 GHz, and f 4 = 10. 53 GHz with an impedance bandwidth of 70 %, 50 %, 20 % and 10 % respectively.

40|$|A {{low-cost}} beamformer {{phased array}} antenna has been developed for expendable launch vehicles, rockets, and missiles. It utilizes a conformal array antenna of <b>ring</b> or individual <b>radiators</b> (design varies depending on application) {{that is designed to}} be fed by the recently developed hybrid electrical/mechanical (vendor-supplied) phased array beamformer. The combination of these new array antennas and the hybrid beamformer results in a conformal {{phased array antenna}} that has significantly higher gain than traditional omni antennas, and costs an order of magnitude or more less than traditional phased array designs. Existing omnidirectional antennas for sounding rockets, missiles, and expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) do not have sufficient gain to support the required communication data rates via the space network. Missiles and smaller ELVs are often stabilized in flight by a fast (i. e. 4 Hz) roll rate. This fast roll rate, combined with vehicle attitude changes, greatly increases the complexity of the high-gain antenna beam-tracking problem. Phased arrays for larger ELVs with roll control are prohibitively expensive. Prior techniques involved a traditional fully electronic phased array solution, combined with highly complex and very fast inertial measurement unit phased array beamformers. The functional operation of this phased array is substantially different from traditional phased arrays in that it uses a hybrid electrical/mechanical beamformer that creates the relative time delays for steering the antenna beam via a small physical movement of variable delay lines. This movement is controlled via an innovative antenna control unit that accesses an internal measurement unit for vehicle attitude information, computes a beam-pointing angle to the target, then points the beam via a stepper motor controller. The stepper motor on the beamformer controls the beamformer variable delay lines that apply the appropriate time delays to the individual array elements to properly steer the beam. The array of phased <b>ring</b> <b>radiators</b> is unique in that it provides improved gain for a small rocket or missile that uses spin stabilization for stability. The antenna pattern created is symmetric about the roll axis (like an omnidirectional wraparound), and is thus capable of providing continuous coverage that is compatible with very fast spinning rockets. For larger ELVs with roll control, a linear array of elements can be used for the 1 D scanned beamformer and phased array, or a 2 D scanned beamformer can be used with an NxN element array...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis investigates {{the design of}} an anti-skywave (ASW) AM broadcast antenna. The parameters of a typical AM broadcast antenna are presented first. Then the design proposed by Richard L. Biby is studied by numerical modeling with the Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC). Biby's proposed design involves a <b>ring</b> of short <b>radiators</b> with a conventional monopole operating over finite ground. To analyze the behaviour of Biby's proposed ASW antenna, a generic radiator study is conducted to test the ability of different sized radiators to launch the sky wave and the ground wave first as isolated elements and then as closely coupled radiators with cancelling phasing. Finally, some potential candidate structures are proposed for AM broadcast transmission which might achieve the desired characteristics of ground wave enhancement and sky wave suppression.

40|$|A compact {{circular}} polarized (CP) double-ring antenna with {{directional pattern}} is proposed {{based on the}} Yagi-Uda concept. After integrating a local-grounded coupler inside the square ring, a circular polarized wave can be effectively radiated by exciting two orthogonally linearly polarized fundamental modes of the ring resonator, leading to a smaller size than using other high-order modes of the ring. Since the side length of miniaturized patch hybrid coupler is {{much smaller than the}} quarter-wavelength (), the whole coupler plus feeders can be fully embedded inside the <b>ring</b> <b>radiator.</b> To obtain a directional radiation pattern, the second meandered ring is then mounted under the square ring, which can be considered as an inductive Yagi-Uda reflector. Since the physical area of the reflector is almost the same with the square-ring radiator, the total size of the antenna is only about, which can be a good candidate of the antennas for handled mobile terminals. Finally, a prototype of the proposed antenna is designed and fabricated. The measured results show a good agreement with the simulated resultspublished_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} heat {{treatment}} at 42. 9 +/- 0. 4 degrees C for 30 - 90 min of rat cervical spinal cord (cervical 5 -thoracic 2) were investigated in animals which {{had received a}} priming treatment at 42. 3 +/- 0. 4 degrees for 60 min in the same region 24 hours before. Hyperthermia to the cervical region in the rat was applied by a coaxial double <b>ring</b> <b>radiator,</b> operating at a frequency of 434 MHz. The test heat treatment led to neurological complications, ranging from unco-ordinated use of the forelegs to paralysis of both forelegs. Death was observed, presumably {{as a result of}} respiratory paralysis. The animals that received the priming heat treatment were more resistant to heat injury than those without priming. The LD 50, 60 days, for animals without and with priming treatment was respectively at 41 +/- 2 min 42. 9 degrees C and at 88 +/- 7 min 42. 9 degrees C. The TTR calculated from the LD 50, 60 days, data is 2. 1 +/- 0. 2. Almost all animals, without priming, that did not die {{as a result of the}} treatment, recovered in the period from day 1 to day 60 after hyperthermia. Animals that had received a priming exposure were less able to recover from neurological symptoms induced by the test heat treatment. For this reason the induced resistance to thermal injury after priming exposure was more pronounced in the data on lethality than on neurological symptoms. Spinal cord histology from animals that did not recover from neurological symptoms showed extensive non-vascular damage to both gray and white matte...|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, {{we explore}} the {{generation}} of light in transformation-optical media. When charged particles move through a transformation-optical material with a speed larger than the phase velocity {{of light in the}} medium, Cherenkov light is emitted. We show that the emitted Cherenkov cone can be modified with longitudinal and transverse stretching of the coordinates. Transverse coordinates stretching alters only the dimensions of the cone, whereas longitudinal stretching also changes the apparent velocity of the charged particle. These results demonstrate that the geometric formalism of transformation optics can be used not only for the manipulation of light beam trajectories, but also for controlling the emission of light, here for describing the Cherenkov cone in an arbitrary anisotropic medium. Subsequently, we illustrate this point by designing a <b>radiator</b> for a <b>ring</b> imaging Cherenkov <b>radiator.</b> Cherenkov radiators are used to identify unknown elementary particles by determining their mass from the Cherenkov radiation cone that is emitted as they pass through the detector apparatus. However, at higher particle momentum, the angle of the Cherenkov cone saturates to a value independent of the mass of the generating particle, making it difficult to effectively distinguish between different particles. Using our transformation optics description, we show how the Cherenkov cone and the cut-off can be controlled to yield a radiator medium with enhanced sensitivity for particle identification at higher momentum [Phys. Rey. Lett. 113, 167402 (2014) ]...|$|R
5000|$|The Hotchkiss {{was based}} on a design by Captain Baron Adolf Odkolek von Ujezda of Vienna. The patents had been {{purchased}} in 1893 by the firm of Benjamin Hotchkiss, based in Saint-Denis, near Paris. Benjamin Hotchkiss was no longer alive {{at the time of the}} purchase, but the Odkolek design was further developed and greatly improved under the direction of American-born Laurence Vincent Benét (1863-1948) with the assistance of Henri Albert Mercié. After trials that began in 1895, development issues were resolved leading to the initial purchase of the Hotchkiss gun by the French Military in 1897. In 1898 an export model was also offered for international sales by Hotchkiss. With some useful changes, such as the addition of five cooling <b>radiator</b> <b>rings</b> on the barrel, the same basic design led to the M1900, and later to the M1914 (with minor improvements that were added since 1908). In the meantime adoption of the St. Étienne Mle 1907 (a French government arsenal product [...] ) to equip the infantry went through in 1908. Nevertheless, Hotchkiss machine guns were also purchased by the French military for use in overseas colonies and by mountain troops in the Alps. By the 1916, during World War I, French line infantry, still equipped with the unsatisfactory Saint-Etienne, convinced General Petain that it needed the more reliable Hotchkiss. It got its wish and French infantry divisions became progressively outfitted with the Hotchkiss gun in late 1917 and early 1918.|$|R
