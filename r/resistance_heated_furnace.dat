Cubic {{silicon carbide}} (3 C-SiC) thin films were grown on (100) and (111) Si {{substrates}} by CVD technique using hexamethyldisilane (HMDS) {{as the source}} material in a <b>resistance</b> <b>heated</b> <b>furnace.</b> HMDS {{was used as the}} single source for both Si and C though propane was available for the preliminary carbonization. For selective epitaxial growth, patterned Si (100) substrates were used. The effect of different growth para-meters such as substrate orientation, growth temperature, precursor concentration, etc on growth was exa-mined to improve the film quality.

To minimize the gas-phase reaction a cooled entry system has been developed. The dominance of surface reaction control resulted in columnar growth. The role of the grain boundaries, characterizing polycrystals, were examined. For transport properties measurements the polysilicon layers were isolated by a chemical vapor deposited silicon dioxide film on a silicon substrate. Deep lying electron and hole trapping center concentrations were related to grain sizes. The characteristic measured mobility minima {{as a function of}} carrier concentrations, were associated to the crossing of the Fermi energy the appropriate deep lying impurity level. The criteria of impurity band formation, associated to grain boundaries introduced dangling bonds, were examined.

The annealing temperatures were varied and the samples were characterised with Auger electron spectroscopy, glancing incidence X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. As-deposited a-Si 0. 8 C 0. 2 :H thin films contain {{a large amount of}} hydrogen and are amorphous. When annealing the films, the onset of Si crystallisation appears at 700 °C. For higher annealing temperatures, we observed SiC crystallites in addition to the Si nanocrystals (NCs). The crystallisation of SiC correlates with the occurrence of a strong PL band, which is strongly reduced after hydrogen passivation. Thus PL signal originates from the SiC matrix. Si NCs exhibit no PL yield due to their inhomogeneous size distribution...|$|E

40|$|This work {{examined}} {{the influence of}} processing parameters on the production of Al-SiC metal matrix composites (MMC) by batch compocasting process. Processing parameters investigated includes tirring speed, stirring time, stirrer geometry, stirrer position, metal fluid temperature (viscosity). Room temperature (25 °C) visual simulations, computer simulations and validation Al-SiC MMC production tests were performed. In the visual and computer simulations, water an d g ly c e ro l/water were used to represent liquid an d semi-solid a lum in ium respectively. The effects of viscosities of 1, 300, 500, 800 and 1000 mPas and stirrin g speeds of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 rpm were investigated. A 10 vol. % reinforced SiC particulate, {{similar to that used}} in the aluminium MMC’s, was used in the visualisation and computational tests. The visualisation tests were carried out in a transparent glass beaker. The computational simulation was performed with Fluent(CFD software) an d an ad d on package MixSim. This consisted of a 2 D axisym metric multip h a se time dependent simulation of the production routeusing an Eulerian (granular) model. The dependence of particle dispersion times, settling timesand vortex height on stirring geometry and stirrer speed was found. A blade angle of 60 degrees was found better for the flat blade stirrer, to obtain uniform particulate dispersions quickly. From the setestsas tirrin g speed of 150 rpm for water-SiC an d 300 rpm for the glycerol/water-S iC sy stem were found to be necessary in order to obtain a uniformd is tribution of the SiC. A viscosity increase from 1 mPas (for liquid metal) to 300 m Pas (for semi-solid metal) was found to have a tremendous effect on the SiC dispersion and settling times. However, a further increase from 300 mPas to 1000 mPashad negligible effect on this time. A significant part of the work consisted of the design, construction and validation of a specialised quick quench compocaster for this high temperature processing method. This machine consisted of a stirrer with four 60 degree angled flat blades and a cruciblein a <b>resistance</b> <b>heated</b> <b>furnace</b> chamber.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, an attempt {{has been made}} to prepare ZrB 2 powder by self-propagating high {{temperature}} synthesis (SHS) technique. The effect of synthesis on the purity and morphology of powder is investigated. A stoichiometric mixture of ZrO 2, H 3 BO 3 and Mg powder is synthesised in a <b>resistance</b> <b>heating</b> tubular <b>furnace</b> with continuous flow of high pure argon gas. The synthesis is also carried out with NaCl as a diluent. The MgO is leached out from the as-synthsised powder. Phase analysis of powder is performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of thin Fe-Cr-Al {{heating element}} strips was investigated {{with respect to}} the oxidation limited life times and geometrical changes during <b>resistance</b> and <b>furnace</b> <b>heating.</b> For this purpose, isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests varying in their total exposure time and cycle duration were performed in the temperature range 1050 - 1200 degrees C. Specimens subjected to rapid cyclic, <b>resistance</b> <b>heating</b> revealed shorter life times than calculated for specimens subjected to isothermal exposure. The life times were found to increase with increasing cycle duration and hence decreasing number of cycles for a given time at temperature. This life time decrease is related to an "hour glass" waviness of the specimens, which develops during prolonged thermal cycling. The development of this plastic deformation also occurred during <b>furnace</b> <b>heated,</b> thermal cycling tests. A two-step mechanism is introduced combining an oxidation kinetics related time to the onset of significant waviness with an enhancement of this waviness {{as a result of a}} ratcheting effect. The latter seems to strongly depend on the number of cycles and on the plastic deformation generated during each cycle rather than on the total time at temperature. The development of an "hour glass" waviness leads to an enhanced aluminium depletion due to an increase of the specimen surface area. Additional deformation phenomena like "hot tube" or "corkscrew" behaviour occur during the <b>resistance</b> <b>heating</b> tests. These are related to a temperature gradient that develops over the specimen width due to the poor aspect ratio of the specimens...|$|R

40|$|Boron carbide is {{produced}} in a <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>furnace</b> using boric oxide and petroleum coke as the raw materials. In this process, a large current is passed through the graphite rod located {{at the center of}} the cylindrical furnace, which is surrounded by the coke and boron oxide mixture. Heat generated due to <b>resistance</b> <b>heating</b> is responsible for the reaction of boron oxide with coke which results in the formation of boron carbide. The whole process is highly energy intensive and inefficient in terms of the production of boron carbide. Only 15 % charge gets converted into boron carbide. The aim of the present work is to develop a mathematical model for this batch process and validate the model with experiments and to optimize the operating parameters to increase the productivity. To mathematically model the process and understand the influence of various operating parameters on the productivity, existing simple one-dimensional (1 -D) mathematical model in radial direction is modified first. Two-dimensional (2 -D) model can represent the process better; therefore in second stage of the project a 2 -D mathematical model is also developed. For both, 1 -D and 2 -D models, coupled heat and mass balance equations are solved using finite volume technique. Both the models have been tested for time step and grid size independency. The kinetics of the reaction is represented using nucleation growth mechanism. Conduction, convection and radiation terms are considered in the formulation of heat transfer equation. Fraction of boron carbide formed and temperature profiles in the radial direction are obtained computationally. Experiments were conducted on a previously developed experimental setup consisting of <b>heat</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>furnace,</b> a power supply unit and electrode cooling device. The <b>heating</b> <b>furnace</b> is made of stainless steel body with high temperature ceramic wool insulation. In order to validate the mathematical model, experiments are performed in various conditions. Temperatures are measured at various locations in the furnace and samples are collected from the various locations (both in radial and angular directions) in the furnace for chemical analysis. Also, many experimental data are used from the previous work to validate the computed results. For temperatures measurement, pyrometer, C, B and K type thermocouple were used. It is observed that results obtained from both the models (1 -D and 2 -D) are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. Once the models are validated with the experiments, sensitivity analysis of various parameters such as power supply, initial percentage of B 4 C in the charge, composition of the charge, and various modes of power supply, on the process is performed. It is found that linear power supply mode, presence of B 4 C in the initial mixture and increase in power supply give better productivity (fraction reacted). In order to have more confidence in the developed models, the parameters of one the computed results in the sensitivity analysis parameters are chosen (in present case, linear power supply is chosen) to perform the experiment.

During experimental work, the alloy was heated to 750 °C by <b>resistance</b> <b>heated</b> box <b>furnace</b> and solidified at various cooling rates. Cooling curves for the metal were recorded with two thermocouples, one at the centre of the melt volume and one beside the containing crucible wall. A specially designed chamber with kaowool blanket was used to achieve the slowest cooling rate. The faster cooling rate was achieved with the crucible in open atmosphere with a set air flow rate over the crucible. A Data Acquisition (DAQ) system controlled by LabVIEW software was used to record the temperature-time profiles. From these cooling curves, the phase change at any corresponding time and temperature was estimated. The temperature difference between centre and wall of crucible was used to determine dendritic coherency point (DCP). Results show that, the slowest cooling rate with the kaowool blanket was at 0. 03 °C/s. An intermediate cooling rate of 0. 21 °C/s was achieved by leaving the melt to cool without kaowool blanket or forced air flow, and the fastest cooling rate was 0. 43 °C/s. The change in cooling rate altered the temperatures at which phase changes occurred, including those for eutectic and solidus.
