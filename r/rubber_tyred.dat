The prominent treads of the metal plates are both hard-wearing and damage resistant, especially in comparison to <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b> The aggressive treads of the tracks provide good traction in soft surfaces but can damage paved surfaces, so some metal tracks can have rubber pads installed for use on paved surfaces.|$|R
