40|$|After {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis, India was exposed to many external shocks from commodity prices and foreign capital flows. Although capital flow fluctuations were largely due to global risk-on risk-off factors, a widening current account deficit (CAD) contributed to India's vulnerability to external shocks. The major source of shocks was external, but policy mistakes increased India's vulnerability. These included inadequate attention to sectoral bottlenecks that reduced export growth and domestic financial savings, while substitution away from expensive oil imports was discouraged. Dependence on foreign capital, to finance the CAD, rose while degrees of freedom from continuing capital controls were underutilized to reduce exchange rate volatility and to smooth interest rates. Steep depreciations combined with volatility did not help exporters. Evaluation of measures to stabilize the exchange rate establishes that temporarily taking oil marketing companies demand {{out of the market}} was the most effective, since small demand-supply mismatches lead to large currency movements in thin markets. Prudential measures such as increasing position limits, margin requirements are to be preferred to a ban on a market or a transaction-type.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the conventional wisdom, real estate activity in the aggregate is not disfavored by the 1986 Tax Act. Within the broad aggregate, however, widely different impacts are to be expected. Regular rental and commercial activity will be slightly disfavored, while historic and old rehabilitation activity will be greatly disfavored. In contrast, owner- occupied housing, {{far and away the}} largest component of real estate, is favored, both directly by an interest rate decline and indirectly owing to the increase in rents. Low-income rental housing may be the most favored of all real estate activities. The rent increase for residential properties will be 10 to 15 percent with our assumption of a percentage point decline in interest rates. For commercial properties, the expected rent increase is 5 to 10 percent. The market value decline, which will be greater the longer and further investors think rents will be below the new equilibrium, is unlikely to exceed 4 percent in fast growth markets, even if substantial excess capacity currently exists. In no-growth markets with substantial excess capacity, market values could decline by as much as 8 percent from already depressed levels. Average housing costs will decrease slightly for households with incomes below about $ 60, 000, but increase by 5 percent for those with incomes above twice this level. With the projected increase in rents, homeownership should rise for all income classes, but especially for those with income under $ 60, 000. The aggregate home ownership rate is projected to increase by three percentage points in the long run in response to the Tax Act. The new passive loss limitations are likely to lower significantly the values of recent loss-motivated partnership deals and of properties in areas where the economics have turned sour (vacancy rates have risen sharply). The limitations should have little impact on new construction and market rents, however. <b>Reduced</b> <b>depreciation</b> write-offs, lower interest rates, and higher rents all act to lower expected passive losses.

EiM has been running from 2005 and is now finalized in May 2010. Within the EiM project, the local energy company, Falkenberg Energi AB (FEAB), has received EU-funding of totally 98 200 Euro for the two local heating systems consist of a completely new small scale district heating system in Ullared and one partly new in Vessigebro, in the north-east part of the municipality of Falkenberg. The system in Ullared, which this report is focusing on, a prefabricated transportable heating plant with a boiler of 1500 kW has been installed. The fuel used is pellets. The pipe network consists now of about 2, 5 km of double pipeline. 22 customers have been con-nected so far, representing a heat demand of about 2400 MWh annually. The main customers are the school building, health care centre, elderly housing and the parish. The main pipe network is made up of traditional double district heating pipes of steel with polyurethane insulation and a polythene casing. The financial results have improved during 2009, mostly due to greatly <b>reduced</b> <b>depreciations.</b> For 2009 the result was + 304 000 SEK. (2008 : - 146 000 SEK) The heat density of the system in Ullared is, being a small scale district heating system, quite normal with a linear heat density of about 0, 8 MWh/m. But the key problem of the district heating system in Ullared is the very low connection rate which is roughly estimated to 22 %. This is for the system in Ullared at the same time a well needed future potential for expansion. The Environmental impact is important for many customers when they chose their heating system and it is usually a good argument for the district heating industry as a whole. However, the environmental impact from low density district heating systems is higher than for traditional systems since both heat losses and resource depletion from pipes and components increase with lower heat density. Still research report referred to in this report states that the choice of district heating is a good choice for the environmental impact for those property owners who today uses fossil fuel for heating. One estimation says roughly a reduction of 40 tons of CO 2 -equivalents per year compared with oil furnace heating. Finally, the small scale district heating system in Ullared has definitely the potential of attracting more customers in the future with a well spread out distribution net with many buildings close situated offering an alternative for change of heating system for potential customers for a future connection when energy prices for oil and electricity increases even more. Anyway it will have a positive impact on the environment both globally and locally.

The study examines the effect of exchange rate on the mode of operation of the firms. We find that a depreciation in the currency of the host country will unambiguously raises FDI flows from foreign firms only if initially the firms are mainly exporting. Once they have become multinationals, the depreciation in the currency of the host country may give different effect on the FDI flows.

Simulations of a simple two-sector open economy growth model based on Matsuyama (1992) suggest that a weaker real {{exchange rate}} can lead to a "growth surge", as workers move into traded goods industries with more "learning by doing" and exit non-traded goods sectors with slower productivity growth.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three essays {{that are}} linked by {{their focus on}} dynamic models of political economy, in which farsighted agents interact over {{an infinite number of}} periods, and the strategic environment evolves endogenously over time. In Chapter 2, "Dynamic Legislative Bargaining with Veto Power", I analyze the consequences of veto power in an infinitely repeated divide-the-dollar bargaining game with an endogenous status quo policy. I show that a Markov equilibrium of this dynamic game exists, and that, irrespective of the discount factor of legislators, their recognition probabilities, and the initial division of the dollar, policy eventually gets arbitrarily close to full appropriation of the dollar by the veto player. Chapters 3 and 4 [...] -coauthored with Thomas Palfrey and Marco Battaglini [...] -study free riding in a dynamic environment where a durable public good provides a stream of benefits over time and agents have opportunities to gradually build the stock.

With reversibility, there is a continuum of equilibrium steady states: the highest equilibrium steady state of the public good is increasing in the group size, and the lowest is decreasing. With irreversibility, the set of equilibrium steady states converges to a unique point as depreciation converges to zero: the highest steady state possible with reversibility. In Chapter 4, "The Dynamic Free Rider Problem: An Experimental Study", we test the results from this model with controlled laboratory experiments. The comparative static predictions for the treatments are supported by the data: irreversible investment leads to significantly higher public good production than reversible investment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{literature}} on small open economies has studied separately two opposite effects of currency depreciation during crises: {{in the presence}} of nominal wage rigidity, exchange rate <b>depreciation</b> <b>reduces</b> unemployment; {{in the presence of}} collateral constraints that link external debt to the value of income, exchange rate depreciation tightens the collateral constraint and leads to higher consumption adjustment. This paper shows that in a model that includes both frictions, exchange rate policy faces a “credit access - unemployment trade-off," i. e., a trade-off between reducing involuntary unemployment and relaxing the external credit limit. A quantitative study of this model shows that during financial crisis episodes, optimal policy features large nominal and real exchange rate depreciation. This is because, while containing real exchange rate depreciation can have welfare gains related to second moments (lower consumption volatility) its costs are related to first-moments (higher average unemployment rate). The optimal policy implies a lower currency depreciation than that necessary to achieve full employment, which is consistent with “managed-floating" exchange rate policy, typically observed during financial crises in emerging economies. Sudden Stops (or large current account adjustments) are part of the endogenous response under the optimal exchange rate policy to large negative shocks...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the real}} option literature, {{whether or not}} {{uncertainty}} shocks drive business cycles depends {{on the degree of}} adjustment frictions. The more plants freeze and remain inactive in response to increased uncertainty, the stronger the adverse effects on the economic activity. Using quarterly labor flow data of U. S. establishments, we find that an unexpected increase in uncertainty reduces hiring, quits and job creation, while it raises layoffs and job destruction. Our finding suggests that plants remain active as a result of uncertainty shocks. A partial equilibrium model with capital and labor adjustment costs can not explain our empirical results. Surprise increases in uncertainty leads plants to freeze investment and labor policies. We are able to rationalize our findings using a version of this model without labor adjustment frictions. As uncertainty increases, more plants adopt a wait-and-see policy for investment. This, in turn, <b>reduces</b> capital through <b>depreciation</b> of the existing capital stock, and thereby lowers labor demand, which implies more layoffs and less hiring. The model implies that economies with flexible labor market regulations should experience more layoffs and job destruction upon an uncertainty shock with respect to economies with stricter regulations.

40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the {{possible}} impact that the depreciation of a common currency can have on {{the stability of the}} related monetary union. It shows that, other things being equal, this <b>depreciation</b> <b>reduces</b> the probability of the weakest Member States leaving the monetary union when hit by a specific and negative demand shock, and the probability of other Member States, which belong to the same area but are not directly hit by any shock, deciding to leave due to the contagion effect. Obviously, the depreciation of the common currency is not the only variable affecting the stability of a monetary area. In this respect, it is sufficient to recall that competition in the international markets is not just price competition. Hence, the paper also analyzes the role played by trade balance elasticities. In our framework, it emerges that higher (lower) elasticities of the weakest countries hit by the specific shock make their exit more (less) likely. Moreover, given the elasticities of these same countries, there is a threshold value in the elasticities of the other Member States under which contagion can never happen. It is apparent that this framework applies to the possible behavior of ‘peripheral’ countries in the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), and to their interactions {{with the rest of the}} area. Hence, this paper can be read as a strategic interaction between two representative countries of the euro area in order to identify the selection mechanisms between good and bad equilibria...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the role that income tax incentives to landlords play in the determination of market rental rates. Landlords typically receive benefits from accelerated depreciation on real assets that are usually appreciating. The value of this tax benefit depends both on the depreciation schedule {{as well as the}} landlord's marginal tax rate. Changes in income tax law in the 1980 's dramatically affected both of these factors. In 1980, the top federal marginal tax rate was 70 %, and rental housing could be depreciated on a double-declining balance over 20 years. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1980 reduced the top marginal tax rate significantly. Changes were made in 1984 that altered the depreciation schedule so that rental property could be depreciated more rapidly. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reformed the depreciation schedule so that rental property had to be depreciated over 27 years: a significant change for landlords. In addition, the top federal marginal tax rate was reduced to 33 percent. The main direction of the changes in the federal tax code in the 1980 's was to decrease the tax advantages associated with rental property. Decreases in the top marginal tax rate reduced the value of tax write-offs, while increases in the length of time required for <b>depreciation</b> <b>reduced</b> the amount of depreciation taken each year.

He shows that faster human capital <b>depreciation</b> <b>reduces</b> unemployment, which leads to more job creation and less job destruction. This effect works in an opposite direction compared with the standard capital obsolence effect that reduces job duration. The second essay examines a search model with heterogeneous workers and jobs by assuming that high-quality workers can undertake both high-quality and low-quality jobs, while low-quality workers can only carry out low-quality jobs. He extends the existing literature as follows: (i) the distribution of skills across workers is endogenized and (ii) the labour force participation is also endogenized. The third essay concentrates on business cycles and taxation in a matching model by studying the effects of labour taxes and reforms thereof on equilibrium unemployment and the sensitivity of an economy to macroeconomic shocks. The policy instruments to be analyzed are (i) the marginal tax rate, (ii) the tax subsidy to produce a tax progression scheme and (iii) the replacement ratio to account for variability in the outside option for workers. He shows, for example, that a higher marginal tax rate and a higher replacement ratio amplify shocks, while tax subsidies dampen them...|$|R
40|$|This thesis empirically {{examines}} {{the effects of}} oil prices on the trade balances of oil importing and exporting Sub-Saharan African countries. These countries depend heavily on international trade for foreign exchange and economic growth, and fluctuations in oil prices have direct implications for their terms of trade. This thesis contributes to the oil price-trade balance literature by focusing on three aspects of this relationship that are unexplored. First, this thesis introduces the issue of nonlinear oil price effects to the trade balance literature. Using a Threshold Vector Autoregressive Model, it estimates asymmetric and threshold effects of oil prices on the trade balance, focusing on oil price volatility {{as the source of}} nonlinearity. Nonlinearities are shown to be stronger in the effects of oil price volatility shocks than oil price level shocks: volatility shocks have larger effects on the trade balance when they occur in an already volatile environment, and decreases in oil price volatility have larger effects than increases. Second, this thesis pioneers the empirical investigation of the role of real exchange rates in determining the effects of oil prices on the trade balance. Using a Cross Section Dependence robust panel data method, this thesis shows that real exchange rate <b>depreciations</b> <b>reduce</b> the effects of oil prices on the trade balances of SSA countries, while real appreciations reinforce these effects. Third, this thesis is the first study to empirically investigate how higher international financial risk sharing affects the response of the trade balance to oil prices. To do this, it employs a Panel Smooth Transition Regression model. The results show that oil importing SSA countries that are well integrated in global financial markets, with higher access to foreign funds, fare better when the oil price is high: they are able to avoid large fluctuations in their nonoil trade balances by smoothing nonoil consumption...|$|R
