40|$|The {{inevitable}} {{production of}} {{errors in the}} information business violates the citizen's right to obtain truthful information which permits him to form criteria with regard to daily problems {{in order to be}} able to choose correctly among the possible options presented. This is in effect the essence of democratic action. The sociological concepts of some countries such as the United States make it such that the graveness of the harm that may be wrought by erroneous information may be considered less serious than the danger in which freedon of the press places itself by permitting the invasion of the information media by individual and official organisms through the granting of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> of erroneous information. Other systems on the other hand consider that the juridical framework must anticipate the urgent re-establishment of the truth, giving rise to the birth of what has be en called the «rectificative control" of information by means of the figures of law of the right of reply attributed to individuals, and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> which can be exercised by public authorities and official organisms. It would appear to be interesting to study this figure -admitted in our legal and juridical system- and to which there is assigned as juridical nature that of «a public duty of service» defined by LUCIFREDI. As well as examining at length the historical antecedents and compared legislation with regard to the subject matter, the author sets down the foundation of the concept and the characteristics of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rectification.</b> He also studies those aspects which relate to the active subject -authorities and the organs of the Administration- and to the passive subject -directors of periodic publications and of Information Agencies- as well as to the circumstances produced by the birth of the right and the conditions under which this right has to be exercised, and a number of other related aspects. These include the function assigned by our legislation to the official press organisms -which is not that of a simple intermediary but rather that of the qualification of the rectifying information and the power of decision over the propriety of ordaining the insertion of the rectifications- and the duties imposed by the norms in force upon the passive subject and the possibility of responsability in the case of nonfulfilment, in its administrative, penal and civil facets. The author then ends by examining the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> as applied on the international level, both from the standpoint of its possib!e exercise on the part of authorities and organisms of one country in another country, and of its exercise at the State level...|$|E

40|$|Bernard Williams {{has noted}} the {{tendency}} of certain types of political thought to inform past societies about their moral failings. This is certainly true of the history and political thought focussed on indigenous peoples, whether written by indigenous or non-indigenous scholars. In such writing, contemporary conceptions of justice are used to find the actions of past colonial governments immoral thus justifying the scholars conclusions as to the moral <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>rectification.</b> Avoiding the obvious and much traversed methodological problems {{in the production of}} such histories, I focus instead on the denial of indigenous voice and self-determination that is enabled by such moralism. I do so by noting the exclusion of indigenous peoples from the basic political demands that we all have, and could expect from any political authority, indigenous or non- indigenous: in particular the enforcing of property rules, but also stability, order, the conditions of co-operation etc. I suggest that by thinking through how best to theorise an answer to those demands by indigenous peoples, political theory (and in turn, politics itself) would turn to the actual political demands of indigenous peoples, and not the moralising imaginations of scholars...|$|R

40|$|Bankruptcy {{courts have}} {{frequently}} been characterized as courts of equity. Often this characterization has accompanied unusually relaxed interpretation or {{application of a}} provision of the Bankruptcy Code. However, this understanding does not exhaust the meaning of equity in bankruptcy. Historically, equity covered a large range of topics–trusts and estates, injunction, contracts, specific performance, unjust enrichment, restitution, and disgorgement. In addition, equity {{was not limited to}} particular remedies. Equity’s remedies certainly included money damages but recognized many more. The law of equity was substantive as well as remedial; it recognized primary rights as well as secondary <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>rectification.</b> Among equity 2 ̆ 7 s primary rights were equitable interests in property. And section 541 (a) of Bankruptcy Code includes such equitable interests in its definition of property of the estate. If equity once boasted a substantial substantive content, what was it? The answer is found in the title of the Restatement Third, Restitution and Unjust Enrichment (R 3 RUE). Unjust (or unjustifiable) enrichment provides the conceptual core of this body of law. As the converse of tort law, which identifies unjustified harms to another, unjust enrichment recognizes unjustified benefits to another, at least to the extent they come at the claimant’s expense. Notwithstanding the merger of law and equity, in the mid- 1990 ’s the American Law Institute appointed Andrew Kull as the reporter for the R 3 RUE. With final approval in 2010, we can expect to see the R 3 RUE affect the legal landscape in the near future. It is that impending impact in bankruptcy that constitutes the burden of this article. Part I briefly summarizes the substantive law of equity as expressed in the R 3 RUE. It addresses the substantive core of law of equity. Distinct categories of operative facts such as benefits conferred by mistake or without request, pursuant to a voidable contract, or as a result of wrongful interference with the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> a claimant ground unjust enrichment. Part II surveys the remedial aspects of the R 3 RUE comprising the four so-called proprietary remedies–constructive trust, equitable lien, subrogation, and the paired set of rescission and restitution. These proprietary remedies are the equitable interests in property {{that are part of the}} property of the estate. Finally, Parts III–VI focus on these four remedies in greater depth and examine how courts operating under the Bankruptcy Code have (mis) applied them. I conclude with specific observations about how the R 3 RUE can and indeed should affect the development of equitable interests by firmly recognizing their place as property of the estate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> current through molecular junctions comprising self-assembled monolayers of decanethiolate through {{the incorporation of}} C 60 fullerene moieties bearing undecanethiol groups in junctions using eutectic Ga–In (EGaIn) and Au conducting probe AFM (CP-AFM) top-contacts. The degree <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> increases with increasing exposure of the decanethiolate monolayers to the fullerene moieties, going through a maximum after 24 h. We ascribe this observation to the resulting mixed-monolayer achieving an optimal packing density of fullerene cages sitting above the alkane monolayer. Thus, the degree <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> {{is controlled by the}} amount of fullerene present in the mixed-monolayer. The voltage dependence of R varies with the composition of the top-contact and the force applied to the junction and the energy of the lowest unoccupied π-state determined from photoelectron spectroscopy is consistent with the direction <b>of</b> <b>rectification.</b> The maximum value <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> R = |J(+) /J(−) | = 940 at ± 1 V or 617 at ± 0. 95 V is in agreement with previous studies on pure monolayers relating the degree <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> to the volume of the head-group on which the frontier orbitals are localized...|$|R

40|$|Two of the {{important}} stages {{in the production of}} maps from remotely sensed imagery are rectification and classification. Residual geometric errors following rectification produce a “component ” of the apparent classification error. Hence, besides being of value in its own <b>right,</b> reduction <b>of</b> the <b>rectification</b> error will enhance the quality of the classification stage, and the classification accuracy statistics will more closely refer to “pure ” classification error rather than classification error due to pixel mismatch. In rectification to ground control points (GCPs) there is a natural limit of what can be achieved in <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> an image, and this is determined by the cost of collecting good GCPs. However, if we are concerned with a sequence of images, and are concerned primarily with estimating change and growth, the rectification is image-to image, and the process becomes one of pixel matching, and the only cost is processing time. We present a spectrally-based pixel-matching algorithm which seems to offer considerable scope for very accurate pixel-to-pixel and hence image-to-image matching. An algorithm is used which maximizes local correlations in each spectral band at each co-registration point: a multivariate anisotropic spatial auto-correlation approach. The results are demonstrated and validated in a case-study of a 1987 Landsat 5 TM image, 1997 Landsat 5 TM image and a 2000 Landsat 7 ETM image, all of the same forested region in China...|$|R

50|$|Rectification is the {{translation}} of the raw EMG signal to a single polarity frequency (usually positive). The purpose of rectifying a signal is to ensure the raw signal does not average zero, due to the raw EMG signal having positive and negative components. The two types <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> signals refer to {{what happens to the}} EMG wave when it is processed. These types include full length frequency and half length. Full length frequency adds the EMG signal below the baseline (usually negative polarity) to the signal above the baseline making a conditioned signal that is all positive. This is the preferred method <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> because it conserves all signal energy for analysis, usually in the positive polarity. Half length rectification deletes the EMG signal below the baseline. In doing so, the average of the data is no longer zero therefore it can be used in statistical analyses. The only difference between the two types <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> is that full-wave rectification takes the absolute value of the signal array of data points.|$|R
