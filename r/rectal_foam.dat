40|$|BACKGROUND: 6 -Mercaptopurine and its prodrug {{azathioprine}} {{are effective}} medications for refractory inflammatory bowel disease. However, {{use of these}} drugs has been limited by concerns about their toxicity. Colonic delivery of azathioprine may reduce its systemic bioavailability and limit toxicity. AIM: To determine the bioavailability of 6 -mercaptopurine after administration of azathioprine via three colonic delivery formulations. METHODS: Twenty four healthy human subjects each received 50 mg of azathioprine by one of four delivery formulations (each n = 6) : oral; delayed release oral; hydrophobic rectal foam; and hydrophilic <b>rectal</b> <b>foam.</b> All subjects also received a 50 mg dose of intravenous azathioprine during a separate study period. Plasma concentrations of 6 -mercaptopurine were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The bioavailabilities of 6 -mercaptopurine after colonic azathioprine administration via delayed release oral, hydrophobic <b>rectal</b> <b>foam,</b> and hydrophilic <b>rectal</b> <b>foam</b> (7 %, 5 %, 1 %; respectively) were {{significantly lower than the}} bioavailability of 6 -mercaptopurine after oral azathioprine administration (47 %) by Wilcoxon rank sum pairwise comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine delivered to the colon by delayed release oral and <b>rectal</b> <b>foam</b> formulations considerably reduced systemic 6 -mercaptopurine bioavailability. The therapeutic potential of these colonic delivery methods, which can potentially limit toxicity by local delivery of high doses of azathioprine, should be investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease...|$|E
40|$|Background & AimsBudesonide is a high-potency, second-generation {{corticosteroid}} {{designed to}} minimize systemic adverse consequences of conventional corticosteroids. We performed 2 randomized, phase 3 trials {{to evaluate the}} ability of budesonide <b>rectal</b> <b>foam,</b> formulated to optimize retention and provide uniform delivery of budesonide to the rectum and distal colon, to induce remission in patients with ulcerative proctitis or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis. MethodsTwo identically designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy of budesonide foam for induction of remission in 546 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative proctitis or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis who received budesonide foam 2 mg/ 25 mL twice daily for 2 weeks, then once daily for 4 weeks, or placebo. ResultsRemission at week 6 occurred significantly more frequently among patients receiving budesonide foam than placebo (Study 1 : 38. 3 % vs 25. 8 %; P =. 0324; Study 2 : 44. 0 % vs 22. 4 %; P <. 0001). A significantly greater percentage of patients receiving budesonide foam vs placebo achieved rectal bleeding resolution (Study 1 : 46. 6 % vs 28. 0 %; P = . 0022; Study 2 : 50. 0 % vs 28. 6 %; P =. 0002) and endoscopic improvement (Study 1 : 55. 6 % vs 43. 2 %; P =. 0486; Study 2 : 56. 0 % vs 36. 7 %; P =. 0013) at week 6. Most adverse events occurred at similar frequencies between groups, although events related to changes in cortisol values were reported more frequently with budesonide foam. There were no cases of clinically symptomatic adrenal insufficiency. ConclusionsBudesonide <b>rectal</b> <b>foam</b> was well tolerated and more efficacious than placebo in inducing remission in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative proctitis and ulcerative proctosigmoiditis.

40|$|George P Christophi, Arvind Rengarajan, Matthew A Ciorba Division of Gastroenterology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune-mediated {{disease of}} the colon that is {{characterized}} by diffuse and continuous inflammation contiguous from the rectum. Half of UC patients have inflammation limited to the distal colon (proctitis or proctosigmoiditis) that primarily causes symptoms of bloody diarrhea and urgency. Mild-to-moderate distal UC can be effectively treated with topical formulations (rectal suppositories, enemas, or foam) of mesalamine or steroids to reduce mucosal inflammation and alleviate symptoms. Enemas or foam formulations adequately reach up to the splenic flexure, have a minimal side-effect ­profile, and induce remission alone or in combination with systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Herein, we compare the efficacy, cost, patient tolerance, and side-effect profiles of steroid and mesalamine rectal formulations in distal UC. Patients with distal mild-to-moderate UC have a remission rate of approximately 75 % (NNT = 2) after treatment for 6 weeks with mesalamine enemas. <b>Rectal</b> budesonide <b>foam</b> induces remission in 41. 2 % of patients with mild-to-moderate active distal UC compared to 24 % of patient treated with placebo (NNT = 5). However, rectal budesonide has better patient tolerance profile compared to enema formulations. Despite its favorable efficacy, safety, and cost profiles, patients and physicians significantly underuse topical treatments for treating distal colitis. This necessitates improved patient education and physician familiarity regarding the indications, effectiveness, and potential financial and tolerability barriers in using rectal formulations.

40|$|Background. Mesalazine Enemas are of well proven {{efficacy}} for the topical {{treatment of}} distal ulcerative colitis. Although new rectal formulations of mesalazine {{are not expected}} to be superior in efficacy and tolerability to standard formulations, they may offer secondary advantages in terms of overall acceptability. Aim. To compare the efficacy: tolerability and overall acceptability, of a new mesalazine <b>rectal</b> <b>foam</b> (Salofalk((R)) foam) with mesalazine enema in the treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis. Patients and Methods. A multicentre study was carried out in patients with active proctitis, proctosigmoiditis and left-sided ulcerative colitis as evaluated by the Clinical Activity Index (CAI {{greater than or equal to}} 4) and Endoscopic Index (EI greater than or equal to 6). Patients were randomly assigned to receive, in open-label fashion, either mesalazine foam 2 g twice a day or mesalazine enema (2 g/ 60 mi twice a day) for 3 weeks. Patients who did not achieve remission (defined as CAI < 4 and EI < 6) after 3 weeks continued the study receiving the alternative galenic formulation for a further 3 weeks. Results, A total of 195 patients were enrolled. Characteristics at baseline were similar except for concomitant therapy with oral 5 -ASA products: during the 1 (st) treatment phase, 41 % of patients on enema received such treatment vs only 29 % of those on foam. Patients with at least one post-treatment efficacy evaluation were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (n= 89 foam, n= 96 enema). After 3 weeks of treatment, 112 patients were in remission and only 59 patients entered the 2 (nd) treatment phase thus providing data on acceptability. Remission was achieved after 3 weeks in 54 % of patients treated with foam and in 67 % of those treated with enema. The 90 % confidence interval for the difference in remission rates was 0 to 24 and thus within the clinically acceptable range of therapeutic equivalence. At the end of the 2 (nd) phase, 70 % of patients switched to foam were in remission vs 65 % to the enema, Two patients discontinued treatment with foam prematurely due to anal bunting. No clinically important changes were seen in the laboratory tests. Conclusions. Salofalk((R)) foam and enema are equally effective for the treatment of proctitis, proctosigmoiditis and left-sided ulcerative colitis. The new foam preparation is as well tolerated and accepted as enemas and can be used as a therapeutic alternative to conventional mesalazine enema formulations...|$|E
