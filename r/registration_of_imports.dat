Nanotechnology is intensively {{developing}} and is mostly introduced in renewable energy, cosmetics, nanomedicine, electricity and electronics thereby increasing amount of nanowaste has been challenging {{issue in the}} world. However waste management policy in Mongolia has incomplete, nanowaste regulation has to be embedded {{in order to protect}} environment and human health. Because environmental and health impact of nanomaterial is still open field for researchers. The main objectives of this study are to introduce test results of some nanomaterials, and to evaluate waste including nanowaste management policy in Mongolia. 21 nanomaterials were tested by X-Ray Diffraction analysis, Cross Correlation Analysis and the Ames test. As a result, physical sizes of 5 nanomaterials were measured at less than 100 nm, and all samples were non-mutagenic. In conclusion, the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> goods in Mongolia needs to be improved in high technology products and safety data sheet for nanomaterial is necessary due to sound disposal of hazardous waste...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> {{pesticides}} in Pakistan since February 1980, when <b>import</b> and sale <b>of</b> pesticide was shifted to private sector and subsidy on ground spraying was withdrawn. Various pesticide <b>registration</b> schemes <b>of</b> <b>import</b> have been discussed and number of pesticides registered in each scheme has been reported. The pros and cons <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> schemes have been discussed. An appropriate regression model satisfying basic assumptions has been developed for the <b>import</b> and consumption <b>of</b> pesticides. Using the model estimates, it was concluded that the growth rate <b>of</b> pesticide <b>import</b> was computed to be 35 % in 1981 taking 1980 as base year, 30 % in 1982 taking 1981 as base year; and for subsequent years, the growth rate <b>of</b> pesticide <b>import</b> has lowered and has reached at 8 % in 1999 taking corresponding preceding year as base year. The same growth rate has been calculated till 2002. The agricultural growth rate has been recorded lower than that <b>of</b> pesticide <b>import</b> excepting 1995 - 96, when highest agricultural growth rate of the decade was recorded to be 11. 7 % and with pesticide <b>import</b> growth rate <b>of</b> 10 %. This indicates that the trend of using pesticide for pest control is higher when compared to agricultural growth trend...|$|R
