40|$|Abstract: The role of {{the lesion}} {{location}} within functional pain systems is not fully understood for central poststroke pain (CPSP) pathogenesis. In a patient with CPSP we used data from both {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for anatomo-functional correlations. Structural MRI showed a small residual cavity confined to the right thalamic ventral posterolateral nucleus and the adjacent posterior arm of the internal capsule. DTI maps showed selective reduction of right sensory thalamocortical fibers. Functional MRI, performed with different thermonociceptive stimuli, showed pain-specific signal changes in the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24 / 32) and in the associative parietal regions (BA 5 / 7). These findings underline, for CPSP pathogenesis, the role of damage of lateral nociceptive thalamoparietal fibers together with the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of anterior cingulate and posterior parietal regions. Perspective: In a patient with CPSP, we combined noninvasive neuroimaging techniques (functional and diffusion MRI) to assess the anatomo-functional relationship in CPSP.

40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood eosinophils released eosinophil survival- enhancing activity when stimulated with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin.

Moreover, IL- 3 and GM-CSF were measurable in ionomycin- stimulated eosinophil supernatants by immunoassay. Eosinophils produced approximately one-half as much IL- 3 and one-fifth as much GM-CSF as ionomycin-stimulated mononuclear cells. Neutrophils also produced IL- 3 and GM-CSF, but the amounts were less than those produced by eosinophils.

40|$|Dinitrophenol (DNP) -ovalbumin(OA) -induced tissue {{macrophage}} {{reaction in}} sensitized guinea pigs {{is enhanced by}} treatment with complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). The en-hancement of the reaction {{may be due to}} the increased production of a T-lymphocyte-derived macrophage chemotactic factor (LDMCF) because treatment of animals with CFA potentiates antigen- and concanavalin A(ConA) -induced <b>release</b> <b>of</b> LDMCF <b>activity</b> from spleen cells of the CFA-treated animals in vitro. This potentiating effect by CFA seems to be ascribed to the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> an adherent-cell-derived soluble factor from the CFA-treated animals.

40|$|SUMMARY. Modulation of Bordetella {{pertussis}} was {{induced by}} growth in Hornibrook medium {{with a high}} content of magnesium sulphate (C-medium); four pathophysiological activities in the cells or in the whole culture were measured at intervals. Modulation, shown by the extensive loss of protective antigen, histamine-sensitising factor, leuko-cytosis-promoting factor, heat-labile toxin and X-mode specific envel-ope proteins, occurred during the first 10 h of incubation of X-mode cells in C-medium at 35 °C and {{before the onset of}} the logarithmic phase of growth. The rapidity of these losses was greater than could be explained by a simple growth-dilution effect and {{did not appear to be}} due to <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> into the culture fluid. It seemed, therefore, that there was selective destruction of pathophysiological activities as well as cessation of synthesis. The activities appeared to be lost at different rates. Mouse-protective activity was lost more rapidly than histamine-sensitising and leukocytosis-promoting activities; heat-labile toxicity was lost more slowly or less completely. Modulation was shown to be easily reversed...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{was developed for}} measuring residual rennin activity in curd extracts and whey. A sensitive substrate at pH 5. 8 was prepared by mixing 6 grams of low-heat nonfat dry milk in 500 milliliters buffer containing 0. 05 molar cacodylic acid, 0. 02 molar calcium chloride, and 0. 012 molar triethanolamine, and storing it at 2 degrees centigrade for 18 hours. Two milliliters of whey or curd extract were inoculated into 25 milliliters of substrate at 30 degrees centigrade. The coagulation time was measured and compared to that induced by 2 milliliters of a known rennin concentration added {{at the same time}} to identical substrate. Recovery of activity was determined by adjusting milk samples to pH 5. 20 and coagulating them with a known concentration of rennin. The clot was broken by agitation and the curd separated from the whey by centrifugation. Activities accounted for in the curd and whey amounted to 91 ± 1. 6 per cent the activity added to the milk.

40|$|Patients with {{advanced}} breast cancer may develop acute, severe hypercalcemia when treated with estrogens or antiestrogens. In this study, {{we examined the}} effects of estrogens and related compounds on the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> bone resorbing <b>activity</b> by cultured human breast cancer cells in vitro. We found that the estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 releases bone resorbing activity in response to low concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol. Bone resorbing activity was also released in response to the antiestrogen nafoxidine. Other steroidal compounds had no effect on the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> bone resorbing <b>activity.</b> Estrogen-stimulated <b>release</b> <b>of</b> bone resorbing <b>activity</b> occurred with live bone cultures, but not with devitalized bones, indicating that the effect was bone cell mediated.

40|$|Several {{possible}} control {{mechanisms for}} CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2. 7. 7. 15) activity in pea (Pisum sativum L.) stems were investigated. Indol- 3 -ylacetic acid (IAA) {{treatment of the}} pea stems decreased total cytidylyltransferase activity but did not affect its subcellular distribution. Oleate (2 mM) caused some stimulation of enzyme activity by <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> from the microsomal fraction into the cytosol, but neither phosphatidylglycerol nor monoacyl phosphatidylethanolamine {{had an effect on}} activity or subcellular distribution. A decrease in soluble cytidylyltransferase protein concentrations was found in IAA-treated pea stems, but this was not sufficient to account for all of the decrease in cytidylyltransferase activity. A 50 % inhibition of enzyme activity could be obtained with 0. 2 mM-CMP, which indicated possible allosteric regulation. Similar inhibition was obtained with 1. 5 mM-ATP, but other nucleotides had no effect. The cytidylyltransferase enzyme protein was not directly phosphorylated, and the inhibition with 1. 5 mM-ATP occurred with the purified enzyme, thus excluding an obligatory mediation via a modulator protein. The results indicate that the cytosolic form of cytidylyltransferase is the most important in pea stem tissue and that the decrease in cytidylyltransferase activity in IAA-treated material appears to be brought about by several methods...|$|E
40|$|In {{alternating}} 12 -hr {{periods of}} light and dark the rat is active mainly in the dark. Its activity in the dark (beginning at 1800) depends exclusively on <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> by the 24 -hr clock. In the light (beginning at 0600) the 24 -hr clock inhibits activity; the normal rat becomes totally inactive in the light except for activity resulting from external stimulation. After section of the connections between the optic chiasma and the hypothalamus, some rats become totally and permanently inactive in the dark. This sectioning destroys the 24 -hr clock. After destruction of the clock removes inhibition of activity in the light period, the rat becomes active promptly at start of the light period [...] i. e., becomes a "light-active" animal. In the normal rat, activity becomes synchronized to start of the dark (by the electric clock at 1800), regardless of the amounts of activity. Destruction of the 24 -hr clock eliminates the synchronizer at 1800. However, almost at once, activity, eating, and drinking are kept together by a second synchronizer, start of the light (by the electric clock at 0600). This may explain the ability of the rat to survive after destruction of the 24 -hr clock...|$|E
40|$|Gap {{junctions}} (GJs) between neurons {{are present}} in both the newborn and the adult nervous system, and although important roles have been suggested or demonstrated {{in a number of}} instances, in many other cases a full understanding of their physiological role is still missing. GJs are expressed in the rodent lumbar cord at birth and mediate both dye and electrical coupling between motor neurons. This expression has been proposed to mediate: (i) fast synchronization of motoneuronal spike activity, in turn linked to the process of refinement of neuromuscular connections, and (ii) slow synchronization of locomotor-like oscillatory activity. Soon after birth this coupling disappears. Since in the adult rat regeneration of motor fibers after peripheral nerve injury leads to a recapitulation of synaptic refinement at the target muscles, we tested whether GJs between motor neurons are transiently re-expressed. We found that in conditions of maximal responsiveness of lumbar motor neurons (such as no depression by anesthetics, decerebrate <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of subsets of motor neurons, use of temporal and spatial summation by antidromic and orthodromic stimulations, testing of large ensembles of motor neurons) no firing is observed in ventral root axons in response to antidromic spike invasion of nearby counterparts.

Since these effects are controversial in man, we investigated in 3 groups of volunteers the corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> a 2 h-infusion of angiotensin II (7 ng/kg/min), vasopressin (1 ng/kg/min) and desmopressin (1 ng/kg/min) given alone or in combination with a bolus injection of 100 micrograms CRF 41 by measuring plasma concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone and delta 4 -androstenedione. Given alone angiotensin II and desmopressin had no significant effect in contrast to vasopressin which increased significantly the ACTH and steroid levels. Angiotensin II and vasopressin were both able to potentiate the corticotropin <b>releasing</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> CRF 41, whereas desmopressin was unable to produce such a potentiation.

40|$|The {{release of}} {{carnitine}} palmitoyltransferase (CPT) activity from rat liver mitochondria by increasing concentrations of digitonin was studied for mitochondrial preparations from fed, 48 h-starved and diabetic animals. A bimodal <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> was observed only for mitochondria isolated from starved and, {{to a lesser}} degree, from diabetic rats, and it appeared to result primarily from the enhanced release of approx. 40 % and 60 %, respectively, of the total CPT activity. This change {{in the pattern of}} release was specific to CPT among the marker enzymes studied. For all three types of mitochondria there was no substantial release of CPT concurrently with that of the marker enzyme for the soluble intermembrane space, adenylate kinase. These results illustrate that the bimodal pattern of release of CPT reported previously for mitochondria from starved rats [Bergstrom & Reitz (1980) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 204, 71 - 79] is not an immutable consequence of the localization of CPT activity {{on either side of the}} mitochondrial inner membrane. Sequential loss of CPT I (i. e. the overt form) from the mitochondrial inner membrane did not affect the concentration of malonyl-CoA required to effect fractional inhibition of the CPT I that remained associated with the mitochondria. The results are discussed in relation to the possibility that altered enzyme-membrane interactions may account for some of the altered regulatory properties of CPT I in liver mitochondria of animals in different physiological states...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{a family}} with a brachydactyly type A 2 and identified a heterozygous arginine to glutamine (R 380 Q) substitution in the growth/differentiation factor 5 (GDF 5) in all affected individuals. The observed mutation {{is located at the}} processing site of the protein, at which the GDF 5 precursor is thought to be cleaved releasing the mature molecule from the prodomain. In order to test the effect of the mutation, we generated the GDF 5 -R 380 Q mutant and a cleavage-resistant proGDF 5 mutant (R 380 A/R 381 A) in vitro. Both mutants were secreted from chicken micromass cultures, but showed diminished biological activity. Western blot analyses showed that wt GDF 5 was processed by the chicken micromass cells, whereas the mutants were not, indicating that the mutations interfere with processing and that this leads to a strong reduction of biological activity. To test the requirements for GDF 5 processing in vitro we produced recombinant human (rh) proGDF 5 wild-type protein in Escherichia coli. The results show that unprocessed (rh) proGDF 5 is virtually inactive but can be proteolytically activated by different enzymes such as trypsin, furin, and MMP 3. (rh) proGDF 5 could thus be used as a locally administered depot form with retarded <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> In contrast to mature rhGDF 5, (rh) proGDF 5 shows a high solubility at physiological pH, a characteristic that might be useful for therapeutic applications...|$|E
40|$|The secreted, {{multifunctional}} enzyme PLB 1 (phospholipase B 1 protein encoded by the PLB 1 gene) is a virulence {{determinant of}} the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, but {{the mechanism of}} its secretion is unknown. The cryptococcal PLB 1 gene encodes putative, N-terminal LP (leader peptide) and C-terminal GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor attachment motifs, suggesting that PLB 1 is GPI-anchored before secretion. To investigate the role of these motifs in PLB 1 secretion, four cDNA constructs were created encoding the full-length construct (PLB 1) and three truncated versions without the LP and/or the GPI anchor attachment motifs [LP−PLB 1 (PLB 1 expressed without the LP consensus motif), LP−PLB 1 GPI− (PLB 1 expressed without the LP and GPI consensus motifs) and PLB 1 GPI− (PLB 1 expressed without the GPI anchor attachment motif) respectively]. The constructs were ligated into pYES 2, and galactose-induced expression was achieved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The LP was essential for secretion of the PLB 1 protein and its three activities (PLB, lysophospholipase and lysophospholipase transacylase). Deletion of the GPI motif to create PLB 1 GPI− resulted in a redistribution of activity from the cell wall and membranes to the secreted and cytosolic fractions, with 36 – 54 % of the total activity being secreted as compared with 2 -fold more than that for PLB 1 GPI−), with 75 – 86 % {{of this in the}} cell-wall fraction, 6 – 19 % in the membrane fraction and 3 – 7 % in the cytosolic fraction. Cell-wall localization was confirmed by <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> with β-glucanase in both S. cerevisiae recombinants and wild-type C. neoformans.
