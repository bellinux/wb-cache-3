5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their programs. In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of milk in <b>returnable</b> containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the trend of interlibrary loans (ILLs) through the {{experiences}} of Edinburgh University Library (EUL). A preliminary study aims to consider how the purchase of one e-journal package impacted on the number of ILL requests processed. Design/methodology/approach – The article describes the experience of EUL. Findings – The article finds that total ILLs, both <b>returnables</b> and non-returnables, rose to a peak in 1998 and have declined significantly since then. Full desk-top delivery has not yet been achieved, but this is in the forefront of the library's strategy. Originality/value – The paper gives a detailed insight into the impact of e-journals and other factors on the use of the document supply service for both <b>returnables</b> and non-returnables in a large UK university...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{trends and}} {{developments}} in remote document {{supply in the}} UK are examined, including a suggestion of what to call the activity itself. The impact of recent legislation covering copyright, legal deposit and electronic signatures on RDS is discussed as {{is the effect of}} electronic journals deals. Changes at BLDSC are noted, particularly the introduction of a secure electronic delivery service. But BLDSC will have to operate in a changing environment as envisaged in a new interlending scheme, BLDSC Plus. The central importance of BLDSC however is underlined by two important studies. The future prospects of a number of RDS systems are mentioned, but the reliance on an unreliable transport scheme for the delivery of <b>returnables</b> threatens to undo much of the good work. The conclusion is that RDS and related activities are in a transitional phase.

25|$|Metrication in the United Kingdom, {{the process}} of {{introducing}} the metric system of measurement in place of imperial units, has made steady progress since the mid 20th century but today remains equivocal and varies by context. Most of government, industry and commerce use metric units, but imperial units are officially used to specify journey distances, vehicle speeds and the sizes of <b>returnable</b> milk containers, beer and cider glasses (though fresh milk is often still sold in multiples of pints, with the metric equivalent also marked). Imperial units are also often used to describe body measurements and vehicle fuel economy. In schools metric units are taught and used as the norm and imperial units that remain in common usage in the UK must also be taught.|$|E
25|$|Metrication in the United Kingdom {{began in}} the mid-1960s. Initially this {{metrication}} was voluntary and by 1985 many traditional and imperial units of measure had been voluntarily removed from use in the retail trade. The Weights and Measures Act of 1985 formalized their removal for use in trade, though imperial units were retained for use on road signs and the most common imperial weights such as the foot, inch, pound, ounce, gallon and pint continued {{to be used in}} the retail trade for the sale of loose goods or goods measured or weighed in front of the customer. Since 1 January 2000 it has been unlawful to use imperial units for weights and measures in retail trade in the United Kingdom except as supplementary units or for the sale of draught beer and cider by the pint or milk that is sold in <b>returnable</b> containers.|$|E
50|$|On July 14, 2005 after a {{fight with}} her mother, Sliwinski burst {{out the door and}} took her Ford Mustang out in an alleged attempt to take her own life by {{speeding}} down Dempster Street in Skokie, Illinois. Instead, she took the lives of John Glick of The <b>Returnables,</b> Douglas Meis of The Dials and EXO, and Michael Dahlquist of Silkworm when her car, going nearly 90 mph, ran three red lights and hit their car at an intersection. Both vehicles flipped over. The first calls to Skokie 911 came in about 12:15 pm. Before Meis died, he and Sliwinski were both taken to the hospital in ambulances. Police wanted to interview Meis before he went into emergency surgery, but police were too late and Meis died 10 minutes later from multiple injuries. When police interviewed Sliwinski, asking if she purposely drove into the car, she repeatedly changed her story. At 5:30 P.M. on the afternoon of July 15 Skokie police officers arrested Sliwinski in her hospital room. After the crash, Sliwinski underwent surgery for a broken ankle at St. Francis Hospital in Evanston before being transferred to the Cermak Health Services in the Cook County Jail. She was later charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated battery.|$|R
40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} {{program for}} re-washing recycled glass containers {{for use in}} applications such as wine bottling depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse bottle streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. Bottle washing programs may focus {{on a variety of}} bottle types, including beer bottles, wine bottles, or juice bottles. This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, bottles were manufactured to heavy specifications as <b>returnables.</b> Today, most glass containers are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. Wine bottles remain an exception. Wine bottles manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing wine bottles is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a wine bottle does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass bottles may lead to lighter weight wine bottles as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations for wine bottle washing facilities. Finally, wine bottles wholesale for 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer bottles cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible for wine bottles. The collection of bottles must be structured to maximize the recovery of usable containers. Certai...|$|R

Stevens was one of the managers, or prosecutors, elected by the House to present its case in the impeachment trial. [...] Although Stevens was too ill to appear in the Senate on March 3, when the managers requested that Johnson be summoned (the President would appear only by his counsel, or defense managers), he was there ten days later when the summons was <b>returnable.</b> The New York Herald described him as [...] having a [...] "face of corpselike color, and rigidly twitching lips... a strange and unearthly apparition—a reclused remonstrance from the tomb... the very embodiment of fanaticism, without a solitary leaven of justice or mercy... the avenging Nemesis of his party—the sworn and implacable foe of the Executive of the nation".|$|E
500|$|The 40-page {{first issue}} was {{released}} in print and digitally on August 20, 2014. Jamie McKelvie and Chip Zdarsky provided art for two retailer-exclusive variant covers. These variants were commissioned directly by the retailers. Unlike most comics sold in the direct market, unsold copies of this issue could {{be returned to the}} publisher. This tactic allowed retailers to place higher orders without taking a financial risk. Estimated sales were just under 35,000 copies, making it the 61st best-selling comic book for the month. Due to re-orders, the issue sold out at the distributor level on the day of release. A second printing was announced the next day and was released on September 24, 2014, the same day as issue two. Including sales for the second printing, the first issue sold approximately 41,000 copies. In addition to the standard print version, a larger [...] "magazine" [...] version with eight additional pages of art was available for an extra cost. This version, which was not <b>returnable,</b> was estimated to have sold an additional 8300 copies. All told, The Fade Out #1 had better sales than anything Brubaker and Phillips had previously done together. Brubaker suspects the numbers were higher partly because they had developed a following, and partly because retailers had become more supportive of Image books in general.|$|E
