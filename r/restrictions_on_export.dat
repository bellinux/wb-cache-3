50|$|The Export Control Act of 1949 is {{an example}} of the type of {{legislation}} that it renders, subject to the regulations promulgated under it, all persons wherever situated. Under its provisions exports of scarce materials are controlled both from an economic standpoint—short supply and consequent inflationary effect on foreign demand; and the security standpoint—autarchy and self-sufficiency in strategic resources not available in sufficiently large quantities. These are both domestic policies aimed primarily at conditions within the United States, but controls are also directed at conditions outside the country as an instrument of foreign policy. This is exemplified by the <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the United States. This latter motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the Soviet block to parallel those of the United States. The benefits of the various economic and military aid programs were to be withheld from non-cooperating nations.|$|E

Battle of Alabama. [...] Strong motivation for this 'control' act also came from export control concerns, following their tightening by the Export control Act of 1949 over Soviet advances; export controls were used for both domestic policy and later as an instrument of foreign policy. This is exemplified by the <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the US.

50|$|The ancient Ashokan edicts of the Mauryan age around 269 BCE record emperor Ashoka's {{conquest of}} Kalinga, roughly {{the modern state}} of Odisha. The major rock and pillar edicts mention the massive human toll of about 100,000 due to the war. The edicts record that an even larger number later perished, presumably from wounds and famine. The Tughlaq Dynasty under Muhammad bin Tughluq held power during the famine {{centered}} on Delhi in 1335-42. The sultanate offered no relief to the starving residents of Delhi during this famine. The oldest famine in pre-colonial Deccan with well-preserved local documentation is the Deccan Famine of 1791-92. Relief {{was provided by the}} ruler, the Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao II, in the form of imposing <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> of grain and importing rice in large quantities from Bengal via private trading, however the evidence is often too scanty to judge the 'real efficacy of relief efforts' in the Mughal period. Other pre-colonial famines in the Deccan were the Damajipant famine of 1460 and the famines starting in 1520 and 1629. The famine in the Deccan and Gujarat, was another famine in India's history. An estimated 3 million perished in Gujarat and one million in the Deccan. In the second year the famine killed not only the poor but the rich as well. The Damajipant famine is said to have caused ruin both in the northern and southern parts of the Deccan. Famines hit the Deccan in 1655, 1682 and 1884. Another famine in 1702-1704 killed over two million people.|$|E
50|$|Although {{controls}} were first authorized in 1940 {{in regard to}} munitions and similar materials essential to the defense effort, its coverage was extended in 1942 to all commodities, and broader geographic coverage, following America's entry into World War II. The law was extended, with modifications through 1948, and it was envisioned that remaining controls would soon disappear {{at the time of}} re-enactment in 1949. The scarcity of certain goods in the world markets however, made continuance of controls necessary in order to prevent a drain on such goods from plentiful American supplies with its consequential inflationary effects. National security and foreign policy concerns, especially following the outbreak of the Korean War, were new and compelling reasons for passing the Export Control Act of 1949, and in extending it until (at least) 1958. The law included both domestic policies aimed primarily at conditions within the United States, as well as controls directed at conditions outside the country, as an instrument of American foreign policy. This is exemplified by the <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the United States during the Cold War. The foreign policy motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the Soviet block to parallel those of the United States. The benefits of the various economic and military aid programs were to be withheld from non-cooperating nations, as in the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951.|$|E
40|$|Why do governments seek {{restrictions}} {{on the use of}} export subsidies through reciprocal trade agreements such as GATT? With existing arguments, it is possible to understand GATT's <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> subsidies as representing an inefficient victory of the interests of exporting governments over the interests of importing governments. However, to our knowledge, there does not exist a formal theoretical treatment that provides circumstances under which GATT's <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> subsidies can be given a world-wide efficiency rationale. In this paper, we offer one such treatment {{in the context of a}} natural monopoly market. We emphasize that subsidy competition between governments can serve to coordinate the entry decisions of firms, finding that consumers in the importing countries may suffer if the coordination afforded exporters by government subsidy programs does more to prevent entry than to promote it. In such circumstances, we show that the existence of export subsidy programs can lead to inefficiencies, and importing countries and the world as a whole can be better off when such programs are banned. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the report is to clarify the legal {{possibilities}} of restricting export of certain types of used EEE due to e. g. content of hazardous substances, energy consumption and/or limited market value.

Plastic tunnels dominate export market production. Field grown tomatoes are still exported to the EU but levels have dropped off dramatically as the EU narrowed the entry window, and as the market demanded fruit size and fruit quality {{that can only be}} produced in greenhouses or plastic tunnels. Plastic house production grew from about 323, 000 Mt {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 ’s to about 565, 000 Mt in the 2001 / 2002 season.
