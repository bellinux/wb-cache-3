The present study investigates {{the effect of}} <b>returned</b> <b>sludge</b> on improving the performance of poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) in turbidity, coliform bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria removal from drinking water during rapid mixing phase. Materials and Methods: In {{order to determine the}} optimal <b>returned</b> <b>sludge</b> volume injected during rapid mixing with PAC for turbidity, total coliform and hetrophic bacteria, experiments were conducted based on variables such as injected silt volume (from 0 - 125 ml), and varying turbidities from 58 - 112 NTU.

Coagulant efficiency in turbidity removal and microbial parameters were determined by Covariance, Duncan analyses and graphs were drawn by MS Excel. The results statistically showed significant among variables (P< 0. 05). Results: The results showed that the maximum turbidity removal efficiency of 98. 92 at 30 ppm was 10 ml while the maximum turbidity removal efficiency of 98. 31 at 10 ppm was 4 ml.

40|$|Background and purpose: Environmental {{pollution}} {{by heavy}} metals and their transfer to soil and crops are a growing global problem. This study aimed {{to measure the}} concentrations of heavy metals in wastewater and sludge wastewater treatment plant in Gorgan, Iran. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 176 samples of effluent, and <b>returned</b> and dried <b>sludges</b> were analyzed in wastewater treatment plant in Gorgan, during six months in 2016. The concentration of Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cr were determined using polarography (Metrohm 797 AV) and furnace atomic adsorption spectroscopy (AA 240 Varian Co.) in the laboratory of Health Faculty in Golestan University of Medical Sciences. Results: The average concentrations of Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cr in the effluent were 0. 105 ± 0. 06, 0. 0089 ± 0. 008, 0. 095 ± 0. 108, and 0. 102 ± 0. 175 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cr in <b>returned</b> <b>sludge</b> were 323. 48 ± 217. 65, 2. 44 ± 3. 3, 354. 14 ± 322. 79, and 388. 53 ± 252. 59 mg 1 /kg of dry weight, respectively. Also, in dried sludge, the average concentrations of lead, cadmium, nickel, and chromium were 58. 48 ± 2. 67, N. D, 30. 31 ± 1. 98, and 506. 25 ± 813. 81 mg/kg of dry weight, respectively. Conclusion: The concentrations of heavy metals in wastewater effluent and dried <b>sludge,</b> except in <b>returned</b> <b>sludge,</b> were below the standards. Due to long-term use of effluents, necessity of treatment of other parameters, {{and the effect of}} bioaccumulation of metals in sludge, caution should be taken for their agricultural application.

Sludge preparation procedures were optimized for three potential biocatalysts; aeration basin mixed liquor, aerobic digester <b>sludge</b> and <b>return</b> activated <b>sludge.</b> Following a 24 h starving period, the <b>return</b> activated <b>sludge</b> and mixed liquor sludges reported the highest oxidative degradation of a standard glucose/glutamic acid (GGA) mixture and the <b>return</b> activated <b>sludge</b> also recorded the lowest endogenous FM-respiration rate. Dynamic working ranges up to 170 mg BOD 5 L- 1 for OECD standard solutions and 300 mg BOD 5 L- 1 for GGA were obtained. This is a considerable improvement upon the BOD 5 standard assay and most other rapid BOD techniques. Time-series ferricyanide-mediated oxidation of the OECD 170 standard approached that of the GGA 198 standard after 3 - 6 h. This is noteworthy given the OECD standard is formulated as a synthetic sewage analogue. A highly significant correlation with the BOD 5 standard method (n = 35, p < 0. 001, R = 0. 952) was observed for a wide diversity of real wastewater samples.

The fate of Hg and Sb was investigated for an activated sludge process treatment works in the UK. Relatively high crude values (Hg 0. 092 μg/L, Sb 1. 73 μg/L) were observed at the works, whilst low removal rates within the primary (Hg 52. 2 %, Sb 16. 3 %) and secondary treatment stages (Hg 29. 5 %, Sb − 28. 9 %) resulted in final effluent concentrations of 0. 031 μg/L for Hg and 2. 04 μg/L for Sb. Removal of Hg was positively correlated with suspended solids (SS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, whilst Sb was negatively correlated.

Such variations and the relative contributions of various N 2 O production pathways are not fully understood. This study applied a previously established N 2 O model incorporating two currently known N 2 O production pathways by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (namely the AOB denitrification and the hydroxylamine pathways) and the N 2 O production pathway by heterotrophic denitrifiers to describe and provide insights into the large spatial variations of N 2 O fluxes in a step-feed full-scale activated sludge plant. The model was calibrated and validated by comparing simulation results with 40 days of N 2 O emission monitoring data {{as well as other}} water quality parameters from the plant. The model demonstrated that the relatively high biomass specific nitrogen loading rate in the Second Step of the reactor was responsible for the much higher N 2 O fluxes from this section.
