25|$|His {{first task}} was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To {{accomplish}} this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the iltizam lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all {{the production of the}} land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by <b>raising</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the 'tax-farmers' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax-farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants who worked the land, Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties. The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on waqf endowments, which were previously tax-free. Through these endowments, personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes. As well as raising revenue to fund his new military, this tax took revenue away from the local elite, Mamluks and the ulama, weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali's reforms.|$|E
25|$|Evangelical Christians {{comprised}} 52 {{percent of}} the state's voters in 2008. A poll in 2005 showed that 53 percent of West Virginia voters are pro-life, the seventh highest in the country. A September 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that 19% of West Virginia voters thought that same-sex marriage should be legal, while 71% thought it should be illegal and 10% were not sure. A separate question on the same survey found that 43% of West Virginia voters supported the legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 17% supporting same-sex marriage, 26% supporting civil unions but not marriage, 54% favoring no legal recognition and 3% not sure. In 2008, 58 percent favored troop withdrawal from Iraq while just 32 percent wanted troops to remain.

Appropriating over $60 {{billion over}} 5 years by {{matching}} {{federal funds to}} states that provide health insurance to children and pregnant women, and raising the federal cigarette tax from 39 cents to $1. After CHIP passed the House and the Senate, President George W. Bush vetoed the bill over a $30 billion spending difference between what he and congress proposed, saying that “Because the Congress has chosen to send me a bill that moves {{our health care system}} in the wrong direction, I must veto it,” and that lawmakers should “produce a good bill that puts poorer children first.” After Bush's decision on CHIP, Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed measure to override Bush's veto. In 2009 after Bush left office, the House passed a new version of CHIP, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The new version including the original expansion of coverage to 4 million children, and along with <b>raising</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> cigarettes, a new provision was added to raise taxes on other tobacco products.|$|E

500|$|In 1733 a new Excise and Customs Bill was introduced, restricting {{imports and}} <b>raising</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> many luxury items. Christchurch rapidly became a hot-bed for smugglers, {{where they were}} known as [...] "freetraders", {{and much of the}} town was {{involved}} in the trade. The [...] "Double Dykes" [...] are said to have been used to hide contraband, while Mudeford spit is rumoured to have been used in the construction of [...] "Guinea boats" [...] (cheaply built galleys sometimes capable of outrunning the day's steamships). One apocryphal story is that the black house acquired its distinctive black colour when customs officers tried to smoke out some holed-up smugglers by lighting fires around the base. The house was constructed in 1848 and used by shipwrights as a dwelling and workshop, smuggling was in decline with the introduction of a free-trade policy and more effective measures being implemented by the Coast Guard by this time, so the house may not in fact have had much involvement in smuggling. The spit has a long association with shipbuilding with two large ships being built in the mid-19th century, the Viscountess Canning of 193 tons and the Enterprise 253 tons.|$|E

2500|$|One of the world's {{earliest}} smoking bans was a 1575 Roman Catholic Church regulation which forbade the use {{of tobacco}} in any church in Mexico. In 1604, King James I of England published an anti-smoking treatise, A Counterblaste to Tobacco, that {{had the effect of}} <b>raising</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> tobacco. The Ottoman Sultan Murad IV prohibited smoking in his empire in 1633 and had smokers executed. Pope Urban VII also prohibited smoking in the Church in 1590 followed by Urban VIII in 1624. Pope Urban VII threatened to excommunicate anyone who [...] "took tobacco in the porchway of or inside a church, whether it be by chewing it, smoking it with a pipe or sniffing it in powdered form through the nose". The earliest citywide European smoking bans were enacted shortly thereafter. Such bans were enacted in Bavaria, Kursachsen, and certain parts of Austria in the late 17th century. Smoking was banned in Berlin in 1723, in Königsberg in 1742, and in Stettin in 1744. These bans were repealed in the revolutions of 1848. The first building in the world to ban smoking was the Old Government Building in Wellington, New Zealand in 1876. This was over concerns about the threat of fire, as it is the second largest wooden building in the world.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{determinants}} of a readiness for pro-environmental travel behavior in households. Four empirical studies were conducted examining reduction in car use (Study I), acceptability of transport policy measures (Study II and III), and behavioral adaptations in response to travel demand management (TDM) measures (Study IV). In Study I, {{the aim was to}} interrupt habitual car use by means of a deliberation intervention and to examine the importance of moral motivation (i. e., personal norm) for car use reduction. Results showed that, {{as a result of the}} intervention, car use was mainly reduced among car users with a strong car use habit and a strong moral motivation to reduce car use. The aim of Study II was to examine factors important for the acceptability of three TDM measures: <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel, improved public transport, and an information campaign. The results demonstrated the importance of general environmental beliefs (i. e., pro-environmental orientation, problem awareness, personal norm, and willingness to reduce car use) and policy specific beliefs (i. e., perceived impact on freedom to choose travel mode and own car use, perceived effectiveness, and perceived fairness) for the acceptability of the measures. Furthermore, personal norm was found to be particularly important for the acceptability of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> and the information campaign, whereas problem awareness was more important for the acceptability of improved public transport. Following up on Study II, the purpose of Study III was to examine the acceptability of single and combined transport policy measures, more specifically, <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel, improved public transport, subsidies of renewable fuel, a package of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel and improved public transport, and a package of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel and subsidies of renewable fuel. General environmental beliefs (i. e., pro-environmental orientation, problem awareness, personal norm, and willingness to act) and policy specific beliefs (i. e., perceived effectiveness and perceived fairness) were found to be important for the acceptability of the measures. Moreover, personal norm was particularly important for the acceptability of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel and the packages, while problem awareness was more important for the acceptability of improved public transport and subsidies of renewable fuel. The aim of Study IV was to examine the behavioral adaptations, more specifically, the expected car use reduction, in response to three hypothetical TDM measures: <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel, improved public transport, and a package of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel and improved public transport. Furthermore, factors important for the expected car use reduction were analyzed. Results showed that a combination of the measures was expected to lead to a larger car use reduction compared to the single measures, and the most commonly chosen reduction strategies were more efficient car use and changing travel mode. Moreover, internal motivational factors, such as personal norm, and the perceived personal impact of the measures were important for expected car use reduction in response to the measures...|$|R
