The {{current system of}} value added tax has weaknesses, including carousel fraud, negative impact on cash flow of businesses and complicated rules to collect and manage the tax. <b>Reverse</b> <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism</b> is considered as a solution of existing weaknesses of current system. Although this regime is able to solve the mentioned weaknesses, it also has some disadvantages.

40|$|Services {{cannot be}} subject to border {{controls}} {{in the same way}} as goods, which makes the charging and collection of VAT in these instances more complex. In many jurisdictions, VAT is collected on the cross-border supply of services via the <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This mechanism transfers the liability for the payment of VAT to the local recipient of the service (ie the customer), which creates a situation where foreign suppliers are not required to register in these jurisdictions and accordingly decreases the cost of compliance - a key contributor to the principle of VAT neutrality. In most cases, where the local recipient is liable for the payment of reverse charge VAT in respect of an imported service, a corresponding input tax credit is available where the service is on-supplied, resulting in a VAT neutral position for the local recipient. The problem arises where the <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism</b> is applied inconsistently from country to country - where in some instances the VAT accounted for on imported services cannot be claimed as a credit due on the supply. In such instances, the reverse charge VAT represents an actual cost to the recipient of the service, which will then invariably be on-charged to the final consumer. In such cases, VAT will be levied on VAT and the final consumer will {{be subject to}} double VAT taxation. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released the International VAT/GST Guidelines in April 2014 which has the "aim of reducing the uncertainty and risks of double taxation and unintended non-taxation that result from inconsistencies in the application of VAT in a cross-border context. " These guidelines are not aimed at providing detailed prescriptions for national legislation but rather seek to identify objectives and suggest means for achieving them. These Guidelines are an important step in initiating a more harmonised approach to VAT. While not binding, they represent the key principles of a successful VAT structure that should be inherent in all VAT legislation. This paper is an analysis of the feasibility of implementing a harmonised approach to VAT in Africa, with particular regard to the application of the <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and the different means by which the incidence of double VAT taxation that results, can be prevented. This position is compared to that of the European Community (EC) in order to highlight the need for consistency in the application of VAT legislation of different African jurisdictions. The varying application of the <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism</b> in African countries is one such example of how uncoordinated unilateral measures can result, and have the potential, not only to increase the cost of compliance and doing business in Africa, but also to create barriers and discourage, particularly, cross-border trade in services. By initiating a more harmonised approached to VAT legislation across Africa, the inconsistencies in the application of similar principles can be avoided, facilitating trade and easing the compliance burden on vendors...|$|E

If during the 2007 - 2013 period, were pursued three major objectives (convergence, regional competitiveness and territorial cooperation), in the current 2014 - 2020 funding period, money is allocated differently between countries that are deemed to be more developed, in transition and less developed. These categories are set according to GDP per capita. Next we exposed the fiscal changes made in the EU in 2010 - 2011 period and then we corelate them with the strategy for regional development for five member states: Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. We used data reported by Eurostat regarding the evolution of unemployment rate and for the foreign direct investments in 2007 - 2012 period. We also brought up and changes required by the new Romanian Fiscal Code. According to it, measures such as reduction of income tax for new micro enterprises or extending the VAT <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism</b> in many sectors of activity, are meant to encourage foreign capital inflows and also to increase the level of regional development. As a general conclusion, we found {{that there is a}} direct link between fiscal policy and regional development; fiscal measures implemented influence the level of unemployment, economic growth, and competitiveness in the private sector...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of revenue from Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Value Added Tax (VAT) to governments worldwide cannot be understated. Worldwide, the company tax rates and personal tax rates in general have been falling while the GST and VAT rates have either {{remained the same}} or been on the rise. With the world economy slowing down, more governments are increasingly relying on the tax take from indirect taxes to fund their policies. Evaluation of the GST and VAT systems are therefore very important to assist with keeping pace with the changing environment. As part of the recent tax reforms in New Zealand, the government identified some weaknesses with the GST model used in New Zealand. Consequently, the government issued two discussion documents identifying what these weaknesses were and what it considered were the solution to these issues. This dissertation considers the weaknesses of the GST model that were identified {{by the government and}} discusses in detail what the government had identified as its preferred option of dealing with these weaknesses, the Domestic <b>Reverse</b> <b>Charge</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The dissertation also focuses on the alternative that was proposed, the compulsory zero- rating provisions, which the government eventually legislated for to address these concerns. Finally, the dissertation will attempt to answer the question as to whether the government has made the right decision in legislating for the zero-rating provisions instead of the proposed DRC...|$|E
