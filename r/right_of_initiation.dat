40|$|Abstract — Recent {{research}} in wireless communications technologies has focused {{to the development}} of Next-generation wireless systems (NGWS) which integrate various existing wireless networks technologies, each of which is optimized for some specific services such as WLANs, WiMAX, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The most important and challenging issue is to realize seamless handoffs with small handoff latency and packet loss to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) in NGWS. In this paper, we propose a handoff management architecture using relative signal strength of the present and neighboring base stations to calculate the handoff initiation time. To take the <b>right</b> decision <b>of</b> handoff <b>initiation</b> time we use mobile’s speed, handoff signaling delay information and also the size of the present and neighboring cell and reduce the errors associated with them. The performance analysis shows that the approach ensures successful handoff and reduces call blocking probability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Due {{to rapid}} growth in IEEE 802. 11 based Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), handoff has become a burning issue. A mobile Node (MN) {{requires}} handoff when it travels out of the coverage area of its current access point (AP) and tries to associate with another AP. But handoff delays provide a serious barrier for such services to {{be made available to}} mobile platforms. Throughout the last few years there has been plenty of research aimed towards reducing the handoff delay incurred in the various levels of wireless communication. In this article, we propose a received signal strength measurement based handoff technique to improve handoff probability. By calculating the speed of MN (Mobile Node) and signaling delay information we try to take the <b>right</b> decision <b>of</b> handoff <b>initiation</b> time. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that by taking the proper decision for handoff we can effectively reduce false handoff initiation probability and unnecessary traffic load causing packet loss and call blocking...|$|R

Abstract – Influence of an {{ion beam}} on {{properties}} of magnetron (planar geometry) is considered {{and character of}} display of such influence on features <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> the abnormal glow discharge of low pressure is experimentally investigated. Character-istics <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> the discharge in the bottom range of pressure < 8 · 10 – 2 Pa are determined at an irradiation of the magnetron cathode a beam of ions of argon. Dominating factors <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> the abnormal glow discharge of low pressure in magnetron are ion–electron emission and sputter-ing of the magnetron cathode by ion beam. Falling dependence of a voltage <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> the dis-charge on energy of ions and threshold dependence of a voltage <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> on a current of an ion beam is established. The prospect of expansion of functionalities of planar magnetron is shown due to the coordination of modes of sputtering of the magnetron anode by an ion beam and the magne-tron cathode by plasma ions of the abnormal glow discharge. 1...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect <b>of</b> time <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> feeding after hatching and influence of dietary ascorbic supplementation during realimentation on productivity, carcass characteristics and mortality of Ross 308 broiler chickens. The study was a factorial arrangement in a complete randomized design. Six hundred and seventy five unsexed Ross 308 broiler chickens with an initial weight of 32 ± 2 g per bird were assigned to 15 treatments in a 3 (times <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> feeding) x 5 (ascorbic acid supplemental levels) factorial arrangement with three replications, each having 15 birds each. The experimental diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous but with different ascorbic acid supplementation levels. Ascorbic acid supplementation started three days after hatching. More than 50 % of the birds died between one and three days <b>of</b> age when <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> feeding after hatching was above 36 hours. Time <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> feeding above 36 hours of hatching resulted in lower (p 0. 05) on feed intake of the bird's irrespective <b>of</b> time <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> feeding after hatching. It is concluded that time <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> feeding above 36 hours after hatching is not desirable, mainly because of its effect on mortality. However, the beneficial effect of ascorbic acid supplementation could be exploited in reducing mortality rate and improving growth rates in broiler chickens subjected to delayed <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> feeding after hatching...|$|R

40|$|There {{is still}} limited {{knowledge}} about the interrelations among the age <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> different substances and the diverse aspects of adolescent functioning. The present cross-national study aimed at exploring {{the presence of a}} time-order pattern <b>of</b> age <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> different substances and the relationships with personal and relational resources and vulnerabilities, drawn from the problem behaviour theory by Jessor et al. (1991). The sample consisted of 970 adolescents from Italy and The Netherlands, of whom 198 were fully initiated in alcohol, first tobacco use, regular tobacco smoking and marijuana. In both countries, cumulative scale analyses showed the presence of a pattern <b>of</b> age <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> in the different types of substances. The earlier the age of onset of one substance, the earlier the age of onset of the other substances. Furthermore, the higher the personal resources and the healthy, conventional parents and friend models, the older the age <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> different substances by both Dutch and Italian adolescents. With respect to the use of alcohol, the higher the relational resources, the older the age <b>of</b> <b>initiation.</b> Conversely, the higher the adolescents perceived relational vulnerabilities, the younger their age <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> in drugs. These findings suggest that preventive interventions might be more successful when they are precocious, enhance personal capabilities, and produce changes in the adolescent life context. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} archetypal theme <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> in {{selected}} texts by Joseph Conrad. The Introduction first surveys critical attention to initiatory motifs in Conrad {{with the objective}} of demonstrating the need for an approach to the topic informed by a more formal and theorized understanding <b>of</b> <b>initiation.</b> It then offers a prima facie case for the centrality of the idea <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> in Conrad's oeuvre, based on references culled from a range of the author's writings. Chapter One seeks to contextualise initiation by providing a history of anthropological research into and theorisations of the rite, proceeding to a description of its typical structure and functions. A detailed account is given of the most widely accepted model <b>of</b> <b>initiation,</b> Arnold van Gennep's tripartite schema. Moving on to Conrad's writing, Chapter Two draws on both his fiction and more personal writings in order to provide a provisional account of the writer's own understanding <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> and its importance, and to offer some explanation of why Conrad should have been prompted to accord the motif such prominence in his work. Conrad's presentation and (impliedly) his understanding <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> was never entirely consistent and underwent some change {{in the course of his}} writing career. The critical assessment of "Typhoon" in Chapter Three depicts Conrad's more optimistic conception <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> as a rite benefitting both society, by promoting solidarity, and the individual, by advancing self-knowledge. Chapter Four introduces, via analyses of the novellas "Youth" and "The Shadow Line", that variation on the motif <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> which is more typical of its manifestation in Conrad: the failure of individuals to complete their cycles <b>of</b> <b>initiation.</b> Chapter Five identifies those characteristics <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> which appear to be determinative in the representations <b>of</b> incomplete <b>initiation</b> in Conrad's work. Initiation seems to play out approximately seven paradoxes; the impact of some of these is examined through analysis of the initiatory ordeals of the main protagonists in The Secret Agent. Integral to this discussion is an attempt to demonstrate the vital role which initiation plays in the healthy maintenance not only of social order but also of faith and life itself. The Conclusion summarises the more important findings of the study and indicates some directions for further, related research. ...|$|R

40|$|Energetic materials, {{such as high}} explosives, {{propellants}} and ballotechnics, {{are widely}} used as energy sources {{in the design of}} numerous devices, components and processes. Although most energetic materials are selected for safe operation, their high energy densities have the potential for inadvertent initiation and subsequent powerful energy transformations. This potential for damage or injury places a heavy burden on careful analysis of safety issues as part of the design process. As a result, considerable effort has been devoted to empirical testing <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> conditions, and development of scientific models <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> processes that have been incorporated into computer models for numerical simulation <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> reaction. Nevertheless, in many cases, there is still only rudimentary understanding of the processes <b>of</b> <b>initiation.</b> Mechanochemical processes are perhaps the least understood of the various excitation mechanisms. In these energy transformation processes mechanical stimuli lead directly to initiation and substantial reaction under conditions not thought to be capable of reaction. There are no established scientific models <b>of</b> the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> mechanochemical reactions in energetic materials. Mechanochemical reactions can be initiated by enhanced solid state chemical reactivity, changes in reactant configuration, and localization <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> energy.
