5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, <b>retinoblastoma</b> (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E
25|$|Development {{of cancer}} often {{involves}} multiple alterations of the cellular genome (Knudson hypothesis). Human <b>retinoblastoma</b> {{is a well}} studied example of a cancer type where mitotic nondisjunction can contribute to malignant transformation: Mutations of the RB1 gene, which is located on chromosome 13 and encodes the tumor suppressor <b>retinoblastoma</b> protein, can be detected by cytogenetic analysis in many cases of <b>retinoblastoma.</b> Mutations of the RB1 locus in one copy of chromosome 13 are sometimes accompanied by loss of the other wild-type chromosome 13 through mitotic nondisjunction. By this combination of lesions, affected cells completely lose expression of functioning tumor suppressor protein.|$|E

40|$|The nuclear DNA content {{characterization}} {{was carried}} out by means of both DNA index and DNA histogram type assessments in a series of 21 <b>retinoblastomas,</b> 11 neuroblastomas, 1 ganglioneuroblastoma, and 4 medulloblastomas. These measurements were performed by means of the cytophotometric digital cell image analyses of Feulgen-stained nuclei. The results indicate that as far as nuclear DNA content is concerned, <b>retinoblastomas</b> seem to be very different from neuroblastomas. In fact, in terms of DNA index, <b>retinoblastomas</b> are significantly more aneuploid than neuroblastomas. The DNA histogram type shows that the high level of aneuploidy found in <b>retinoblastomas</b> corresponds to genotypically polymorphic tumors, and this could reflect a serious degeneration of the genomic material in <b>retinoblastomas.</b> This type of degeneration seems to be much less frequent in neuroblastomas, which basically seem to be either diploid or hypertriploid.

25|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} {{may play}} a role in mammalian hair cell regeneration. By modulating <b>retinoblastoma</b> protein activity in rat cochlea, sonic hedgehog allows mature hair cells that normally cannot return to a proliferative state to divide and differentiate. <b>Retinoblastoma</b> proteins suppress cell growth by preventing cells from returning to the cell cycle, thereby preventing proliferation. Inhibiting the activity of Rb seems to allow cells to divide. Therefore, sonic hedgehog, identified as an important regulator of Rb, may also prove to be an important feature in regrowing hair cells after damage.|$|E

To determine {{the effect of}} Cdh 11 loss in tumorigenesis, we crossed Cdh 11 null mice with TAg-RB mice. Loss of Cdh 11 had no gross morphological effect on the developing retina of Cdh 11 knockout mice, but led to larger retinal volumes in mice crossed with TAg-RB mice (p = 0. 01). Mice null for Cdh 11 presented with fewer TAg-positive cells at postnatal day 8 (PND 8) (p = 0. 01) and had fewer multifocal tumors at PND 28 (p = 0. 016), compared to mice with normal Cdh 11 alleles. However, tumor growth was faster in Cdh 11 -null mice between PND 8 and PND 84 (p = 0. 003). In tumors of Cdh 11 -null mice, cell death was decreased 5 - to 10 -fold (p, 0. 03 for all markers), while proliferation in vivo remained unaffected (p = 0. 121).

40|$|In {{addition}} to RB 1 gene mutations, <b>retinoblastomas</b> frequently show gains of 1 q and 6 p and losses of 16 q. To identify suppressor genes on 16 q, we analyzed 22 short tandem repeat loci in 58 patients with known RB 1 mutations. A subset of tumors was also investigated by conventional and matrix comparative genomic hybridization. In 40 of 58 (69 %) tumors, {{we found no}} loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at any 16 q marker. LOH was detected in 18 of 58 (31 %) tumors, including five with allelic imbalance at some markers. In one tumor LOH was only observed at 16 q 24. As the parental origin of allele loss was unbiased, an imprinted locus {{is unlikely to be}} involved. Analysis of gene expression by microarray hybridization and quantitative RT real-time PCR did not identify a candidate suppressor in 16 q 24. Cadherin 13 (CDH 13), CBFA 2 T 3, and WFDC 1, which are candidate suppressors in other tumor entities with 16 q 24 loss, did not show loss of expression. In addition, mutation and methylation analysis showed no somatic alteration of CDH 13. Results in all tumors with chromosome 16 alterations define a single minimal deleted region of 5. 7 Mb in the telomeric part of 16 q 24 with the centromeric boundary defined by retention of heterozygosity for a single nucleotide variant in exon 10 of CDH 13 (Mb 82. 7). Interestingly, clinical presentation of tumors with and without 16 q alterations was distinct. Specifically, almost all <b>retinoblastomas</b> with 16 q 24 loss showed diffuse intraocular seeding.

25|$|However, in the {{sporadic}} form, both alleles {{would need}} to sustain a mutation before the cell can become cancerous. This explains why sufferers of sporadic <b>retinoblastoma</b> are not at increased risk of cancers later in life, as both alleles are functional in all their other cells.
