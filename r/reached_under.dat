5|$|During the Second World War, {{the three}} major South American navies found {{themselves}} unable to acquire major warships; they were only {{able to do so}} again after the conflict, when the United States and United Kingdom had many unnecessary or surplus warships. The war had proved the obsolete status of battleships, so the South American navies were seeking cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, yet they ran into political difficulties in acquiring anything larger than s and s. They were only able to acquire them when the Red Scare began to strongly affect American and international politics. One of the deals <b>reached</b> <b>under</b> the Mutual Defense Assistance Act (1949) sold six American light cruisers to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in January 1951. While this bolstered the navies of important South American allies of the United States, which would be treaty-bound to assist the United States in any war, naval historian Robert Scheina argues that the American government also used the opportunity to significantly affect the traditional naval rivalry among the three countries. The warships sold unilaterally changed the naval outlook of all three nations, leading them to accept parity (as opposed to the Argentine pre-war stipulation that its fleet be equal to Brazil's and Chile's combined).|$|E
5|$|Nichols and Cooper {{came to an}} {{agreement}} about the Solway Bridge. Although it was in Knox County, Anderson County had contributed $27,000 towards its construction. It was still paying off the bonds, but now the bridge was usable only by CEW workers. Nichols negotiated a deal in which Knox County was paid $25,000 annually for the bridge, of which $6,000 was {{to be used to}} maintain the access road. Judge Thomas L. Seeber then threatened to close the Edgemoor Bridge unless Anderson County was similarly compensated. An agreement was <b>reached</b> <b>under</b> which Anderson County received $10,000 for the bridge and $200 per month. Knox County did not keep its side of the bargain to maintain the road, which was damaged by heavy traffic and became impassable after torrential rains in 1944. The Army was forced to spend $5,000 per month on road works in Knox County.|$|E

Rumors of a mine {{construction}} soon reached the Confederates, but Lee refused to believe or act upon it for two weeks before commencing countermining attempts, which were sluggish and uncoordinated, and were unable to discover the mine. General John Pegram, whose batteries would be above the explosion, did, however, take the threat seriously enough {{to build a new}} line of trenches and artillery points behind his position as a precaution.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 2014, the Army {{launched}} a counter-attack, firing 100 rockets and carrying out 15 air strikes on Nawa. The {{focus of the}} government offensive were Nawa, Inkhil, Jasem and Deraa city. The next day, the military recaptured Tal al-Jabiyah hill. The military was also attempting to advance towards western and eastern Tal al-Ahmar {{in an attempt to}} prevent rebels from advancing toward Quneitra. A deal was also reportedly <b>reached</b> <b>under</b> which 2,000 rebels would be granted safe passage to evacuate from Jassem, which overlooks southern Daraa. The deal was set to expire within 48 hours.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, {{relations}} soured between the French contingent and residents in several villages that led to injuries on both sides, after a French regiment began an exercise {{in order to identify}} Hezbollah members that included searching homes, taking photographs, using sniffer dogs, and questioning residents. Residents accused them of violating private property, treating them with contempt, and of not coordinating with the Lebanese army. The residents made clear that their conflict was only with the French contingent, and that relations with other contingents were good. Following discussions between UNIFIL commanders, ambassadors of countries with soldiers in UNIFIL, and the commander of the Lebanese army, an agreement was <b>reached</b> <b>under</b> which sniffer dogs would no longer be used, UNIFIL soldiers would refrain from entering Lebanese homes and yards, and only Lebanese army soldiers would carry out searches of homes.|$|E
25|$|Back Seat Dodge ’38 (1964), by Edward Kienholz, is a {{sculpture}} portraying a couple engaged {{in sexual activity}} {{in the back seat}} of a truncated 1938 Dodge automobile chassis. The piece won Kienholz instant celebrity in 1966 when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors tried to ban the sculpture as pornographic and threatened to withhold financing from LACMA if it included the work in a Kienholz retrospective. A compromise was <b>reached</b> <b>under</b> which the sculpture's car door would remain closed and guarded, to be opened only on the request of a museum patron who was over 18, and only if no children were present in the gallery. The uproar led to more than 200 people lining up to see the work the day the show opened. Ever since, Back Seat Dodge ’38 has drawn crowds.|$|E
25|$|The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has {{established}} a TLV for UV-C exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254nm UV, this TLV is 6 mJ/cm² over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV {{is supported by the}} International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When TUSS was planned, and until quite recently, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0 mJ/cm² dose is <b>reached</b> <b>under</b> the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2 μW/cm². Thus, 0.2 μW/cm² was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.|$|E

25|$|The villa {{received}} prominence {{at national}} level since the 1980s and more recently in 2001, when the lack of finance put at risk for {{the closure of the}} home. On 14 March of that year the Friars reached an agreement with the Ministry of Social Services, housed at Palazzo Ferreria, to receive financial social services from the Government of Malta and other sources. An agreement was <b>reached</b> <b>under</b> notary Eugene Montanaro with the condition that the home works hand in hand with Aġenzija Appoġġ. Soon after the agreement, the house was restructured and upgraded with modern facilities at a financial cost of Lm 50,000, of which Lm 31,148 were allocated from Appoġġ with finance paid by the government of Malta. The home was then still run by the Friars, but also assisted by Programme Manager Anna Maria Laurenti, who received her studies in London. The part of the property used for religious services was kept and restructured, and was this time open as Blessed Nazju Falzon Chapel. Falzon is a beatified Maltese and this house-church is the first and only place of worship dedicated to him. The chapel within the property has its own entrance and was inaugurated to the public on 30 May 2001 by provincial Bernard Bartolo.|$|E

The FBI (as well as Attorney General Janet Reno) pushed for the publication of Kaczynski's manifesto, which led to his sister-in-law, and then his brother, recognizing Kaczynski's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto, and tipping off the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity {{in order to avoid the}} death penalty, as he did not believe he was insane. In 1998 a plea bargain was <b>reached,</b> <b>under</b> which Kaczynski pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.|$|E

500|$|In United States v. Smith (1820), in {{an opinion}} by Justice Story, the Court upheld a {{conviction}} under the 1819 statute, holding that Congress {{could leave the}} definition of piracy {{to the law of}} nations. After reviewing the history of foreign (primarily English) law, Justice Story declared: [...] "We have, therefore, no hesitation in declaring, that piracy, by the law of nations, is robbery upon the sea, and that it is sufficiently and constitutionally defined by the fifth section of the act of 1819." [...] In a rare dissent, Justice Livingston argued that Article One, Section Eight, Clause Ten obliged Congress to define piracy with more specificity. The facts in Smith were almost identical to those which Palmer had held could not be <b>reached</b> <b>under</b> the Crimes Act of 1790: a U.S. citizen pirate, commissioned by a government in Buenos Aires, had led a mutiny, seized a new ship, and then robbed a Spanish ship.|$|E
500|$|In 1887, part of {{the river}} bank near Todham Lock, which bordered the Cowdray estate of the Earl of Egmont, had collapsed, and the Earl {{suggested}} that Lord Leconfield of Petworth, a successor to the Earl of Egremont, should pay for its repair. After some disagreement, a compromise was <b>reached,</b> <b>under</b> which the bank was repaired and a floodgate was fitted at {{the upper end of}} the lock, with both men paying half of the cost. Lord Leconfield assumed that when the Arun Navigation finally obtained an Act of Abandonment in 1896, his responsibilities for the maintenance of the River Rother had ended. However, in 1903 heavy rain and floods destroyed the floodgate and {{part of the}} adjacent weir, resulting in river levels though the 8th Earl of Egmont's estate dropping by [...] The Earl, Augustus Arthur Perceval, issued a writ against Lord Leconfield for damages. The case was heard in the High Court, at which it was agreed that the navigation was now useless, but that the two men would share the costs of rebuilding the floodgate, after which responsibility for its maintenance would pass to the Earl, who could also dredge the river above the lock.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the final}} years of the 1st centuryAD, the legions {{remained}} the backbone of the Roman army, although the auxilia in fact outnumbered them by up to half as much again. Within the legions, the proportion of troops recruited from within Italy fell gradually after 70AD. By the close of the 1st century, this proportion had fallen to as low as 22 percent, with the remainder drawn from conquered provinces. Since technically only citizens were allowed to enlist in the legions, where recruits did not possess citizenship then, at least in some instances, citizenship [...] "was simply given [...] them on enlistment". During this time, the borders of the Empire had remained relatively fixed to the extent originally <b>reached</b> <b>under</b> the Emperor Trajan. Because of this, the army was increasingly responsible for protecting existing frontiers rather than expanding into foreign territory, the latter of which had characterised the army's earlier existence. As a result, legions became stationed in largely fixed locations. Although entire legions were occasionally transferred into theatres of war, they remained largely rooted in one or more legionary bases in a province, detaching into smaller bodies of troops (Latin: vexillationes) on demand. This policy eventually led to a split of the military's land-based forces into mobile and fixed troops in the later Empire. In general, the best troops were dispatched as vexillationes, and the remainder left to guard border defences were of lower quality, perhaps those with injuries or near retirement.|$|E
