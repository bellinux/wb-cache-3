5|$|The LRDG {{air link}} was created during the {{occupation}} of Kufra by Major Guy Lenox Prendergast. Appreciating the value of aircraft for reconnaissance, liaison, evacuating wounded and flights to GHQ Cairo, he had two Waco aircraft fitted with long <b>range</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks. Prendergast flew one himself and Sergeant R. F. T. Barker flew the other. When Bagnold {{was appointed to the}} General Staff Cairo in August 1941, Prendergast was given command of the LRDG.|$|E
25|$|The blended wing body (BWB) concept offers {{advantages}} in structural, aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today's more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs. These features translate into greater <b>range,</b> <b>fuel</b> economy, reliability and life cycle savings, {{as well as}} lower manufacturing costs. They also allow {{for a wide variety}} of potential military and commercial applications.|$|E
25|$|The Catron & Fisk Airplane and Engine Co {{was founded}} in 1917, {{developing}} several aircraft in series including the CF-10, a 22-passenger airliner. The company was reorganized as International, accounting for the aircraft's dual identity as the International CF-10. The 'Spirit of Los Angeles' modified the CF-10 with long <b>range</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks and update Wright Whirlwind engines {{to compete in the}} Dole Air Derby.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadest}} <b>range</b> of <b>fuel</b> {{tests were}} conducted by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) labs in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Engineers estimated the performance and fuel economy of 1977 Gremlin Xs operating on ordinary gasoline, a variety of wide boiling <b>range</b> <b>fuels</b> (naphtha, kerosene, etc.), {{as well as two}} alcohols, ethanol and methanol.|$|R
50|$|The American company <b>Range</b> <b>Fuels</b> {{announced}} in July 2007 {{that it was}} awarded a construction permit {{from the state of}} Georgia to build the first commercial-scale -per-year cellulosic ethanol plant in the US. Construction began in November, 2007. The <b>Range</b> <b>Fuels</b> plant was built in Soperton, GA, but was shut down in January 2011, without ever having produced any ethanol. It had received a $76 million grant from the US Department of Energy, plus $6 million from the State of Georgia, plus an $80 million loan guaranteed by the U.S. Biorefinery Assistance Program.|$|R
5000|$|Section 9003 {{allowed the}} USDA Rural Development office to approve this $80 million loan to <b>Range</b> <b>Fuels</b> Inc. [...] <b>Range</b> <b>Fuels</b> {{produces}} low carbon bio fuels from {{any and all}} biomass. The $80 million loan is dedicated to building a facility that will produce cellulosic ethanol from wood chips. In 2010 the plant is expected to achieve an output level of 20 million gallons of ethanol per year. Other benefits of the plant include an estimated 63 jobs that will be created to build and operate the facility.|$|R
25|$|In putting {{together}} the curriculum for training pilots and copilots on the B-29 Superfortress, Training Command could make use of its experience in transition training for heavy bombers. No such experience was available {{in the case of}} flight engineers, because the B-29 was the first AAF aircraft that required a flight engineer. This individual operated the engine control panel of the aircraft. Located behind the pilot, the panel contained all operating instruments but those the pilot used to control the altitude and direction of the B-29. At the direction of the pilot, the flight engineer used these instruments to adjust the throttles, fuel mixture, supercharger, and propeller pitch. He also computed the aircraft's cruising <b>range,</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption, engine performance, weight and balance, and airworthiness. Flight engineers underwent comprehensive training at Amarillo and Lowry Fields before assignment to B-29 transition training.|$|E
2500|$|The Gremlin was {{faster than}} other subcompacts of the time. Motor Trend {{magazine}} recorded zero to 60mph (0 to 97km/h) in 12.6 seconds with the [...] engine.

2500|$|The External Stores Support System (ESSS) {{provides}} two stub wings {{each with}} two hard points primarily for external fuel tanks, but, {{it can also}} carry various weapon systems. When equipped with the Extended <b>Range</b> <b>Fuel</b> System (ERFS), the system can support two 870 L (230 gal) or 1,700 L (450 gal) external tanks. The system feeds into the main fuel tank and not the engines directly. [...] The ESSS can also be fitted {{with a wide range}} of weapons including up to sixteen AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, rockets and gun pods, and other systems.|$|E

2500|$|Tankers are {{considered}} [...] "force multipliers," [...] because they convey considerable tactical advantages. [...] Primarily, aerial refueling {{adds to the}} combat radius of attack, fighter and bombers aircraft, and allows patrol aircraft to remain airborne longer, thereby reducing the numbers of aircraft necessary to accomplish a given mission. Aerial refueling can also mitigate basing issues which might otherwise place limitations on combat payload. Combat aircraft operating from airfields with shorter runways must limit their takeoff weight, which could mean a choice between <b>range</b> (<b>fuel)</b> and combat payload (munitions). Aerial refueling, however, eliminates many of these basing difficulties because a combat aircraft can take off with a full combat payload and refuel immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Once completed, the {{aircraft}} {{was delivered to}} its squadron aircrew. Long <b>range</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks were installed in the fuselage for its overseas movement. [...] If the plane was going to England over the North Atlantic Route it received two 100 gallon tanks; to Africa over the South Atlantic Route required four 100 gallon tanks, and the very long-distances of the South Pacific Route, then eight 100 gallon tanks were installed due to the vast distances between island airfields. [...] Extra oil was also required and this was put into a 50-gallon drum with a hose to each engine through the wing. When the oil level got low more would be hand pumped from the drum to the engines oil tank.|$|E
2500|$|The UH-60 can be {{equipped}} with stub wings {{at the top of}} fuselage to carry fuel tanks or various armaments. The initial stub wing system is called External Stores Support System (ESSS). It has two pylons on each wing to carry two [...] and two [...] tanks in total. The four fuel tanks and associated lines and valves form the external extended <b>range</b> <b>fuel</b> system (ERFS). U.S. Army UH-60s have had their ESSS modified into the crashworthy external fuel system (CEFS) configuration, replacing the older tanks with up to four total [...] crashworthy tanks along with self-sealing fuel lines. The ESSS can also carry [...] of armament such as rockets, missiles and gun pods. The ESSS entered service in 1986. However, {{it was found that the}} four fuel tanks obstruct the field of fire for the door guns; thus, the external tank system (ETS), carrying two fuel tanks on the stub wings, was developed.|$|E

2500|$|P-47s were {{operated}} by several Allied air arms during World War II. The RAF received 240 razorback P-47Ds which they designated [...] "Thunderbolt Mark I", and 590 bubbletop P-47D-25s, designated [...] "Thunderbolt Mark IIs". With {{no need for}} another high-altitude fighter, the RAF adapted their Thunderbolts for ground attack, a task for which the type was well suited. Once the Thunderbolts were cleared for use in 1944, they were used against the Japanese in Burma by 16 RAF squadrons of the South East Asia Command from India. Operations with army support (operating as [...] "cab ranks" [...] to be called in when needed), attacks on enemy airfields and lines of communication, and escort sorties. They proved devastating in tandem with Spitfires during the Japanese breakout attempt at the Sittang Bend in the final months of the war. The Thunderbolts were armed with three 500lb (227kg) bombs or, in some cases, British [...] "60pound" [...] (27kg) RP-3 rocket projectiles. Long <b>range</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks gave five hours of endurance. Thunderbolts flew escort for RAF Liberators in the bombing of Rangoon. Thunderbolts remained in RAF service until October 1946. Post-war RAF Thunderbolts were used {{in support of the}} Dutch attempts to reassert control of Batavia. Those squadrons not disbanded outright after the war re-equipped with British-built aircraft such as the Hawker Tempest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Biodiesel liquids are {{increasingly}} being used as blending stocks with middle distillate ground transportation fuels or as a fuel itself. However, an upper limit of 20 % biodiesel is common for a soy derived biodiesel blending stock with petroleum diesel fuels. It is important for operational consideration {{to look at the}} many problems this could present. Among the more important considerations are storage stability, filterability, temperature <b>ranges,</b> <b>fuel</b> compatibility, oxidative stability, and induced instability reactions. We compare the soy methyl esters to the untreated soy cooking oil for compatibility with petroleum fuels...|$|R
