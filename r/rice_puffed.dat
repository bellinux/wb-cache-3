50|$|Chikki is a ready-to-eat solid, brittle sweet {{generally}} {{made from}} casting {{a mix of}} dry nuts and hot jaggery syrup. Peanuts and jaggery mix are most common. Other than almonds, cashews, walnuts, sesame and other seeds, varieties of chikki are also prepared from puffed or roasted Bengal gram, puffed rice, beaten <b>rice,</b> <b>puffed</b> seasonal grains, and regional produce such as Khobara (desiccated coconut). Like many Indian sweets, Chikki is typically a high protein delicacy.|$|E
5000|$|Puffed rice {{is formed}} by the {{reaction}} of both starch and moisture when heated within the shell of the grain. Unlike popcorn, rice kernels are naturally lacking in moisture and must first be conditioned with steam. Puffed rice can be created by heating the steam-conditioned kernels either with oil or in an oven. <b>Rice</b> <b>puffed</b> {{in this way is}} crisp, and known as [...] "crisped rice". Oven-crisped rice is used to produce the Rice Krispies breakfast cereal as well as the crisped rice used in Lion Bars, Nestlé Crunch, Krackel, and similar chocolate bars. [...] Though not as dramatic a change when compared to popcorn, the process and end result are the same.|$|E
40|$|Rice {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be one of}} the major contributors to arsenic (As) in human diets in addition to drinking water, but little is known about rice products as an additional source of As exposure. Rice products were analyzed for total As and a subset of samples were measured for arsenic speciation using high performance liquid chromatography interfaced with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). A wide range of rice products had total and inorganic arsenic levels that typified those found in rice grain including, crisped <b>rice,</b> <b>puffed</b> rice, rice crackers, rice noodles and a range of Japanese rice condiments as well as rice products targeted at the macrobiotic, vegan, lactose intolerant and gluten intolerance food market. Most As in rice products are inorganic As (75. 2 - 90. 1 %). This study provides a wider appreciation of how inorganic arsenic derived from rice products enters the human diet. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method {{was developed for}} determination of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) in foods using a monolithic column with sample clean up on an immunoaffinity column. The method was validated for analysis of AFB 1 in rice, bread, puffed corn snack, wheat flour and peanut samples. The average recoveries for AFB 1 in different foods ranged from 94. 4 to 102. 5 % with the coefficient of variation lower than 10 % for all foods. Limit of detection was 0. 01 ng/g. A survey of AFB 1 was performed on 90 samples collected from Tehran retail market in June 2005. The results showed {{that none of the}} bread and wheat flour samples were contaminated with AFB 1. The mean AFB 1 levels in <b>rice,</b> <b>puffed</b> corn snack and peanut samples were 4. 17, 0. 11, and 1. 97 ng/g, respectively. The level of contamination of 3 samples (one rice sample and two peanuts samples) to AFB 1 was found to be higher than 5 ng/g. Although all food samples had mean concentration of AFB 1 below the maximum tolerated level in Iran, the mean intake of AFB 1 from rice was estimated 3. 49 times higher than the guidance value of 1 ng AFB 1 /Kg body weight/day. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to monitor AFB 1 in foods, especially in rice, in Iran. This is the first study on exposure assessment of Iranian population to AFB 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{technology}} of puffed-salted rice processing has been studied. Five rice varieties (IR 64, IR 42, IR 48, Cisadane and Gemar) were used. Salt solution was sprayed onto the <b>rice</b> prior to <b>puffing,</b> at level of 10 % of <b>rice</b> weight. <b>Puffed</b> salted <b>rice</b> {{were compared to}} puffed unsalted-rice. The results showed that either rice varieties or salting affected the <b>puffed</b> <b>rice</b> characteristics. <b>Puffed</b> <b>rice</b> of Gemar variety had the highest whiteness and volume expansion, and lowest hardness. Protein quality decreased in the <b>puffed</b> <b>rice,</b> indicated by decreasing in amino acids composition. Aromatics and S-amino acid were more susceptible to degradation during puffing than the others. Salt spraying before puffing resulted in <b>puffed</b> <b>rice</b> with lower whiteness and volume expansion, and higher water solubility and gel consistency. Salting also increased amino acids susceptibility to degradation during puffing. Salting, however, decreased {{in the ability to}} absorb water and increased hardness, therefore the treatment would keep <b>puffed</b> <b>rice</b> crispy for longer lime rather than puffed, unsalted-rice. Organoleptics evaluation also showed that <b>puffed</b> <b>rice</b> of Gemar variety had the high score of color, appearance, taste and crispiness, though poor in flavor.
