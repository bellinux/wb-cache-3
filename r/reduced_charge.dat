5|$|Bell's retrial in the Barker {{assault was}} {{scheduled}} for December 6. Three days before the trial began, {{he pleaded guilty to}} a <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> of battery, and was sentenced to 18months in a juvenile facility, with credit for time served. He agreed to testify against any of the other assault defendants at trial. All appeals were dropped as part of the plea agreement.|$|E
5|$|The guns used three {{different}} charges, {{depending on the}} situation: a full charge, a full flashless charge, and a <b>reduced</b> <b>charge.</b> The standard full charge weighed 15.2–15.5lb (6.9–7.0kg), the flashless charge was slightly heavier at 16lb (7.3kg), and the <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> was significantly smaller, at 3.6lb (1.6kg). Both full charges provided a muzzle velocity of 2,600ft/s (790m/s) in new guns, but as continued fire wore down the barrels, muzzle velocity degraded slightly, to 2,500ft/s (760m/s). The reduced charge's muzzle velocity was correspondingly lower, at 1,200ft/s (370m/s). Each gun was supplied with 450 rounds, and was expected to fire 4,600 shells before it was worn enough to warrant replacement. At the maximum effective elevation to engage surface targets, 45degrees, the guns could hit targets up to 17,392yards (15,903m) away. The maximum height at which aircraft could be engaged was 37,200feet (11,900m).|$|E
5|$|Martin's death largely {{took the}} air out of the federal perjury case against Webber. In July 2003, on the day before jury {{selection}} in the case was due to begin, Webber pleaded guilty to the <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> of criminal contempt in order to avoid a possible jail sentence. He admitted to having received and repaid $38,200. The deal was subject to a discretionary fine and possible classification of the infraction as a felony by the United States District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds who would rule in September 2003. In exchange for the plea all other charges were dropped against him as were all charges against his father. The charges against Webber's aunt had been dropped after Martin's death.|$|E

50|$|Gonzalez {{was charged}} with first degree {{intentional}} homicide and attempted first degree intentional homicide {{as a result of}} the shooting. Under Wisconsin law, self-defense is a mitigating circumstance to these charges, and once claimed the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating circumstance does not exist. Actual self-defense is an absolute defense to the charges. Unnecessary self-defense (the accused believed self-defense was needed, but such belief was unreasonable) <b>reduces</b> the <b>charges.</b> If the prosecution cannot prove the accused did not have a valid self-defense motive (even an unreasonable one), the <b>charges</b> are automatically <b>reduced.</b> Under most of the <b>reduced</b> <b>charges,</b> unreasonable self-defense is no longer an affirmative defense. Actual (reasonable) self-defense is a valid defense for the <b>reduced</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|R

25|$|William Pugh was {{sentence}}d to a six-year sentence for voluntary manslaughter {{in the case of}} Harry Todd Turner on May 17, 1982. Pugh had initially been charged with the first-degree murder of Turner, in addition to companion charges of robbery and sodomy; however, after five days of deliberation, the jury found Pugh guilty of the <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> of manslaughter, and innocent of robbery and sodomy.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} October 2007, {{all three}} of Simpson's co-defendants had plea-bargained with the {{prosecution}} in the Clark County, Nevada, court case. Walter Alexander and Charles H. Cashmore accepted plea agreements in exchange for <b>reduced</b> <b>charges</b> and their testimony against Simpson and three other co-defendants, including testimony that guns {{were used in the}} robbery. Co-defendant Michael McClinton told a Las Vegas judge that he too would plead guilty to <b>reduced</b> <b>charges</b> and testify against Simpson that guns were used in the robbery. After the hearings, the judge ordered that Simpson be tried for the robbery.|$|R

25|$|Mailer {{married his}} second wife, Adele Morales, in 1954. She was a painter, {{well known in}} New York City. They had two daughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. Mailer stabbed her twice with a {{penknife}} during a party, puncturing her pericardium which needed emergency surgery. His wife would not press charges and he later pleaded guilty to a <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> of assault for a suspended sentence. Morales recovered and in 1997 published a memoir of their marriage entitled The Last Party, which recounted her husband stabbing her at a party and the aftermath. This incident has been {{a focal point for}} feminist critics of Mailer, who point to themes of sexual violence in his work.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October 2010, TfL {{announced}} that Western Extension would formally be removed on 4 January 2011, noting that charging on the Western extension would in practice end on 24 December 2010 {{at the start}} of the Christmas break. Other changes implemented on 4 January 2011 included an increase of the charge to £10 if paid in advance or on the day and to £12 if paid by midnight the charging day after travel, with a <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> of £9 for people who sign up to 'Congestion Charging Auto Pay' (CC Auto Pay) (with a £10 registration fee) which allowed users to nominate up to five vehicles with all fees being automatically debited from a nominated bank account at the end of each month.|$|E

25|$|ESI has a {{more complex}} {{ionisation}} mechanism, relying heavily on droplet charge excess and as such {{there are many more}} factors to consider when exploring the cause of ion suppression. It has been widely observed that for many analytes, at high concentrations, ESI exhibits a loss of detector response linearity, perhaps due to <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> excess caused by analyte saturation at the droplet surface, inhibiting subsequent ejection of gas phase ions from further inside the droplet. Thus competition for space and/or charge may be considered as a source of ion suppression in ESI. Both physical and chemical properties of analytes (e.g. basicity and surface activity) determine their inherent ionisation efficiency. Biological sample matrices naturally tend to contain many endogenous species with high basicity and surface activity, hence the total concentration of these species in the sample will quickly reach levels at which ion suppression should be expected.|$|E
500|$|Six {{students}} (Robert Bailey, then aged 17; Mychal Bell, then 16; Carwin Jones, then 18; Bryant Purvis, then 17; Jesse Ray Beard, then 14; and Theo Shaw, then 17) {{were arrested}} in the assault of Barker. Mychal Bell was initially convicted as an adult of aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery. His convictions were overturned {{on the grounds that}} he should have been tried as a juvenile. Before a retrial in juvenile court, Bell pleaded guilty to a <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> of simple battery. The other five defendants later pleaded [...] "no contest" [...] to the same offense, and were convicted.|$|E
500|$|The second gun, Furious spare, {{was mounted}} in , {{but she was}} not ready for combat until 13 October 1918. She fired three rounds the {{following}} day, but had to cease fire to avoid hitting friendly advancing troops. One round had already been loaded when the order came to cease fire so she fired it, with a <b>reduced</b> <b>charge,</b> into a minefield to seaward. A total of 85 18-inch shells were fired in action by both guns. [...] Wear on General Wolfes gun was measured at about 0.37 inch after firing 161 effective full charges (EFC) - 105 rounds including proof and practice, with 57 being supercharges.

The guns in all three turrets could elevate to 45degrees, but only I and III turrets could depress to −2degrees; the superfiring II turret was not able to depress. This enabled a maximum range of 36,900yards or [...] with the Mark 8 projectile. [...] The turrets were able to [...] 150degrees in both directions from the centerline, which enabled a wide arc of fire.

50|$|Plea {{bargaining}} {{is extremely}} difficult in jurisdictions based on the civil law. This is because unlike common law systems, civil law systems have no concept of plea—if the defendant confesses; a confession is entered into evidence, but the prosecution is not absolved of the duty to present a full case. A court may decide that a defendant is innocent even though they presented a full confession. Also, unlike common law systems, prosecutors in civil law countries may have limited or no power to drop or <b>reduce</b> <b>charges</b> after a case has been filed, and in some countries their power to drop or <b>reduce</b> <b>charges</b> before a case has been filed is limited, making plea bargaining impossible. Since the 1980's, many civil law nations have adapted their systems to allow for plea bargaining.|$|R
