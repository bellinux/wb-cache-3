40|$|The {{effects of}} plasma damage on {{dielectric}} reliability were studied using voltage ramp stress experiments. Altering <b>ramp</b> <b>rates</b> {{allowed us to}} identify the main mechanisms for failure, namely intrinsic and metal catalyzed failure. Failure mechanisms are identified using ∂ ln (t B D) / ∂ ln(R) trends for pristine and plasma damaged SiCOH films. Failure dynamics are discussed for 7 % and 25 % porous SiCOH films. O 2 plasma treatment was found to lower the breakdown strength of 7 % SiCOH from 79. 5 V to 67. 1 V at low <b>ramp</b> <b>rates</b> (0. 01 V/s), and from 135. 7 V to 109. 3 V at fast <b>ramp</b> <b>rates</b> (20 V/s). The breakdown strength of 25 % SiCOH films was enhanced from 41. 0 V to 55. 4 V after plasma treatment at slow <b>ramp</b> <b>rates.</b> However, at fast <b>ramp</b> <b>rates,</b> the plasma treatment lowered the breakdown voltage from 112. 0 V to 99. 7 V. The enhancement in breakdown strength for highly porous samples under slow <b>ramp</b> <b>rates</b> is attributed to film densification upon plasma treatment, while the deterioration at fast <b>ramp</b> <b>rates</b> {{is associated with the}} generation of defects catalyzing dielectric failure...|$|R
30|$|Finally, we have {{showed that}} if a ramping time of a few seconds is introduced, the allowed delays can be longer, but from a power system’s {{perspective}} an immediate response results in better frequency profiles (smaller deviations and settling times for the power oscillations). Therefore, {{there is a clear}} trade-off between the loads’ response delay and their <b>ramping</b> <b>rate.</b> If the response delay is relatively large due to practical limitations (for instance due to a long FMT), then the <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> must decrease, to avoid large power oscillations and unsafe system operation. This trade-off can be incorporated in the PFC scheme by defining certain allowed regions for combinations of response delays and <b>ramping</b> <b>rates.</b> The operator would enforce lower <b>ramping</b> <b>rates</b> to aggregations which exhibit larger response delays and would allow faster <b>ramping</b> <b>rates</b> when loads can response with smaller delays. Since a higher <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> improves the system’s performance (provided that the delay is sufficiently small), a performance payment should be followed, where these resources would be remunerated with higher prices, to ensure a fair compensation to the providers.|$|R
40|$|Several recent {{applications}} of superconducting magnets require the magnets {{to be operated}} at high <b>ramp</b> <b>rates</b> and at frequencies of several Hertz. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has recently designed and built prototypes of superconducting dipole magnets that can be ramped at a fairly high rate (1 T/s or more). For accelerator applications, it is also crucial that the magnets maintain good field quality even at high <b>ramp</b> <b>rates.</b> In order to characterize the field quality of magnets at high <b>ramp</b> <b>rates,</b> a measurement system consisting of 16 printed circuit tangential coils has been developed. The coil system is held stationary while the magnet is ramped.

40|$|The role of {{temperature}} <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> during the two-step growth of GaN-on-sapphire by metalorganic {{chemical vapor deposition}} is explored. The surface morphology and crystalline properties of the low-temperature-deposited GaN buffer layer annealed under various <b>ramping</b> <b>rates</b> (20 - 60 degreesC/min) to 1000 degreesC were investigated by atomic force microscopy and X-ray measurements. For lower <b>ramping</b> <b>rates</b> employed, a dramatic re-evaporation of the GaN buffer layer might occur. This makes the buffer layer thinner, yielding a GaN epilayer of hexagonal morphology. However, as the higher <b>ramping</b> <b>rates</b> are applied, the surface becomes rougher and exhibits hexagonal three-dimensional islands. It {{could be due to}} the fact that the grains of the GaN buffer layer do not have enough time to coarsen. Under a temperature <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> of 40 degreesC/min, a smooth buffer-layer surface can be maintained and results in a subsequent high-quality overlayer deposition. The mirror GaN epilayer shows a near-band-edge peak (25 K) centered at 3. 477 eV with a full-width at half-maximum as narrow as 13. 1 meV. The observed temperature-ramping-rate effects can be interpreted by the coalescence mechanism of the GaN buffer layer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the accessibility of}} Ti 3 SiC 2 -derived carbons (Ti 3 SiC 2 -DCs) synthesized non-isothermally using a temperature ramp. The microstructure of the Ti 3 SiC 2 -DCs is characterized using TEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and gas adsorption. For the characterization by gas adsorption, we adopt our Finite Wall Thickness (FWT) model to invert Ar adsorption isotherms at 87 K to obtain pore size and pore wall thickness distributions of the Ti 3 SiC 2 -DCs. Accordingly, we identify a pore accessibility problem in the Ti 3 SiC 2 -DCs, as reported for Ti 3 SiC 2 -DCs prepared at 1073 K in our previous work. A striking feature is that Ti 3 SiC 2 -DC prepared at the slowest <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> (2 K/min) has a very narrow pore size distribution, while the Ti 3 SiC 2 -DCs synthesized at higher <b>ramping</b> <b>rates</b> (5 and 15 K/min) have much broader pore size distributions centered around 5. 2 Å. A significant amount of previously unreported ultra-microporosity is observed based on low pressure CO 2 adsorption at 273 K.

The drawback to the use of fluid heat transfer is initial cost. It adds perhaps ten percent to the price of the autoclave in mid-size range installations. Fluid life is estimated to range from five to fifteen years, depending upon length of exposure to the highest temperatures as well as the maintenance of internal cleanliness.|$|E
50|$|Each {{distributed}} generation resource {{has its own}} integration issues. Solar PV and wind power both have intermittent and unpredictable generation, so they create many stability issues for voltage and frequency. These voltage issues affect mechanical grid equipment, such as load tap changers, which respond too often and wear out {{much more quickly than}} utilities anticipated. Also, without any form of energy storage during times of high solar generation, companies must rapidly increase generation around the time of sunset to compensate for the loss of solar generation. This high <b>ramp</b> <b>rate</b> produces what the industry terms the duck curve (example) that is a major concern for grid operators in the future. Storage can fix these issues if it can be implemented. Flywheels have shown to provide excellent frequency regulation. Short term use batteries, at a large enough scale of use, can help to flatten the duck curve and prevent generator use fluctuation and can help to maintain voltage profile. However, cost is a major limiting factor for energy storage as each technique is prohibitively expensive to produce at scale and comparatively not energy dense compared to liquid fossil fuels. Finally, another necessary method of aiding in integration of photovoltaics for proper {{distributed generation}} is in the use of intelligent hybrid inverters.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays on the economics of <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> restrictions at hydro power plants. The first essay examines the impact of <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> restrictions imposed on hydro operations to protect aquatic ecosystems. A dynamic optimization model of the profit maximizing decisions of a hydro operator is solved for various restrictions on water flow, using data for a representative hydro operation in Ontario. Profits are negatively affected, but {{for a range of}} restrictions the impact is not large. Ramping restrictions cause a redistribution of hydro production over a given day, which can result in an increase in total hydro power produced. This affects the need for power from other sources with consequent environmental impacts. The second essay uses a real options approach to study the impact of <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> restrictions on hydro power plants. We consider the effect on profits from electricity generation in order to inform policy decisions about <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> restrictions. A novelty of the essay is in examining the optimal operation of a prototype hydro power plant with electricity prices modelled as a regime switching process. We show that profits are negatively affected by ramping restrictions. Interestingly for a large range of restrictions, profit is not sensitive to ramping restrictions. The results point to the importance of accurately modelling electricity prices in gauging the trade offs involved in imposing restrictions on hydro operators which may hinder their ability to respond to volatile electricity prices and meet peak demands. The third essay investigates the impact of <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> restrictions on hydro power plants using a three regimes model with multiple jump sizes. We consider how the multiple jump sizes among these three regimes affect the impact of ramping restrictions on the prototype hydro power plant. The numerical experiments provide further evidence that ramping restrictions have a larger impact when the expected variation in price is increased such as through an increase in the jump size which makes it desirable to change water release rates relatively frequently. In both non-stochastic and stochastic settings, these three essays have highly consistent results on the impact of ramping restrictions on the hydro station's profit. We observe profits are significantly affected (by less than 7 % in essay one, by less than 10 % in essay two, and by less than 9 % in essay three) {{in the case of the}} most severe ramping constraints, but we also observe a range of less severe ramping restrictions over which profits are not substantially affected (by less than 2 % in essay one, by less than 3 % in essay two, and by less than 2 % in essay three). Results from this thesis should facilitate the implementation of <b>ramping</b> <b>rate</b> restrictions for environmental and economic benefits...|$|R
