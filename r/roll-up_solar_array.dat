40|$|The LST {{mission of}} up to 15 years plus about two years {{allotment}} for ground return maintenance could stretch the LST operation {{to the end of}} the century. This extended mission life, combined with the large power requirements of the telescope and the scientific instruments, imposes stringent requirements on the electrical power subsystem. The use of an onboard microprocessor for individual battery cell control and monitoring offers a technique that could improve the battery cycle life dramatically. The battery configuration includes spare battery cells which can be switched by the microprocessor to replace failed cells. The microprocessor can also be used for inflight reconditioning of the batteries to increase performance and verify ampere-hour capacity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel ultra-light booms {{for solar}} sails {{and other large}} deployable space structures. These CFRP booms have a unique property: bistability over the whole length (BOWL), which enables simple and compact deployment mechanism designs that can reduce overall system mass. They were produced to solve some of the previously encountered problems with bistable composite tubular booms that reduced their optimal length and scalability due to local buckling phenomena when {{the diameter of the}} coil increased. A new low-cost manufacturing technique, which consists of using braids with a variable angle change over the boom length, was found to have a positive effect in reducing that tendency. An analytical model is used to explain this behavior and predict the secondary stable state properties and natural diameter of the coiled/packed boom. A 3. 6 m tape spring version of these bistable CFRP booms has been designed for a 25 m 2 Gossamer Sail Deorbiter of future space assets and is being considered for an upcoming solar sail demonstration mission called CubeSail. Larger booms are being designed for a new scalable <b>roll-up</b> <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> concept...|$|E

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{solar array}} {{consists}} of two identical double roll-out wings designed after the Hughes flexible <b>roll-up</b> <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> (FRUSA) and {{was developed by the}} European Space Agency (ESA) to meet specified HST power output requirements at the end of 2 years, with a functional lifetime of 5 years. The requirement that the HST solar array remain functional both mechanically and electrically during its 5 -year lifetime meant that the array must withstand 30, 000 low Earth orbit (LEO) thermal cycles between approximately + 100 and - 100 C. In order to evaluate the ability of the array to meet this requirement, an accelerated thermal cycle test in vacuum was conducted at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), using two 128 -cell solar array modules which duplicated the flight HST solar array. Several other tests were performed on the modules. The thermal cycle test was interrupted after 2, 577 cycles, and a 'cold-roll' test was performed on one of the modules in order to evaluate the ability of the flight array to survive an emergency deployment during the dark (cold) portion of an orbit. A posttest static shadow test was performed on one of the modules in order to analyze temperature gradients across the module. Finally, current in-flight electrical performance data from the actual HST flight solar array will be tested...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} known for many years, based partly on NASA Glenn Research Center testing, that {{high-voltage}} <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> arc into the space plasma environment. <b>Solar</b> <b>arrays</b> are composed of solar cells in series with each other (a string), and the strings may be connected in parallel to produce the entire <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> power.

In the case of sustained arcing (discovered at Glenn and applied to the design and construction of <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> on Space Systems/Loral (SS/Loral, Palo Alto, CA) satellites, Deep-Space 1, and Terra), an arc on one <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> string can couple to an adjacent string and continue to be powered by the <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> output until a permanent electrical short is produced.
