The aim is to describe the <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> methods as applied in practice of a multinational group of companies, to analyze the categories and the indicators used and to assess their information value with regards to the management decision-making process. Once the concept <b>and</b> function of <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> theoretically defined, the <b>reporting</b> process <b>and</b> its outcomes are described with the company Alcatel-Lucent as an example. Furthermore, the thesis focuses on the structure of a profit and loss statement as used for management purposes in Alcatel-Lucent and the content and information value of all P&L accounts.
