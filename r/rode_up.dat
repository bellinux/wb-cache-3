5|$|The breed {{eventually}} became popular in other European countries as well. Pugs were painted by Goya in Spain, and in Italy they <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> front on private carriages, dressed in jackets and pantaloons that matched {{those of the}} coachman. They were used by the military to track animals and people, and were also employed as guard dogs.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius and Tong Yabghu (called Ziebel in the Byzantine sources) met {{under the}} walls of Narikala. The yabgu <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> to the emperor, kissed his {{shoulder}} and made a bow.

During the ensuing feast the Khazar leaders received ample gifts {{in the shape of}} earrings and clothes, while the yabghu was promised the hand of the emperor's daughter, Eudoxia Epiphania.|$|E

5|$|At the 1933 World Scout Jamboree, a 14-year-old Scout named Bela Bánáthy was {{kneeling}} by his campfire when three uniformed men <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> on horseback: Count Paul Teleki, the Chief Scout of Hungary and the Chief of Staff for the jamboree; General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff {{officer of the}} Royal Hungarian Army; and Baden-Powell, the British hero of the Boer War and Chief Scout of the World. The men introduced themselves to the Scout and inspected his camp. They complimented him on {{a job well done}} and rode on. Meeting the Chief Scout of Hungary and Boer War hero Robert Baden-Powell left a deep impression on Bánáthy. He decided he would become a military officer instead of a minister.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, Brigadier General Hugh Mercer of the Continental Army {{clashed with}} two regiments {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood of the British Army. Mercer and his troops were overrun, and Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent a brigade of militia under Brigadier General John Cadwalader to help them. The militia, on seeing the flight of Mercer's men, also began to flee. Washington <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> with {{reinforcements}} and rallied the fleeing militia. He then led the attack on Mawhood's troops, driving them back. Mawhood gave the order to retreat and most of the troops tried to flee to Cornwallis in Trenton.|$|E
5|$|The two armies {{stayed in}} their {{respective}} locations for two days. During the second day (August 1) Hannibal, aware that Varro would be in command the following day, left his camp and offered battle, but Paullus refused. When his request was rejected, Hannibal, recognizing the importance {{of water from the}} Aufidus to the Roman troops, sent his cavalry to the smaller Roman camp to harass water-bearing soldiers that were found outside the camp fortifications. According to Polybius, Hannibal's cavalry boldly <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> {{to the edge of the}} Roman encampment, causing havoc and thoroughly disrupting the supply of water to the Roman camp.|$|E

5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. The Indians did not close, but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing with smooth bore muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought that the Indians held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, the Indians were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided to hold his position in the trees and make a surprise attack on the Indians after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> with a white flag and called for the Americans to surrender, which was refused.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 15 August 636. At dawn both armies {{lined up for}} battle {{less than a mile}} apart. It is {{recorded}} in Muslim chronicles that before the battle started, George, a unit commander in the Byzantine right center, <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> to the Muslim line and converted to Islam; he would die the same day fighting on the Muslim side. The battle began as the Byzantine army sent its champions to duel with the Muslim mubarizun. The mubarizun were specially trained swordsmen and lancers, with the objective to slay as many enemy commanders as possible to damage their morale. At midday, after losing a number of commanders in the duels, Vahan ordered a limited attack with a third of his infantry forces to test the strength and strategy of the Muslim army and, using their overwhelming numerical and weaponry superiority, achieve a breakthrough wherever the Muslim battle line was weak. However the Byzantine assault lacked determination; many soldiers of the Imperial Army were unable to press the attack against the Muslim veterans. The fighting was generally moderate, although in some places it was especially intense. Vahan did not reinforce his forward infantry two-thirds of which was kept in reserve with one-third deployed to engage the Muslims, and at sunset both armies broke contact and returned to their respective camps.|$|E

25|$|In Byzantine {{times the}} {{sanctuary}} {{was one of}} the most important in Constantinople. On Ascension Day, the Emperor arrived by boat to the small harbor of the Golden Gate. He <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> to the sanctuary, where he was acclaimed by the factions, who offered him a cross and garlands. Later, he dressed in his ceremony robe in his apartments and, after receiving the Patriarch, the two entered the church hand-in-hand. After the celebration, he invited the Patriarch for dinner.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett of Griffin's {{division}} rode to {{the left}} when he heard increased firing and saw the Confederate left flank {{on the opposite side}} of Sydnor's field. Griffin also rode to Sydnor's field and saw the Confederate movement along White Oak Road. Major Cope then <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> and told Griffin that Warren wanted him to move toward White Oak Road by the left flank. Meanwhile, all of Griffin's men except three regiments of Bartlett's brigade had moved off and joined Crawford's division.|$|E

25|$|The Kentuckians {{began to}} flee down the hill, {{fighting}} hand-to-hand with Indians who had flanked them. McGary <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> to Boone's company {{and told him}} everyone was retreating and that Boone was now surrounded. Boone ordered his men to retreat. He grabbed a riderless horse and ordered his 23-year-old son, Israel Boone, to mount it. He then turned {{to look for a}} horse for himself. Israel suddenly fell to the ground, shot through the neck. Boone realized his son was dead, mounted the horse and joined in the retreat.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{just how}} those men looked as we <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> the little hill where their camp was. The red {{light of the}} morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay head towards us on the ground. And every man had a round red spot {{on top of his}} head, about as big as a dollar where the redskins had taken his scalp. It was frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint everything all over. I remember one man had on buckskin breeches.|$|E
25|$|Warren {{was told}} that the new Gravelly Run bridge was {{completed}} at 2:05a.m. Ayres's division arrived at Sheridan's position near dawn. As predicted by Warren, the effect of Bartlett's appearance threatening Pickett's flank was enough for Pickett to withdraw to Five Forks, which the Confederates had done by the time Ayres reach Dinwiddie Court House. One of Sheridan's staff officers met Ayres and told him that his division should have turned on to Brooks Road, a mile back. Ayres returned to Brooks Road, where a lone Confederate picket promptly fled as the division approached and, after Sheridan <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> for a brief meeting with Ayres, Ayres's men settled down for a rest until 2:00p.m.|$|E

25|$|Karel Kaers, the {{youngest}} man {{to win the}} world road championship, also won the Ronde in 1939– without intending to. For him, it was training for Paris–Roubaix. He drove to the Kwaremont hill near Kluisbergen, parked his car, then rode 40km to the start in Ghent. His plan was to ride round the course with his usual training partner, stop when he got to his car, then drive home. Knowing he wasn't riding the whole distance, Kaers jumped clear of the field– again as training– and <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> the Kwaremont with a minute's lead. But his car wasn't there. He pressed on instead and won the race. His manager had driven the car away to save Kaers from temptation.|$|E
25|$|During the shad bake {{lunch at}} Rosser's camp, two of Munford's pickets <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> {{to report that}} Union forces were {{advancing}} on all roads. Fitzhugh Lee and Pickett decided that since they could not hear an attack, due {{as it turned out}} to the thick pine forest and heavy atmosphere between the camp and Five Forks and an acoustic shadow, there was little to worry about. Soon after 4:00p.m., Pickett asked Rosser for a courier to take a message to Five Forks. Not long after that, two couriers were dispatched, the officers heard gunfire and saw the lead courier captured by Union horsemen on Ford's Road just across Hatcher's Run. Then they saw a Union Army battle line coming toward the road.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00a.m., Meade's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Alexander S. Webb, {{had sent}} {{an order to}} Warren to report to Sheridan for further orders. Two of Warren's {{divisions}} had done so {{within an hour of}} that message. A staff officer <b>rode</b> <b>up</b> to Warren at about 9:30a.m. and handed him Webb's message. At the same time that Webb sent this message to Warren, 6:00a.m., Meade sent a telegram to Grant stating that Warren would be at Dinwiddie soon with his whole corps and would require further orders. Warren reported to Meade on the successful movement of the corps and stated that while he had not personally met with Sheridan, Griffin had spoken with him. The failure of Warren to report directly to Sheridan may have contributed to his relief from command later on April 1. Warren reported to Sheridan about 11:00a.m.|$|E
