5000|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{a damaged}} printed circuit board (PCB) may be simply replaced during recovery procedures by an identical PCB from a healthy drive. While this may work in rare circumstances on hard disk drives manufactured before 2003, it will not work on newer drives. Electronics boards of modern drives usually contain drive-specific adaptation data (generally a map of bad sectors and tuning parameters) and other information required to properly access data on the drive. Replacement boards often need this information to effectively recover all of the data. The <b>replacement</b> <b>board</b> {{may need to be}} reprogrammed. Some manufacturers (Seagate, for example) store this information on a serial eeprom which can be removed and transferred to the <b>replacement</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

The upgrade also allows one to select to increase the CPU speed from 7.09 to 49.63 MHz with a 4 KB zero waitstate CPU cache. But it requires an FPGA core to actually carry it out (which works with the 16 MHz 68SEC000 chips).The harddrive support is available by a virtual A600/A1200 style GAYLE parallel ATA interface.

The <b>replacement</b> <b>board</b> of directors appointed {{by the federal government}} forced CNoR to assume the management of federally owned Canadian Government Railways (CGR). On December 20, 1918, a Privy Council order directed CNoR and CGR to be managed under the moniker Canadian National Railway (CNR) as a means to simplify funding and operations, although CNoR and CGR would not be formally merged and cease corporate existence until January 20, 1923, the date that CNR was formally consolidated.|$|E
5000|$|These {{versions}} roughly {{coincide with}} versions of Windows NT (see table below). Operating systems that use SLP 1.0 {{check for a}} particular text-string in a computer's BIOS upon booting. If the text string does not match the information stored in the particular installation's OEM BIOS files, the system prompts the user to activate his or her copy as normal. SLP 2.0 and SLP 2.1 work in a similar manner. This effectively [...] "locks" [...] the operating system to the qualified motherboard. In addition, if an end-user feels the need to perform a [...] "clean install" [...] of Windows and if the manufacturer supplies the user with an installation disc (not a [...] "System Recovery" [...] disc that is a hard-drive image), the user will not be prompted to activate the copy, given that the installation is performed on the same motherboard. Furthermore, because the check only involves the BIOS and not hardware, a user is allowed to change virtually all hardware components within the machine except motherboard, a procedure that would normally trigger re-activation in retail copies of Windows. If the <b>replacement</b> <b>board</b> is the same brand and of the same broad vintage as the original it will often {{be accepted by the}} OEM software. Manufacturers are generally only given a few SLP key by Microsoft. A royalty has been paid by the manufacturer if the board has a SLP key. Each manufacturer is issued with their own modified copy of Windows XP or Windows 7 that recognizes their own unique keys. Windows 8 will install on any UEFI motherboard containing a valid encrypted Microsoft product key since a royalty has been prepaid. It is most probable that an individual OEM royalty is much less than the retail price of the same version of Windows.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} corporate governance mechanisms in a context characterised by fully outside boards. The internal governance mechanisms studied comprise CEO <b>replacement,</b> <b>Board</b> of Director’s turnover and Chairman replacement in firms with ownership diversity. We find that corporate governance matters for improving performance. Our empirical findings indicate that, in privately-owned banks, forced Chairman departure followed by an outsider and the appointment of an outside CEO are seen as positive events. In addition, our results indicate that for non-private banks large board replacements are negatively related to future performance. Our study is conducted using a rich data set from the Costa Rican Central Bank for the period 1999 – 2004, and we carry out a regression analysis using the GMM technique {{in order to address}} endogeneity and firm-specific effects. The academic implications of these findings lay mostly in the strong support of the positive benefits that disciplinary mechanisms have on firm performance, since these events create the conditions for organisational change. Furthermore, these results suggest that ownership mattes, an...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, wood fibres {{have often}} been applied as the {{reinforcement}} of thermoplastic materials, such as polypropylene, whereas their use in combination with thermosetting resin has been less widespread. This study concerns the production of PMMA-based composites by partly replacing alumina trihydrate (ATH) with wood waste fillers, namely rice husks and almond shells, which would otherwise be disposed by incineration. The amount of filler introduced was limited to 10 % as regards rice husks and 10 or 15 % almond shells, since indications provided by reactivity tests and viscosity measurements did not suggest the feasibility of total replacement of ATH. As a matter of fact, the introduction of these contents of wood waste filler in PMMA-based composite {{did not result in}} any significant deterioration of its mechanical properties (Charpy impact, Rockwell M hardness and flexural performance). Some reduction of these properties was only observed in the case of introduction of 15 % almond shells. A further issue concerned the yellowing of the organic filler under exposure to UV light. On the other hand, a very limited amount of water was absorbed, never exceeding values around 0. 6 %, despite the significant porosity revealed by the filler’s microscopic evaluation. These results are particularly interesting in view of the application envisaged for these composites, i. e., wood <b>replacement</b> <b>boards...</b>|$|R

50|$|The parish {{authorities}} {{were known as}} vestries and consisted of all the ratepayers of the parish. As the number of ratepayers of some parishes grew, it became increasingly difficult to convene meetings as an open vestry. In some, mostly built up, areas the select vestry took over responsibility from the entire body of ratepayers. This innovation improved efficiency, but allowed governance by a self-perpetuating elite. The administration of the parish system relied on the monopoly of the established English Church, which {{for a few years}} after Henry VIII alternated between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England, before settling on the latter on the accession of Elizabeth I in 1558. By the 18th century, religious membership was becoming more fractured in some places, due for instance to the progress of Methodism. The legitimacy of the parish vestry came into question and the perceived inefficiency and corruption inherent in the system became a source for concern in some places. For this reason, during the early 19th century the parish progressively lost its powers to ad hoc boards and other organisations, for example the loss of responsibility for poor relief through the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. Sanitary districts covered England in 1875 and Ireland three years later. The <b>replacement</b> <b>boards</b> were each entitled to levy their own rate in the parish. The church rate ceased to be levied in many parishes and became voluntary from 1868.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade Portuguese Agricultural Credit Cooperatives (ACCs) have {{increasingly}} face survival challenges related to their difficulty in gathering equity. The main source of ACCs equity is the net benefit; thus, understanding how ACCs governance can work on correcting bad economic performance is of crucial importance to overcome this constraint.
