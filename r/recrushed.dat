40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Concern {{exists that}} {{vertebral}} bodies augmented with ce-ment placed laterally {{may be at}} risk of collapse on the nonaugmented side. The purpose of the current study was to determine if placing the cement laterally rather than centrally resulted in risk of collapse on the nonaugmented side. METHODS: Vertebral bodies (L 2 â€“L 5) were harvested from eight osteoporotic female cadaver spines. Simulated vertebral-body compression fractures were created and stabilized by injecting 3. 5 or 7. 0 mL of cement centrally or laterally. Vertebral bodies were <b>recrushed</b> to measure their augmented strength and stiffness. Anterior, posterior, left, and right lateral heights were measured initially, after augmentation, and after recompression. RESULTS: Lateral and central 3. 5 -mL injections of cement restored strength, whereas 7. 0 -mL injections significantly increased strength compared with initial values. The stiffness of vertebral bodies receiving central 3. 5 -mL injections was significantly less than it was initially, although the stiffness of bodies receiving 3. 5 -mL laterally was not significantly different from initial values. Initial and posttreatment stiffness values did not significantly differ in vertebral bodies receiving 7. 0 -mL, lateral or central injections. Vertebral heights did not significantl...|$|E
40|$|The stone {{aggregates}} of dolomite, andesitic and spililized diabase {{were tested}} to estimate {{their response to}} abrasive-impact strain. Standardized and non-standardized estimation of <b>recrushing</b> action were utilized in the experiment. The focus {{of the study was}} to improve the estimation of resistance to the <b>recrushing</b> process. The assumption that there is a relationship between the degree of <b>recrushing</b> of the stone aggregates and the grain surface before <b>recrushing</b> was confirmed The investigation was performed by the use of the standardised method according to the HRN Standard (Los Angeles). For the complete evaluation of the aggregate several other methods in accordance to HRN were also applied. The values obtained are found to be the result of several factor which include structural, textural and mineral properties, as well as genesis, tectonics (postgenetic strain producing the micro-cleavage and cataclasis) and recrystallization. The influence of the size, shape together with the interrelationship of crystals and micro-blocks on the physical and mechanical properties were determined by electronic microsc...|$|R
5000|$|After separating, {{qualified}} materials will {{be taken}} away as final products, while unqualified materials will be carried back to the stone crushing equipment for <b>recrushing.</b> And customers can classify final products according to different size ranges. All the final products are up to the related standards within and beyond China. Of course, according to different requirements, customers can adjust {{the size of their}} final products from this stone crushing plant. Process of Stone Crushing Plant ...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a {{suitable}} bioceramic material for hard tissue replacement. In this present work HAp has synthesized by solid state reactions in temperature near 1250 oC and it exhibits hexagonal crystal structure. HAp samples exhibited improvement in mechanical properties with increasing cold compaction pressure {{as well as}} <b>recrushing</b> operation. It also showed high resistance to surface reaction with the simulated body fluid. Surface morphology, pore volume, and particle size of the material have studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique, and Particle Size Analysis. Chemical bonding present in the newly produced hydroxyapatite material was confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of chrushed rock aggregates are {{greatly influenced by}} the petrographic characteristics of parent rock. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the relation between the petrographic characteristics of some volcanic and subvolcanic (silicate) rocks from Croatia, and the chrushing resistance of aggregates produced by their comminution. The aggregate resistance to chrusing was tested by means of the Los Angeles abrasion test. During this testing, an aggregate is subjected to dynamic load by impact and abrasion. The petrographic characteristics were examined with the petrographic and scanning electron microscope and by X-ray powder diffraction with CuKa (1, 54 A) radiation. In order to obtain the most correct evaluation of aggregates chrushing resistance, four different values had been used - the <b>recrushing</b> index (Ir), the reduction ratio (RR), the Los Angeles abrasion value (LA) and the Los Angeles abrasion value residue (LAr). On the basis of the obtained results, the following petrographic factors have been revealed as the most important ones for rock aggregates resistance to crushing: a - the size of crystals, b - the form, arrangement and dimensions ratio of crystals, and, especially c - the presence of microfractures in parent rock...|$|R
