40|$|The {{risk for}} {{initiation}} of fatigue {{cracks in the}} <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> web in the weld zone of a rail is studied. The interaction between the welding residual stress field and the stress field caused by service loads is simulated in a nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis where the welding residual stress distribution (shape) and magnitude, the service load magnitude and the material parameters used in the fatigue life estimation are varied. The initiation of fatigue cracks is assessed using the shear-stress-based multiaxial fatigue criterion proposed by Dang Van, and the propagation of fatigue cracks in the rail web is carried out using a Paris-type crack growth law. A discussion is presented of the interpretation of using the Dang Van criterion to assess crack initiation for stress–response load cycles with low shear stress amplitudes and high hydrostatic stress levels. In addition, the accuracy in the fatigue life assessment is evaluated by statistical uncertainty analysis where the variances according to the Gauss approximation formula are studied. The risk for fatigue crack initiation and propagation in the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>rail</b> web, respectively, is enhanced due to the welding residual stress, and the uncertainty in load level dominates the uncertainty in the fatigue assessments...|$|R

40|$|Rail defects {{are caused}} by fatigue from contact by wheels and by {{defective}} materials. Inappropriate management of those rail defects might result in safety-related problems such as operation disruption and derailment. The Technical Center has conducted technological development for rail defect management such as development of new rail defect detecting cars. Here we will explain current studies on head checks caused in <b>rail</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> transverse cracks (squat) that we are currently working on. 2. 1 Current State of Head Checks In recent years we have found many head checks with breaking out (spalling) shown as in Fig. 1 on high rails at curves with relatively large radii on conventional lines. Since there had been few head checks causing spalling other than on sections where rolling stock applies lubricant, that was not seen as a serious problem. But recently we have found head checks with spalling also on section...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the finite element elastic-plastic code ANSYS/LS-DYNA was {{utilised}} {{to investigate the}} stress states and material response of wheel/rail under three contact situations, which included high and low adhesion, and full slip. Canted and non-canted rails were considered to measure how the cant angle affected the contact stress levels. Furthermore, {{the effects of the}} contact curvatures on the contact zone and contact pressure were also examined. The simulation of wheel flange contact was conducted to compare the stress state of the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>rail</b> gauge. The results showed that a higher level of adhesion would enlarge the slip region in the stick/slip contact patch and widen the surface damage to a larger area. Moreover, the worn wheel/rail profiles would result in a non-elliptical contact patch and an increase of the contact pressure. Based on the shakedown map, it was anticipated that the rail would be damaged from the ratchetting response of the material...|$|R
50|$|Two {{significant}} {{limitations of}} the atmospheric system were overcome at this period. The first was an auxiliary traction pipe was provided at stations; it was laid outside the track, therefore not obstructing pointwork. The piston carriage connected to it by a rope—the pipe must have had its own piston—and the train could be hauled into a station {{and on to the}} start of the onward main pipe. The second development was a level crossing arrangement for the pipe: a hinged cover plate lay across the pipe for road usage, but when the traction pipe was exhausted, a branch pipe actuated a small piston which raised the cover, enabling the piston carriage to pass safely, and acting as a warning to road users. Contemporary technical drawings show the traction pipe considerably lower than normal, with its top about level with the <b>rail</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> with its centre at the level of the centre of the transoms. No indication is shown as to how track gauge was maintained.|$|R

40|$|Contamination on the {{railhead}} such as crushed leaves, {{oxide formation}} or even changes in atmospheric conditions can cause adhesion loss between {{the wheel and}} the rail. In these situations, trains can lose {{some or all of}} their braking capacity leading to vehicles coming within dangerously close proximity to one another. Low adhesion situations are traditionally combatted by firing sand directly into the wheel/rail contact from on-board the train. Previous testing has been carried out to investigate the optimum sanding system set-up which delivers the most amount of sand to the wheel/rail interface. Testing presented in this paper is a continuation of the previous set-up tests [1] and focuses on adhesion differences when sand enters the contact under low adhesion conditions. A full-scale test facility was used for these tests. Firstly, tests were undertaken which investigated sand density on the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> how this affects adhesion restoration. A second set of tests looked at how adhesion was restored when sand was fired into the contact using the ideal sanding system set-up found in previous testin...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to assist infrastructure managers (IM) {{to plan the}} utilisation of their grinding trains: an expensive resource. It was undertaken to support increasing the competitiveness of rail freight by considering combined improvements in both freight vehicle and track components in a holistic approach including economic assessments. A major cost to freight operators are the access charges that IM charge {{to cover the costs}} of track maintenance; these costs (and hence access charges) may be reduced if maintenance requirements can be linked more closely to loads imposed by traffic, enabling optimum grinding schedules to be developed and life cycle costs of rail to be reduced. Infrastructure managers undertake grinding to prevent the growth and/or formation of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks, to remove corrugations from the <b>rail</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> potentially to improve acoustic track quality and hence the sound pollution associated with rail operations.

40|$|Abstract- Rail {{inspection}} is {{an important}} task in railway maintenance. The speed and loads of trains have been increasing greatly in recent years, and these factors inevitably raise the risk of producing rail defects. Mainly the discrete surface defects impact the riding quality and safety of a railway system. However, {{it is a challenge}} to inspect such defects in a vision system because of illumination inequality and the variation of reflection property of rail surfaces. This project presents a real-time VIS for discrete surface defects of <b>rail</b> <b>heads.</b> VIS comprises the Image Acquisition Subsystem (IAS) and the image analysis subsystem. IAS acquires gray rail images for the surface of a <b>rail</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> the latter processes rail images and detects possible defects. This paper propose the Local Normalization(LN) method to enhance the distinction between defects and background in a rail image, considering illumination inequality and the variation of reflection property of rail surfaces. VIS first acquires a rail image by the image acquisition system, and then, it cuts the sub image of rail. Track by the track extraction algorithm. Then, VIS enhances the contrast of the rail image. At last, VIS detects defects using the defect localization based on projection profile (DLBP), which identifies possible defects using the projection profile of the mean intensity over each longitudinal (or transversal) line. This is robust to noise and very fast. The proposed LN method and DLBP algorithm are better than the related well-established approaches. The distance of the crack can also be found based on certain assumption. Index Terms- Discrete surface defects, local normalization(LN), projection profile, visual inspection. I...|$|R
