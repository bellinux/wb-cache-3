40|$|In {{a process}} for {{measuring}} the sequences of movements in running disciplines and the resulting calculable parameters, in particular the step size, number of steps, step time and running time, a transmitter (S 1 or S 2), a receiver (E 1 or E 2) and a signal delay counter (Z 1 or Z 2) are fitted in each shoe of an associated pair of shoes (1, 2). The delay (t<d<i<r<.) measured from the <b>rear</b> <b>shoe</b> (2) of a signal (dir.) emitted when the front shoe (1) {{is placed on the}} ground is transferred in time conformance to the first shoe (1) and from the first shoe, the counter statuses of the two counters (Z 1 and Z 2) are sent to a computer unit at high frequency (Fig. 3...|$|E
5000|$|... a rearfoot strike (heel strike) has {{the initial}} center of {{pressure}} in the rear third of the <b>shoe</b> (<b>rear</b> 1/3 of <b>shoe</b> length); ...|$|R
50|$|Also, {{drum brakes}} {{do not apply}} {{immediately}} when the wheel cylinders are pressurized, because {{the force of the}} return springs must be overcome before the shoes start to move towards the drum. This means that the very common hybrid disc/drum systems only brake with the discs on light pedal pressure unless extra hardware is added. In practice, a metering valve prevents hydraulic pressure from reaching the front calipers until pressure rises enough to overcome the return springs in the drum brakes. If the metering valve were left out, the vehicle would stop only with the front discs until return spring pressure on the <b>rear</b> <b>shoes</b> were overcome.|$|R
5000|$|Also in June 1971, {{the first}} Ducati 750 GT models {{came out of}} the factory, {{distinguished}} by silver frames, metal-flake paint, fibreglass fuel tanks, 1 1/8" [...] (1.125") Amal carburettors, and twin leading <b>shoe</b> <b>rear</b> brakes.|$|R
50|$|From 1976, the T140 had {{hydraulic}} {{disc brakes}} {{for both the}} front and rear wheels. Prior to that date, early versions were equipped with a conical hub rear drum brake. A single leading <b>shoe</b> <b>rear</b> drum brake was specified for the last Bonnevilles proposed by the Meriden factory in 1984 but the factory closed before production. From 1982, twin front brake discs were available as an option.|$|R
60|$|The {{advice was}} excellent, but Kutusow, who {{was even more}} unfitted than Barclay for the post of commander-in-chief, refused to adopt this course, and fell back towards Moscow, {{followed}} by the French. The sufferings of the latter had already become severe--the nights were getting very cold, the scarcity of food was considerable, {{the greater part of}} the army was already subsisting on horse-flesh, the warm clothing, which was becoming more and more necessary, was far in the <b>rear,</b> their <b>shoes</b> were worn out, and it was only the thought that they would have a long period of rest and comfort in Moscow, that animated them to press forward along the fifty miles of road between Borodino and that city.|$|R
50|$|Also in June 1971, {{the first}} Ducati 750 GT models {{came out of}} the factory, {{distinguished}} by silver frames, metal-flake paint, fibreglass fuel tanks, 30 mm Amal carburettors, and twin leading <b>shoe</b> <b>rear</b> brakes. Taglioni experimented with four valve heads at this time, but failed to produce better power figures than his two valve heads, so the two valve racers continued. He continued to experiment with four valve heads right up to 1973.|$|R
30|$|Basic {{definitions}} of shoe parts are as follows: heel—the {{part of the}} sole that raises the <b>rear</b> of the <b>shoe</b> {{in relation to the}} front; insole—the inner flat bed of the shoe on which the foot rests; quarter lining—a covering applied to the inner rear and sides of the shoe; sole—the entire part of the shoe below the wearer’s foot; throat—upper middle portion of the shoe, upper—the part of a shoe that cover the toes, the top and sides of the foot, and the back of the heel; vamp—the section of upper that covers the forefoot.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a {{stressed}} {{member of the}} heavy duty open cradle frame with a central box section front downtube between the forward cylinders. A small car-sized starter motor and generator were fitted. It had a five-speed transmission, {{at a time when}} most motorcycles had four. Ceriani developed the suspension package, but riders today would be alarmed by the inadequate front and <b>rear</b> single leading <b>shoe</b> 8.675 in drum brakes. The stopping distance was huge, and had to be allowed for. It had a 61.2 in wheelbase, and weighed 596 lb dry. Taglioni dismissed the Berliners' suggestion of shaft drive, and chose chain final drive. The police specification stipulated 16-inch tyres, so there was little choice in that.|$|R
50|$|Like an overpronator, an underpronator {{does not}} absorb shock {{efficiently}} - {{but for the}} opposite reason. The underpronated foot is like a diving board that, instead of failing to spring someone in the air because it is too flimsy, fails to do so because it is too rigid. There is virtually no give. An underpronator's arches or ankles don't experience much motion as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves internal rotation at the hip, knee, or ankle {{will be more likely}} to underpronate than one whose bone structure has external rotation or central alignment. Usually - but not always - those who are bow-legged tend to underpronate. An individual who underpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the lateral (outside) side of the <b>shoe</b> towards the <b>rear</b> of the <b>shoe</b> in the heel area.|$|R
5000|$|The car runs on a 6.2-liter {{naturally-aspirated}} {{cast aluminum}} V8 {{that can be}} ordered from three options. The first boasts out [...] and 425 lbft Nm, the second putting out [...] and 489 lbft Nm, and the third option doing [...] and 604 lbft Nm. The car's top speed and performance figures are dependent on the option. The engine compression rate is 10.7:1 and the bore and stroke is 103.25 x 92 mm. This power is delivered by either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed semi-automatic transmission. The body contains composite and carbon fiber. The car's tire sizes are 245/40R18 up front and 315/30R18 down the <b>rear.</b> These tires <b>shoe</b> the aluminum alloy standard wheels. The brakes are regular steel discs, which are 355 mm both front and rear but are 6-piston up front and 4-piston down the rear. These brake discs have optional carbon fiber.|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Rapid {{manufacturing}} has been revolutionary allowing {{the production of}} personalised design components for products like footwear to the final customer. Foot shape {{plays an important role}} in the development of injuries in runners, therefore any footwear should take into account an individuals mass, foot shape and other measures to provide unique support, balance, and comfort to the wearer. Despite the obvious potential in footwear products, it is not known how best to measure feet in this context nor even whether a personalised shoe can positively affect comfort, performance and prevent risk from injury. A challenge for anthropometry is the collection of detailed anthropometric measurements of the foot which can then be used to specify the design of personalised footwear. A pilot study is being conducted to assess the feasibility of personalising the design of insoles for running <b>shoes.</b> <b>Rear</b> striker, recreational runners (n= 6) were selected to take part in the study. They were 18 - 64 years old, had no reported musculoskeletal pain or injury in the last 12 months. If they had any known lower limb abnormality they were excluded from the study. The plantar surface of the feet were scanned and detailed anthropometric measurements taken. Using these data insoles for a running shoe were rapid manufactured for comparison with the standard running shoe. Participants then returned to the laboratory to be fitted with a running shoe under two experimental conditions (personalised and standard footwear). For each experimental condition, the footwear was evaluated in terms of comfort (visual analogue scales), performance (running economy on a treadmill) and injury risk (knee and ankle torque, ground reaction force and plantar pressure distribution). This paper will present and discuss the detailed methodology for this research...|$|R
