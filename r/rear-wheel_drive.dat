5|$|As {{with most}} large cars of its time, the Tagora was a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicle, with a {{longitudinally}} mounted engine. There were three engine choices, mated to four- and five-speed manual transmissions or an optional three-speed automatic {{in the case}} of the four-cylinder engines.|$|E
5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E
5|$|The PSA Group, {{formed in}} 1976 when Peugeot bought out its competitor, Citroën, {{took over the}} former Chrysler Europe in 1979; one of its first {{decisions}} was to rebrand all of the models manufactured in the French and British factories to Talbot. Among the models inherited from Chrysler was the Scottish-built <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Talbot Sunbeam, the only small car in the lineup.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2009, Lamborghini {{announced}} {{a special edition}} run of 250 Gallardo LP550-2 [...] "Valentino Balboni edition" [...] supercars; the company stated that the new car was to be <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> in accordance with Balboni's preference for the thrill of cornering a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> vehicle. These vehicles were also made special with a white and gold stripe that runs {{the center of the}} car, inspired by sports cars of the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Provided is an {{apparatus}} {{for use with}} a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> motorized wheelchair. The apparatus enables a motorized wheelchair {{to be used in}} areas that would not otherwise be possible. A motorized wheelchair, though very useful and necessary, has several mobility drawbacks. Lateral movement poses a problem to the motorized wheelchair. This apparatus provides a modification to existing <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> motorized wheelchairs that allows the user to maneuver in tight spaces by providing a for sideways movement that would not be possible in conventional wheelchair designs...|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Rovanperä was {{a regular}} {{competitor}} of the SRC Finnish Rallycross Championship with a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> Ford Focus {{as well as a}} Volvo S40, but finished only 11th overall. He had many technical problems with both cars.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|Toyota {{launched}} the Aurion in Australasia, where it competes with the <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Ford Falcon, Holden Commodore, and the now discontinued front-wheel drive Mitsubishi 380. The TRD variants were pitched {{to compete with}} the Subaru Liberty GT and Mazda 6 MPS. Since its introduction, the Aurion has received numerous awards and positive reviews. In particular, the car has been praised for its good performance mated with comparatively low fuel consumption, and the inclusion of safety and comfort features that are optional on competitor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar {{had little}} {{experience}} with four-wheel drive systems at the time, having previously only produced <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars. Randle approached Tony Rolt's company, FF Developments {{to design the}} transmission and four-wheel drive system for the XJ220, with Rolt's son Stuart running the project. Tony Rolt was the Technical Director of Ferguson Research, where he was heavily involved {{in the design of}} the four-wheel drive system used in the Jensen FF, the first sports car to be fitted with such a transmission. Tony Rolt also had a long involvement with Jaguar, winning the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans with the factory works team driving the Jaguar C-Type.|$|E
50|$|Though over 300 Lohner-Porsche chassis {{were sold}} up to 1906, {{most of them}} were two-wheel drive; either front- or <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> trucks, buses and fire-engines. Some four wheel drive buses were produced, but no four wheel drive automobiles.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the failure}} of surpassing the Huracán Performante, the team {{was still able to}} make the Viper ACR the fastest American, <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> (with no {{additional}} assistance), and manual transmission car to go around the track. Their lap time also brought the car to sixth position for street legal vehicles.|$|R
5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces {{carried out}} a winter test for {{potential}} military vehicles in March 1958. 35candidate vehicles from the two domestic producers and various importers were driven around Finland. VAT sent four vehicles to the test, three of which were 4×4s and one was an ordinary, <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> vehicle. During the five days' testing period, all vehicles were continuously fully loaded. For part of the journey, the vehicles had to tow an eight-ton field cannon. The vehicles were tested for off-road capabilities in even, -deep snow. One of the Vanajas was destroyed in an accident. The domestic vehicles performed well in the test; {{in some cases the}} <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> Sisus and Vanajas outperformed the 4×4-driven foreign competitors. None of the vehicles were clearly better than the others but the result convinced the Defence Forces of the capabilities of the domestic vehicles and led to several deals for SAT and VAT.|$|R
5|$|In 1983, Toyota {{chairman}} Eiji Toyoda {{issued a}} challenge to build the world's best car. The project, code-named F1 (“Flagship One”) developed the Lexus LS 400 to expand Toyota’s product line in the premium segment. The F1 project followed the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Mark II models. Both the Supra and Mark II were <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars with a powerful 7M-GE or 7M-GTE inline-six engine. The largest sedan Toyota built {{at the time was}} the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, a domestic, hand-built limousine, and V8-powered model, followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan. The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market and along with the Crown not slated for export after a restyle in 1982. The F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.|$|E
5|$|The F1 {{project was}} {{completed}} in 1989, involving 60 designers, 24 engineering teams, 1,400 engineers, 2,300 technicians, 220 support workers, approximately 450 prototypes and more than $1 billion in costs. The resulting car, the Lexus LS 400, had a design that shared no major elements with previous Toyota vehicles, with a new 4.0 L V8 gasoline engine and <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> The car debuted in January 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit and sales of the vehicle began the following September at a network of 81 new Lexus dealerships in the U.S. The LS 400 was sold along with the smaller ES 250, a rebadged version of the Japanese market Toyota Camry Prominent/Toyota Vista. The launch of Lexus {{was accompanied by a}} multimillion-dollar advertising campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{during its}} first full year of sales, Lexus sold 63,594 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans in the U.S., the {{majority}} being the LS model. That year, Lexus also began limited exports to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. In 1991, Lexus launched its first sports coupe, the SC 400, which shared the LS 400’s V8 engine and <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> design. This {{was followed by the}} second generation ES 300 sedan, which succeeded the ES 250 and became Lexus' top seller. At the conclusion of 1991, Lexus had become the top-selling premium car import in the U.S., with sales reaching 71,206 vehicles. That year, Lexus ranked highest in J.D. Power and Associates' studies on initial vehicle quality, customer satisfaction and sales satisfaction for the first time. The marque also began increasing U.S. model prices past those of comparable American premium makes, but still below high-end European models. By 1992, the LS 400's base price had risen 18 percent.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{have studied the}} {{electric}} power steering system for a front wheel- steered, <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> four wheels vehicle. A controller has been designed for our model {{with the help of}} assist characteristics curves and PID action. We have carried out simulation on different types of vehicle paths which include circular and moose test path. We chose two different cases of steering and for each case we have carried out simulation by considering the two path states...|$|R
25|$|In 2016, albeit Dodge {{and many}} other reports say the Viper ACR (Phase VX I) set 13 lap records, the ACR {{actually}} set a total of 14 lap records around the world, with all but one in the United States. All lap records made in US tracks are certified by the SCCA, making it the most lap records held for a Viper, and more memorably, the current world record holder for it. This number became 15 after a crowdfunded lap record attempt in the Nürburgring Nordschleife, {{which is also the}} only lap record outside of the United States, where the car never took first overall, but became the fastest American, <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> (with no additional assistance), and manual transmission car to ever lap the track.|$|R
500|$|The {{development}} team {{looked at}} the two principal competitors, the Ferrari F40 and the Porsche 959.

50|$|The Proton Juara {{is powered}} by a 1.1-litre Mitsubishi 4A31 S4 4-cylinder EFI petrol engine which {{produces}} 71 hp or 53 kW of power at 6,000 rpm and 94 Nm of torque at 4,500 rpm respectively. Only a 4-speed automatic was offered. The Juara has a top speed of 135 km/h and a 0-100 km/h time of 18.1 seconds. Its suspension setup consists of MacPherson struts at the front and trailing arms in the rear. Proton claimed to have tuned the suspension for car-like handling based on expertise gained from Lotus. Uniquely, the Juara is {{one of only a handful}} of Proton cars to be <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> (FR layout). The Juara also became the first Proton to feature Electric Power Steering (EPS).|$|R

40|$|P a g e | ii This work {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} to estimate tire side slip angles in front-wheel steered, <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> four wheeled vehicles. A three degree-of-freedom model with slip angle, yaw rate and roll angle as {{degrees of freedom}} was constructed to capture the coupling between steering and roll dynamics of such vehicles. An open-loop estimator was designed based on this model to estimate the side slip angles of tires using available real-time measurements which include steering angle, steering torque and suspension positions. The estimator was validated by comparing its predictions with that of an ADAMS model. The predictions of the ADAMS model in turn were compared with experimental results reported in vehicle dynamics literature for similar vehicles and test conditions. We conclude that a three degree-of-freedom model {{is a good start}} for use in estimation techniques of side slip angle...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{electric}} motors in automotive performance applications {{has resulted in}} the development of the electronic differential, and the capabilities stemming from independently-controlled wheels. The potential benefits have been explored before; however, there is little experimental data published on the effects of such a vectored torque system on the performance of an automobile. This thesis will investigate the effects of such a system on a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> Formula-Student class racecar with regards to its performance on the skid pad and track. Experimental data is collected from the skid pad as well as a modified figure-four course and compared to a calculated estimate to find the optimal torque bias for a given vehicle and driver to maximize cornering speed and stability. In doing so, skid pad and course times were acquired for two test vehicles with a variety of static torque bias settings which were then further implemented on a course. The resulting data indicates that the vectored torque system increases vehicle performance regardless of the driver and aids in controllability of the vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Revolve NTNU is {{a student}} {{organization}} that each year design and build a formula race car {{to participate in the}} engineering student competition Formula Student. Since its birth in 2010, Revolve NTNU has developed rapidly both organizationally and technologically. After achieving titles as best newcomer (FSUK 2012) and best Nordic team (FSUK 2013) with conventional combustion engines, the team took a big technological leap in 2014 and switched to an electric powertrain. The same year Revolve NTNU finished as the best <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>driven</b> electric vehicle (FSUK 2014). In 2015 the 2014 concept was refined and finished as 4 th overall (FSA 2015). To keep up the progress in the future and bring the battle to the decade-long experienced top running teams, Revolve NTNU has decided to change the powertrain layout to a four-wheel driven system with hub-mounted electric motors. This opens new possibilities for regenerative braking, torque vectoring control and overall increased acceleration. Due to very limited availability of suitable motors on the commercial market, the organization has initiated a research & development project. The goal is to develop an electric motor prototype tailored for use in Formula Student within a limited budget...|$|R
25|$|The Rebel is {{considered}} to be a precursor of the muscle cars (<b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> mid-size cars with a powerful V8 engines and special trims) that became so popular in the 1960s. It also foretold that muscle-type performance would be included among AMC's models.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the Bluebird {{was joined}} in 1981 by the similar-sized Stanza, which gave Nissan buyers the {{alternative}} option of front-wheel drive and a hatchback body style {{for the first}} time, as front-wheel drive hatchbacks were by now overtaking <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> saloons in popularity.|$|E
