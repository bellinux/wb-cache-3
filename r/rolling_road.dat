5|$|Friendship International Airport was {{constructed}} between 1947 and 1950 {{as the new}} primary airport for Baltimore. To directly connect the airport with Baltimore, an access road was planned to link the new BaltimoreWashington Expressway, later designated MD 295, with the airport terminal. The first portion of the Friendship International Airport Access Road was completed from a full Y interchange at the expressway to an interchange with MD 170 in October 1949 and designated MD 46. The access road was completed from MD 170 to the airport terminal in July 1951, {{about the same time}} the expressway was completed between MD 46 and downtown Baltimore. The remainder of what is now I-195 was planned as early as 1969, when the portion of Metropolitan Boulevard north of US 1 was placed under construction. The freeway opened from the US 1 ramps northwest through the I-95 interchange to an intersection with Sulphur Spring Road just south of the modern Selford Road overpass in August 1974. The freeway was extended to its present terminus at <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> and the ramps to UMBC Boulevard were constructed in 1975. Metropolitan Boulevard south of the I-95 interchange was marked as a second segment of MD 46 from when it opened. North of I-95, the freeway was marked as a relocation of MD 166. That segment of MD 46 was renumbered as an extension of MD 166 by 1981.|$|E
25|$|Several rolling {{roads were}} {{established}} in Maryland in the early 18th century for the transportation of tobacco in casks, or hogsheads, from plantations to river ports. These casks were pulled along the road by slaves and later oxen before this method of freight transportation was made obsolete {{by the introduction of}} sturdy wagons. The <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> in western Baltimore County connecting Rockdale with Elkridge, which was likely built in 1714 by William Summers, is the only such road in Maryland whose name survived to modern times. South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> was improved as a macadam road from Washington Boulevard (later US 1) to Frederick Road (later US 40 and now MD 144) by 1921. In St. Denis, the highway that was to become MD 166 followed modern Arlington Avenue and East Street south across a grade crossing of the B Railroad to its southern terminus at Washington Boulevard. MD 166 was moved to modern South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> when the highway's bridge over the railroad was built in 1931. By 1933, North <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> was upgraded to an improved county highway. North <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> would be expanded to a divided highway in Woodlawn around 1981. Unlike South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road,</b> North <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> has never {{been a part of the}} state highway system.|$|E
25|$|North <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> {{begins at}} MD 144 (Frederick Road) several blocks west of MD 166 {{on the west}} side of Catonsville. The two-lane road heads north through a {{residential}} area where it intersects Edmondson Avenue. North <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> expands to a four-lane divided highway at Old Frederick Road and intersects US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) within a commercial area. The highway becomes an undivided, two-lane road with wide lanes and passes through residential areas in the western part of Woodlawn. North <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> expands to four lanes again at Crosby Road and gains a divider as it passes under I-70. The highway enters a commercial area featuring Security Square Mall and an intersection with Security Boulevard, which heads east as MD 122. North <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> continues as a four-lane undivided highway with occasional center turn lane as it passes between business parks to the east and residential subdivisions to the west. The highway reduces to two lanes north of Windsor Boulevard in the Windsor Mill area. North <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> has an oblique intersection with Windsor Mill Road in the village of Hebbville and intersects Milford Mill Road before meeting MD 26 (Liberty Road) at the hamlet of Rockdale east of Randallstown. The highway reaches its northern terminus at Old Court Road between Randallstown and Pikesville.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{disjoint}} {{sections of}} South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> {{that are not}} part of MD 166. The highway begins in the village of St. Denis on a curve at East Street and South Street. South Street leads west and then south to US 1 and East Street provides access to the St. Denis flag stop on MARC's Camden Line. South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> crosses over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision just west of the train station. The highway makes a right-angle turn east at Railroad Avenue and another right-angle turn north at Cedar Avenue and Arlington Avenue; the latter street provides access to the train station from the north. South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> meets the western end of Francis Avenue before reaching a dead end adjacent to the I-195I-95 interchange. South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> begins again {{on the north side of}} the interchange next to the UMBC Training Centers and Tech Incubators. The highway makes a turn at Selford Road just west of that road's crossing of MD 166 and meets the state highway at a pair of carriageways on either side of the park and ride facility.|$|E
25|$|MD 166 {{is a part}} of the National Highway System as a {{principal}} arterial for its entire length. North <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> is also {{a principal}} arterial from MD 144 in Catonsville to MD 26 at Rockdale.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} changes to MD 166 {{came in the}} early 1970s with the {{construction}} of I-95 and Metropolitan Boulevard, the latter of which went under construction in 1969. When I-95 was completed through Arbutus in 1971, South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> was split. Metropolitan Boulevard opened from the US 1 ramps northwest through the I-95 interchange to an intersection with Sulphur Spring Road just south of the modern Selford Road overpass in August 1974. South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> was truncated in St. Denis by the construction of the US 1 ramps. The freeway was extended to its present terminus at <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> and the ramps to UMBC Boulevard were constructed in 1975. Metropolitan Boulevard south of the I-95 interchange was marked as a second segment of MD 46disjoint from the section between MD 295 and Baltimore/Washington International Airportfrom when it opened. North of I-95, the freeway was marked as a relocation of MD 166. MD 166 was extended to US 1 and replaced that segment of MD 46 by 1981. MD 166 was truncated to its present southern terminus when I-195 was completed in June 1990.|$|E

5000|$|The seventh {{stage of}} the 1995 Tour linked Charleroi and Liège, both in {{southern}} Belgium. It took in the <b>rolling</b> <b>roads</b> of Liège-Bastogne-Liège. Indurain attacked with Johan Bruyneel following and the rest were left 50 seconds behind. The following day Indurain won the first time trial, organised on a demanding circuit at Seraing. Jean-Paul Ollivier wrote: [...] "It offered him another chance to assert his authority. Who could challenge him? The hierarchy established itself by itself. Indurain once again set off on a demonstration Tour. This last victory by the rider from Navarra was a model of strength, intelligence and authority, all well controlled. There wasn't an tactical error, never a scare, no moments of weakness".|$|R
25|$|MD 166 {{begins as}} a {{continuation}} of the four-lane Metropolitan Boulevard freeway at the northern terminus of I-195 just north of the Interstate's interchange with I-95. The highway passes under Selford Road and has a partial interchange with UMBC Boulevard that allows access to the UMBC campus to and from the south. MD 166 curves northwest over the ramp from southbound UMBC Boulevard and the freeway's carriageways split around a park and ride facility as the freeway terminates at South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road.</b> MD 166 continues north along two-lane South <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road.</b> The highway meets the western end of MD 372 (Wilkens Avenue) and passes between <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> Golf Course on the east and the Catonsville Campus of the Community College of Baltimore County to the west. MD 166 temporarily expands to four lanes between Valley Road and Bloomsbury Avenue, between which the highway passes Catonsville High School. The highway narrows and passes {{along the edge of the}} Central Catonsville and Summit Park Historic District before veering north at Hilton Avenue and reaching its northern terminus at MD 144 (Frederick Road) west of downtown Catonsville.|$|E
25|$|Security Boulevard was {{constructed}} by Baltimore County specifically as an access {{road to the}} new Social Security Administration headquarters complex constructed in Woodlawn that opened in 1960. The new divided highway was built from the intersection of Forest Park Avenue and Cooks Lane north and west to a point west of Gwynn Oak Avenue in 1960. The boulevard was extended west to Belmont Avenue in 1963 contemporaneous with the completion of I-695 through Woodlawn. Security Boulevard was extended beyond <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> to its present western terminus in 1972. The boulevard east of <b>Rolling</b> <b>Road</b> and the short adjacent portion of Cooks Lane in Baltimore County were transferred from county to state maintenance and designated MD 122 around 1991.|$|E

MD 122 heads east as a six-lane divided highway through a commercial area. The state highway intersects Belmont Avenue just north of Security Square Mall before its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) just north of the Beltway's stack interchange with I-70. There is no access between MD 122 and I-70 via I-695. East of the Beltway, the state highway intersects Woodlawn Drive and Gwynn Oak Avenue and passes along the northern edge of the Social Security Administration headquarters complex. East of the complex, MD 122 parallels Dead Run east and then southeast through a forested area, becoming four lanes at its intersection with Forest Park Avenue and Ingleside Avenue, the latter of which has a ramp to westbound I-70. The state highway continues through a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-70 just west of the Interstate's eastern terminus at a park and ride facility. At its southern intersection with Forest Park Avenue and an entrance ramp to the park and ride, MD 122 reduces to two lanes and its name changes to Cooks Lane for the very short remainder of the highway to the boundary between Baltimore County and the city of Baltimore. Cooks Lane continues as an unnumbered residential street southeast through the West Hills neighborhood of Baltimore to US 40 (Edmondson Avenue).|$|E

5000|$|His first {{published}} science fiction story was Bis zum Nullpunkt des Seins ("To the Zero Point of Existence", 1871), depicting life in 2371, but {{he earned his}} reputation with his 1897 novel Auf zwei Planeten, which describes an encounter between humans and a Martian civilization that is older and more advanced. The book has the Martian race running out of water, eating synthetic foods, travelling by <b>rolling</b> <b>roads,</b> and utilising space stations. His spaceships use anti-gravity, but travel realistic orbital trajectories, and use occasional mid-course corrections in travelling between Mars and the Earth; the book depicted the technically correct transit between the orbits of two planets, something poorly understood by other early science fiction writers. It influenced Walter Hohmann and Wernher von Braun. The book was not translated into English until 1971 (as Two Planets), and the translation is incomplete.
