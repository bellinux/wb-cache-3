40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{practice}} of interview-based research through the metaphor of researcher as ghostwriter. What is suggested is that research can be examined {{as a form of}} textual practice in which researchers create images of others and also enter those images. In such a practice, research can be understood as a dialogic process where researchers are never neutral in their attempts to write about the lives of other people. This then leads to a need for researchers to account for their textual choices and their role in producing accounts of the experience of others. The article concludes that the ghostwriter metaphor is a way of understanding research that enables researchers to acknowledge their role in the production of textual representations of their research participants.

40|$|In {{their paper}} {{and in their}} earlier {{comments}} to the SEC on the proposed attorney reporting rules, Professors Cramton, Cohen and Koniak do an excellent job recounting {{the genesis of the}} attorney reporting requirements in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, describing the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s proposed and final rules and critiquing the rule 2 ̆ 7 s triggering mechanism and now apparently shelved noisy withdrawal requirement. Their case study of the recent Spiegel, Inc. independent examiner 2 ̆ 7 s report is a particularly useful vehicle for examining the practical implications of the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s policy and drafting choices. Although I {{was a member of a}} committee that submitted comments opposed to noisy withdrawal, there is much in their paper with which I agree. Specifically, given that the corporation is the client, it is hard to argue against up-the-ladder reporting. I would also agree that the triggering mechanism as adopted is difficult to apply; although, as I explain later, I think there may be a rational explanation for why the SEC chose that particular articulation. While I disagree with Professors Cramton, Cohen and Koniak on the wisdom of mandating noisy withdrawal, there is little to be gained from rehashing the already copious arguments against that provision. Instead, I want to follow in the tradition of many symposium comments, which effectively say, 2 ̆ 2 the principal paper was interesting, but this is what I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. 2 ̆ 2 What I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about is the SEC as an institution. What institutional features may impact the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s willingness or ability to enforce these lawyer conduct rules vigorously in the future? This kind of institutional analysis is important because one of the primary justifications for requiring the SEC to promulgate and enforce these reporting rules is the perceived failure of state bar authorities to discipline transactional lawyers. This Comment suggests, however, that with respect to enforcing professional responsibility rules the SEC shares many characteristics with state bar authorities and that it is therefore reasonable to expect a very similar pattern of enforcement. This prediction is not meant to suggest that Section 307 is unlikely to yield any benefits. Indeed, the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s new reporting rules seem to have had a salutary effect already because they appear to have substantially influenced the ABA 2 ̆ 7 s amendments to Model Rules 1. 6 and 1. 13. 8 The mere presence of these lawyer reporting rules-especially in a post-Enron environment where courts and regulators may be less willing to believe that lawyers were simply innocent bystanders-will likely cause more lawyers to report illegal acts up the ladder, even if the prospect for a disciplinary proceeding is remote. If such an increase in up-the-ladder reporting occurs, it may lessen the impact of financial wrongdoing at publicly traded companies. Thus, Section 307 may have important benefits even in a low enforcement environment. This Comment proceeds as follows. Part I takes an agency-wide perspective and focuses on the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s budget and personnel constraints and the already enormous demands on the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s scarce resources. Part II sketches the potential influence of cultural norms, constraints and staff incentives on future enforcement efforts in this area. Brief concluding remarks follow...|$|E
40|$|Although {{this is a}} {{symposium}} dedicated to the discussion of race and crime, I don 2 ̆ 7 t <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about race and crime—at least not directly. I {{want to talk about}} crime in places—inner city communities. It is through the lens of place that the question of race and crime, as well as class and crime, is better understood. My discussion of place and crime will take on the connection between race and crime in a very nuanced fashion. Specifically, I will lay out a theory that engages the connections between law and the social sciences. The theory I will explore here helps to explain both the disproportionate numbers of both minority offenders processed by the criminal justice system and minority victims counted by it. The theory does more: it explains why the arguments that both promote and attack current visions of law enforcement are hampered by a myopic focus on individual law breakers that condemns both sides to ineffectiveness. The relevant theory is a sociological conception of crime first advanced over fifty years ago. In 1942, Clifford Shaw and Henry Mc- Kay, two researchers from the Chicago School of sociology, argued in a seminal work that the structure of communities matters more in explaining the occurrence of delinquency than do the individual characteristics of offenders. According to Shaw and McKay 2 ̆ 7 s social organization theory, individual factors often connected with crime—such as low economic status or unemployment—do not themselves significantly impact crime. Rather, community-level structures—such as the prevalence of friendship networks, participation by community residents in formal organizations like PTAs and churches, and community- wide supervision of neighborhood teen peer groups—mediate the impact of these factors on crime. Put another way, the structure of the community in which an individual lives interacts in important ways to either facilitate or retard that individual 2 ̆ 7 s criminal or delinquent behavior. Because they promoted the connection between community level structures and crime over the relevance of individual dispositions to offend, Shaw and McKay doubted the efficacy of deterrence models driven by formal state-imposed sanctions...|$|E

40|$|Indigenous youth {{have the}} {{opportunity}} to hone their literacy skills, forge life-long friendships, build confidence and tell their stories through participation in the literacy program offered via The University of Notre Dame Australia (UNDA) and Clontarf Aboriginal College partnership. A recent gallery-walk, entitled ‘My Story’, exhibiting a culmination of months of young Indigenous students’ work and achievements, was available for public viewing at a special-event held at Clontarf. The aim of the exhibition was to promote the growing confidence of students, whilst demonstrating the quality of work derived from unique bonds formed between Indigenous youth and UNDA pre-service teachers. Senior Lecturer in Education, Glenda Cain, said the program had enabled pre-service teachers to combine service learning, literacy teaching and learning related to Indigenous culture and education in the one setting, whilst reflecting on breaking down the barriers of societal misconceptions and focusing on human relationships. “In particular, for the pre-service teachers, it has enabled the practical application of skills and knowledge related to teaching and literacy learning,” Ms Cain said. “The importance of literacy has been highlighted and students’ confidence to learn and apply these skills has been supported and showcased through the joint construction of ‘My Story’. ” Ms Cain said there had been a strikingly noticeable change in the level of interaction between the students of both Clontarf and UNDA as the semester progressed. “There have been friendly greetings, laughter and a more relaxed atmosphere as the students have come to know and work together,” she said. “They have shown greater engagement with the formal learning tasks and individualised programs have developed. A Clontarf staff member also commented about the growth in confidence of students while working with the UNDA pre-service teachers. “There is the real sense that a learning community has developed with respect, empathy and excitement shared by all. ” Clontarf student, Thomas Cox of Halls Creek, who insisted his tutor of nine weeks, Bianca Florenca, attend the gallery-walk with him, said the program had given him the opportunity to learn and grow as a person whilst making lots of new friends. “I’m reading much better than ever before and I’ve made a lot of friends with other boys from Perth and all over,” Mr Cox said. “I started off not talking to anyone but just the boys and I felt a bit sad and didn’t <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and later on I started to talk more with everyone and now it’s like I’ve known them all for years. ” According to Ms Cain, a number of UNDA pre-service teachers involved in the program are now exploring the possibility of a remote practicum in 2011. For the Clontarf students, it is hoped they will continue to grow in confidence and remember the times when they excelled while helping a UNDA student to become a better teacher. “The interactions through this experience have changed attitudes. It is a significant outcome of this initiative. At the heart of teaching is the relationship between the teacher and the student,” she said.

Anna looks towards the Wortmanns’ farm. She scans the fields from the road separating the hotel property and the Wortmanns’ farm, to the Blinkwater mountains on the horizon. There is no sign of a motorbike, or of a streak of dust twisting through the fields. She’s longing for a glimpse of Michael Wortmann on his motorbike, but she knows her search is pointless.

Großmutti says that the blanket makes her feel homesick for her childhood. There is something in Großmutti’s eyes that makes it easy for Anna to imagine her as a little girl, climbing the highest tree on the hotel’s property, and feeling the freedom of being higher than everyone else in Wartburg. Almost like flying. The church bells strike six. Großmutti taps her walking stick against the stoep’s tiles. Großmutti doesn’t need a walking stick, actually, but she likes to use one – mainly in moments like these, to draw attention to herself. “Isn’t there anybody to serve me here?” Großmutti calls, loudly. Großmutti never says anything softly. “No,” Anna says, her voice heavy. She gets up. “Oh good, we aren’t having a drought after all!” Großmutti coughs, and catches Anna’s eye, finally managing to force a smile from her.

Großmutti’s family used to own three of the biggest sugar farms in the area – but Großmutti’s Onkel Hermann had been more interested in drinking away his money than in farming, which meant that most of the land now belonged to other families. Luckily, the hotel was still in the family, Großmutti often said.

She hopes Großmutti won’t realize she’s not paying attention. All she can think of is the news she heard that morning. Anna and Michael are sitting underneath the jacaranda tree, eating red grape ice lollies. They are five years old, and they’ve just met.

Ok, I admit there was a bit too much about the mountains and birds and how he feels when he looks at them in his poems. But I liked them. ”’ This is one of Großmutti’s favourite stories. Anna has already heard it, more than once. Großmutti’s favourite part of the story is the beginning part, where she speaks at length about her looks. Großmutti likes to exaggerate. But Anna knows that when it comes to speaking about her looks, Großmutti is telling the truth. Anna has seen photos, and her grandmother had really been beautiful as a young woman. “Sie hat die Schönheit in die Familie gebracht,” Großvater likes to say. Anna just hopes Großmutti hadn’t spent so much time speaking about her looks back then. Vanity is easier to handle in an old person. In fact, Großmutti’s vanity is quite charming. “You know, mein Schatz, I was also beautiful once. I looked a bit like you—just prettier. Same blue eyes, dark hair, and good figure. My complexion, people used to say, was the best in the whole of Wartburg. And the men … they were just crazy about me. As I’ve noticed they are about you, too. Ja, die Männer!” At this she giggles, and blushes, and puts a stray strand of hair behind her ears. Anna knows exactly what Großmutti is going to say next. “The first time the Swiss poet kissed me was right there under that tree. ” “Does Großvater know this story? I’ve noticed you never tell it when he’s around. He’ll be here any second …” “You know, I was still getting to the point of the story. But you young people… you just don’t have any patience. When you’re 80 years old, like me, you won’t like to be interrupted either,” Großmutti twirls her walking stick around, as if to emphasize her age. Anna wants to mention that she’s heard this story, many times, and that actually, Großmutti is only turning 76 this year. “What I want to tell you, Anna, if you let me finish my story, is what the Swiss poet taught me…” “Großmutti, I don’t <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Christian. ” “You just don’t want to talk about his grandson. What’s the grandson’s name again…” “It’s such a beautiful evening, isn’t it?” Anna says, pointing at the sky full of streaks of evening-red light. “What’s his name again?” Großmutti persists. “You see, I really am getting old [...] . I never used to forget things. ” “His name’s Luka. And another thing you keep ‘forgetting’ is that I really don’t want you to even mention him. ” “I told you to be careful of Luka, didn’t I?” Anna blushes and looks away. “What do you want to tell me about then, Großmutti? Do you want to tell me that Christian taught you how to kiss? Because you’ve explained that to me before, in detail, And some only hear noise. That is their choice. But I hope that you won’t choose noise. And then, you will realise that not only is there music all around you, there is music inside you, too. The music has been there – inside you, around you, since before you were born. You just need to learn to listen, mein Schatz – listen before you sing. ” Anna looks towards the mountains at the horizon, and tries to listen. All she can hear is the sound of night settling over Wartburg, and she wishes that there were a moon tonight...|$|E
