40|$|Adaptive array antennas use {{has been}} limited to {{non-commercial}} applications due to their high cost and hardware complexity. The implementation cost of adaptive array antennas can be {{kept to a minimum}} by using cost effective antennas, reducing the number of elements in the array and implementing efficient beamforming techniques. This thesis presents techniques for the design of adaptive array antennas which will enable their cost effective implementation in wireless communication systems. The techniques are investigated from three perspectives, namely, reconfigurable antenna design, wide scan array design and single-port beamforming technique. A novel single-feed polarisation reconfigurable antenna design is proposed in the first stage of this study. Different polarisation states, namely, linear polarisation (LP), left-hand circular polarisation (LHCP) and <b>right-hand</b> <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> (RHCP), are achieved by perturbing the shape of the main radiating structure of the antenna. The proposed antenna exhibits good axial ratio (< 3 dB at 2. 4 GHz) and has high radiation efficiency in both polarisation modes (91. 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} polarisation of {{the horizontal}} magnetic components of whistler mode signals received at Halley, Antarctica (L≈ 4. 3), {{is in many}} cases that expected from a simple model of the transionospheric and sub-ionospheric propagation in the southern hemisphere; i. e. right-hand elliptical (field vectors rotate clockwise, looking towards the source) for ionospheric exit points close to the receiver, tending towards linear for more distant exit points. This suggests {{it may be possible}} to use the observed polarisation to estimate the propagation distance. However, in other cases, in certain frequency ranges, left-hand elliptically polarised signals have been observed. More realistic models do predict polarisation reversals at certain frequencies and exit point to receiver distances, but not over such a wide frequency range as has sometimes been observed. Also, in some cases, signals with nearly <b>right-hand</b> <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> have been observed for exit points at large distances where linear polarisation would be expected...|$|E

The suggestion is explored that the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> arises as a propagation effect within the source. The physical basis of this alternative mechanism {{is the fact that}} the natural wave modes of a synchrotron emitting gas are linearly polarised, allowing partial conversion of linear into <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> as in a quarter-wave plate.

40|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> is {{commonly}} induced through the multiple scattering of light by aerosols in a planetary atmosphere and the multiple reflection of light by a rough surface. More interestingly, light reflected by organisms displays unique spectral <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> behaviour, presenting {{the possibility of}} circular polarimetry {{for the detection of}} life. It has previously been neglected due its relatively small signal and the need for advanced instrumentation in its measurement. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> that can be induced by the atmosphere of an exoplanet and the impact it would have on the measurement of surface features. This was done through the modelling of the multiple scattering of light by aerosols for varying aerosol and atmospheric conditions. The influence of partial cloud cover was also modelled. A degree of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> between 10 - 3 or 10 - 5 was typically observed. The maximum values were found at phase angles of 30 ° to 70 °, with an additional peak at 110 ° to 140 ° and near-zero values around 90 °. The particle size, real refractive index and cloud and gas optical thickness values were the most significant parameters. The introduction of partial cloud cover increased the variability of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> values and high cloud symmetry with respect to the equator led to a decrease in the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation.</b> The modelled <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> may be measurable for some cases but not all. The best phase angles for observation are around 40 ° and 140 °, where the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> is near peak value and the linear polarisation is relatively small. The symmetry of the clouds is advantageous for the observation of surface features, as <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> values cancel out due to having opposite sign. However, a fully cloudy planet would make surface observations very challenging. This work can be built upon with the modelling of surface and biological <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation.</b> Most importantly, observations of organism-dense areas are required to determine the potential of circular polarimetry for the detection of life.

40|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} very tenuous clouds {{that appear in}} the high {{latitude}} mesosphere during the summer 1. They are seen by scattering of sunlight from cloud particles near the mesopause. They {{are known to be}} at altitudes of ~ 82 km, more than 50 km higher than the next highest clouds in the atmosphere, the nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds. They are usually seen after midnight in June and July in the north-east twilight arch at latitudes of 55 – 65 ° and appear silvery-blue 2 in the red twilight glow. Observations have been made from ground level 3, 4, rocket 5 and satellites 6, 7. Studies of sunlight scattered from the clouds have concentrated on measurements of polarisation of the scattered light to allow estimates of the size distribution of the cloud particles to be made. These estimates agree in that only submicron particles with an upper radius limit in the range 0. 05 – 0. 3 µm are present. Recent measurements 4 of scattered light have shown the presence of a small proportion of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation,</b> indicating that the cloud particles are probably non-spherical, and estimates of the particle size, being {{based on the assumption that}} scattering is from homogeneous spheres (Mie scattering), may need revision. The revision might be enough to force reappraisal of the amount of water condensed to form the clouds and consequent reappraisal of the relative humidity in this part of the atmosphere. A small amount of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> can be produced in the scattering of natural (unpolarised) light from elongated particles 8 but a greater proportion of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> will arise if the incident light is partly polarised and if the axes of the elongated particles show some directional preference. However, light scattered from spherical particles will also show some small amount of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation,</b> if the incident light were to be linearly polarised in a direction skewed with respect to the plane of scattering. If the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> is produced by elongated cloud particles, it is possible that polarisation of the scattered light will show marked differences from place to place due to different proportions and directions of alignment of particles being caused by updraughts or vertical wind shears present in different parts of the cloud region. This would not be expected if the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> was due to scattering of linearly polarised light from spherical particles.

Following a radio flare in 2001 January, significant and variable <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation,</b> at a fractional level of 0. 2 - 0. 4 %, was measured with ATCA at four frequencies between 1 - 9 GHz. Following an additional outburst 65 days later in 2001 March, further ATCA observations measured a comparable sign and level of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> at two frequencies. At this second epoch, contemporaneous MERLIN observations directly imaged a relativistic ejection event and allowed us to confidently associate both the circularly and linearly polarised emission with the relativistic ejecta, allowing a detailed measurement of the full polarisation properties in the optically thin phase. The fractional <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> spectrum appears to flatten at higher frequencies in 2001 January, when there is strong evidence for multiple components at different optical depths.
