40|$|The {{important}} task {{of carrying out}} the internal audit of expenses {{is to get the}} sufficient and <b>reliable</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> This can be achieved by using the analytical procedures in the audit process. The identification of the analytical procedures with the financial analysis of the business activities prevents from the efficient usage of them in the internal audit of the restaurant business expenses. The knowledge of internal auditors about the instructional techniques of analytical procedures and their tasks, depending on the verification steps are insufficient. The purpose of the article is the developing the methods of the internal audit of the restaurant business expenses based on an integrated application of analytical procedures. The nature and purpose of analytical procedures have been investigated in the article. It have been identified the factors influencing on auditor’s decision about the choice of analytical procedures complex. It was recommended to identify among them the purpose of analytical procedures, the type and structure of the enterprise, the source of the available information, the existence of financial and non-financial information, reliability and comparability of the available information. It have been identified the tasks of analytical procedures, depending on the verification steps. It was offered the analytical procedures complex as a part of internal audit of the restaurant business expenses.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{findings}} in auditing indicate that sequential processing of conflicting <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> {{can lead to}} possible non-normative responses. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the effects of conflicting <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> and source reliability on audit judgement during sequential processing. Eightyeight auditors from the Big 5 CPA firms in Fiji participated in the study. The results suggests that auditors only display significant differences in judgments when presentation order is reversed for conflicting <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> from a source with high reliability. Application of a weighted average model supports the notion that the reliability of source affects the weighting of conflicting <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> Additional analysis shows that presentation order inhibits auditors from rationally weighing conflicting <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> with varying source reliability.

40|$|<b>Audit</b> <b>evidence</b> {{enables the}} auditor to express {{an opinion on}} the {{financial}} statements. To address {{the risk that the}} auditor may express an inappropriate opinion, the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures must be responsive to the assessed risks of material misstatement. The auditor must aggregate the levels of assurance obtained from different combinations of tests of controls, substantive analytical procedures and tests of details to respond to the assessed risks. These evidence planning decisions are complex and require professional judgement. Research has found that the extent of audit procedures is not linked to the assessed risks and that auditors may not know to aggregate evidence from different types of audit procedures. Research also supports the use of a structured audit methodology that includes decision models, to guide the application of professional judgement. This leads to the overall objective of this study: the development of an integrated <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> planning model to quantify the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> The study employs a grounded theory model building approach, interpreting the relevant concepts and principles from the literature review into the development of the model. The integrated <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> planning model quantitatively relates the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> in a logical and structured manner with the risk assessment and three distinct overall levels of assurance needed to support the audit opinion. It uses the cumulative nature of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> and the compensatory inter-relationship between tests of controls, substantive analytical procedures and tests of details to quantitatively aggregate the extent and levels of assurance from the different combinations of procedures to obtain reasonable assurance at the required overall level of assurance. The model provides a framework for influencing and guiding the exercise of professional judgement and is a practical and effective tool to benefit the users thereof when conducting an audit. Thus, the study models the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> with reference to the aggregation of different types and combinations of evidence and the linkage between the risk assessment and the extent of evidence that provides a flexible framework for the application of professional judgement regarding the gathering of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> AuditingD.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the use of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> in fraud detection. This is because the detection of fraud is not an easy task to be undertaken by auditors, and even most of the auditors were unable to detect fraud as well. To be used to detect fraud, <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> must be sufficient, competent, and relevant. Furthermore, to assess their validity, the evidence collected should be tested first. An auditor also needs to have professional skepticism when gathering and evaluating <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> Without applying professional skepticism, auditors will only find misstatements caused by error only and hard to find fraud. For the detection of fraud within the organization, fraud categorized into three groups, namely fraudulent financial reporting, misappropriation of assets, and corruption. Each type of fraud has its own characteristics, so as to be able to detect the fraud it is necessary to understand well the types of fraud that may arise within the company...|$|R
