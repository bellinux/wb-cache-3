Aiming to explore the vast market of the former USSR, they used the situation to make professionals and services totally dependent on their financial sustenance, turned the major attention to the availability of medicines rather than that of psycho-social <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services,</b> and stimulated corruption within the mental health sector very much.|$|E

40|$|A simple cost {{effective}} survey {{to assess the}} need for a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>service</b> for individuals disabled by poliomyelitis was carried out making the maximum use of the existing government administration. The field team consisted solely of a medical officer and a health officer. The prevalence rate for paralytic poliomyelitis in the Mbeya region of Tanzania was 2. 95 / 1000 persons. The rate for children under 10 years was 1. 15 / 1000, suggesting that the expanded immunisation programme started in 1977 was being successful. With approximately 4000 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis in the Mbeya region a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>service</b> would seem to be justified. If poliomyelitis surveys are required for rehabilitation purposes they must include all age groups. In this survey, had only school children been considered, as recommended by the World Health Organisation, two thirds of the cases would have been excluded, thereby hardly justifying a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R
25|$|Handicap International {{estimates}} {{that up to}} 50 percent of people injured during the attacks have sustained severe injuries that will require rehabilitation to prevent permanent disability. Of the 1.5 million {{people living in the}} Gaza Strip, international and national agencies working in disability and rehabilitation estimate that, even before the military operation, over 10 percent had moderate or severe impairments. They estimate that as many as half of the 5,380 men, women and children injured over the past three weeks of conflict may suffer lifelong impairment, exacerbated by the inability of rehabilitation workers to provide early intervention. These agencies has highlighted the importance of providing early intervention for those newly injured, especially those discharged prematurely from health facilities; re-establishing and strengthening the capacity of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> and disabled peoples organizations to respond to the increased need. This is especially critical given that the main provider of specialist <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> in Gaza sustained severe damage and is not yet fully operational. Even before 27 December, {{the first day of the}} attacks, there was already a back-log of people waiting for specialised services including rehabilitation and surgery.|$|E
25|$|Various {{improvements}} {{were also}} made {{to health care}} provision and coverage during the social-liberal coalition’s time in office. In 1974, domestic aid during in-patient or in-patient cures was established, sick pay to compensate for wages lost while caring for a child was introduced, and the time-limit to in-patient care was removed. That same year, the cover of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> was increased, together with the cover of dental and orthodontic services. Health insurance coverage was extended to self-employed agricultural workers in 1972, and to students and the disabled in 1975. in 1971, an International Transactions Tax Law was passed.|$|E
25|$|The {{statutory}} National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme {{covers all}} Finnish residents, {{and it is}} run by the Social Insurance Institution (SII) through approximately 260 local offices all over the country.

The NHI system offers varying levels of reimbursement for outpatient drugs, care from private providers, transport costs to health care facilities, sickness and maternity leave allowances, and some <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services.</b> The NHI also partially reimburses occupational healthcare costs for services delivered to employees, but not to dependents.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Sam Brownback {{was elected}} {{governor}} with 63 {{percent of the}} state vote. He was sworn in as governor in 2011, Kansas' first Republican governor in eight years. Brownback had established himself as a conservative member of the U.S. Senate in years prior, but since becoming governor has made several controversial decisions, leading to a 23% approval rating among registered voters, the lowest of any governor in the United States. In May 2011, much to the opposition of art leaders and enthusiasts in the state, Brownback eliminated the Kansas Arts Commission, making Kansas the first state without an arts agency. In July 2011, Brownback announced plans to close the Lawrence branch of the Kansas Department of Social and <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Services</b> as a cost-saving measure. Hundreds rallied against the decision. Lawrence City Commission later voted to provide the funding needed to keep the branch open.|$|E
25|$|Anosognosia {{is a lack}} of {{awareness}} or understanding of the loss of function caused by the brain injury and is common in individuals who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke. Because patients with anosognosia may be unaware of their deficits, they may be less likely to seek treatment once they are released from the hospital. The lack of proper treatment could lead to higher levels of dependency later on. In order to make functional recovery gains, right hemisphere stroke survivors should receive <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services,</b> so patients with anosognosia should be encouraged to seek out additional treatment. However, due to the anosognosia, these patients often report a higher perceived quality of life than other right hemisphere stroke survivors because of the unawareness of the resulting deficits (Daia et al., 2014). Patients with smaller lesions often recover faster from anosognosia than patients with larger lesions resulting in anosognosia (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{critically}} review the research literature investigating the experiences of providing care to a spouse or partner during inpatient rehabilitation following a catastrophic injury (namely, stroke, traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury) and their perceptions of inpatient <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>service</b> delivery. Method: An integrative review was undertaken to determine the extent to which the topic has been investigated. Quantitative and qualitative research papers were systematically identified in peer-reviewed journals in electronic databases. Findings: Five articles published between 1994 and 2016 reported on four studies investigating the experiences of caregiving specifically by a spouse/partner to a person receiving rehabilitation following a stroke. No research was found that committed to understanding the experiences of the spouse/ partner and their perceptions of inpatient <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>service</b> delivery following traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury exclusively. Conclusion: The diverse aspects of caregiving are not an area of inquiry in <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>service</b> delivery following a traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury.
