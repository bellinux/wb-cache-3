25|$|The diets of the {{starlings}} {{are usually}} dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds in continents Asia and Africa, for example white sandalwood, Indian Banyan. In addition to trees {{they are also}} important dispersers of parasitic mistletoes. In South Africa, the <b>red-winged</b> <b>starling</b> is an important disperser of the introduced Acacia cyclops. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, {{which led to the}} speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol. Laboratory experiments on European starlings have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly. In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings will also consume nectar. The extent to which starlings are important pollinators is unknown, but at least some are, such as the slender-billed starling of alpine East Africa, which pollinates giant lobelias.|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} birds {{in a state}} of nature, the first and most obvious {{supposition}} which will occur to everyone is that the female at the proper season accepts the first male whom she may encounter; but she has at least the opportunity for exerting a choice, as she is almost invariably pursued by many males. Audubon—and we must remember that he spent a long life in prowling about the forests of the United States and observing the birds—does not doubt that the female deliberately chooses her mate; thus, speaking of a woodpecker, he says the hen is followed by half-a-dozen gay suitors, who continue performing strange antics, “until a marked preference is shewn for one.” The female of the <b>red-winged</b> <b>starling</b> (Agelæus phœniceus) is likewise pursued by several males, “until, becoming fatigued, she alights, receives their addresses, and soon makes a choice.” He describes also how several male nightjars repeatedly plunge through the air with astonishing rapidity, suddenly turning, and thus making a singular noise; “but no sooner has the female made her choice, than the other males are driven away.” With one of the vultures (Cathartes aura) of the United States, parties of eight or ten or more males and females assemble on fallen logs, “exhibiting the strongest desire to please mutually,” and after many caresses, each male leads off his partner on the wing. Audubon likewise carefully observed the wild flocks of Canada geese (Anser Canadensis), and gives a graphic description of their love-antics; he says that the birds which had been previously mated “renewed their courtship as early as the month of January, while the others would be contending or coquetting for hours every day, until all seemed satisfied with the choice they had made, after which, although they remained together, any person could easily perceive that they were careful to keep in pairs. I have observed also that the older the birds, the shorter were the preliminaries of their courtship. The bachelors and old maids, whether in regret, or not caring to be disturbed by the bustle, quietly moved aside and lay down at some distance from the rest.”[166] Many similar statements with respect to other birds could be cited from this same observer.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere is {{a global}} threat of {{invasive}} alien plants to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Of these, fleshy-fruited species are credited {{as some of the}} worst invaders and this is largely due to their mutualisms with local dispersers. Comparative studies between invasive and indigenous species can shed new insights into the traits which promote invasive plants success over their indigenous counterparts. This study compared the germination success of indigenous Solanum giganteum and invasive Solanum mauritianum, following ingestion by <b>Red-winged</b> <b>Starlings</b> (Onychognathus morio, Sturnidae) and Speckled Mousebirds (Colius striatus, Coliidae) and compared these with de-pulped seed and whole fruit controls. Nutritive and morphological fruit traits were also considered. Seed retention times were only obtained for <b>Red-winged</b> <b>Starlings</b> on both diets, and these did not differ. For both plant species, ingested and de-pulped seeds had similar germination success and mean daily germination, irrespective of frugivore type. However, pulp removal was important for S. giganteum. The type of avian frugivore affected the onset of germination, with the comparatively larger <b>Red-winged</b> <b>Starlings</b> promoting earlier germination of both S. mauritianum and S. giganteum seeds when compared to their controls, except for de-pulped S. mauritianum. These germinated {{at the same time as}} ingested S. mauritianum, but significantly earlier than de-pulped S. giganteum. Speckled Mousebirds consumed more S. mauritianum than S. giganteum, while <b>Red-winged</b> <b>Starlings</b> showed the opposite. While S. mauritianum had larger yellow fruits, their seeds were smaller, lighter and more numerous than those in the red fruits of S. giganteum. Furthermore, S. mauritianum fruits contained considerably more sugar content than S. giganteum fruits. In summary, offering greater nutritional rewards and generating greater reproductive outputs than indigenous species, can explain why fleshy-fruited exotics become highly invasive...|$|R

50|$|Males form territories, 7.5 - 49 ha large (the size {{depends on}} {{rainfall}} patterns), {{in which they}} stay with their partners and offspring. Males are generally more vigilant than females. Klipspringer form large dung heaps, nearly 1 m across and 10 cm deep, at the borders of territories; another form of marking is the secretion of a thick, black substance, measuring 5 mm across, from the preorbital glands onto vegetation and rocks in the territories. A study revealed that the tick Ixodes neitzi detects and aggregates on twigs marked by the klipspringer. Another study showed that plants near the borders with neighbouring territories are particularly preferred for marking. The main vocalisation is a shrill whistle, given out be the klipspringer pair in a duet, {{as a means of}} communication or anti-predator response. Predators include the baboon, black-backed jackal, caracal, eagle, leopard, martial eagle, serval, spotted hyaena and Verreaux's eagle. Birds such as familiar chats, pale-winged <b>starlings,</b> <b>red-winged</b> <b>starlings</b> and yellow-bellied bulbuls have been observed feeding on ectoparasites of klipspringer.|$|R

25|$|On January 3, {{more than}} five hundred <b>starlings,</b> <b>red-winged</b> {{blackbirds}} and sparrows fell dead in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, USA. Also on the same day, an estimated two million dead fish were found floating in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, USA.|$|R
40|$|Each winter an {{estimated}} 350 million <b>starlings,</b> <b>red-winged</b> blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), and brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) congregate in roosts {{in the southeastern}} United States (Meanley 1971, Meanley and Royall 1976). These birds have been of increasing concern because of agricultural damage claims (Stickley et al. 1976, Dolbeer et al. 1978), reputed health hazards (Monroe and Cronholm 1977), and other nuisance problems associated with them.

40|$|Bird-aircraft {{collisions}} are {{costly and}} potentially deadly {{to people and}} wildlife. From 1990 through 2004, 57, 702 bird collisions with aircraft were reported within the USA to the US Federal Aviation Administration. Approximately 82 % of the strikes occur below 305 m height about ground level; therefore bird deterrents on airfields that reduce {{the quality of the}} birds’ habitat are critical to safe airport operation. One management approach is to reduce perching sites within the airport premises. We tested two anti-perching devices (BirdwireTM and BirdbloxTM) in an aviary setting. As an ancillary test, we determined which wire in a standard three-strand security array was preferred by blackbirds and <b>starlings.</b> <b>Red-winged</b> blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were deterred from sitting on a perch when anti-perching wire was installed 5 cm above the perch. These same species preferred the top wire of the three-wire security array. Red-winged blackbirds, common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), brown-headed cowbirds, European starlings, and rock pigeons (Columba livia) were deterred from perches protected by BirdbloxTM. Because our tests were conducted in a captive situation, we recommend field testing the products to determine if bird use of airport structures may be reduced in an operational setting...|$|R

50|$|Like other starlings, the <b>red-winged</b> <b>starling</b> is an omnivore, {{taking a}} wide range of seeds, berries, nectar from plants such as Aloe and Schotia brachypetala, and invertebrates, such as the beetle species Pachnoda sinuata.

40|$|WOS: 000248669100067 International audienceWe analysed, for {{the first}} time, songs of the African <b>Red-winged</b> <b>Starling</b> Onychognathus morio and {{compared}} their general characteristics {{with those of the}} European Starling Sturnus vulgaris. Both species are gregarious during the non-breeding season, but European Starlings tend to nest in colonies, form unstable pair-bonds and are occasionally polygynous, whereas Red-winged Starlings form long-term pair-bonds and occupy exclusive nesting territories. Red-winged Starlings produced the same basic song categories as European Starlings: warbles and whistles. These two categories appeared to be involved in similar social interactions in the two species. However, several aspects of song behaviour differed between the two species: Red-winged Starlings, breeding in isolated nests, preferentially used whistles for long-distance communication and showed a simpler organization of warbling song. Whistles in the <b>Red-winged</b> <b>Starling</b> were mostly shared between birds and, in contrast to the European Starling, were not indicators of individual identity. Also in contrast to the European Starling, female song in Red-winged Starlings appeared very important throughout the breeding period. Our results suggest that some song characteristics in the two species are phylogenetically conserved whereas others are affected by the distinct social systems of the two species...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that fruit features such as nutrient content, size and colour have co-evolved with dispersal agent behaviour, physiology and morphology. Avian nectarivore feeding ecology is relatively well studied; however, less is known about fruit selection in avian frugivores. Previous work highlights the importance of individual factors that contribute towards fruit preferences, but few studies bring these factors together. Consequently the aim of this dissertation was to attempt this in terms of frugivory by investigating behavioural, physiological and morphological aspects of fruit selection in generalist avian dispersers. This was achieved by manipulating the nutritional content, size and colour of fruits (artificial fruits) under controlled conditions. The first part of the dissertation addresses physiological aspects of fruit selection in <b>Red-winged</b> <b>Starling</b> Onychognathus morio, Speckled Mousebird Colius striatus and Dark-Capped Bulbul Pycnonotus tricolor.

Outside the park dominants were represented by Cape Weaver Ploceus capensis, Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus, Cape Canary Serinus canicollis, Common Quail Coturnix coturnix, Stonechat, Cape Bunting Emberiza capensis and Drakensberg Siskin Pseudochloroptila symonsi. Characteristic, high-altitude species in the park included Drakensberg Siskin, Mountain Pipit Anthus hoeschi, Orange-breasted Rockjumper Chaetops auriantius, Banded Martin Riparia cincta and Sentinel Rock Thrush Monticola explorator. Species such as the Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis, Sicklewinged Chat Cercomela sinuata, Mountain Chat Oenanthe monticola, Thick-billed Lark Galerida magnirostris, <b>Red-winged</b> <b>Starling</b> Onychognathus morio, Alpine Swift Apus melba Cape Sparrow, Grey-headed Sparrow Passer diffusus, Red Bishop Euplectes orix and Golden Bishop Euplectes afer were absent or occurred in very low densities in the park, although they are widespread and common in the Maluti/Drakensberg grasslands (including areas neighbouring to the park). The lack of trees and shrubs for nesting, the lack of cultivated fields as feeding places and competition with related species both for food and nesting sites, may partly play a role in this regard...|$|E
