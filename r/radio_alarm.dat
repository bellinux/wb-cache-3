As Trends and Issues paper number 178 showed, the patterns of assaults and risk factors are predictable.

5000|$|A {{breakup of}} the GBV lineup led to a shake-up in Cobra Verde with the entry of Klein (of the Cleveland heavy-metal band Breaker) and Vazzano (of the Cleveland rock band Quazimodo) in 1998.

The former, who died in 2007, {{was a member of}} noted Cleveland bands the Pagans and <b>Radio</b> <b>Alarm</b> Clocks, and served as a board member for the parody cult known as the Church of the Subgenius. Hill played in the band until 2002, leaving to pursue comedy and acting. Hill was replaced by Edward Angel Sotelo, an Argentine-born musician who had played in Cleveland-based post-punk Proletarian Art Threat. At this point, Cobra Verde included guitarist Derek Deprator who was replaced by Jovan Karcic (of noted Columbus group Gaunt).

2500|$|When the Decision Dispatcher {{has made}} a {{decision}} as to what units will actually be assigned to the incident, unless the supervisor intervenes, he or she pushes the [...] "release" [...] button and the alarm is routed to the assigned companies, both in their respective firehouses and to the individual mobile data terminals (MDT) of each company's apparatus when {{it is in the}} field, depending on where the Starfire computer shows them to be situated. If a company/unit in a firehouse does not acknowledge the run within 30 seconds, the computer will notify the Voice Alarm Dispatcher (VAD), who will call that unit via radio in their firehouse by the dedicated intercom system. One minute after the alarm is released, it will appear on the computer screen of the radio dispatcher (Radio), who will announce the alarm and the response two times and ask for acknowledgment from any companies assigned who have not done so by <b>radio,</b> voice <b>alarm</b> or MDT. The radio dispatcher has a special keyboard called the Status Entry Panel (SEP), which is used to update the status of units based on information received by radio.|$|R

50|$|David Thomas Broughton is an English folk/avant-garde {{singer and}} guitarist, {{currently}} based in Seoul, Republic of Korea and previously in Pyongyang, North Korea. Born in Otley, West Yorkshire, he creates {{the sound of}} a large ensemble by sampling himself singing, playing acoustic guitar, and making an assortment of other sounds through a Boss loop pedal. He also uses various non-traditional musical instruments to augment his songs, including <b>radios,</b> personal attack <b>alarms</b> and televisions, and occasionally incorporates a use of natural field recordings into his music. He is also known for his love of spontaneity and musical improvisation, recording albums in one take (allowing recording faults to remain) and beginning live performances with no clear plan in mind. He includes self-conscious, ironic dance moves and off-mic (often off-stage) singing in his live performances.|$|R

However, there are ever more doubts about a one-fits-all policy considering the increasing diversity of users and the increasing number of complaints. In our previous studies a taxonomy of 'soft' usability problems related to the use of electronic products has been made. The question posed in this paper is how people behave in the actual use of annoying user-unfriendly products. An experiment was conducted with 33 South Koreans and 23 Americans. A <b>radio</b> <b>alarm</b> clock and a MP 3 player were chosen to induce soft usability problems. A questionnaire was used to measure the participants' characteristics. Overall, this study indicates that product operation and user behavior are correlated with specific user characteristics such as age, gender, and culture. close...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is related to active control of in-car noise. Basically, an artificially {{generated}} sound is superimposed on the unwanted interior noise in order to cancel it out. The canceling signal is obtained by suitable detection and processing of the interior noise so that the unwanted sound perceived by the human observer is considerably reduced. The core of the system consists of an ensemble of “experts ’ that are specialized in modeling the in-car noise for predefined engine rotation intervals. These are implemented by artificial neural networks, due to their well-known approximation capabilities. Tracking capabilities of the changes occurring in the environment are provided by adaptive weighting of the experts outputs. This action is driven by a discriminator that is able to distinguish between useful sounds (voice, <b>radio,</b> <b>alarm</b> signals) and unwanted noise. Experimental results show {{the efficiency of the}} proposed method, indicating significant noise level reduction in a fairly broad frequency range...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore {{the role of the}} doctor in the {{emergency}} primary health care service in red response situations in Norway, including the doctors’ experiences with a variety of emergency situations. The Norwegian municipalities are responsible for medical support and treatment to every person in the municipality. This is managed through the primary health care services, also encompassing home nurses, regular general practitioners (rGPs), health visitors, midwives, nursing homes, out-of-hours services, casualty clinics, doctors oncall and a local emergency communication centre. The main resources in the emergency primary care services are the rGPs during office hours and the out-ofhours services, casualty clinics and doctors on-call out-of-hours. The secondary health care services manage the ambulance services (vehicles, boats, airplanes and helicopters) and the emergency medical communication centres (EMCCs). When someone calls the national emergency number 113, a nurse at the EMCC does a triage of the patient’s/patients’ problem based on the Norwegian Index of Medical Emergency Assistance (Index). The triage shall result in one of three possible levels of urgency; red response, which concerns potentially or manifestly life-threatening situations and therefore has the highest priority; yellow response, which is urgent but where the condition in question is not considered life-threatening at the moment; and the green response, which has the lowest priority with no urgency. If in need of medical attention during daytime (not life-threatening, but urgent), patients are supposed to contact their own rGP or call the local emergency communication centre (LEMC). Doctors on-call in the emergency primary care service in the municipalities shall be in a state of readiness 24 hours a day, with the out-of-hours services as an included part. The rGPs are equipped with radios. In potentially life-threatening situations patients are expected to call 113 to an EMCC. If the EMCC defines the problem as life-threatening the ambulance and doctor on-call shall be alerted by a <b>radio</b> <b>alarm</b> from the EMCC, and attend the patients at site. In some cities casualty clinics are open during office hours and some have open access 24 / 7. Inter-municipal co-operations, where one doctor is on-call out-of-hours covering all municipalities in the co-operation, are common. The main objectives of the thesis were: - To explore the emergency primary care services and the most urgent emergency patients, defined as red responses, in general. - To explore the role of the doctors on-call and their experiences with red response patients. Main findings in the thesis; - There was an insufficient radio use among doctors on-call in about half of the emergency primary care districts. - There were large differences in numbers of doctors receiving alarms between the three areas. The most important factor with respect to doctors on- call being alerted or not was the individual EMCC. - The rGPs took part in emergency care with an overall high self-confidence in performing emergency procedures. - The emergency primary health care services constitute {{an important part of the}} out-of-hospital emergency system in Norway...|$|E
