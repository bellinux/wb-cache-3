40|$|Abstract. Traditionally {{environmental}} {{scientists are}} limited to simple display and animation of large-scale <b>raster</b> geospatial <b>data</b> derived from remote sensing instrumentation and model simulation outputs. Identifying regions that satisfy certain range criteria, e. g., temperature between [t 1,t 2) and precipitation between [p 1,p 2), {{plays an important role}} in query-driven visualization and visual explo-ration in general. In this study, we have proposed a Binned Min-Max Quadtree (BMMQ-Tree) to index large-scale numeric <b>raster</b> geospatial <b>data</b> and efficiently process queries on identifying regions of interests by taking advantages of the approximate nature of visualization related queries. We have also developed an end-to-end system that allows users visually and interactively explore large-scale <b>raster</b> geospatial <b>data</b> in a Web-based environment by integrating our query pro-cessing backend and a commercial Web-based Geographical Information System (Web-GIS). Experiments using real global environmental data have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed BMMQ-Tree. Both experiences and lessons learnt from the development of the prototype system and experiments on the real dataset are reported...|$|R

40|$|In data analysis, it {{is often}} useful to {{delineate}} or segregate areas of interest {{from the general population}} of data in order to concentrate further analysis efforts on smaller areas. Three methods are presented here for automatically generating polygons around spatial data of interest. Each method addresses a distinct data type. These methods were developed for and implemented in the sample planning tool called Visual Sample Plan (VSP). Method A is used to delineate areas of elevated values in a rectangular grid of <b>data</b> (<b>raster).</b> The <b>data</b> used for this method are spatially related. Although VSP uses data from a kriging process for this method, it will work for any type of data that is spatially coherent and appears on a regular grid. Method B is used to surround areas of interest characterized by individual data points that are congregated within a certain distance of each other. Areas where data are “clumped” together spatially will be delineated. Method C is used to recreate the original boundary in a <b>raster</b> of <b>data</b> that separated data values from non-values. This is useful when a rectangular <b>raster</b> of <b>data</b> contains non-values (missing data) that indicate they were outside of some original boundary. If the original boundary is not delivered with the raster, this method will approximate the original boundary...|$|R

While it is desirable to enable visual explorations of large-scale <b>raster</b> geospatial <b>data</b> in a Web environ-ment, improving the end-to-end performance between query back-end and the client applications remains a challenging technical is-sue. Techniques for providing tiled map services that are adopted by major commercial Internet maps APIs have been successful in handling static geospatial data. Motivated by the practical needs of supporting query-based visual explorations in a Web environment, we have proposed a dynamic tiled map services approach that inte-grates and extends existing Web-based standards and best practices in serving tiled images for static <b>raster</b> geospatial <b>data.</b> The ap-proach includes quadtree-based indexing and query processing at the server side and a middleware to efficiently convert quadrants of dynamic query results into tiled images. A prototype system has been developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

In this study, we have developed an efficient spatial data structure called BQ-Tree to code <b>raster</b> geospatial <b>data</b> by exploiting the uniform distributions of quadrants of bitmaps at the bitplanes of a raster. In addition to utilizing the chunk-level coarse grained parallelism on both multicore CPUs and GPGPUs, we have also developed two fine-grained parallelization schemes and their four implementations by using different system and application level optimization strategies. Experiments show that the best GPGPU implementation is capable of decoding a BQ-Tree encoded 16 -bits NASA MODIS geospatial raster with 22, 658 * 15, 586 cells in 190 milliseconds, i. e., 1. 86 billion cells per second, on an Nvidia C 2050 GPU card.
