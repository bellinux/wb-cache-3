40|$|Past {{approaches}} {{for assessing the}} impacts of transporting spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste have not been effectively implemented or have used relatively simple approaches. The Yucca Mountain Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) analysis considers 83 origins, 34 fuel types, 49, 914 legal weight truck shipments, 10, 911 rail shipments, consisting of 59, 250 shipment links outside Nevada (shipment kilometers and population density pairs through urban, <b>suburban</b> or <b>rural</b> <b>zones</b> by state), and 22, 611 shipment links in Nevada. There was additional complexity within the analysis. The analysis modeled the behavior of 41 isotopes, 1091 source terms, and used 8850 food transfer factors (distinct factors by isotope for each state). The model also considered different accident rates for legal weight truck, rail, and heavy haul truck by state, and barge by waterway. To capture the all of {{the complexities of the}} transportation analysis, a Microsoft{reg_sign} Access database was created. In the Microsoft{reg_sign} Access approach the data is placed in individual tables and equations are developed in queries to obtain the overall impacts. While the query might be applied to thousands of table entries, there is only one equation for a particular impact. This greatly simplifies the validation effort. Furthermore, in Access, data in tables can be linked automatically using query joins. Another advantage built into MS Access is nested queries, or the ability to develop query hierarchies. It is possible to separate the calculation into a series of steps, each step represented by a query. For example, the first query might calculate the number of shipment kilometers traveled through urban, <b>rural</b> and <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> for all states. Subsequent queries could join the shipment kilometers query results with another table containing the state and mode specific accident rate to produce accidents by state. One of the biggest advantages of the nested queries is in validation. Temporarily restricting the query to one origin, one shipment, or one state and validating that the query calculation is returning the expected result allows simple validation. The paper will show the flexibility of the assessment tool to consider a wide variety of impacts. Through the use of pre-designed queries, impacts by origin, mode, fuel type or many other parameters can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Chinese {{economic}} reforms have moved Mao's antiurban paradigm to an urban-driven paradigm. Since the late 1980 s, modernist reforms {{have led to}} large scales of urbanization, particularly in the <b>suburban</b> <b>rural</b> <b>zones.</b> Extensive amounts of farmland in Beijing have been expropriated for conversion to urban use to bolster economic growth. Whilst market reforms {{have resulted in a}} substantial rise in land values, as the state is effectively the sole landowner, little of the 'surplus value' thus created has gone to the peasants who merely have user rights. In response, peasants have created an informal sales and rental housing market to make up for their loss in livelihood, and to meet the demand of Beijing residents and low-income migrant workers. Supported by site surveys, this paper examines peasants' rights to the city, other property rights, {{and the ways in which}} they exercise their 'illegal' rights and the mechanism by which the 'surplus value' is shared between the state, the developers, and, albeit limited, the peasants in the urbanization process. More intricate policy measures have since been taken by the Chinese government in pacifying the social tension arising from inequitable housing distribution...|$|R

40|$|The Yucca Mountain Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) {{analysis}} {{addressed the}} potential for transporting spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from 77 origins for 34 types of spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste, 49, 914 legal weight truck shipments, and 10, 911 rail shipments. The analysis evaluated transportation over 59, 250 unique shipment links for travel outside Nevada (shipment segments in urban, <b>suburban</b> or <b>rural</b> <b>zones</b> by state), and 22, 611 links in Nevada. In addition, the analysis modeled the behavior of 41 isotopes, 1091 source terms, and used 8850 food transfer factors (distinct factors by isotope for each state). The analysis also used mode-specific accident rates for legal weight truck, rail, and heavy haul truck by state, and barge by waterway. This complex mix of data and information required an innovative approach to assess the transportation impacts. The approach employed a Microsoft{reg_sign} Access database tool that incorporated data from many sources, including unit risk factors calculated using the RADTRAN IV transportation risk assessment computer program. Using Microsoft{reg_sign} Access, the analysts organized data (such as state-specific accident and fatality rates) into tables and developed queries to obtain the overall transportation impacts. Queries are instructions to the database describing how to use data contained in the database tables. While a query might be applied to thousands of table entries, {{there is only one}} sequence of queries that is used to calculate a particular transportation impact. For example, the incident-free dose to off-link populations in a state is calculated by a query that uses route segment lengths for each route in a state that could be used by shipments, populations for each segment, number of shipments on each segment, and an incident-free unit risk factor calculated using RADTRAN IV. In addition to providing a method for using large volumes of data in the calculations, the queries provide a straight-forward means used to verify results. Another advantage of using the MS Access database was the ability to develop query hierarchies using nested queries. Calculations were broken into a series of steps, each step represented by a query. For example, the first query might calculate the number of shipment kilometers traveled through urban, <b>rural</b> and <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> for all states. Subsequent queries could join the shipment kilometers query results with another table containing unit risk factors calculated using RADTRAN IV to produce radiological impacts. Through the use of queries, impacts by origin, mode, fuel type or many other parameters can be obtained. The paper will show both the flexibility of the assessment tool and the ease it provides for verifying results...|$|R
40|$|PurposeRural-urban {{disparities in}} {{provision}} of preventive services exist, {{but there is}} sparse research on how <b>rural,</b> <b>suburban,</b> or urban differences impact physician adherence to clinical preventive service guidelines. We aimed to identify factors that may cause differences in adherence to preventive service guidelines among <b>rural,</b> <b>suburban,</b> and urban primary care physicians. MethodsThis qualitative study involved in-depth semi-structured interviews with 29 purposively sampled primary care physicians (10 <b>rural,</b> 10 <b>suburban,</b> 9 urban) in Missouri. Physicians {{were asked to describe}} barriers and facilitators to clinical preventive service guideline adherence. Using techniques from grounded theory analysis, 2 coders first independently conducted content analysis then reconciled differences in coding to ensure agreement on intended meaning of transcripts. FindingsPatient epidemiologic differences, distance to health care services, and care coordination were reported as prominent factors that produced differences in preventive service guideline adherence among <b>rural,</b> <b>suburban,</b> and urban physicians. Epidemiologic differences impacted all physicians, but rural physicians highlighted the importance of occupational risk factors in their patients. Greater distance to health care services reduced visit frequency and was a prominent barrier for rural physicians. Care coordination among health care providers was problematic for suburban and urban physicians. Patient resistance to medical care and inadequate access to resources and specialists were identified as barriers by some rural physicians. ConclusionsThe <b>rural,</b> <b>suburban,</b> or urban context impacts whether a physician will adhere to clinical preventive service guidelines. Efforts to increase guideline adherence should consider the barriers and facilitators unique to <b>rural,</b> <b>suburban,</b> or urban areas.

40|$|The most {{challenging}} processes {{to be investigated}} further which are occurring in residential areas, suburbs in the largest Belarusian cities have been determined and systematized in the paper. The paper considers modern processes of transformation and development of residential areas on the studied territories; ongoing changes in the typology of dwellings and inhabitant composition of the suburban zones; problems pertaining to infrastructure development of suburban territories; preservation and improvement of recreational and ecological functions of the <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> in the largest cities. The paper presents a hypothesis on the possibility to modernize an urbanized region while using digital technologies and it also provides architectural and artistic characteristics of the residential environment. The main research methods are the following: field surveys; analysis of statistical data, project and regulatory documentation. So it has been revealed {{that it is necessary}} to carry out a detailed study of inhabitant composition in the settlements in order to determine their actual requirements in schools, kindergartens, and other facilities of public services.
