5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|E
5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still {{teaching}} about vaquero equipment, methods, and history. She had a strong interest {{in the history of the}} spade bit horse in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex bit that can only be properly used on a highly trained horse handled by a skilled rider. In the vaquero tradition, its use represents the highest level of trust and communication between horse and rider. The process of training the spade bit horse takes five to seven years to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working horse and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of the horse is also a factor; to become a spade bit horse, the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> of a horse trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|E

25|$|Live Life Drive {{gave the}} Prevé 4 out of 5 stars, praising the <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling,</b> {{refinement}} and roominess of the Prevé, while pointing out several flaws {{which included the}} CVT powertrains, interior fit & finish, and the troubled Proton brand image. Autoworld.com.my shared similar impressions on the Prevé, where the authors declared it as Proton's best product to date, owing much to its <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> attributes, standard equipment and value for money appeal. The CVT powertrains and build quality were pointed out as its major let downs. Popular Malay language automobile news portal funtasticko.net echoed generally positive sentiments, in which the reviewers concluded that the Prevé symbolized {{the beginning of a}} 'new Proton' intent on shedding its negative brand image, on the domestic and global stages alike.|$|E

25|$|Redline {{bias-ply}} tires {{continued as}} standard equipment on the 1968 GTO, {{though they could}} be replaced by whitewall tires at no extra cost. A new option was radial tires for improved <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> However, very few were delivered with the radial tires because of manufacturing problems encountered by supplier B.F.

40|$|In {{response}} to popularity of ATVs in Arkansas and youth ATV accident rates, the Arkansas 4 -H program established an ATV safety training program in 2008. The program has educated 1, 500 youth in Arkansas about basic concepts of safe ATV operation in {{response to}} youth accident rates. The course covered proper equipment, laws, proper <b>riding,</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> techniques. The program has not been evaluated. The study was to evaluate participants’ knowledge levels prior to participation in the program and after receiving instruction and hands-on ATV operation training, and to determine if Standard Course and S-Course participants’ knowledge scores were different. The effectiveness of the program {{as a tool to}} teach participants basic concepts of safe ATV operation. The course covered proper equipment, laws, proper <b>riding,</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> techniques. The study also compared the results of two different versions of the ATV Safety program, the Standard Course and the S-Course in order to determine which course was most effective at teaching the concepts previously listed. ATV Safety Course participants who completed the training between December 2015 and April 2016 participated in this study. A significant difference was seen in test scores for both the Standard Course and S-Course, while no significant difference was found when Standard Course and S-Course participant scores were compared. The study found that participant ATV knowledge increased regardless of which version of the course was completed...|$|R

25|$|In 1983, Peugeot {{launched}} the successful Peugeot 205 supermini, which is largely credited for turning the company's fortunes around. The 205 was regularly the bestselling car in France, {{and was also}} very popular {{in other parts of}} Europe, including Britain, where sales regularly topped 50,000 a year by the late 1980s. It won plaudits for its styling, <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> It remained on sale in many markets until 1998, overlapping with the introduction of the 106 in 1991, and ceasing production at the launch of the 206, which also proved hugely popular across Europe.|$|E
25|$|Breaking {{down and}} testing {{competing}} cars, {{as well as}} listening to customer input played a large part {{in the development of}} the third-generation Taurus, just like it did during the development of the first generation. Many competing cars were broken down and extensively tested in order for the Taurus to be designed to be superior to them in terms of comfort, performance, and refinement. Most notably, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord were extensively tested, and the Taurus' suspension was designed to emulate these cars' <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> techniques. Customer input played a large part into the design of the third generation Taurus' interior.|$|E
25|$|In early 1992, an all new Zetec 16-valve {{engine was}} {{launched}} bringing improved driveability, while also marking {{the return of}} the XR3i which was available with two versions of the 1.8L Zetec engine. The 150PS (110kW) RS2000 also appeared in the autumn of 1991 with a 16v version of the Sierra's I4 2.0L engine and also improved <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> meaning that this version of the Escort finally delivered on the road. Specifications, however, were also higher than before. The Escort was now available with items such as power steering, electric windows, central locking, electronic antilock brakes, and air conditioning. Some of these options were even available on some of the entry-level models.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A design {{method of}} {{integrated}} control for suspension system and steering system is proposed based on vehicle <b>ride</b> comfort <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> stability. A car simulation model is built applying the software of MATLAB and ADAMS. The construction and {{characteristic of the}} integrated simulation model of the suspension system and steering system is illustrated in detail which uses fuzzy method and PID method. Using the simulation model, body vertical acceleration, roll angle and yaw angular velocity are measured in three status which include no control condition, the individually control for active suspension, and the integration control respectively. The simulation data show that the integrated control method synchronously ensures the <b>ride</b> comfort <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> stability...|$|R
50|$|Advantages of the DC 27 {{included}} a high interior with good headroom, a smooth <b>ride,</b> <b>and</b> stable <b>handling.</b> Disadvantages included {{the lack of}} access to the cab from the working area, fuel consumption of approximately 8.5 mpgimp, and an inadequate braking system.|$|R
25|$|The {{relative}} {{sliding movement}} of the leaves of a multi-leaf steel spring results in stiction-based hysteresis with respect to spring compression. This stiction reduces suspension compliance and can compromise both <b>ride</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> Lacking individual leaves, the mono-leaf spring avoids stiction.|$|R
25|$|Stung by the {{criticism}} of the original Mark V (which was still hugely popular despite motoring press criticism of its styling, <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling),</b> Ford facelifted the Escort and Orion in September 1992, giving the revised cars a new grille, bonnet and, in the Escort hatchback's case, a new rear end. A new 1.6L 16-valve 90bhp (66kW) Zetec engine was introduced, replacing the previous CVH. Fuel injection was now standard on all petrol models, and Ford introduced a four-wheel-drive variant of the RS2000, offering much improved handling over its front-wheel-drive cousins. A first for the Escort also saw the introduction of all disc brakes on all four wheels as standard on all RS2000 and XR3i models.|$|E
25|$|The Prevé {{has been}} met with {{critical}} acclaim in Thailand. Bangkok Post praised the pricing of the Prevé, where the author cited “In range-topping Premium form at 759,000 baht, {{not a single}} player in the Thai C-segment can match it for price.” Manager Daily regarded the Prevé as a large improvement over Proton's previous offerings in many aspects, including design and build quality. The author {{went so far as}} to liken the turbocharged Prevé CFE to a Lotus Evora. Motortrivia pointed out Proton's confidence in the Prevé, citing the 5-year warranty and affordable pricing compared to its Thai-assembled Japanese counterparts. Thanathep Thanesniratsai of popular HeadLight Magazine applauded the Prevé and claimed it was on par with cars from European manufacturers in the <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> aspect.|$|E
25|$|On its {{launch in}} 1972, the Peugeot 104 was {{offered as a}} compact four-door fastback. Although it had a short, sloping rear end that {{suggested}} a hatchback, there was originally a separate boot/trunk, as on a conventional saloon. Power was provided from a 954cc Douvrin engine called the PSA X engine, an all-aluminium alloy, chain driven overhead cam, with gearbox in the sump, sharing engine oil, which was jointly developed with Renault. This transmission-in-sump arrangement {{was similar to that}} pioneered by the British Motor Corporation in the Mini. It gave good levels of economy and refinement as well as having an impressive chassis which made <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> excellent. The engine was mounted leaning backwards, at a 72 degree angle.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Zora Arkus-Duntov {{and other}} GM {{engineers}} had become fascinated with mid and rear-engine designs. It {{was during the}} Corvair's development that Duntov took the mid/rear-engine layout to its limits in the CERV I concept. The Chevrolet Experimental Research Vehicle was a lightweight, open-wheel single-seat racer. A rear-engined Corvette was briefly considered during 1958–60, progressing {{as far as a}} full-scale mock-up designed around the Corvair's entire rear-mounted power package, including its complicated air-cooled flat-six {{as an alternative to the}} Corvette's usual water-cooled V-8. By the fall of 1959, elements of the Q-Corvette and the Sting Ray Special racer would be incorporated into experimental project XP-720, which was the design program that led directly to the production 1963 Corvette Sting Ray. The XP-720 sought to deliver improved passenger accommodation, more luggage space, and superior <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> over previous Corvettes.|$|E
2500|$|For 1978, the Hornet {{platform}} was redesigned with {{an adaptation}} of the new Gremlin front-end design and renamed AMC Concord.

5000|$|In 1979, Yamaha {{followed}} the growing trend of offering a [...] "factory custom" [...] {{version of the}} bike, called a [...] "Special" [...] by Yamaha. Pullback handlebars, a stepped seat, a smaller, fatter rear wheel, a smaller capacity tear-drop gas tank, fully adjustable suspension, and altered frame created a factory custom, forerunner of the modern cruiser. The XS Eleven Special sold well despite complaints about the poor ergonomics. [...] "What that translates to is a bike with an awkward riding position but generally excellent road manners. In fact, {{most of the things}} that irritated this staff in the way the bike <b>rode</b> <b>and</b> <b>handled</b> could be traced to the handlebar, which, although certainly as trendy as disco dancing, was not what the ergonomics doctor ordered for precise, comfortable control." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Heaney-Grier partnered with her diving trainers, Manny Puig and Mark Rackley (who {{was at the}} time also Heaney-Grier's boyfriend), filming {{underwater}} encounters with animals such as alligators and sharks.
