5000|$|The British {{royal family}} {{has a long history}} of bespoke limousines {{stretching}} back to Daimler models owned by King Edward VII. On state occasions, Queen Elizabeth II usually travels in one of two armoured Bentley State Limousines. Delivered in 2002 to commemorate the Queen's Golden Jubilee, these custom-built vehicles are based on the Bentley Arnage floorplan, with a twin-turbocharged 6.75 litre V8 engine that produces [...] and [...] of torque, giving a maximum speed of 130 mph. The state limousine is 3 ft longer than a standard Bentley Arnage, 10 in taller and 6 in wider. It is equipped with broad rear-hinged doors that open almost 90 degrees. The car also has opaque <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>panels</b> that can be removed to allow increased visibility when the occupant is attending a public event or installed for increased privacy when required.|$|R
25|$|The Nash Ambassador and Statesman {{continued}} with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other body <b>panels,</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> glass, dash <b>panels</b> and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy {{owing to the}} lighter unitized Nash body.|$|R
50|$|Car glass {{includes}} windscreens, {{side and}} <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> and glass <b>panel</b> roofs on a vehicle. Side windows {{can be either}} fixed or be raised and lowered by depressing a button (power window) or switch or using a hand-turned crank. The power moonroof, a transparent, retractable sunroof, may be considered {{as an extension of}} the power window concept. Some vehicles include sun blinds for rear and <b>rear</b> side <b>windows.</b> The window shield of a car is appropriate for safety and protection of debri in the road. It also comforts the driver as well. The majority of car glass is held in place by glass run channels, which also serve to contain any fragments of glass if the glass breaks.|$|R
50|$|Available {{features}} on 2000 models included a hidden radio antenna (integrated into the <b>rear</b> quarter <b>panel</b> <b>window</b> glass), Gentex auto dimming electrochromatic rear view mirrors, lane departure indicators on side view mirrors (before on the glass) and ultrasonic rear park assist /backup sensors. The lower front bumper valance and illuminated running boards were changed over to Arizona beige {{to complement the}} standard Arizona beige exterior body trim on Eddie Bauer models.|$|R
2500|$|By December 1974 the car {{lost the}} [...] "Fronte" [...] badging, but {{retained}} the Fronte name in marketing material. Also in 1974 (May), the emissions became cleaner {{to match the}} 50年 (1975) emissions rules, but power was down to 26PS. The basic [...] "E" [...] version was dropped. The first cosmetic change the 360 series Hatch underwent was a modification of the trunklid to accept the larger license plates (330 × 165mm) legislated for January 1, 1975. In export markets, the vehicle was also available with <b>rear</b> side <b>window</b> <b>panels.</b> for the 1976 model year another horsepower was lost, as emissions rules were gradually tightened, and the Hatch received a new grille, the taillights were {{held in place by}} two rather than three screws, and the C-pillar logo was altered. A more luxurious [...] "Custom" [...] model was also brought out for 1976. This had more comfortable (softer) suspension, lowering cargo capacity from [...] Production ended in May 1976.|$|R
2500|$|Ford {{imported}} all of {{its first}} generation Transit Connect models as passenger vehicles by including <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>rear</b> seats, and rear seatbelts. The vehicles are exported from Turkey on cargo ships owned by Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics (WWL), arrive in Baltimore, and are converted back into light trucks at WWL's Vehicle Services Americas Inc. facility by replacing <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> with metal <b>panels</b> and removing the rear seats and seatbelts. The removed parts are not shipped back to Turkey for reuse, but shredded and recycled in Ohio. The process exploits the loophole in the customs definition of a light truck: as cargo does not need seats with seat belts or <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> presence of those items automatically qualifies the vehicle as a passenger vehicle and exempts the vehicle from light truck status. The process costs Ford hundreds of dollars per van but saves thousands in taxes. Chrysler has announced it will introduce the Ram ProMaster City, an Americanised version of the Fiat Doblò, in 2015 [...] building the vehicle at the Tofaş plant in Turkey, importing only passenger configurations and subsequently converting cargo configurations.|$|R
50|$|Side {{windows were}} not {{existent}} in open cars, {{which may have}} detachable side screens, or manually or power-operated glass side windows as in a saloon or sedan. <b>Rear</b> <b>windows</b> have evolved similarly, with plastic <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> appearing {{as late as the}} first-generation Porsche Boxster. Contemporary convertibles and retractable hardtops feature heatable glass <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> to maximize visibility - though <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> often can compromise visibility by their size, as with the case of the very small <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and restricted visibility of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. Plastic windows can degrade, fade, yellow, and crack over time, diminishing visibility.|$|R

5000|$|A rare {{option for}} the Phantom was a <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> Monterey-Salinas Transit and King County Metro {{are the only two}} transit {{authorities}} known to have ordered Phantoms with a <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R

A more luxurious [...] "Custom" [...] model was also brought out for 1976. This had more comfortable (softer) suspension, lowering cargo capacity from 300 to 200 kg. Production ended in May 1976.Reflecting new Kei car rules, in July 1976 the length of the Hatch was extended to 3190 mm (wheelbase to 2100 mm), all ahead of the firewall. The new front and new large bumpers made what was an already odd-looking car even stranger. Now the Suzuki Fronte Hatch 55 (or 550), it received the three-cylinder 539 cc LJ50 engine, which was a de-smogged L50 engine with an extra cylinder tacked on: it was also known as the T5A/T5B in other applications. The new model code was SH10. The inside remained nearly unchanged and the only differences at the rear was a new, larger bumper, and the change to a single strut for the rear gate for increased access. Power remained 25 PS as per late 360 Hatches, but torque was up considerably. The lineup was again restricted to B, D, and T models, with the T receiving chromed rather than painted bumpers.|$|R
5000|$|They {{have also}} been {{extensively}} applied to <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> as well, where legislative measures have not banned such use. For instance in Sweden that is the normal place to put them and the bumper sticker is actually called [...] "bakrutedekal" [...] (<b>rear</b> <b>window</b> decal).|$|R
50|$|In 1970 a {{flow-through}} ventilation system, where vents {{were added}} towards {{the rear of}} the car (on the exterior under the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> on the 142 and 144 and as a grille next to the right side taillight of the 145) and electrically defrosted <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> were introduced. The split <b>rear</b> side <b>window</b> on the 145 became one piece which was no longer possible to open.|$|R
50|$|The Barracuda {{used the}} Valiant's 106 in {{wheelbase}} and the Valiant hood, headlamp bezels, windshield, vent <b>windows,</b> quarter <b>panels,</b> doors, A-pillar, and bumpers; {{the trunk and}} some of the glass was new. Utilizing the same hybrid design approach as Ford did turning its Falcon into the Mustang significantly reduced Plymouth's development and tooling cost and time for the new model. The greatest effort was put into creating its distinguishing 14.4 ft² (1.33 m²) <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> a collaboration between Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) and Chrysler designers that created the largest ever installed on a standard production car to that time.|$|R

50|$|The Ami {{was offered}} in saloon and break (estate) body styles over two generations, the Ami 6 and the Ami 8. The later Ami 8 {{fastback}} saloon featured a steeply raked <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> {{in contrast to}} the earlier reverse-raked <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> of the Ami 6 notchback.|$|R

50|$|In 1957, Mercury {{introduced}} the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, featuring a roofline with a retractable <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> From 1958 to 1960, the feature made its {{return on the}} Continental Mark-series line, with a reverse-slant <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> (on both hardtops and convertibles). For 1963, Mercury re{{introduced the}} feature as an option for the Monterey; to streamline production, elements of the window design were shared with Ford station wagons. From 1963 to 1966, the optional reverse-slant roofline with retracting <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was unique to Mercury, featured by no other American brand.|$|R
