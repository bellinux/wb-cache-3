The NBQC structure allows easy implementation {{of the concept of}} interleaved channel assignment (ICA), which can take full advantage of antenna directivity. With ICA, the NBQC system can enhance the system performance from several perspectives. First, the NBQC has better coverage performance than the current three-sector cellular architecture. Second, we demonstrate that in a typical radio environment, the NBQC system can achieve a <b>reuse</b> <b>cluster</b> size = 2 with the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) as high as 11 dB in 90 % of the cell area, which is a 3 – 5 -dB improvement over the existing cellular architectures. Third, as compared to the most advanced three-sector clover-leaf cell architecture with <b>reuse</b> <b>cluster</b> size = 3, the NBQC system with ICA can achieve <b>reuse</b> <b>cluster</b> size = 2 with very slight degradation in SIR performance, thereby still improving system capacity by about 40 % over a wide range of ninetieth percentile SIR requirements.

40|$|Abstract- Due to {{discrete}} <b>reuse</b> <b>cluster</b> sizes, disjoined and uniformed channel assignment, conventional tri-sectored cellular {{systems have}} not taken full advantage of antenna directivities. In this paper, we present a novel Channel Alternation and Rotation (CAR) scheme to coordinate channel assignment with antenna directivities. In CAR, cell layout is based on two-tier cell-reuse structure and each cell is allocated one extra channel set for channel alternations and rotations. The extra channel set gives network designer the flexibility to assign channels according to nearest front lobe interference avoidant strategy to enhance co-channel interference ratio (CII). CAR allows deployment of smaller, non-integer <b>reuse</b> <b>cluster</b> sizes based on CII requirements, thus increases frequency reuse efficiency. CAR reuse plans can increase channel capacity up to 31. 25 % while still maintain comparable CII margins.

40|$|Abstract — Enabling {{underlay}} direct Device-to-Device (D 2 D) communication mode {{in future}} cellular networks has good potential for spectrally-efficient and low-latency support of local media services. Recently, {{it has become}} evident that shrinking the reuse distance over which wireless resources are reused is a key enabler for achieving high spectral efficiency. Moreover, Interference Alignment (IA) based transmission can enhance the capacity of a wireless network by providing more degrees of freedom. In this work, we exploit clustering of D 2 D users, frequency <b>reuse</b> over <b>clusters</b> and then using IA to enhance the sum rate. Specifically, we show that in a D 2 D environment, {{it is possible to}} achieve significant gains in attainable rates by constructing clusters of D 2 D pairs and reuse the available radio resources over the clusters. Moreover, within a cluster, it is possible to further enhance the spectral efficiency by constructing small-sized groups of D 2 D pairs over which IA is applied to offer additional degrees of freedom. We show that resource <b>reuse</b> over the <b>clusters</b> offer overall rate increase proportional to the number of formed clusters. In addition, interference alignment offers up to 33 % increase in the overall rates in the high transmission power regimes compared to the normal Point-to-Point (P 2 P) communication.

50|$|Initiation of a nest {{begins with}} mud {{collection}} for the mud wall, entrance, pedicel, and first brood cell. This process {{can take up}} to four days. Therefore, all trips on the very first day of nest construction are devoted to mud collection. After the first brood cell is nearly complete, the female will begin to collect both mud and resin, which will be used to line the cell on the second day. After the cell is lined, almost no mud is collected on the third day. A female will spend almost three quarters of her time foraging for larval food collection, and the rest for resin collection. Once the brood cell is complete, oviposition will occur, the collar will be pushed in, and the cell will be covered with mud. The construction of additional cells follows a similar timeline, although there is less mud collection now that the mud wall and entrance have been built. It was noted by Cameron and Ramirez in a study done on the nest architecture of the E. meriana that less time was required to build successive cells after the first. Some nests were also observed to be <b>reused.</b> <b>Clusters</b> of older cells and decomposing females were found in some of the cells, covered with a layer of mud.|$|R

CAR relaxes the constraints assumed in conventional reuse plans to allow deployment of smaller, unconventional <b>reuse</b> <b>cluster</b> sizes based on C/I requirements, thus increases frequency reuse efficiency. In this paper, we present a new reuse plan in which 2 extra channel sets are allocated to each cell type and assigned according to CAR strategy. This reuse plan, referred to as 2 x(3 + 2), increases channel capacity by 20 % in comparison with conventional 4 x 3 reuse plan while still provides signals above the minimum acceptable C/I margin. 2 x(3 + 2) reuse plan is simple and can be implemented without costs...|$|E

Most network regulators require a dropping probability of equal to or less than 3 % and blocking probability of equal to or less than 5 %, to ensure QoS performance. However, a 7 [*]×[*] 7 parallelogram-shaped CMS with a 7 -cell <b>reuse</b> <b>cluster</b> is considered herein and three EMC constraints are simultaneously imposed under a high traffic load. Clearly, a larger channel reuse distance causes fewer channels to be reused throughout the service area. Section 4.2 investigated the effect of the three EMC constraints on the blocking probability and the dropping probability and presented that these three EMC constraints greatly worsen the performance of channel assignment methods. When the increase in traffic load exceeded 40 %, the blocking probability exceeded its recommended operating value of 5 %. Finally, high traffic loads were used to test the robustness of the proposed method. Under high traffic load, few resources are available and call requests tend to be blocked or dropped. The blocking probability and dropping probability tend to increase significantly when the traffic overload is very large owing to the exhaustion of system resources.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Since {{minimizing}} the co-channel {{interference in the}} conventional cellular technologies (AMPS, TDMA, and GSM) leads to better spectral efficiency, these technologies require a systematic frequency planning scheme. Generally, cells are grouped in a cluster of 7 (N= 7). Each <b>cluster</b> <b>reuses</b> the same frequency to maximize bandwidth efficiency. To further minimize the co-channel interference from adjacent clusters, sector antennas are used. A cell is typically sectorized into three sectors (K= 3) to achieve rapid frequency reuse. The deployment practices include using the N= 7, K= 3 or using the N= 4, K= 6 frequency reuse scheme. Because of {{the flexibility of the}} CDMA technology, restrictions of using the conventional clusterization andor sectorization schemes may not be warranted. In fact, to maximize the utilization of existing resources such as cell-site equipment, structures, real-estate, backhauls, etc., employing a non-standard sectorization scheme will yield a more optimum configuration and a more cost-effective solution. We address such non-standard sectorizations in this paper. I...|$|R

However, optimal performance is hard to achieve in practice as the efficiency of resource allocation could drop drastically due to the constraint from the frequency partitions formed by FFR. Since the radio resource is pre-partitioned for cell edge and center, fair resource allocation in a cell is also difficult to implement. Conventional frequency partition adjustment either has high complexity due to global optimization or suffer from heavy performance degradation due to absence of effective control on inter-cell interference (ICI). To solve this issue, we create models for analyzing geographical distribution of interference in multi-cell networks. Based on the observed non-uniform distributed ICI, we redefine the zones for fractional <b>reuse</b> and propose <b>clustering</b> based FFR, which offers resource allocation higher flexibility and better fairness with additional spatial dimension.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in wireless sensor networks for underwater applications. However, acoustic propagation imposes fundamental challenges on the communication system design, making these systems very different from their terrestrial (radio) counterparts. In particular, the underwater channel is characterized by low bandwidth and long propagation delay. In addition, the currently available underwater modems are halfduplex; that is, they cannot transmit and receive data concurrently. When the coverage area of a network is large, one may want to consider a cellular type of network architecture. In such an architecture, the area is divided into clusters, each containing a number of cells, and the available bandwidth is <b>reused</b> across <b>clusters.</b> Each cell has a base station through which the distributed nodes communicate, and communications between base stations are established through a separate link. Base stations can be mounted on buoys so as to offer an efficient radio link between distant cells, a global positioning system-positioned reference or a gateway to another network. Two types of communications are possible: from the base station to the nodes (downlink) or from the nodes to the base station (uplink). In cellular radio systems, different frequency bands are assigned to close cells. The total available bandwidth is divided among the number, N, of cells, which form a cluster. Assuming a 2 D geometry with hexagonal cells, the number of cells in a cluster that minimizes the interference is of the form:, where i and j are integers. The attenuation of signals with distance in the underwater environment is slower than in the radio environment, especially at the more commonly used low-carrier frequencies. Consequently, networks with short cell radii may require a large reuse number, which leads to inefficient system operation. However, this limitation can be overcome by means of a hybrid system design in which time scheduling accompanies frequency reuse...|$|R

We develop a novel low-complexity minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator by exploiting the sparsity of the received signal profile {{and the structure of}} the measurement matrix. It is shown that due to the banded Toeplitz/circulant structure of the measurement matrix, a channel impulse response, such as underwater acoustic channel impulse responses, can be partitioned into a number of orthogonal or approximately orthogonal clusters. The orthogonal clusters, the sparsity of the channel impulse response and the structure of the measurement matrix, all combined, result in a computationally superior realization of the MMSE channel estimator. The MMSE estimator calculations boil down to simpler in-cluster calculations that can be <b>reused</b> in different <b>clusters.</b> The reduction in computational complexity allows for a more accurate implementation of the MMSE estimator.

Different from device-centric content placement, cluster-centric placement focuses on placing content in each cluster such that the collective performance of all the devices in each cluster is optimized. Modeling {{the locations of the}} devices as a Poisson cluster process, we first show that the coverage-optimal performance can be achieved by placing content of interest for each cluster at the device closest to its cluster center. Since this restricts the frequency <b>reuse</b> within a <b>cluster</b> to one, and may not also be feasible due to storage/energy limitations, we also characterize the network performance in terms of coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE) for a general class of strategies in which the content of interest for the typical device is available at the kth closest device to the cluster center.

40|$|Abstract — Underwater {{acoustic}} {{communications systems}} are {{challenged by the}} characteristics of acoustic propagation through the underwater environment. There are {{a wide range of}} physical processes that impact underwater acoustic communications and the relative importance of these processes are different in different environments. Acoustic propagation is characterized by three major factors: time-varying multipath propagation, low speed of sound and attenuation that increases with signal frequency. Limited bandwidth in these systems is of paramount obstacles. To overcome this problem the idea of frequency reuse pattern seems to be useful. The key characteristic of a cellular network is the ability to re-use frequencies to increase both coverage and capacity. One element that determines frequency reuse is the reuse distance depending on the cell radius and the number of cells per cluster. Analysis of frequency <b>reuse</b> between adjacent <b>clusters</b> and optimal cell-radius selection criteria has been carried out recently. In other recent woks, the parameters of the cellular networks designing have been calculated based on a rough approximation of the attenuation and propagation model. In our work, after driving the ratio of signal to interference for underwater acoustic channels with more accuracy, the constraints for the cell radius are determined. One of the most important results of this contribution is that, for special parameters like bandwidth, it may be impossible to provide the required signal to interference ratio and bandwidth for the network users. Furthermore, in this paper, the number of supportable users, per-user bandwidth, and the user capacity for a cellular underwater network are determined...|$|R
