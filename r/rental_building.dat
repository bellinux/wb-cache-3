One <b>rental</b> <b>building</b> (Eastwood) has left New York State's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program, though current residents are still protected. Three other buildings are now working toward privatization, including the cooperative.|$|E
2500|$|During the 19th century, {{the town}} saw some changes.

In 1870 the town hall was moved from a <b>rental</b> <b>building</b> at the Hoge Rijndijk (...) to a new building at its present location at the Noordbuurtseweg.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{extends the}} {{protection}} to include dwellings {{with children and}} mobile home parks. [...] This is meant to protect renters and sellers from discriminating based on {{number of children in}} a family. [...] Currently the Fair Housing Act protects against discrimination of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. [...] The law applies to all types of housing, rental homes, apartments, condos and houses. [...] The only exception to the act is when an owner of a small <b>rental</b> <b>building</b> lives in the same building he lets. [...] Since he owns the building and also resides there, he can decide who lives there.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the last}} two Riverside South {{projects}} were being completed; these projects were the off-centered, 362-unit One West End condominium building, {{as well as a}} glass-and-masonry, 616-unit <b>rental</b> <b>building</b> at 21 West End Avenue. The former was slated to have 116 affordable units, while the latter would have 127 affordable units. These two buildings were being built in conjunction with a 700-seat public school and retail spaces, as well as a possible [...] "European-style food market and restaurant". The project's developers, Extell and Carlyle, were planning to sell the remaining three building lots to a Boston-based company, General Investment and Development Companies.

2500|$|Hell's Kitchen {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} upscale neighborhood of affluent young professionals as well as residents from the [...] "old days", with rents in the neighborhood having increased dramatically above the average in Manhattan. It has also acquired a large and diverse community as residents have moved north from Chelsea. Zoning has long restricted the extension of Midtown Manhattan's skyscraper development into Hell's Kitchen, at least north of 42nd Street. The David Childs- and Frank Williams-designed Worldwide Plaza established a beachhead when {{it was built in}} 1989 at the former Madison Square Garden site, a full city block between 49th and 50th Streets and between Eighth and Ninth Avenues that was exempt from special district zoning rules. This project led a real-estate building boom on Eighth Avenue, including the Hearst Tower at 56th Street and Eighth Avenue. An indication of how fast real estate prices rose in the neighborhood was a 2004 transaction involving the Howard Johnson's Motel at 52nd and Eighth Avenue. In June, Vikram Chatwal's Hampshire Hotel Group bought the motel and adjoining SIR (Studio Instrument <b>Rental)</b> <b>building</b> for $9 million. In August, they sold the property to Elad Properties for about $43 million. Elad, which formerly owned the Plaza Hotel, {{is in the process of}} building The Link, a luxury 44-story building.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{despite the}} {{increased}} population, the area still maintains {{a bit of}} small-town atmosphere, with relatively low house turnover. A real estate broker {{who grew up in}} the area said that in Windsor Terrace, [...] "everybody says hello" [...] to each other, and a real-estate feature in The New York Times stated that [...] "residents look out for one another at all hours of the day." [...] There is more on-street vehicle parking in Windsor Terrace than in nearby, more populous neighborhoods. The area's lack of traffic lights, due to low traffic volumes, make Windsor Terrace feel like a small town, as do well-maintained one-family houses, some with covered balconies and stained glass windows; other houses with [...] "bay windows, both rounded and faceted"; and yet other [...] "clapboard Italianate" [...] houses with multicolored cornices. There are a few apartment buildings, including Windsor Tower, a 10-story building that was downgraded from 22 stories after community objections; a 73-unit, seven-floor <b>rental</b> <b>building</b> that opened in 2015; and a condominium tower at 279 Prospect Park W, a former paint factory storage building that posed as a bank in the 1975 movie Dog Day Afternoon. The houses are of varying types, including some small one-story clapboard houses that have attics and date to the neighborhood's development; larger two-story houses with basements and some wood framing on the exterior; and attached brick townhouses with either flat facades with normal-sized windows or curved facades with bay windows, both with two floors and a basement.|$|E
