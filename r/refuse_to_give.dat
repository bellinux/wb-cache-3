25|$|Every city (without exception) had a Council and a Bench, the Council {{being the}} {{administrative}} branch and the Bench the judicial branch. A new Council {{was chosen by}} the old one whose term had expired. The Council was responsible for administration, law, privileges, security, finances, guild oversight, and the like. The Council chose the Mayor, and its members' decision was final—even the Starosta or Voivode could only listen to the Mayor's swearing-in and could not <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him his seal. The Council met daily in the larger cities, less often in smaller ones.|$|E

25|$|Shah Zaman {{requested}} that Raja Sansar Chand of Kangra <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> food or shelter to the Sikhs. This was agreed. Shah Zaman attacked Lahore and the Sikhs, surrounded {{as they were}} on all sides, had to fight a grim battle. The Afghans occupied Lahore in November 1798 and planned to attack Amritsar. Ranjit Singh collected his men and faced Shah's forces about eight kilometres from Amritsar. They were well-matched and the Afghans were forced to retire. They fled towards Lahore. Ranjit Singh pursued them and surrounded Lahore. Afghan supply lines were cut, crops were burnt and other provisions plundered so {{that they did not}} fall into Afghan's hands. Nizam-ud.din of Kasur attacked the Sikhs near Shahdara {{on the banks of the}} Ravi, but his forces were no match for the Sikhs. Here too, it was the Muslims who suffered the most. The retreating Afghans and Nizam-ud-din forces plundered the town, antagonising the local people.|$|E

500|$|One of the monarch's {{historic}} prerogatives was {{the dissolution}} of Parliament, which was [...] "perhaps the most important residual prerogative exercised personally by the sovereign, and represents the greatest potential for controversy." [...] This prerogative was normally exercised {{at the request of}} Parliament and the prime minister, either at his or her discretion or following a motion of no confidence. Constitutional theorists have had differing views as to whether a unilateral dissolution of Parliament would be possible today; Sir Ivor Jennings wrote that a dissolution involves [...] "the acquiescence of ministers", and as such the monarch could not dissolve Parliament without ministerial consent; [...] "if ministers <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> such advice, she can do no more than dismiss them". A. V. Dicey, however, believed that in certain extreme circumstances the monarch could dissolve Parliament single-handedly, on the condition that [...] "an occasion has arisen on which there is fair reason to suppose that the opinion of the House is not the opinion of the electors... A dissolution is allowable, or necessary, whenever the wishes of the legislature are, or may fairly be presumed to be, different from the wishes of the nation." ...|$|E
500|$|When Milian {{moved to}} Los Angeles, her only desire {{was to be}} an actress. She {{always wanted to be}} in the record business, but did not know how to obtain a {{recording}} contract. During this time, she was also a host for Disney Channel. After living in Los Angeles for six months, Milian moved into the same apartment complex as songwriter and producer Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins. Jerkins heard about Milian from a boy band he was working with and once he heard her sing, they began working together. For a year and a half, Milian went into a studio every day and worked with Jerkins, which is where she started meeting people in the record business. She began writing songs at the age of 17 because she needed a demo to help her obtain a recording contract. According to Milian, every time she recorded a song, the producer would <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> her the demo, or would write lyrics that she did not agree with.

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] was filmed in Buftea, Romania by Iulian Moga on 1 November 2010. The clip was uploaded onto YouTube on 14 November 2010. A behind-the-scenes video was previously aired in November 2010 by Romanian television Music Channel. Los 40 Principales cited the video for [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] {{as one of}} Stan's best clips ever. The video begins with scenes of police officers bringing a handcuffed Stan into a room of a police station to interrogate her along with two of her female friends. When {{she and her friends}} <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the police any information, they lock them in a jail cell. Stan coaxes and successfully seduces the guard, while her friends steal his police equipment before locking him inside the cell and escaping. The group enters a dressing room where they find police outfits and disguise themselves as officers. They locate the chief's office and hold the police chief and other workers at gun point while duct-taping their mouths and hands to the chief's desk. Stan and her friends exit the office and walk inconspicuously through the front lobby and out of the building. Cut scenes show Stan dancing in her cell or her with her friends in police uniform.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} upon going to Hanover, the King {{became involved in}} a dispute with his niece. [...] Victoria, who had a strained relationship with her mother, the Duchess of Kent, {{wanted to give the}} Duchess accommodation near her, for the sake of appearances—but not too near her. [...] To that end, she asked the King to give up his apartments at St. James's Palace in favour of the Duchess. The King, wishing to retain apartments in London in anticipation of frequent visits to England, and reluctant to give way in favour of a woman who had frequently fought with his brother, King William, declined, and Victoria angrily rented a house for her mother. At a time when the young Queen was trying to pay off her father's debts, she saw this as unnecessary expense. Her ill-feeling towards the King increased when he refused, and advised his two surviving brothers to similarly <b>refuse,</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> precedence to her intended spouse, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. [...] Ernest argued that the standing of the various royal families had been settled at the Congress of Vienna, and the King of Hanover should not have to yield to one whom he described as a [...] "paper Royal Highness". The act which naturalised Albert as a British subject left the question of his precedence unresolved.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} of Elizabeth I, Edward VI's successor after Mary I, was also inclined to severity. An Act passed in 1572 called for offenders to be burned through the ear {{for a first}} offence and that persistent beggars should be hanged. However, the Act also made the first clear distinction between the [...] "professional beggar" [...] and those unemployed {{through no fault of}} their own. Early in her reign, Elizabeth I also passed laws directly aimed at providing relief for the poor. For example, in 1563, her Act for the Relief of the Poor required all parish residents with ability to pay to contribute to poor collections. Those who “of his or their forward willful mind shall obstinately <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> weekly to the relief of the poor according to his or their abilities” could be bound over to justices of the peace and fined £10. Additionally, the 1572 Vagabonds Act further enabled Justices of the Peace to survey and register the impotent poor, determine how much money was required for their relief, then assess parish residents weekly for the appropriate amount. Her 1575 Poor Act required towns to create “a competent stock of wool, hemp, flax, iron and other stuff” for the poor to work on and houses of correction for those who refused to work where recalcitrant or careless workers could be forced to work and punished accordingly.|$|E

2500|$|The Lieberman clause, {{developed}} by Rabbi Saul Lieberman, does {{not deal with}} secular law, but instead inserts, {{at the time of}} marriage, a halakhic stipulation that the marriage is only valid on the condition that the man gives a get within 6 months of any secular court's divorce. [...] Were the man to <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a get, the marriage would be declared null retroactively—it would be as if the couple were never married from a Jewish legal perspective.|$|E
