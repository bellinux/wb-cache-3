Here we consider such systems in the coherent mesoscopic regime and generalize the proposal of a minimal spin ratchet model based on a non-interacting clean quantum wire with two transverse channels by including disorder and by self-consistently treating the charge redistribution in the nonlinear (adiabatic) ac-driving regime. Our Keldysh-Green function based quantum transport simulations show that the spin ratchet mechanism is robust and prevails for disordered, though non-diffusive, mesoscopic structures. Extending the two-channel to the multi-channel case does not increase the net ratchet spin current efficiency but, remarkably, yields a dc spin transmission increasing linearly with channel number.

We find that motors based on flashing ratchets present a low efficiency and an unavoidable entropy production. On the other hand, a certain class of motors based on adiabatically changing potentials, named <b>reversible</b> <b>ratchets,</b> exhibit a higher efficiency and the entropy production can be arbitrarily reduced. In the last years there has been an increasing interest in the so-called “ratchets ” or Brownian motors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These systems consist of Brownian particles moving in asymmetric potentials, such as the one depicted in fig. 1 (left), and subject to a source of non-equilibrium, like external fluctuations or temperature gradients. As a consequence of these two ingredients —asymmetric potentials and non-equilibrium—, a flow of particles can be induced. Most of the cited papers consider systems where the Brownian particles do not gain energy in a systematic way. Although these systems are called “Brownian or molecular motors”, they do not convert heat into work, nor induce any energy conversion.

40|$|We {{reveal the}} {{mechanism}} of subdiffusion which emerges in a straightforward, one dimensional classical nonequilibrium dynamics of a Brownian <b>ratchet</b> <b>driven</b> by both a time-periodic force and Gaussian white noise. In a tailored parameter set for which the deterministic counterpart is in a non-chaotic regime, subdiffusion is a long-living transient whose lifetime can be many, many orders of magnitude larger than characteristic time scales of the setup thus being amenable to experimental observations. As a reason for this subdiffusive behaviour in the coordinate space we identify thermal noise induced dynamical localization in the velocity (momentum) space. This novel idea is distinct from existing knowledge {{and has never been}} reported for any classical or quantum systems. It suggests reconsideration of generally accepted opinion that subdiffusion is due to road distributions or strong correlations which reflect disorder, trapping, viscoelasticity of the medium or geometrical constraints.

40|$|We {{show that}} ac driven skyrmions {{interacting}} with an asymmetric substrate provide a realization {{of a new}} class of ratchet system which we call a vector ratchet that arises due to the effect of the Magnus term on the skyrmion dynamics. In a vector ratchet, the dc motion induced by the ac drive can be described as a vector that can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the substrate asymmetry direction. Up to a full 360 ^∘ rotation is possible for varied ac amplitudes or skyrmion densities. In contrast to overdamped systems, in which ratchet motion is always parallel to the substrate asymmetry direction, vector ratchets allow the ratchet motion to be in any direction relative to the substrate asymmetry. It is also possible to obtain a reversal in the direction of rotation of the vector ratchet, permitting the creation of a <b>reversible</b> vector <b>ratchet.</b> We examine vector <b>ratchets</b> for ac <b>drives</b> applied parallel or perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction, and show that reverse ratchet motion can be produced by collective effects. No reversals occur for an isolated skyrmion on an asymmetric substrate. Since a vector ratchet can produce motion in any direction, it could represent a new method for controlling skyrmion motion for spintronic applications. Comment: 10 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|Molecular machines, which exist {{everywhere}} in the biological system [1], are composed {{of a group of}} molecules that execute specific tasks, such as pumping substances through cell membranes, carrying loads to travel between cells, and causing muscle contractions. Today it is possible to make and manipulate molecular machines in a laboratory [1, 2]. A theoretical model, like a thermal ratchet [3, 4], offers basic explanations to the microscopic mechanism of molecular machines. In particular, these models and real systems both show a certain ability to make particles move in a certain direction under the condition of intense thermal fluctuations. What we are interested in here is a special kind of molecular machine, the so-called stochastic pump. An obvious characteristic of this kind of molecular machine is its stochastic pumping effect, i. e. the rectified effect of classical stochastic currents when the system is under the influence of a time periodic driving force [1]. One can describe the driving effect of a system by the adjustment of external parameters, which in the paper are the adiabatic adjustment and the non-adiabatic adjustment. When the system is changed by the adiabatic adjustment, we require that the parameter difference be small and the process happen in a short time, then we let the system go back to equilibrium, and have the system stay in equilibrium much longer than its relaxation time. Parrondo has proved that within cyclic adiabatic adjustment, the energy imported to the system from the external world is almost zero, and because the system is in the equilibrium state almost all the time, entropy hardly change. He calls this system a <b>reversible</b> <b>ratchet</b> [6]. In this situation, our investigation is aimed at the design of Parrondo's (1998) in “Reversible ratchets as Brownian particles in an adiabatically changing periodic potential. ” We make some further calculations about the integrated particle current of a <b>reversible</b> <b>ratchet</b> by using such parameters as the width and height of the potential, and the area of the integrated path to find the conditions of the largest particle current. We have found that there are three different behaviors of the largest particle current when the potential height is changed, and there exist some symmetric structures. Under the condition of non-adiabatic adjustment, our investigation is aimed at the no-pumping theorem of Saar Rahav etc. (2008) brought up in “Directed Flow in Non-adiabatic Stochastic Pumps[1]. ” We have found that there are some special parameters that can cause the current to become zero within a cyclic circulation. We use the network model of V. Y. Chernyak & N. A. Sinit syn (2008) [7] and choose the number of state to be 2 or 3, and the existing probability of particle to be. Then the probability of jumping is dP, which is determined by the set of velocity probability current kij, which can be described as a matrix, and the master equation can be written as dP=KP. When every static state is under the condition of detailed balance[1], meaning that the transported probability of every two interactive states is the same under the condition of long-term equilibrium, what we concerned here is whether the integrated current of every interactive state is zero under a cyclic circulation. By adopting the Arrhenius form(ke-β△E) as the velocity probability, we calculate the integrated current of a cycle under two conditions: changing the potential well and keeping the potential barrier unchanged, and the other way around. The results show that the integrated current of a cycle in both conditions are zero, that is the no-pumping theorem brought up by Saar Rahav (2008) [1]. On the other hand, we consider the velocity probability as a constant or the form of kij=Aijsin 2 (φij+ωijt) orkij=C+Aijsin(φij+ωijt) ≧ 0 to calculate the integrated current under cyclic circulation, and we have found that there are some interesting results when the parameters are changed. By way of the two kinds of investigation, we hope that our results can be helpful for the design of a ratchet model. 在生物系統中到處存在著能執行特定任務的一群分子組合 [...] -分子機器[1]，它們可以是跨越細胞膜的唧筒或在細胞中攜帶負載或造成肌肉收縮。目前利用人工組成而且可操縱的分子機器已經是可行的[1, 2]。在理論模型上，例如熱棘輪[3, 4](thermal ratchet) ，就對分子機器運作的微觀機制提供了基本的理解。很特別的是這些模型與真實系統都顯示出，在面對激烈的熱擾動情況下，具有相當的能力使粒子產生有方向性的運動或流動。我們感興趣的是稱之為隨機唧筒(stochastic pump) 的分子機器。這類分子機器最顯著的特性就是隨機唧筒效應，意即在時間上作週期性的驅動下，具古典隨機流的整流作用[5, 6]。 針對系統的驅動可以用外在參數來進行，我們考慮絕熱及非絕熱兩種調制參數方式。所謂絕熱調制就是每次使系統產生變化時，為時間很短的突然改變且參數的變化量很小，然後讓系統回至平衡狀態，再讓系統停留在平衡態的時間遠大於其鬆弛時間。Parrondo 證明在一個循環的絕熱調制下，外界輸入系統的能量幾乎為零，而且系統幾乎隨時處於平衡狀態，也幾乎沒有熵的產生。這樣的棘輪稱之為可逆棘輪[7]。在這種絕熱的情形，我們主要針對Parrondo(1998) 在” <b>Reversible</b> <b>ratchets</b> as Brownian particles in an adiabatically changing periodic potential. ”一文中[7]有關可逆棘輪之積分粒子流的運動方式的設計[1, 7]作進一步的計算，希望在影響粒子流大小的參數中，如粒子所處的位能的寬度、高度或深度，積分路徑大小，分別計算及預測最大粒子流的參數選取。在本研究中，我們將一維空間分割成一段一段，每段作為一個單位，每單位再分為位能壘、位能井及沒有位能變化三段，作為週期性方形位能調制的對象，將位能作一定步驟順序的升高或降低的操作。文獻中Parrondo僅對位能壘、位能井的寬度以及積分路徑大小對積分流大小作簡單的描述。我們發現位能壘、位能井及沒有位能變化處的寬度均為 時，積分流最大，且不同寬度的最大積分流與位能壘、位能井大小具有第一、三象限與第二、四象限的對稱性，並且積分流的最大值在不同的位能壘/井寬度中是具有三段結構性的。 在非絕熱調制條件下，我們主要針對Saar Rahav等(2008) 在” Directed Flow in Nonadiabatic Stochastic Pumps. ”一文中[1]的”零汲取定理(no-pumping theorem) ” 作進一步的計算。在本研究中，我們找到一些特定參數，會導致在每一週期循環時粒子流為零。我們考慮V. Y. Chernyak & N. A. Sinitsyn (2008) [8]所稱的 N 個網路系統模型[9]，選用兩個或三個狀態為研究對象，當各狀態的粒子存在機率為 ，且其機率流速率 ，此每單位時間機率變遷 符合主方程式(master equation) 。我們探討各狀態在靜態狀態時符合細緻平衡(detailed balance) [1]，也就是若在很長時間以後的平衡狀態下，任兩個交互作用的狀態其機率變遷的速率相等，亦即探討所有狀態與狀態之間的機率流均為零時，其積分流在一週期性循環中是否為零。在採取Arrhenius form 即常見的 形式作為機率流速率，當位能井為常數，位能壘隨時間作週期性改變，或當位能壘為常數，位能井隨時間作週期性改變等兩種情況下運算，其積分流在一循環週期必為零，此即Saar Rahav(2008) [1]所稱的零汲取定理。我們並以機率流速率為常數或sin及cos含隨時間變化的週期函數，如Kij=Aijsin 2 (φij+ωijt) 或Kij=C+Aijsin(φij+ωijt) ≧ 0 形式，分別以機率流速率全為常數或兩狀態彼此的機率流速率相等、各狀態流出的機率流速率相等、各狀態流入的機率流速率相等的四種條件下作探討，結果發現機率流速率在前三項條件下，一週期循環積分流為零。但當在第四項條件下，其積分流受到相位的影響不一定為零。 在這兩種研究中發現我們對棘輪模型的設計可以對隨機唧筒的絕熱與非絕熱調制提供有效的參照。 1. 	緒論 1 1. 1 	簡介與背景 [...] 2 1. 2 	研究過程與研究目的 [...] 3 1. 3 	研究假設與限制 [...] 4 2. 理論基礎與文獻探討 5 2. 1 傳統式一般馬達與可逆棘輪對於能量之使用方式之不同………………. …. 5 2. 2 對熱的工作效率之探討……………………………………. ……… [...] ……… [...] . 5 2. 2. 1 外界作用者的熵沒有改變的作功效率的推導…………………. …. …… 5 2. 2. 2 等溫的布朗馬達效率的推導…………………………………… [...] …. … 6 2. 2. 3 棘輪的工作效率……………………………………………………… [...] . 7 2. 3 ”布朗粒子在絕熱系統一維地週期性位能改變其積分流大小”文獻之探討… 9 2. 4 ”零汲取定理” (no-pumping theorem) 文獻之探討………………… [...] . …… [...] 11 2. 4. 1 兩個狀態的粒子流情況………………………………………………… 13 2. 4. 2 三個狀態的粒子流情況………………………… [...] …………………… [...] 16 3. 研究方法 22 3. 1 布朗粒子在絕熱系統一維地週期性位能改變其積分流大小之探討……… 22 3. 2 零汲取定理之探討…………………………………………………………… 24 3. 2. 1 兩個狀態的粒子流情況…………………………………………………. 24 3. 2. 2 三個狀態的粒子流情況……………………………………………… [...] . 26 4. 結果與討論 28 4. 1 探討布朗粒子在絕熱系統一維地週期性位能改變其積分流大小之結果… 28 4. 2 探討零汲取定理之結果………………………………… [...] ………………… [...] 39 5. 結論與建議 57 5. 1 關於絕熱系統一維地循環式週期性位能改變產生布朗粒子積分流大小所作探討的結論與建議………………………………………………………. 57 5. 2 關於零汲取定理所作探討的結論與建議…………………………………… 58 5. 2. 1 機率流速率符合Arrhenius form……………………………………… [...] 59 5. 2. 2 機率流速率以Sin 或 Cos 的 時間 之線性函數………………… 59 參考文獻 61 附錄A…………………………………………………………………………………. 63 附錄B…………………………………………………………………………………. 65 附錄C………………………………………………………………………………… [...] 7...|$|R

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} organelle (plastid) originated via primary endosymbiosis {{in which}} a phagotrophic protist captured and harnessed a cyanobacterium. The plastid was inherited by the common ancestor of the red, green (including land plants), and glaucophyte algae (together, the Plantae). Despite the critical importance of primary plastid endosymbiosis, its ancient derivation has left behind very few "footprints" of early key events in organelle genesis. To gain insights into this process, we conducted an in-depth phylogenomic analysis of genomic data (nuclear proteins) from 17 Plantae species to identify genes of a surprising provenance in these taxa, Chlamydiae bacteria. Previous studies show that Chlamydiae contributed many genes (at least 21 in one study) to Plantae that primarily have plastid functions and were postulated to have played {{a fundamental role in}} organelle evolution. Using our comprehensive approach, we identify at least 55 Chlamydiae-derived genes in algae and plants, of which 67 % (37 / 55) are putatively plastid targeted and at least 3 have mitochondrial functions. The remainder of the proteins does not contain a bioinformatically predicted organelle import signal although one has an N-terminal extension in comparison to the Chlamydiae homolog. Our data suggest that environmental Chlamydiae were significant contributors to early Plantae genomes that extend beyond plastid metabolism. The chlamydial gene distribution and protein tree topologies provide evidence for both endosymbiotic gene transfer and a horizontal gene transfer <b>ratchet</b> <b>driven</b> by recurrent endoparasitism as explanations for gene origin. Our findings paint a more complex picture of gene origin than can easily be explained by endosymbiotic gene transfer from an organelle-like point source.

40|$|We {{investigate}} anticipated synchronization {{between two}} periodically driven deterministic, dissipative inertia ratchets that {{are able to}} exhibit directed transport with a finite velocity. The two ratchets interact through an unidirectional delay coupling: one is acting as a master system while the other one represents the slave system. Each of the two dissipative deterministic <b>ratchets</b> is <b>driven</b> externally by a common periodic force. The delay coupling involves two parameters: the coupling strength and the (positive-valued) delay time. We study the synchronization features for the unbounded, current carrying trajectories of the master and the slave, respectively, for four different strengths of the driving amplitude. These in turn characterize differing phase space dynamics of the transporting ratchet dynamics: regular, intermittent and a chaotic transport regime. We find that the slave ratchet can respond {{in exactly the same way}} as the master will respond in the future, thereby anticipating the nonlinear directed transport...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in biochemistry is how molecular machines convert chemical potential energy into mechanical work. Here, {{this problem is}} addressed {{in terms of how}} a proton gradient (ΔpH) drives anthrax toxin transmembrane protein translocation with a given directionality. One model to explain this phenomenon is a charge-state Brownian ratchet, wherein movement is biased by asymmetries across the membrane. Acidic residues in the substrate are protonated on the lower pH starting side, thus allowing them to pass through the cation-selective protective antigen (PA) channel. Movement can occur in either direction according to Brownian motion, but acidic residues that reach the higher pH of the destination are deprotonated, preventing retrotranslocation and resolving movement in one direction. This model is probed through the use of planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology to analyze the charge requirements of the model substrate LF N, the binding domain of the natural substrate lethal factor. Acidic residues are necessary and sufficient for ΔpH-driven translocation provided the starting side pH is low enough to sufficiently protonate the residues. Their position in the sequence, just before LF N 's folded domain, {{plays a key role in}} substrate unfolding. Basic charges are important for initiation into the channel and to chaperone deprotonated acidic residues during translocation. 	Further work by Sarah Wynia-Smith confirms the importance of acidic residues just before LF N 's folded domain and points to the existence of electrostatic translocation barriers in the PA channel. I identify key residues in the upper portion of the channel's β barrel that contribute to its cation selectivity. These residues also prove to play a significant role in substrate initiation and translocation, supporting the role for a charge gate in the channel that prevents retrotranslocation. Finally, secondary structure of the translocating substrate is analyzed. LF N translocates in a compact helical state nucleated by the channel's α clamp, a nonspecific helix-binding site recently identified by Geoffrey Feld. α clamp-induced helix formation lowers a previously identified but uncharacterized translocation barrier, and substrates that cannot form helices cannot translocate. This suggests a mechanism wherein helix melting, coupled to the electrostatic <b>ratchet,</b> <b>drives</b> translocation-coupled substrate unfolding...|$|R
