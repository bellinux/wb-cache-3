40|$|AbstractWindow glass {{breakage}} in {{a building}} fire could change the oxygen supply because of the entrance of fresh air. To investigate the break behavior of window glass under various <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> temperature <b>rise,</b> a finite element method was employed to solve the linear dynamic response equilibrium of the system. The Coulomb-Mohr criterion and SIFs based mixed-mode criterion were employed to predict the crack initiation and growth, respectively. A total <b>of</b> 12 <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> temperature <b>rise</b> were designed from 150 K/s to 0. 75 K/s for a centre- heated and edges-shaded glass pane. The maximum thermal stresses are located at the shaded part between the hot and cool glass layer, {{which is where the}} cracking is initiated. Under a rapid <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> temperature <b>rise,</b> a smaller temperature rise could result in a bigger dynamic stress which is then followed by crack initiation. Under a slower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> temperature <b>rise,</b> the dynamic effect becomes weaker and the thermal stress can be evaluated using the static method...|$|R
25|$|Recently, it {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} that late Holocene, 3,000 calendar years ago to present, sea level was nearly stable prior to an acceleration of <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> that is variously dated between 1850 and 1900 AD. Late Holocene rates of sea level rise have been estimated using evidence from archaeological sites and late Holocene tidal marsh sediments, combined with tide gauge and satellite records and geophysical modeling.

These methods in combination suggest a mean eustatic component of 0.07mm/yr for the last 2000 years.|$|E
2500|$|For a given load, sizing of a {{smoothing}} capacitor is a tradeoff between reducing ripple voltage and increasing ripple current. The peak current is {{set by the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> of the supply voltage on the rising edge of the incoming sine-wave, reduced by {{the resistance of the}} transformer windings. [...] High ripple currents increase I2R losses (in the form of heat) in the capacitor, rectifier and transformer windings, and may exceed the ampacity of the components or VA rating of the transformer. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers specify the maximum capacitance of the input capacitor, and SS diode rectifiers also have current limitations. [...] Capacitors for this application need low ESR, or ripple current may overheat them. [...] To limit ripple voltage to a specified value the required capacitor size is proportional to the load current and inversely proportional to the supply frequency and the number of output peaks of the rectifier per input cycle. Full-wave rectified output requires a smaller capacitor because it is double the frequency of half-wave rectified output. [...] To reduce ripple to a satisfactory limit with just a single capacitor would often require a capacitor that's infeasibly large.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} of variable-density groundwater flow and dispersive solute transport {{was used to}} predict the extent, rate, and lag time of saltwater intrusion in response to various sea-level rise scenarios.

Skerry (1997) suggests that bone adaptation is controlled especially by loads that cause a change in habitual strain magnitude.

30|$|Since a fault created wave attenuates when {{travelling}} {{through a}} boundary inductor [12], {{the side of}} the fault with respect to boundary inductor can be easily and reliably identified if the magnitudes of disturbance at two sides are compared. A number of advantages are apparent in this method when compared with aforementioned methods of fault direction identification. As the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change of voltage (ROCOV) based fault detection methods [9, 11] applied for detection of transmission line and bus faults demands both line side voltage and bus side voltages, no additional sensors are necessary. Fault directions can be readily identified without using costly high bandwidth CTs that needed to measure fast current transients. Furthermore, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> dropping of voltages during DC side faults is much faster than the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> <b>of</b> fault currents: this is because the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> <b>of</b> current is approximately equals to the time integral of voltage variation. Therefore, a voltage based directional element can detect the direction of a fault promptly when a travelling wave reaches the terminal. Rapid discharge of filter and cable capacitance are dominant during the early phase rising fault current [20]. Since the maximum/steady state fault currents for short circuit faults are likely to be much higher than the circuit breaker capabilities [21], a fault must be detected and the DC circuit breakers (DCCBs) must be opened before the fault current rises above the breaker’s maximum interruption current. This aspect has not been tested in the fault detection schemes such as the one presented in [12]. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change of voltage based HVDC grid protection scheme presented in [9] can face difficulties during high resistance faults.|$|R

40|$|Reconstructions of Holocene {{relative}} {{sea level}} (RSL) have valuable applications {{in a number}} of topics within the Earth sciences, including calibrating and constraining geophysical models of Earth’s rheology and glacial isostatic adjustment.
