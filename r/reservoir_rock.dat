25|$|Dolomite {{is used as}} an {{ornamental}} stone, {{a concrete}} aggregate, {{and a source of}} magnesium oxide, {{as well as in the}} Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum <b>reservoir</b> <b>rock,</b> and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. Where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly, dolomite is sometimes used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel. Large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass.|$|E
25|$|Three {{conditions}} must {{be present}} for oil reservoirs to form: a source rock rich in hydrocarbon material buried deep enough for subterranean heat {{to cook it}} into oil, a porous and permeable <b>reservoir</b> <b>rock</b> for it to accumulate in, and a cap rock (seal) or other mechanism that prevents it from escaping to the surface. Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake {{with a layer of}} water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as reservoirs) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an oil field forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} part of {{this study}} focused on possible changes of the permeability of <b>reservoir</b> <b>rocks.</b> A strong decrease of the permeability of the present <b>reservoir</b> <b>rocks</b> due to barite precipitation was observed in most experimental runs and different stages of pore clogging due to the barite precipitation were identified in the samples and visualized via SEM. This is of special importance for the operators of geothermal power plants, since the permeability of <b>reservoir</b> <b>rocks</b> is decisive for the profitability of a geothermal power plant. If the permeability at a geothermal site decreases, cost-intensive compensation measures have to be initiated.|$|R

2500|$|Determining which {{fracking}} {{technique is}} appropriate for well productivity depends largely on {{the properties of the}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>rock</b> from which to extract oil or gas. [...] If the rock is characterized by low-permeability — which refers to its ability to let substances, i.e. gas, pass through it, then the rock may be considered a source of tight gas. [...] Fracking for shale gas, which is currently also known as a source of unconventional gas, involves drilling a borehole vertically until it reaches a lateral shale rock formation, at which point the drill turns to follow the rock for hundreds or thousands of feet horizontally. [...] In contrast, conventional oil and gas sources are characterized by higher rock permeability, which naturally enables the flow of oil or gas into the wellbore with less intensive hydraulic fracturing techniques than the production of tight gas has required. The decades in development of drilling technology for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production has not only improved access to natural gas in low-permeability reservoir rocks, but also posed significant adverse impacts on environmental and public health.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier {{transform}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} together with multivariate statistical regression {{was used to}} produce calibrations between spectra of standard mineral mixtures and gas shale <b>reservoir</b> <b>rocks.</b> A Classical Least Square (CLS) model was developed from the attenuated spectra of mixtures of five mineral standards chosen to represent the most frequently encountered minerals in shale-type <b>reservoir</b> <b>rocks</b> namely: quartz, illite/smectite (30 : 70), kaolinite, calcite and dolomite. The CLS model developed was able to quantify the mineral components of independent mixtures with an absolute error between 1 to 3 wt % for all the pure minerals in the mixtures. Samples from a suite of shale <b>reservoir</b> <b>rocks</b> were analysed using standard Quantitative X-Ray Diffraction (QXRD) and with FTIR. Unknown mineral concentrations in the samples were then predicted using spectra and the calibration equations. Good correlations were achieved between the QXRD and ATR-CLS predicted concentrations (r 2 > 0. 8), with average absolute error of between 1 to 6 wt%. This provides evidence that attenuated FTIR is a promising method for rapid and accurate determination of minerals in <b>reservoir</b> <b>rocks</b> for building higher resolution data without additional time consuming and expensive traditional analyses...|$|R
