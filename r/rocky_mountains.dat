5|$|Denver {{lies within}} the semi-arid, {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification BSk). It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest {{amount of precipitation}} spread throughout the year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, {{at the foot of}} the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountains,</b> Denver, like all cities along the eastern edge of the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountains,</b> is subject to sudden changes in weather. Contrary to the popular belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the city can actually expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly cloudy days, and 120 cloudy days each year.|$|E

5|$|Marcy Cottrell Houle wrote Wings for My Flight in {{the several}} decades {{following}} a major {{decline in the}} peregrine falcon population, which occurred between 1950 and 1970. During the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated 1000 breeding pairs of peregrine falcons inhabited the western United States and Mexico, coupled with 500 pairs in the eastern U.S. By the 1970s, no peregrine falcons were discovered east of the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountains,</b> and in the west, peregrine falcon populations had declined by 80 to 90 percent. By 1975, {{the year in which}} the events of Wings for My Flight take place, only 324 pairs of peregrine falcons were known to reside in North America, with only seven pairs in the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountains</b> region, and one at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in southwestern Colorado.|$|E
5|$|The Laramide orogeny {{affected}} all {{of western}} North America {{by helping to}} build the American cordillera. The Kaibab Uplift, Monument Upwarp, the Uinta Mountains, San Rafael Swell, and the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountains</b> were uplifted, at least in part, by the Laramide orogeny. This major mountain-building event started {{near the end of}} the Mesozoic, around 75million years ago, and continued into the Eocene period of the Cenozoic. It was caused by subduction off the western coast of North America. Major faults that trend north–south and cross the canyon area were reactivated by this uplift. Many of these faults are Precambrian in age and are still active today. Streams draining the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Mountains</b> in early Miocene time terminated in landlocked basins in Utah, Arizona and Nevada but there is no evidence for a major river.|$|E
