This is important because many of the ion channels in the membrane of a neuron are voltage-gated ion channels, which open only when the membrane voltage is within a certain <b>range.</b> <b>Voltage</b> clamp measurements of current are made possible by the near-simultaneous digital subtraction of transient capacitive currents that pass as the recording electrode and cell membrane are charged to alter the cell's potential.|$|E

40|$|This work delineates the {{mechanism}} by which directional nanowire growth occurs in the directed electrochemical nanowire assembly (DENA) technique for growing nanowires on micro-electrode arrays. Indium, polythiophene, and polypyrrole nanowires are the subjects of this study. This technique allows the user to specify the growth path {{without the use of}} a mechanical template. Nanowire growth from a user-selected electrode to within ± 3 μm of the straight line path to a second electrode lying within a ∼ 140 ◦ angular range and a ∼ 100 μm radius of the selected electrode is demonstrated. Theory for one-dimensional electrochemical diffusion in the inter-electrode region reveals that screening of the applied voltage is incomplete, allowing a long <b>range</b> <b>voltage</b> component to extend from the biased to the grounded electrode. Numerical analysis of two-dimensional multi-electrode arrays shows that a linear ridge of electric field maxima bridges the gap between selected electrodes but decays in all other directions. The presence of this anisotropic, long <b>range</b> <b>voltage</b> defines the wire growth path and suppresses the inherent tip splitting tendency of amorphous polymeric materials. This technology allows polythiophene and polypyrrole to be grown as wires rather than fractal aggregates or films, establishing DENA as an on-chip approach to both crystalline metallic and amorphous polymeric nanowire growth. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the {{physiology}} of neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using new techniques for in situ patch-clamp recording in C. elegans, we analyzed the electrical properties of an identified sensory neuron (ASER) across four developmental stages and 42 unidentified neurons at one stage. We find that ASER is nearly isopotential and fails to generate classical Na+ action potentials. Rather, ASER displays a high sensitivity to input currents coupled to a depolarization-dependent reduction in sensitivity that may endow ASER with a wide dynamic <b>range.</b> <b>Voltage</b> clamp revealed depolarization-activated K+ and Ca 2 + currents that contribute to high sensitivity near the zero-current potential. The depolarization-dependent reduction in sensitivity can be attributed to activation of K+ current at voltages where it dominates the net membrane current. The voltage dependence of membrane current was similar in all neurons examined, suggesting that C. elegans neurons share a common mechanism of sensitivity and dynamic range...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A new wide locking range injection-locked fre-quency divider (ILFD) using a {{standard}} 0. 18 - m CMOS process is presented. The ILFD {{is based on}} a differential voltage con-trolled oscillator (VCO) with two embedded injection metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) for coupling external signal to the resonators. The new VCO is composed of two single-ended VCOs coupled with cross-coupled MOSFETs and a transformer. Measurement results show that at the supply voltage of 1. 5 V, the divider’s free-running frequency is tunable from 5. 85 to 6. 17 GHz, and at the incident power of 0 dBm the locking range is about 7. 1 GHz (65. 4 %), from the incident frequency 7. 3 to 14. 4 GHz.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{sensitive}} loads in distribution networks is increasing significantly {{with the passing}} of time. It is essential to keep the voltage of these loads in normal <b>range.</b> <b>Voltage</b> sag mainly occurs due to power system faults that should be lim-ited. Formerly reconfiguration and distributed generation (DG) resources placement were studied separately to improve the voltage sag caused by faults; however, there are many practical limits in the use of each method individually. The main task {{of this paper is to}} use reconfiguration and DG resources placement simultaneously to improve voltage sag index which enables us to overcome these limitations. The number of times the voltage of sensitive loads decreases to the critical volt-age is used as an index for performance evaluation. To minimize this index, binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm is used. The efficiency of the proposed method is proved through simulation results and their comparison with previously-performed methods. 1...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} study of atmospheric-pressure rare gas plasma propagation in a high-aspect-ratio capillary is reported. The plasma is generated with a plasma gun device based on a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor powered by either nanosecond or microsecond rise-time high-voltage pulses at single-shot to multi-kHz frequencies. The influence of the voltage waveform, pulse polarity, pulse repetition rate and capillary material have been studied using nanosecond intensified charge-coupled device imaging and plasma-front velocity measurements. The evolution of the plasma appearance during its propagation {{and the study of}} the role of the different experimental parameters lead us to suggest a new denomination of pulsed atmospheric-pressure plasma streams to describe all the plasma features, including the previously so-called plasma bullet. The unique properties of such non-thermal plasma launching in capillaries, far from the primary DBD plasma, are associated with a fast ionization wave travelling with velocity in the 107 - 108 cm s− 1 <b>range.</b> <b>Voltage</b> pulse tailoring is shown to allow for a significant improvement of such plasma delivery.

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, an {{improved}} topology of Buck type AC chopper voltage regulator and its control strategy are proposed. This converter only using two power switches is low cost, easy implemented and the phase synchronized circuit is not needed. The current path {{is provided in}} dead-time period by using simple snubber circuit. The over-voltage protection varistor is also applied to absorb the voltage spikes which may destroy the power switches. The voltage spikes in dead-time mode commutation are greatly reduced and the power switches are protected. Furthermore, the feedforward and feedback control strategy is proposed to suppress fluctuations and eliminate the harmonic components caused by power quality problems of the input voltage. The proposed converter could realize wide <b>range</b> <b>voltage</b> regulation with high power transfer efficiency and low total harmonic distortion. The steady-state equivalent circuit and the input power factor are derived through theoretical analysis. The output filter design method is also presented.

40|$|Electrostatically {{controlled}} graphene p-n junctions are devices {{built on}} single-layer graphene sheets whose in-to-out resistance can be dynamically tuned through external voltage potentials.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a wide <b>range,</b> <b>voltage</b> controlled-current source circuit that is optimized {{to compensate for}} both process and temperature variations. Compensation for process variations is realized by cancellation of the threshold voltage variations. Temperature compensation is applied {{by the use of}} a poly resistor. Ninety samples from 3 different chips of the same wafer run were measured, and for the nominal value of 25 nA, current sources have a standard deviation of 1. 22 % (4. 8 x improvement over an uncompensated current reference). The simulated standard deviation is 8 %, resulting a simulated improvement factor of 8 x, when samples from different wafer runs are to be measured. Measured temperature drift is 250 ppm/degrees C for a temperature range of 0 - 80 degrees C. For the mentioned performance, the circuit consists of only 7 components occupying an area of 64 mu m x 91 mu m, using AMS 0. 35 mu m, 5 V CMOS process technology. The new current source is used to mimic the behavior of an infrared detector, which creates current in the range of 1 - 50 nA. A modified version of proposed current source is also designed with no off-chip bias voltages, and has a temperature coefficient of 57 ppm/degrees C for 9 nA with an acceptable process compensation...|$|E
