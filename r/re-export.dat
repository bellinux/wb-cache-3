5|$|Hong Kong is the world's {{eleventh}} largest trading entity, {{with the}} total value of imports and exports exceeding its gross domestic product. It is the world's largest <b>re-export</b> centre. Much of Hong Kong's exports consist of re-exports, which are products made outside of the territory, especially in mainland China, and distributed via Hong Kong. Its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world's second busiest container port and the world's busiest airport for international cargo. Even before the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong had established extensive trade and investment ties with the mainland, which now enable it to serve as a point of entry for investment flowing into the mainland. At the end of 2007, there were 3.46million people employed full-time, with the unemployment rate averaging 4.1% for the fourth straight year of decline. Hong Kong's economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounts for over 90% of its GDP, while industry constitutes 9%. Inflation was at 2.5% in 2007. Hong Kong's largest export markets are mainland China, the United States, and Japan.|$|E

In 2008, the PAF was reportedly not fully satisfied with the RD-93 engine {{and that it would}} only power the first 50 aircraft; it was alleged that arrangements for a new engine, reportedly the Snecma M53-P2, may have been made. Mikhail Pogosyan, head of the MiG and Sukhoi design bureaus, recommended the Russian defence export agency Rosoboronexport block RD-92 engine sales to China to prevent export competition from the JF-17 against the MiG-29. At the 2010 Farnborough Airshow, the JF-17 was displayed internationally for the first time; aerial displays at the show were intended but were cancelled due to a late attendance decision as well as license and insurance costs. According to a Rosoboronexport official at the Airshow China 2010, held on November 16–21, 2005 in Zhuhai, China, Russia and China had signed a contract worth $238 million for 100 RD-93 engines with options for another 400 engines developed for the FC-1.|$|E
40|$|Since the mid eighties, <b>re-exports</b> in the Netherlands {{has been}} booming, with the {{exception}} of a short interruption in 2001 and 2002. This research shows that a relatively strong growth of <b>re-exports</b> is not just a Dutch phenomenon, but that there is an international trend going on. <b>Re-exported</b> products are at least doubly counted in world trade figures. This international <b>re-exports</b> trend contributes to the fact that world trade volume is growing faster than the volume of world export production. Besides, there are some serious implications for the indicators of countries' exports performances. If one doesn't take account of the implications of the international <b>re-exports</b> trend, the relevant export market growth for Dutch manufactures as well as the loss of market share of Dutch industrialists are overestimated. ...|$|R

At {{least part of}} the increase in production is because of new mines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been observed, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent <b>re-export</b> of Congolese coltan. In addition to the well-publicised involvement in this trade of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the coltan <b>re-export</b> is that international dealers are under pressure not to buy from the DRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC coltan to be re-exported as Rwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold and diamonds from the DRC.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Data {{representing}} transshipment or <b>re-exports</b> {{are almost}} always excluded from analytical portrayals of international trade, yet transshipment is potentially an important phenomenon in understanding a number of economic questions, and is increasing in importance. Rapid technological change {{in areas such as}} containerization and hub-and-spoke routing has promoted the practice of transshipment. While there are significant gaps in the data, the share of <b>re-exports</b> in global exports has undoubtedly increased rapidly, from perhaps 1 in 20 in the mid- 1980 s to perhaps 1 in 6 today. Econometric analysis of U. S. domestic exports and foreign exports (<b>re-exports)</b> over pairs of U. S. ports and destinations suggests that <b>re-exports</b> are significantly more sensitive than domestic exports to factors influencing transaction costs, including distance, containerization, price-fixing liner agreements, and port efficiency and restrictive port policies in the importing country...|$|R

In the 1970s and 1980s, these organizations constituted an important economic link between North Korea and Japan. The Chongryon-affiliated companies monitored the Tokyo Stock Exchange {{to enable the}} DPRK to sell its non-ferrous metals and other mineral products at the most advantageous prices, and purchased inexpensive Japanese consumer goods for <b>re-export</b> to the Comecon countries. Chongryon supporters are thought to control {{as much as one}} third of the pachinko industry in Japan. An important function of these enterprises is earning hard currency to be remitted to Pyongyang. These remittances have been estimated at between $600 million and $1.9 billion each year but are probably much lower. Chongryong announced plans on March 17, 2010 to open three restaurants in Pyongyang; each restaurant will be managed by the main headquarter in Tokyo, the Kantō regional chapter, and the Kinki-Tōkai regional chapter.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1980s until 2011, {{domestic}} ethanol producers {{were protected}} by a 54-cent per gallon import tariff, mainly intended to curb Brazilian sugarcane ethanol imports. Beginning in 2004 blenders of transportation fuel received a tax credit for each gallon of ethanol they mix with gasoline.

[...] Several countries in the Caribbean Basin imported and reprocessed Brazilian ethanol, usually converting hydrated ethanol into anhydrous ethanol, for <b>re-export</b> to the United States.

40|$|China's {{trade has}} three features: high {{incidence}} of <b>re-exports</b> through Hong Kong, high degree of trade related to foreign investment, and large amount of `illegal' trade. <b>Re-exports</b> occur when imports to Hong Kong are consigned to a buyer in Hong Kong, who adds a markup, and exports the goods elsewhere without fundamentally changing the goods. Using U. S. data and accounting for <b>re-exports,</b> the U. S. -China trade balance has to be lowered by 35 percent. Foreign investments in China accounted for 45 percent of China's exports.

30|$|The {{increase}} in <b>re-exports</b> {{is likely to}} be related to several of the main drivers of the growth in trade flows in the early 2000 s.

2500|$|The {{demand for}} {{condensate}} for oil sands diluent {{is expected to}} be more than [...] by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about [...] of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport. However, the recent huge increase in US tight oil production has largely solved this problem, because much of the production is too light for US refinery use but ideal for diluting bitumen. The surplus American condensate and light oil is [...] being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries.
