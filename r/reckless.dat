5|$|<b>Reckless</b> {{was kept}} by Pedersen's {{family for a}} brief time before moving to a more {{permanent}} home with the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. A second article about <b>Reckless</b> appeared in The Saturday Evening Post on October 22, 1955. These two articles and the book Reckless: Pride of the Marines (1955) were written by the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Geer, who kept notes about <b>Reckless</b> during the war. She made several public appearances, including Art Linkletter's show House Party, but had to cancel an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show due to the typhoon. Ed Sullivan had wanted her to appear on his November 7 show and was willing to pay the costs to get her there right after the scheduled, and delayed, November 5 arrival. <b>Reckless</b> never did appear on Sullivan's show.|$|E

5|$|On February 19, 2008, Ne-Yo {{was arrested}} for <b>reckless</b> driving and driving without a valid license after driving through Cobb County, Georgia in his 2006 Range Rover. It was {{reported}} {{that he was doing}} about 150mph, 100mph over the speed limit. On June 2, 2008, Ne-Yo pleaded guilty to the driving without a valid license charge and no contest to the <b>reckless</b> driving charge. He was sentenced to 24 hours of community service.|$|E

5|$|Randolph M. Pate, {{then the}} {{commander}} of the 1st Marine Division, gave <b>Reckless</b> a battlefield promotion from corporal to sergeant in a formal ceremony, complete with reviewing stand, on April 10, 1954, several months after the war ended. She was also given a red and gold blanket with insignia. <b>Reckless</b> was promoted again, to staff sergeant (E-6), on August 31, 1959, at Camp Pendleton, California. This promotion was also awarded by Pate, then the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Pate personally presided over the ceremony, and <b>Reckless</b> was honored with a 19-gun salute and a 1,700-man parade of Marines from her wartime unit. She was an early example of an animal holding official rank in a branch of the United States military.|$|E

5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive {{shopping and}} <b>reckless</b> generosity {{can be caused}} by medication, particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The dopamine dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th and through the 19th century, {{criticism}} centred on debates over the moral message of the play. Actor and playwright David Garrick's 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and <b>reckless.</b> Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been purposely included in the play to show how <b>reckless</b> the hero was {{and that this was}} the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths.|$|E
5|$|Of {{far greater}} {{importance}} to McCarthy than the committee's inconclusive final report was the negative {{effect that the}} extensive exposure had on his popularity. Many in the audience saw him as bullying, <b>reckless,</b> and dishonest, and the daily newspaper summaries of the hearings were also frequently unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|Opposite these {{offices are}} the Grosvenor Hotel and the {{derelict}} George Railway Hotel, which {{were built in}} the 1870s, {{on either side of the}} site of the Bristol Harbour Railway bridge.

5|$|President Mugabe and the Zanu-PF party {{leadership}} found themselves beset {{by a wide}} range of international sanctions. In 2002, the nation was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations due to the <b>reckless</b> farm seizures and blatant election tampering.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} half, nearing the halftime break, came an unusual string of <b>reckless</b> {{challenges}} from Toronto right back, Mikael Yourassowsky, on loan from Croatian side Rijeka. In the 36th minute of play, Yourassowsky was carded for a <b>reckless</b> challenge on Andy Najar, and a minute later was given a second yellow and subsequently ejected for doing a similarly mistimed tackle on Chris Pontius. It would not be until the 62nd minute that United were able to capitalize on the shorthanded Toronto, restoring parity at 2–2 thanks a goal from Ngwenya. The draw gave D.C. United the cup title.|$|E
5|$|Colt {{undermined}} his {{own company}} by his <b>reckless</b> spending. Selden constantly chastised him for using corporate funds to buy an expensive wardrobe or making lavish gifts to potential clients. Selden twice cut off Colt from company money for spending it on liquor and fancy dinners; Colt thought getting potential customers inebriated would generate more sales.|$|E

Between May and July 2013 Lohan spent 90 days in rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943, Captain Wai {{deployed}} to Australia with the 24th Infantry Division and by September 19, 1943, the unit was at Camp Caves, near Rockhampton, {{on the eastern}} coast of Australia.

5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who {{disagree}} with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be <b>reckless</b> before the first battle.|$|E
5|$|Individually, Alexander Ovechkin and Dennis Wideman {{were named}} to the All-Star Game. Due to a {{suspension}} for a <b>reckless</b> hit, however, Ovechkin elected not to attend the game to avoid being a distraction. Four Capitals were {{named one of the}} NHL's weekly three stars – a total of five times throughout the season. Three players made their NHL debut, while Mike Knuble played in his 1,000th game.|$|E
5|$|Proof of {{specific}} intent to endanger life is unnecessary {{on a charge}} of attempting this offence. In Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992 (1994), {{on a charge of}} attempted aggravated arson, it was held to be sufficient for the prosecution to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and that the defendant was <b>reckless</b> as to whether life would thereby be endangered.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Janet gets pregnant, the {{officers}} are baited into chasing a <b>reckless</b> driver {{into an apartment}} complex, where they are ambushed by {{the same group of}} Latino gang members. They fight their way into an alley, where Taylor is shot in the chest. As Zavala desperately attends to his partner, the assassins arrive and shoot him several times in the back, killing him. Police backup eventually arrives and the gangsters are brutally slain after refusing to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} ratings {{near the}} season average, and garnered generally positive reviews from critics. Brown's performance was praised, {{as well as}} the twist in his character's storyline. Also applauded were both Sam's confrontation with Dean over his recent <b>reckless</b> behavior and the resulting reconciliation at the episode's end. Many critics found the presence of character Bela Talbot (Lauren Cohan) in the episode to be pointless, while the critic for TV Guide enjoyed McNab's cameo and wished it had been longer.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{released}} in 1985, {{was directed by}} Irish director Steve Barron. In 1985 the music video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the category for Best Male Video.

5|$|Angle {{was arrested}} on September 4, 2011, by Virginia State Troopers for {{allegedly}} driving under the influence. Angle was placed in Warren County Jail, before posting $2,000 bail and being released in the early morning. State police revealed that Angle's initial breath test at the scene, where he was stopped by police, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.091 percent, which was above the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The test was later ruled not admissible and when a second test, taken at the police station, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06, the DUI charge was dropped. Angle was still charged with <b>reckless</b> driving. On November 8, 2011, Angle entered a plea of no contest and was fined $1,500.|$|E
5|$|As night approaches, the {{brothers}} {{have not been}} able to find Gordon. Dean decides to go after Gordon while Sam stays hidden, but Sam refuses. He then confronts Dean about his <b>reckless</b> behavior since his deal with a Crossroads Demon, which left him only a year to live. Dean claims that he is not scared of his impending death, but Sam challenges this. Dean eventually relents, agreeing to behave more like his old self again. The two then prepare to wait out the night.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been <b>reckless</b> in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E
5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its <b>reckless</b> use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E
5|$|Champollion, {{a liberal}} and {{progressive}} minded man, {{lived in a}} period of political turmoil in France which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic wars he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and <b>reckless,</b> did not help his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. <b>Reckless</b> driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, who {{thought that he was}} <b>reckless.</b> They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
5|$|Enron's auditor firm, Arthur Andersen, {{was accused}} of {{applying}} <b>reckless</b> standards in its audits because of {{a conflict of interest}} over the significant consulting fees generated by Enron. During 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% of the audit fees of public clients for Arthur Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.|$|E
5|$|For her {{exemplary}} {{service to}} the Marine Corps, <b>Reckless</b> was awarded two Purple Hearts (for the wounds received during the Battle of Vegas), a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, a Presidential Unit Citation with bronze star, the National Defense Service Medal, a Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Korea Medal, a Navy Unit Commendation, and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. She would wear these awards on her horse blanket, plus a French Fourragere that the 5th Marines earned in World War I.|$|E
