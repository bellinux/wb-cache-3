40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the results of}} an experimental program designed to investigate the effect of corrosion on the behaviour of shear critical reinforced concrete (RC) beams. The results of twenty RC beams (ten deep beams and ten slender beams) are described and discussed. The test variables included: corrosion level (2. 5 %, 5 % and 7. 5 %) and existence of <b>stirrups</b> (beams <b>without</b> <b>stirrups</b> and beams with stirrups). The feasibility of repairing the corroded shear critical RC beams with CFRP laminates was also investigated. Sixteen specimens were corroded using an accelerated corrosion technique whereas four specimens acted as control un-corroded. Following the corrosion phase, all specimens were tested to failure under three point bending. Test results revealed that the corrosion does not adversely affect the behaviour of shear critical RC beams rather it improves their behaviour. It was found that corrosion changed the failure mode of the corroded beams. The control un-corroded deep beams (beams with and <b>without</b> <b>stirrups)</b> failed in shear-compression failure whereas corroded deep beams (beams with and <b>without</b> <b>stirrups)</b> failed by splitting of the compression strut. The control un-corroded slender beams (beams with and <b>without</b> <b>stirrups)</b> failed in diagonal tension failure whereas the corroded slender beams failed in anchorage failure (beams <b>without</b> <b>stirrups)</b> and flexural failure (beams with stirrups). The analysis of the results showed that corrosion changed the load transfer mechanism and the change of failure mode was associated with the mechanism. The load transfer mechanism changed from a combination of beam and arch action in the control un-corroded deep beams to pure arch action in the corroded deep beams. The load transfer mechanism changed from pure beam action in the control un-corroded slender beams to pure arch action in the corroded slender beams. Two strut and tie models are proposed: one for corroded deep beams and one for corroded slender beams. The ultimate loads of the corroded beams were predicted using these struts and tie models and compared with the experimental results. A very good correlation was found between predicted and experimental results...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{physical}} model, for {{prediction of}} ultimate shear strength of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams is developed {{on the basis}} of a plastic approach originally proposed for reinforced concrete (RC) beams <b>without</b> <b>stirrups.</b> It is founded on the hypothesis that cracks can be transformed into yield lines, and thus is know as Crack Sliding Model (CSM). First, the CSM is improved in order to take into account the shear strength increase for deep beams, due to the arch effect. Then, the effectiveness factors for fibrous concrete under biaxial stresses are evaluated, taking into account the post-cracking tensile strength of SFRC and its ability to control slippage along shear cracks. With the aim of providing a handy and fast tool for design of SFRC beams <b>without</b> <b>stirrups,</b> a simplified design model is also derived.

40|$|Structures {{have been}} built using {{concretes}} with compressive strengths up to 11, 000 psi, even though little data {{is available on the}} properties of such concrete. Engineers have designed these structures by assuming that the design rules and procedures developed for low strength concrete are also satisfactory for the new, higher strengths. This work investigated the applicability of the current ACI shear design provisions to concrete strengths in excess of 10, 000 psi. ^ Thirty-nine reinforced concrete beams with and <b>without</b> <b>stirrups</b> were tested to determine their diagonal cracking and ultimate shear capacities. In beams <b>without</b> <b>stirrups</b> the shear span/depth ratio was held constant at 3. 6, 2. 5, or 1. 5 while the concrete strength was varied from 3000 psi to 15000 psi in otherwise identical beams. Concrete strength was also varied in beams with shear span/depth ratios of 3. 6 and having stirrups with a shear capacity (V(,s) /bd) of 50, 100, or 150 psi. To study the influence of concrete strength on the shear transferred by aggregate interlock two additional series of beams with stirrups were cast with thin plates inserted along the expected inclined crack path to produce a smooth crack surface. Design equations based on the test data from this study are presented. Based on the results of the experimental study, it was concluded that the ACI equations for predicting shear capacity of slender beams with or <b>without</b> <b>stirrups</b> and deep beams <b>without</b> <b>stirrups</b> are conservative throughout the entire range of the concrete strengths tested although the factor of safety against shear failures for slender beams decreases as the concrete strength increases. The ultimate shear capacity of beams increases with the concrete strength, stirrup strength, and decreasing a/d ratios. The shear contribution due to aggregate interlock was significantly affected by the concrete strength. Its contribution varied from about 50 % of the total concrete contribution at 3, 000 psi to 0 % at 9, 000 psi and higher. The dowel action contribution increased significantly from about 30 % at 3, 000 psi to 75 % at 13, 000 psi. The contribution from the compression zone stayed fairly constant at about 25 % with increasing compressive strength. ...|$|R

An analytical model was developed and published for predicting the relative flexural capacity of steel fibre high strength concrete beams (M-u/M-fl) i. e. the ratio of moment with shear interaction to pure flexural moment, This paper investigates the significant role of steel fibres in increasing the beam strength up to its full flexural capacity.

40|$|Synopsis: Many {{concrete}} bridges {{related to}} railways in the U. K. consist of prestressed rectangular concrete beams, post-tensioned together transversely to aid lateral distribution of load; this bridge type has been repeatedly flagged as having insufficient shear capacity. Sixteen tests on small-scale beams, which are scaled-down replica {{models of the}} actual bridge beams, are presented. The specimens are tested under a four-point loading system and are both prestressed (PRC) with and <b>without</b> <b>stirrups</b> and non-prestressed (RC) with and <b>without</b> <b>stirrups,</b> to provide full understanding of their shear behaviour. Four further tests are then presented on RC beams strengthened in shear with FRP bars inserted from the soffit into pre-drilled holes and fixed in place using epoxy resin; this method allows strengthening {{in cases where the}} webs are inaccessible. Comparisons are made with current code predictions for the strength of all specimens. The results show that unstrengthened RC beams behave mostly as expected and as predicted by codes, while for PRC beams a great variation in shear-carrying capacity following shear cracking is observed for different span-to-depth loading ratios. The proposed FRP strengthening scheme is effective and provides significant improvement to the shear-carrying load capacity...|$|R

40|$|Except for huge {{unreinforced}} structures, Weibull’s statistical {{size effect}} is weak in concrete structures. The size effect source is principally energetic, caused by stress redistribution {{due to a}} large fracture process zone size or large cracks formed before maximum load. It is shown that an unbiased statistical analysis of the existing database for shear of R.

40|$|The shear {{strength}} increase due to stirrup inclusion in reinforced concrete beams is analyzed. A number of 126 experimental values of this increase is {{obtained from the}} literature as difference between the {{shear strength}} of a beam with stirrups {{and that of the}} same beam <b>without</b> <b>stirrups,</b> which is called reference beam. On the basis of these values and by means of a statistical regression, a formula for the shear strength increase due to stirrup inclusion is worked out. The proposed formula shows that the stirrup effectiveness in increasing the beam shear strength strongly depends on the concrete strength, and that the dependence on the stirrup nominal shear strength is non-linear. A corresponding design formula is also proposed. Then, by adding this formula to the published expression for the shear strength of beams <b>without</b> <b>stirrups,</b> a general design formula for the prediction of the ultimate shear strength of beams with stirrups failing under flexure and shear is proposed. A comparison of the results obtained by means of this general formula and Eurocode and ACI Code formulas with 474 experimental values of beams with stirrups found in the literature is performed. The comparison shows that the proposed design formula is more consistent and reliable than Eurocode and ACI Code ones. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
