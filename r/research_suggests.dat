5|$|Current <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that the}} primary method of {{infection}} in animals is through ingestion. It is thought that prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids. They may then linger in the soil by binding to clay and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|Recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that the}} topical {{antimicrobial}} zinc pyrithione {{is a potent}} heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes.|$|E
50|$|S is {{incomplete}} dominant (towards co-dominant) to sp.

5|$|Stauromedusae, small sessile cnidarians with stalks and no medusa stage, have {{traditionally}} been classified {{as members of the}} Scyphozoa, but recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> they should be regarded as a separate class, Staurozoa.|$|E
5|$|The ruff is a wader in {{the large}} family Scolopacidae, the typical shorebirds. Recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> that its closest {{relatives}} are the broad-billed sandpiper, Calidris falcinellus, and the sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata.

5000|$|In criticisms {{published}} in the British Medical Journal, both Jane Cassidy and David Colquhoun criticise Lewith, claiming that he prescribes homoeopathy despite having written papers that conclude it doesn’t work. Lewith has conducted <b>research</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the homeopathic remedy has no effect, [...] and other <b>research</b> <b>suggesting</b> that, while the homeopathic medicine itself {{does not appear to}} have an effect, the homeopathic consultation has a clinically relevant non-specific effect.|$|R

5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that it may have}} killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|After {{the last}} ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> they came from {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive flexibility {{has been shown to be}} a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Jogaila's early life, and even his year of birth is uncertain. Previously historians assumed {{he was born in}} 1352, but some recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> a later date—about 1362. He was a {{descendant}} of the Gediminid dynasty and was probably born in Vilnius. His parents were Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana, daughter of Alexander I, Grand Prince of Tver.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> that {{cranberry}} (juice or capsules) may {{decrease the}} number of UTIs in those with frequent infections. A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%. Cranberry juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication. As of 2015, probiotics require further study {{to determine if they}} are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The foregut of the tammar wallaby {{contains}} {{species of}} bacteria {{belonging to the}} phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Within the phylum Proteobacteria, species of the family Succinivibrionaceae are the most abundant and a new species named WG–1 was discovered. WG–1 is a capnophilic bacterium. This has important environmental implications as the bacteria produces less methane than others and does not require CO2 to survive. <b>Research</b> <b>suggests</b> that this information {{could be used to}} reduce carbon production in livestock.|$|E

5|$|The new <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that the}} rocky centres of super-Earths are {{unlikely}} to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear {{to hold on to}} their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} North Korean forces {{committed}} to the region is not known, however later <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> that the North Korean 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight, {{and it is likely}} that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan. This would put the range of North Korean forces involved in the battle between 500 and 2,000.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> William Edward White was {{the first}} African-American {{baseball}} player in MLB, unlike White who passed as a white man, Walker was open about his black heritage, and often faced racial bigotry prevalent in the late 19th century. His brother, Weldy, became the second black athlete to do so later in the same year, also for the Toledo ball club. Walker played just one season, 42 games total, for Toledo before injuries entailed his release.|$|E
50|$|Phytochemical and {{pharmacological}} <b>researches</b> <b>suggest</b> that freshwater macrophytes, such as Centella asiatica, Nelumbo nucifera, Nasturtium officinale, Ipomoea aquatica and Ludwigia adscendens, {{are promising}} sources of anticancer and antioxidative natural products.|$|R

5|$|According to German {{assessments}} of the initial Soviet defeat, 673,000 soldiers had been captured by the Wehrmacht in both the Vyazma and Bryansk pockets, although recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> a lower—but still enormous—figure of 514,000 prisoners, reducing Soviet strength by 41%. Personnel losses of 499,001 (permanent as well as temporary) were calculated by the Soviet command. On 9 October, Otto Dietrich of the German Ministry of Propaganda, quoting Hitler himself, forecast {{in a press conference}} the imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler had never had to lie about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet resistance was perhaps hours away. German civilian morale—low since the start of Barbarossa—significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future Lebensraum in the east.|$|E
5|$|Gediminas' origins are unclear, {{but recent}} <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> that Skalmantas, an {{otherwise}} unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father {{and could be}} considered the dynasty's founder. Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E
5|$|However, later <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that the}} initial {{stability}} of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than {{a certain period of}} healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
