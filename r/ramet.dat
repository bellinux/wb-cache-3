5|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of Serbs killed on 11–13 May vary. Historians Jozo Tomasevich and Ivo Goldstein put the number at 260. Historians Sabrina P. <b>Ramet</b> and Marko Attila Hoare {{estimate}} that about 300 Serbs were massacred while historian Davide Rodogno puts the number at 417 killed. On 14 May, the Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, sent a letter of protest to Pavelić after receiving news of the killings. He failed to condemn the atrocity publicly. The next day, Pavelić visited Rome and was granted a private audience with Pope Pius XII, who offered de facto recognition of the NDH on behalf of the Holy See. Although he was aware that Pavelić was a totalitarian dictator, {{there is no evidence that}} he had knowledge of the first Glina massacre at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Brioni Agreement {{isolated}} Marković {{who tried}} to preserve the federation, but was ignored by van den Broek who appeared not to comprehend issues presented before him, and the EC delegation tacitly encouraged the dissolution of Yugoslavia. The agreement diminished the authority of part of the JNA's leadership who fought {{for the preservation of}} the Yugoslav federation. The agreement was also unfavourable for Croatia because it was left to defend against the JNA and Serb forces. By effectively removing Slovenia from influence of the federal authorities, especially the JNA, the agreement fulfilled one of the Serbian nationalists' goals, allowing the redrawing of international borders. Sabrina <b>Ramet</b> noted that Kučan and Milošević reached an agreement in January 1991 in which Milošević gave his assurances that Slovenia's independence bid would not be opposed by Serbia. In return, Kučan expressed his understanding for Milošević's interest to create a Greater Serbia.|$|E
5|$|The NDH {{authorities}} {{considered that}} the alliance {{would mean that}} the Chetniks could continue to subvert Partisan units. On 30 April, the NDH authorities recognised the rights of Drenović and his troops to remain armed in order to fight the Partisans. The agreement between the NDH and Drenović's Chetniks was soon made public by the entire Ustaše press; Serb public opinion remained divided. By May, Drenović had a force of about 350 Chetniks. At mid-month, he signed an agreement with a Croatian general staff officer in Banja Luka agreeing to cooperate with the NDH in fighting the Partisans. Drenović soon {{emerged as one of the}} most important Chetnik leaders in western Bosnia. That summer, when order had been established in significant parts of the Italian occupation zone, Drenović and other Chetnik detachment leaders and their principal political spokesmen with Italian Second Army headquarters were recognized by the Italians as auxiliaries and early in the summer Italian commander Mario Roatta allowed for the delivery of arms, munitions, and supplies to the Chetniks. Other Chetnik leaders in Bosnia who had concluded alliances with the NDH by June 1942 included Mane Rokvić, Branko Bogunović, Stevo Rađenović and Momčilo Đujić. Historian Sabrina P. <b>Ramet</b> observes that this co-operation must be seen as a function of their mutual fear of the Partisans, and emphasizes the uncertainty and distrust that accompanied it. By June, Drenović's Chetniks numbered about 600 men.|$|E
40|$|Aims Despite {{extensive}} {{studies on}} effects of clonal {{integration in the}} past three decades, {{little is known about the}} effects of clonal integration on the performance of waterlogged clonal plants. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that clonal integration could improve performance of Cynodon dactylon, a stoloniferous clonal herbcommonly found in riparian areas of reservoirs, under waterlogging stress. Methods Relatively young apical <b>ramets</b> of C. dactylon clonal fragments were submerged in water at depths of 0 (control), 5 and 15 cm, and their connections to the relatively old basal <b>ramets</b> of the fragments under normal conditions were either severed (preventing clonal integration) or not (allowing integration). Performances of apical <b>ramets,</b> basal <b>ramets</b> and whole fragments were investigated after one month of treatment. Meanwhile, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm, maximum quantum yield of PSII; Yield, effective quantum yield of PSII) were measured. Important findings Severing the stolon connection significantly decreased the growth of apical <b>ramets</b> under submergence in terms of biomass, total stolon length and number of <b>ramets.</b> Submergence also significantly decreased the growth of apical <b>ramets,</b> but had little effects on basal <b>ramets.</b> Performance of both basal <b>ramets</b> and clonal fragments was enhanced if the basal <b>ramets</b> were connected with the apical <b>ramets</b> subjected to 5 cm depth of submergence. However, stolon severing treatment had little effects on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of both apical <b>ramets</b> and basal <b>ramets.</b> Results indicate that clonal integration increased performance of waterlogged <b>ramets</b> and the growth of non-waterlogged connected <b>ramets.</b> Clonal integration could help C. dactylon resist submergence stress...|$|R
40|$|Aims A pot {{experiment}} {{to examine the}} effects of clonal integration on growth of the stoloniferous herb Centella asiatica suffering from heterogeneous heavy metal Cd 2 + stress was conducted to address two questions: (1) does clonal integration alleviate the negative effects on growth of clonal plants suffering from heterogeneous heavymetal stress; and (2) do the <b>ramets</b> growing in unfavorable microhabitats incur increased photosynthetic efficiency in the connected ramets?Methods Relatively young, distal <b>ramets</b> of C. asiatica were assigned to normal or Cd 2 + stressed soil, and the stolon connections between the relatively old proximal <b>ramets</b> and the young distal <b>ramets</b> were either severed or left intact. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn), chlorophyll fluorescence (maximum quantum yield of PSII, Fv/Fm) and chlorophyll contents of distal <b>ramets</b> and Pn of proximal <b>ramets</b> were measured. The growth performance of distal and proximal <b>ramets</b> was investigated at the end of the experiment. Important findings Cd 2 + stress treatment significantly decreased the Pn, Fv/Fm, chlorophyll contents and growth of distal <b>ramets.</b> Clonal integration significantly alleviated the negative effect of Cd 2 + stress to distal <b>ramets</b> in terms of Pn, Fv/Fm, chlorophyll contents and biomass of distal <b>ramets.</b> There was no significant cost to the connected proximal <b>ramets,</b> and clonal integration did not incur increased photosynthetic efficiency in the proximal <b>ramets.</b> In addition, clonal integration significantly decreased root to shoot ratio of distal <b>ramets</b> suffering from Cd 2 + stress, and reduced the uptake of the heavy metal. Petiole length of proximal and distal <b>ramets</b> was not significantly affected by stolon severing and Cd 2 + stress. It is suggested that clonal integration may enhance growth of clonal plants suffering from heterogeneous heavy metal stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} to exchange resources and non-resource agents {{is one of}} the most outstanding features of clonal plants. Contrast between patches in a heterogeneous environment is the main external driving force behind integration effects. It was hypothesized, on the basis of the source-sink hypothesis, that assimilate demand from drought-stressed <b>ramets</b> will result in enhancement of the photosynthesis of well-watered <b>ramets</b> by a mechanism of feedback regulation, that the negative effect of drought on the photosynthesis of drought-stressed <b>ramets</b> will be ameliorated by physiological integration, and that these effects will be enhanced by increasing contrast. A pot experiment was conducted with clonal fragments consisting of two interconnected <b>ramets</b> of Fragaria orientalis. In the experiment, both the connected and the disconnected clonal fragments were divided into three water contrast groups: (1) homogeneous (no contrast) group; (2) low-contrast group; (3) high-contrast group. The photosynthesis and stress tolerance of drought-stressed <b>ramets</b> did not decrease under the support of well-watered <b>ramets</b> when they were connected, allowing clones to maintain their performance in less favorable environments. But the photosynthesis and stress tolerance of drought-stressed <b>ramets</b> decreased with increasing drought-stress when stolons were disconnected. With a feedback regulation process, the photosynthesis of well-watered <b>ramets</b> connected to drought-stressed <b>ramets</b> was enhanced by the latter, which can compensate, at least partially, for the cost of maintaining the stressed <b>ramets.</b> Drought-stressed <b>ramets</b> gained more benefits in a high-contrast environment than in a lower-contrast environment; this can enhance the survival of drought-stressed <b>ramets</b> in unfavorable habitats, especially stressed patches that would otherwise be unexploitable by independent <b>ramets.</b> But photosynthesis of well-watered <b>ramets</b> did not increase with increasing water availability contrast. It can be concluded that photosynthesis and stress tolerance of F. orientalis was affected by clonal integration and by contrasts of water availability.

Until recently, camel milk could not {{be made into}} camel cheese because rennet was unable to coagulate the milk proteins to allow the collection of curds. Developing less wasteful uses of the milk, the FAO commissioned Professor J.P. <b>Ramet</b> of the École Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et des Industries Alimentaires, {{who was able to}} produce curdling by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet. The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant. The sale of camel cheese is limited owing to the small output of the few dairies producing camel cheese and the absence of camel cheese in local (West African) markets. Cheese imports from countries that traditionally breed camels are difficult to obtain due to restrictions on dairy imports from these regions.|$|E

40|$|Background and aims: In {{contrast}} to seeds, high sensitivity of vegetative fragments to unfavourable environments may limit {{the expansion of}} clonal invasive plants. However, clonal integration promotes the establishment of propagules in less suitable habitats and may facilitate the expansion of clonal invaders into intact native communities. Here, we examine the influence of clonal integration on the morphology and growth of <b>ramets</b> in two invasive plants, Alternanthera philoxeroides and Phyla canescens, under varying light conditions. Methods: In a greenhouse experiment, branches, connected <b>ramets</b> and severed <b>ramets</b> of the same mother plant were exposed under full sun and 85 % shade and their morphological and growth responses were assessed. Key results: The influence of clonal integration on the light reaction norm (connection 6 light interaction) of daughter <b>ramets</b> was species-specific. For A. philoxeroides, clonal integration evened out the light response (total biomass, leaf mass per area, and stem number, diameter and length) displayed in severed <b>ramets,</b> but these connection 6 light interactions were largely absent for P. canescens. Nevertheless, for both species, clonal integration overwhelmed light effect in promoting the growth of juvenile <b>ramets</b> during early development. Also, vertical growth, as an apparent shade acclimation response, was more prevalent in severed <b>ramets</b> than in connected <b>ramets.</b> Finally, unrooted branches displayed smaller organ size and slower growth than connected <b>ramets,</b> but the pattern of light reaction was similar, suggesting mothe...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Grazing is {{a complex}} process {{involving}} the simultaneous occurrence of both trampling and defoliation. Clonal plants are a common feature of heavily grazed ecosystems where large herbivores inflict the simultaneous pressures of trampling and defoliation on the vegetation. We test the hypothesis that physiological integration (resource sharing between interconnected <b>ramets)</b> may help plants {{to deal with the}} interactive effects of trampling and defoliation. Methods In a field study, small and large <b>ramets</b> of the root-suckering clonal tree Populus simonii were subjected to two levels of trampling and defoliation, while connected or disconnected to other <b>ramets.</b> Plant responses were quantified via survival, growth, morphological and stem mechanical traits. Key Results Disconnection and trampling increased mortality, especially in small <b>ramets.</b> Trampling increased stem length, basal diameter, fibrous root mass, stem stiffness and resistance to deflection in connected <b>ramets,</b> but decreased them in disconnected ones. Trampling decreased vertical height more in disconnected than in connected <b>ramets,</b> and reduced stem mass in disconnected <b>ramets</b> but not in connected <b>ramets.</b> Defoliation reduced basal diameter, leaf mass, stem mass and leaf area ratio, but did not interact with trampling or disconnection. Conclusions Although clonal integration did not influence defoliation response, it did alleviate the effects of trampling. We suggest that by facilitating resource transport between <b>ramets,</b> clonal integration compensates for trampling-induced damage to fine root...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ramets</b> are vegetative, clonal {{extensions}} {{of a central}} genet. Common examples are rhizomes (modified stem), tillers, and stolons. A plant is perennial if the birth rate of <b>ramets</b> exceeds their death rate.

500|$|Political {{scientist}} Professor Sabrina P. <b>Ramet</b> {{sees the}} dysfunctionality {{and lack of}} legitimacy of the regime as {{the reasons why the}} kingdom's internal politics became ethnically polarised, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the [...] "national question" [...] in Yugoslavia.

500|$|Andrić {{remains the}} only writer from the former Yugoslavia to have been awarded the Nobel Prize. His use of the Ekavian dialect {{and the fact that}} most of novels and short stories were written in Belgrade has led to his works being {{associated}} almost exclusively with Serbian literature. The historian Bojan Aleksov deems Andrić one of the two central pillars of Serbian literature, the other being Njegoš. According to the scholar Guido Snel, Serbs consider Andrić [...] "one of the greatest non-Serb-born Serbs". [...] "The plasticity of his narrative," [...] Moravcevich writes, [...] "the depth of his psychological insight, and the universality of his symbolism remain unsurpassed in all of Serbian literature." [...] Due to his self-identification as a Serb, Slavonic studies professor David A. Norris asserts, many in the Bosniak and Croat literary establishments have come to [...] "reject or limit Andrić's association with their literatures". Following Yugoslavia's disintegration in the early 1990s, Andrić's works were blacklisted in Croatia under President Franjo Tuđman. Sabrina P. <b>Ramet,</b> an American political scientist of Croatian descent, characterizes Andrić as a writer who [...] "missed the Chetnik train by a very small margin". Though Andrić's biography remains a controversial topic in Croatia, the Croatian literary establishment largely rehabilitated his works following Tuđman's death in 1999.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} blurred ethnic lines. Many Serbs who {{had lived}} in Vukovar for generations– known as the starosedioci or [...] "old settlers"– resisted the propaganda coming from Belgrade and Knin and continued to live peacefully with their Croatian neighbours. The došljaci, or [...] "newcomers", whose families had relocated from southern Serbia and Montenegro to replace the deported Germans after 1945, were the most responsive to nationalist appeals. The journalist Paolo Rumiz describes how they [...] "tried to win their coethnics over to the patriotic mobilization, and when they had no success with that, they killed them, plundered their property and goods, or drove them away. The old settlers would not let themselves be stirred up against other nationalities." [...] When Croats fled the fighting they often gave their house keys for safekeeping to their Serb neighbours, whom they trusted, rather than to the Croatian police. The political scientist Sabrina P. <b>Ramet</b> notes that a distinctive feature of the war in eastern Slavonia was [...] "the mobilization of those who were not integrated into the multi-cultural life of the cities against urban multi-culturalism." [...] Former Belgrade mayor Bogdan Bogdanović characterised the attack on Vukovar as an act of urbicide, a deliberate assault on urbanism.|$|E
40|$|The aspen leaf miner, Phyllocnistis populiella, {{has caused}} {{widespread}} and severe damage to aspen in the boreal forests of western North America {{for over a}} decade. We suppressed P. populiella on individual small aspen <b>ramets</b> using insecticide at two sites near Fairbanks, Alaska annually for seven years and compared plant performance to controls. Insecticide treatment successfully reduced leaf damage by P. populiella during most years and {{had little effect on}} herbivory by externally-feeding invertebrates.

40|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} in resource {{supply is}} common {{and responses to}} heterogeneous resource supply have been extensively documented in clonal angiosperms but not in pteridophytes. To test the hypotheses that clonal integration can modify responses of pteridophytes to heterogeneous resource supply and the integration effect is larger at higher patch contrast, we conducted a field experiment with three homogeneous and two heterogeneous light treatments on the rhizomatous, understory fern Diplopterygium glaucum in an evergreen broad-leaved forest in East China. In homogeneous treatments, all D. glaucum <b>ramets</b> in 1. 5 m 61. 5 m units were subjected to 10, 40 and 100 % natural light, respectively. In the heterogeneous treatment of low patch contrast, <b>ramets</b> in the central 0. 5 m 60. 5 m plots of the units were subjected to 40 % natural light and their interconnected <b>ramets</b> in the surrounding area of the units to 100 %; in the heterogeneous treatment of high patch contrast, <b>ramets</b> in the central plots were subjected to 10 % natural light {{and those in the}} surrounding area to 100 %. In the homogeneous treatments, biomass and number of living <b>ramets</b> in the central plots decreased and number of dead <b>ramets</b> increased with decreasing light supply. At low contrast heterogeneous light supply did not affect performance or biomass allocation of D. glaucum in the central plots, but at high contrast it increased lamina biomass and number of living <b>ramets</b> older than annual and modified biomass allocation to lamina and rhizome. Thus, clonal integration can affect responses of understory ferns to heterogeneous light supply and <b>ramets</b> in low light patches can be supported by those i...|$|R

500|$|At first, the {{occupied}} territories were placed under military administration. The international legal scholar, Professor Raphael Lemkin, who coined the word [...] "genocide" [...] as meaning the [...] "destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group", described the policies implemented by the Hungarian authorities in {{the occupied}} territories as [...] "genocidal". Lemkin asserted that [...] "genocidal" [...] policies were those that were aimed at destroying the political, social, cultural, religious, and economic existence and language of those living in occupied territories. In {{the first two weeks of}} Hungarian rule, 10,000 Serbs were expelled to the German-occupied territory of Serbia, the NDH, or Italian-ruled Montenegro. On 1 May 1941, the Germans estimated that the population of the territories occupied by Hungary was 1,145,000. On 9 July 1941, the military governor of the town of Čakovec in Međimurje, Colonel Zsigmond Timár, issued a declaration that the following day Međimurje was to be placed permanently under military administration and Hungarian rule. According to Professor Sabrina <b>Ramet,</b> the government of the NDH consented to Hungarian annexation of the Međimurje area on 10 July, but according to Davor Kovačić and Marica Karakaš Obradov of the Croatian Institute of History, the Hungarian declaration was made without consulting with the NDH government, and was never recognised by it. The Croat population of the region were unhappy with the decision, and military rule remained in place until 16 August 1941, after which civil administration was introduced. On 12 July, the Yugoslav dinar ceased to be legal tender in {{the occupied territories}}, and was replaced by the Hungarian pengő. A census of the occupied Yugoslav territories was conducted by the Hungarian authorities in 1941, which counted a total population of 1,030,027. In this census, the ethnic proportions in these territories combined were 37 per cent Hungarian, 19 per cent Volksdeutsche, 18 per cent Croats and 16 per cent Serbs, and the population of Prekmurje was 102,867.|$|E

40|$|The {{variety of}} {{theories}} that {{have attempted to}} define the mechanisms of aging and life span can be broadly divided into two alternative but nonexclusive viewpoints. The first stipulates that random changes of cellular and molecular structures lead to death following progressive "wear and tear.

Here we demonstrate that <b>ramets</b> (clonal replicates) experimentally separated from colonies of the acidian protochordate Botryllus schlosseri died months after their separation, almost simultaneously with their parent colony and sibling <b>ramets.</b> In addition, in experimentally joined chimeras between <b>ramets</b> of senescent and nonsenescent colonies, elements from different parent colonies displayed parent-colony-specific timing of mortality. Thus, the senescent phenotype was simultaneously expressed both in chimeras and in unfused <b>ramets</b> of the parent colony that was undergoing senescence, whereas control <b>ramets</b> from the other partner survived.

This study describes the modular dynamics, spatio-temporal growth patterns of aerial plant and sub-terranean rhizome populations of this scourge on fertilized and unfertilized peat and paddy soils. The NPK fertilizer application at 100 : 30 : 30 ha- 1 resulted in more robust aerial plant growth with ca. 253. 5 <b>ramets</b> m- 2 (mean dry aerial biomass of 23. 2 g plant- 1) compared with 235. 6 <b>ramets</b> m- 2 (16. 3 g plant- 1) in unfertilized peat soils 24 weeks after planting of the mother plant. The parallel figures for plants growing on paddy soils of the Jawa series were ca. 97. 08 <b>ramets</b> m- 1 (12. 19 g plant- 1) (fertilized paddy soils) and 83. 67 <b>ramets</b> m- 1 (10. 89 g plant- 1) (unfertilized paddy soils) 24 weeks after planting of the mother plant. Mean <b>ramets</b> mortality was significantly higher in unfertilized paddy soils at 121. 3 <b>ramets</b> m- 2, while in the fertilized paddy soils this was only 34. 7 <b>ramets</b> m- 2, resulting respective net populations of ca. 218. 8 <b>ramets</b> m - 2 and 114. 3 <b>ramets</b> m - 2 in fertilized and unfertilized plots. In paddy soils mean <b>ramets</b> mortality in unfertilized paddy soils was ca. 8. 58 <b>ramets</b> m- 2, while this was only ca. 5. 67 <b>ramets</b> m- 2, leading to the respective resultant net populations of 91. 41 m- 2 and 75. 09 <b>ramets</b> m- 2. Flowering set in earlier among <b>ramets</b> in fertilized peat soils with 103. 2 <b>ramets</b> m- 2 vis-a-vis 77. 5 <b>ramets</b> m- 2, 24 weeks after transplanting of the mother plant in unfertilized soil. Flowering set in earlier among <b>ramets</b> in fertilized paddy soils with 49. 56 <b>ramets</b> m- 2 vis-a-vis the unfertilized soil registering ca. 47. 79 <b>ramets</b> m- 2, 24 weeks after transplanting of the mother plant. Fertilizer applications to either peat or paddy soils did not register any significant difference in mean plant height, chlorophyll contents, and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements vis-a-vis those plants devoid of fertilizer application. No measurable differences were registered in rhizome lengths over time of S. grossus plants devoid of fertilizer application compared with those growing in fertilized peat soils. Similarly patterns were observed among S. grossus populations in both fertilized and unfertilized paddy soils. The time- and space-mediated clonal growth of S. grossus did not register any significant preferential directionality and dispersion of aerial plants and their sub-terranean rhizomes irrespective of fertilizer application or soil types, but rather displaying opportunistic resource capture by aerial and sub-terranean modules. ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD tests, response surface, fractal dimension and fractal topography analysis under fertilizer application factor and differences soils (peat soils - paddy soils) {{were used in the}} study from the first week to the 24 th week. Dispersion analyses of rhizomes was also employed. In circular statistics r (concentration), s (angular deviation), Rayleigh’s R and Rayleigh’s z were computed on the emerged <b>ramets</b> of S. grossus. Results of Rayleigh’s z test showed significant mean direction of <b>ramets</b> emergence for all replicates in the fertilized plots (p > 0. 01). Significant mean direction was obtained only for replicate R 1 for the unfertilized plots. No significant mean direction for replicates R 2 and R 3 of the unfertilized plots means that <b>ramets</b> emergence is distributed uniformly around the circle, that is originating from the mother plant. They occur when s, the dispersion given by the angular deviation is near the maximum (where 0 < s < 83. 01). Dispersion analysis of <b>ramets</b> by circular statistics on S. grossus generated no special preferences in the direction of modules or emerged <b>ramets</b> as explained by the Rayleigh’s r, Rayleigh’s z, and mean angle of dispersion in pest and paddy soils. However, there were heavier concentrations of <b>ramets</b> in the eastern sector of the plot, presumably due to phototropic effect of sunlight. In response surface analyses in peat soils results showed the stationary points obtained for the unfertilized plots is at x-distance = 0. 03 m, y-distance = - 0. 06 m and time (t) = 9. 8 months. This function predicted a maximum density of 178 plants m- 2 to occur at the location and time. For the fertilized plot, the stationary point is at x-distance = 0. 20 m, y-distance = - 0. 82 m and t = 11. 31 months. The predicted density obtained was 291. 02 plants m- 2. While in paddy soils the best location and time in unfertilized soil was between x- distance 0. 00 m and y- distance - 0. 14 m at t = 8. 16 month, while in fertilized soil the location was between x- distance - 0. 13 m and y- distance 0. 20 m and the best time at t = 8. 48 month. In fractal topography analysis results showed value fractal dimension from gl= 0 – gl= 100 between area-covering and ranched network (1 2). The area-covering concentrated at gl= 0 and gl= 40 in both peat and paddy soils (fertilized and unfertilized). While after gl= 100 – gl= 255 sporadic distribution (D- 0) in peat (fertilizer and unfertilized) and unfertilized paddy soils. While for fertilized paddy soil, gl= 100 – gl= 255. The fractal dimension analysis method allows the structural complexity of such associations to be compared between plant communities, with regard to their potential for soil resource acquisition and utilization. In peat soil, distinct and partly not significant differences are found (fractal dimension between 1. 52 ± 0. 53 and 1. 50 ± 0. 59) in unfertilized and fertilized plots. In paddy soil, fractal dimension between 1. 53 ± 0. 55 and 1. 52 ± 0. 49) in unfertilized and fertilized plots. We found distinct and partly not significant differences between plant in peat and paddy soils, when analysing many small units of a complex root system association. In larger plant communities, a broad variety of below-ground structures are recorded in its entirety, integrating the specific features of single sub-structures. In that way, extreme fractal dimensions are lost and the diversity decreases. Therefore, the analysis of larger units of root system associations provides a general knowledge of the complexity of root system structures for heterogeneous plant communities. Under the prevailing experimental conditions in the studies, the following conclusions can be drawn, viz: (i) The optimal period of clonal growth for Scirpus grossus, in general was between 10 - 18 weeks after planting; (ii) Augmentation with different NPK fertilizer concentrations and at different water depths had the following effects on S. grossus growth in both fertilized and unfertilized peat and paddy soils, (a) Increased rate of natality and the population number of <b>ramets,</b> fortified by enhanced proliferation of subterranean rhizomes; (b) Decreased rates of <b>ramets</b> mortality; (c) Increased rate and production of inflorescence of the weed; and (d) Enhanced production of biomass vis-a-vis the control of various plant components. However, the NPK fertilizer treatment did not {{have a significant impact on}} the plant height; chlorophyll content; and chlorophyll fluorescence, registering non-significant difference in both fertilizer and control plants; (iii) Fertilizer concentration with water depth did have a significant impact on the following parameters; namely (a) plant height; and (b) inflorescence number; (iv) Aerial modular growth, dispersion, response surface, plant topography-fractal analyses on emerged <b>ramets,</b> and fractal dimension boxing analyses of subterranean rhizome modules confirmed that the fertilizer treatment (at NPK 100 : 30 : 30) did not have a significant and prevalent impact on the growth patterns of S. grossus...|$|R

40|$|Although {{herbivory}} {{may result}} in plant death, the mode and timing of damage may produce variable wounding responses in the attacked plant. In this study, effects {{of different types of}} apical meristem damage on growth and performance of sea oxeye daisy Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC were compared. Damage involved either clipping or galling of the apical meristem by the gall midge Asphondylia borrichiae Rossi and Strong. Apical dominance was relatively weak before flowering and stronger in short <b>ramets</b> that were shaded by taller neighbors later in the season. Clipped <b>ramets</b> delayed sprouting new stems, and galled <b>ramets</b> sprouted new stems quickly compared to intact <b>ramets,</b> but final stem counts were similar across treatments. Clipping significantly delayed flowering, reduced seed head ripening time, and resulted in fewer seed heads and seeds. Galling did not significantly impact reproduction compared to intact <b>ramets.</b> Nitrogen supplementation significantly increased stem count and seed count and lengthened seed ripening time. Borrichia frutescens responds differently to clipping versus galling by A. borrichiae and better tolerates galling in terms of nonreproductive performance and survival. Galling from A. borrichiae likely prevents Borrichia frutescens from flowering, which suggests resource regulation of meristems by the midge...|$|R
40|$|All {{natural environments}} are {{spatially}} and temporally heterogeneous. Consequently, {{their ability to}} provide essential resources {{for the growth of}} plants is variable. Modular plant species produce repeated basic structures which, in the case of clonal species, are called <b>ramets.</b> <b>Ramets</b> belonging to the same clone are distributed throughout the environment in space and time, and therefore they may be located in sites which differ in resource-providing quality. The connections between <b>ramets</b> may allow resources to be shared, enabling the clone to behave as a cooperative system. As a result of such physiological integration, <b>ramets</b> can survive in conditions where there is lethal shortage of a resource because they are connected to, and supported by, <b>ramets</b> located in conditions where there is ample supply of the same resource. Physiological integration between connected <b>ramets</b> presents opportunities for heterogeneous environments to be exploited to an extent that is only just becoming apparent. As heterogeneity is ubiquitous in natural environments, it may be expected that plants, as relatively immobile organisms, will have evolved the capacity to cope with it by making appropriate localized morphological and/or physiological plastic responses. Recent studies suggest that such responses not only enable clonal species to cope with environmental heterogeneity, but that under some circumstances they can benefit more from environments which are heterogeneous rather than homogeneous, even when both types of environment contain the same amount of resources. Studies on Glechoma hederacea (Lamiaceae) that illustrate this phenomenon are described...|$|R
40|$|Coral reef {{degradation}} increases coral {{interactions with}} filamentous turf algae (FTA) and macroalgae, which {{may result in}} chronic stress for the corals. We evaluated the effects of short (2. 5 month) and long (10 month) periods of FTA removal on tissue thickness (TT), zooxanthellae density (ZD), mitotic index (MI), and concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) in Montastraea annularis {{at the beginning and}} end of gametogenesis. <b>Ramets</b> (individual lobes within a colony) consistently surrounded by FTA and <b>ramets</b> surrounded by crustose coralline algae (CCA) were used as controls. FTA removal reduced coral stress, indicated by increased TT and ZD and lower MI. The measured effects were similar in magnitude for the short and long periods of algal removal. <b>Ramets</b> were more stressed at the end of gametogenesis compared with the beginning, with lower ZD and Chl a cm(- 2), and higher MI. However, it was not possible to distinguish the stress caused by the presence of FTA from that caused by seasonal changes in seawater temperature. <b>Ramets</b> surrounded by CCA showed less stress in comparison with <b>ramets</b> surrounded by FTA: with higher TT, Chl a cm(- 2) and ZD, and lower MI values. Coral responses indicated that <b>ramets</b> with FTA suffered the most deleterious effects and contrasted with those measured in <b>ramets</b> surrounded by CCA. According to published studies and our observations, there could be at least six mechanisms associated to FTA in the stress caused to M. annularis by FTA. Owing to the high cover of FTA (in contrast to macroalgae and CCA) in the Caribbean, the chronic stress, the overgrowth and mortality that this functional algal group can cause on M. annularis species complex, a further decline of this important reef-building coral in the Caribbean is expected...|$|R
