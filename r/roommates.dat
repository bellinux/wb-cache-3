40|$|We {{consider}} one-to-one matching {{markets in}} which agents {{can either be}} matched as pairs or remain single. In these so-called <b>roommate</b> markets agents are consumers and resources at the same time. Klaus (2010) introduced two new "population sensitivity" properties that capture the effect newcomers have on incumbent agents: competition sensitivity and resource sensitivity. On various <b>roommate</b> market domains (marriage markets, no odd rings <b>roommate</b> markets, solvable <b>roommate</b> markets), we characterize the core using either of the population sensitivity properties in addition to weak unanimity and consistency. On the domain of all <b>roommate</b> markets, we obtain two associated impossibility results. consistency; competition and resource sensitivity; core; marriage and <b>roommate</b> markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores interracial <b>roommate</b> {{relations}} {{by looking}} at how it influences students' overall college experiences. It focuses on how these students are affected emotionally, the levels of contact they assume with their <b>roommate,</b> and how their academic performance is affected. The main questions that we asked are: 1) Have you been affected academically by having a <b>roommate</b> of a different race? 2) Did you experience any emotional affects? 3) What {{is the amount of}} time that you and your <b>roommate</b> spend in the room together? 4) Does your interracial <b>roommate's</b> emotion or mood affect you? 5) How much does the race of your <b>roommate</b> affect your study habits? We have come to believe that interracial <b>roommate</b> relations have no significant effect on students' overall college experience. As our research has shown, the college experience is more affected by the roommates' individual personalities rather than any type of racial discomforts the students may possess...|$|R

We {{show that a}} singleton is von Neumann-Morgenstern farsightedly stable if and only if the matching is stable (Theorem 1). We also present a <b>roommate</b> market without a von Neumann-Morgenstern farsightedly stable set (Example 1) and a <b>roommate</b> market with a nonsingleton von Neumann-Morgenstern farsightedly stable set (Example 2) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{created as a}} {{framework}} for the website idealni-cimer. hr, an internet interface that uses psychology-grounded instruments to help students find their suitable <b>roommate</b> within half an hour, making the <b>roommate</b> search quick and effective. The results of American research could potentially lead us to wrong conclusions when searching for an ideal <b>roommate</b> of a Croatian student, since findings seem to be culturally specific. A pilot study and the analyses of focus groups done on 120 Croatian students, suggested that personality is not the only predictor of satisfaction with the <b>roommate</b> relationship. Attitudes towards neatness and the life habits while in a shared apartment also proved to be important. Based on these findings, we designed and assembled a questionnaire and examined its diagnostic validity on a sample of 80 students who were living with a <b>roommate</b> {{at the time of the}} study. Analysis that included data of over 300 users of the idealni-cimer. hr interface suggested that the key determinants of <b>roommate</b> relationship satisfaction are attitudes towards neatness, several personality dimensions (conscientiousness, self-discipline, cooperation, extroversion, and neuroticism) and specific life habits (behavior concerning common living space, behavior concerning relationship to <b>roommate,</b> and bringing over guests in the common living space) ...|$|R

5|$|Death Cab for Cutie {{began as}} a solo project of Ben Gibbard in 1997, while he was the guitar player for the band Pinwheel, and was {{recorded}} under the name All-Time Quarterback. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords the same year. The release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, recruiting Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as lead guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass player, and Nathan Good as drummer. Death Cab for Cutie was officially formed at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, and lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band's development.

5|$|Moore's next {{appearance}} was {{a supporting role}} in the comedy–drama <b>Roommates</b> (1995), playing the wife of Peter Falk. Her following film, Nine Months (1995), was crucial in establishing her as a leading lady in Hollywood. The romantic comedy, directed by Chris Columbus and co-starring Hugh Grant, was poorly reviewed but a box office success; it remains one of her highest-grossing films. Her next release was also a Hollywood production, as Moore appeared alongside Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas in the thriller Assassins (1995). Despite negativity from critics, the film earned $83.5 million worldwide. Moore's only appearance of 1996 came in the Merchant Ivory film Surviving Picasso, where she played the artist Dora Maar opposite Anthony Hopkins. The period drama met with poor reviews.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his <b>roommates</b> had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Sayers and Bears {{teammate}} Brian Piccolo {{became the}} first interracial <b>roommates</b> in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity), {{became the subject of}} the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with Piccolo, a white man, and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, and charges of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.|$|E
