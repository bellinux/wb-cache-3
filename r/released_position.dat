40|$|Abstract. Deposition {{profiles}} of tungsten {{released from the}} outer divertor were studied in JT- 60 U. A neutron activation method {{was used for the}} first time to accurately measure deposited tungsten. Surface density of tungsten in the thick carbon deposition layer can be measured by this method. Tungsten was mainly deposited on the inner divertor (around inner strike points) and on the outer wing of the dome. Toroidal distribution of the W deposition was significantly localized near the tungsten <b>released</b> <b>position,</b> while other metallic impurities such as Fe, Cr, Ni were distributed more uniformly. These data indicate that inward drift in the divertor region played a significant role in tungsten transport in JT- 60 U. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{longitudinal}} mixing of particles which are instantaneously releasedin a bounded turbulent shear flow. The movements of particles are described in view of theLagrangian particle analysis. The similarity of concerned phenomena to the turbulent diffu-sion by continuous movements in a uniform turbulent flow is studied. The discrepancy oftwo phenomena is also shown with some discussions. In the mixing the Lagrangian auto-correlation function plays the most important role. Some auto-correlation functions in aturbulent shear flow are introduced and their dependency on a <b>released</b> <b>position</b> and traveltime is discussed. The discussion gives useful information of estimating the Lagrangianauto-correlation function in a turbulent shear flow. Finally, {{the model of the}} Lagrangianauto-correlation function proposed by the authors in the other paper is referred, and thegeneral features of longitudinal mixing given by the proposed model are compared withthe past knowledge experimentally obtained...|$|E

This paper argues that the current fauna survey guidelines are in need of improvement. The approach and requirements of some other Australian states are briefly assessed to identify similarities and where improvements can be made to the Western Australian (WA) guidelines. This paper concludes with suggestions on how the process and the guidelines in WA can be revised to more adequately assess the impact of developments on terrestrial vertebrate biodiversity and ecosystem function.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the sputtering and the co-deposition processes on plasma-facing tiles with castellation geometry, a PIC (particle-in-cell) simulation of the sheath layer {{near the surface}} was incorporated into a dynamic plasma surface interaction code, EDDY. From the PIC simulation, the gyro-motion of the hydrogen isotope ions {{was found to be}} strongly affected the incident angle of their bombardment. The most probable angle in the angular distribution was found to be smaller than the angle of the magnetic field (measured from the surface normal) in fusion devices. Therefore, the sputtering yield, which calculated by using the angle of the magnetic field as an incident one, was overestimated. On the other hand, as the angle of the magnetic field increased, chemically eroded hydrocarbons were redeposited far from the <b>released</b> <b>position</b> after successive dissociation in the plasmas. Moreover, E � B drift became an important process for the redeposition distribution. The radial electric field E was caused by the gradient of the potential profile in the sheath layer. Realistic plasma profiles of the sheath layer are important for the precise estimation of the co-deposition rates of hydrogen isotopes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{in vitro}} {{preparation}} of the fifth thoracic ganglion of the crayfish was {{used to analyze the}} connections supporting the monosynaptic reflex responses recorded from the depressor motor neurons (Dep MNs). Dep MNs are directly connected by the release-sensitive afferents from a proprioceptor, the coxo-basipodite chordotonal organ (CBCO), which is released by upward movements of the leg. Sine-wave movements, applied to the CBCO strand from the most <b>released</b> <b>position,</b> allowed us to stimulate the greatest part of release-sensitive CBCO fibers. Systematic intracellular recordings from all Dep MNs performed in high divalent cation saline allowed us to determine the connections between CBCO afferents and their postsynaptic Dep MNs: it highlighted the sequential activation of the different Dep MNs involved in the monosynaptic reflex. The convergence of different sensory afferents onto a given Dep MN, and the divergence of a given sensory afferent onto several Dep MNs illustrates the complexity of the sensory-motor reflex loops involved in the control of locomotion and posture. Electrophysiological experiments and simulations were performed to analyze the mechanisms by which Dep MNs integrate the large amount of sensory input that they receive. Paired intracellular recording experiments demonstrated that postsynaptic response shapes characteristic of both phasic and phaso-tonic afferents could be induced by varying the presynaptic firing frequency, whatever the postsynaptic Dep MN. Compartment model simulations were used to analyze the role of the sensory-motor synapse characteristics in the summation properties of postsynaptic MN. They demonstrated the importance of the postsynaptic compartment geometry, because large postsynaptic compartments allowed to generate greater excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) summations than small ones. The results presented show that velocity information is the most effective to elicit large compound EPSPs in MNs. We therefore suggest that the negative feedback reflex is mainly based on the detection of leg movements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{in vitro}} {{preparation}} of the fifth thoracic ganglion of the crayfish was used to study in detail the negative feedback loop involved in the control of passive movements of the leg. Release-sensitive primary afferents of from the coxo-basipodite chordotonal organ (CBCO), a proprioceptor whose strand is released by upward movement of the leg, monosynaptically connect to depressor motor neurons (Dep MNs). Extracellular identification of sensory units from the CBCO neurogram allowed us to determine the global coding of a sine-wave movement, imposed from the most <b>released</b> <b>position</b> of the CBCO strand. Intracellular recordings from sensory terminals (CBTs) and ramp movement stimulations applied to the CBCO strand allowed us to characterize two groups of release-sensitive CBCO fibers. The first group, divided into two subgroups (phasic and phaso-tonic), is characterized by discontinuous firing patterns: phasic CBTs fired exclusively during release movements; phaso-tonic CBTs displayed both a phasic firing and a tonic discharge during the more released plateaus. The second group was continuously firing whatever the movement, with higher frequencies during the release phase of the movement stimulation. All CBTs displayed a marked sensitivity for release movements while only the phaso-tonic ones showed a clear sensitivity to maintained positions. Surprisingly, no pure tonic sensory fibers were encountered. Systematic intracellular recordings from all resistant Dep MNs, performed in high divalent cation saline, allowed us to describe two shapes of monosynaptic resistance reflex responses. A phasic response was characterized by bursts of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) occurring exclusively during CBCO strand release movements. A phaso-tonic response was characterized by a progressive depolarization occurring all along the release phase of the stimulation: during maintained released positions, the amplitude of the sustained depolarization was position dependent; in addition, each release movement produced a phasic burst of EPSPs in the MN. The parallel study of the Dep MN properties failed to point out any correlation between the type of reflex response recorded from the MN and the MN intrinsic properties, which would indicate {{that the type of}} MN response is entirely determined by the afferent messages it receives...|$|E

40|$|A multi-anabranch {{river with}} three braid bars {{is a typical}} river pattern in nature, but no studies have been {{conducted}} to describe mixing characteristics of pollutants in the river. In this study, a physical model of a typical multi-anabranch river with three braid bars was established to explore the pollutant mixing characteristics in different branches. The multi-anabranch reach was separated into seven branches, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, B 5, B 6, and B 7, by three braid bars. Five tracer <b>release</b> <b>positions</b> located 2. 9 m upstream from the inlet section of the multi-anabranch reach were adopted, and the distances from the five positions to the left bank of the upstream main channel were 1 / 6 B, 1 / 3 B, 1 / 2 B, 2 / 3 B, and 5 / 6 B(B is the width of the upstream main channel), respectively. The longitudinal velocities and pollutant concentrations in the seven branches were measured. The planar flow field and mixing characteristics of pollutants from the bottom to the surface in the multi-anabranch river were obtained and analyzed. The results show that the pollutant <b>release</b> <b>positions</b> are the main influencing factors in the pollutant transport process, and the diversion points and pollutant <b>release</b> <b>positions</b> jointly influence the percentage ratios of the pollutant fluxes in branches B 1, B 2, and B 3 to the pollutant flux in the upstream main channel...|$|R
