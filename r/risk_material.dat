40|$|Since 1996, bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) in cattle {{has been linked to}} a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a fatal brain disease in man. This paper assessed the cost-effectiveness of BSE control strategies instituted by the European Commission. In a Monte Carlo simulation model, a non-intervention baseline scenario was compared to three intervention strategies: removal of specified <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> from slaughter animals, post-mortem testing for BSE and the culling of feed and age cohorts of BSE cases. The food risk in the baseline scenario ranged from 16. 98 lost life years in 2002 to 2. 69 lost life years in 2005. Removing specified <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> removal practices, post-mortem testing and post-mortem testing plus cohort culling reduced this risk with 93 %, 82. 7 % and 83. 1 %. The estimated cost-effectiveness of all BSE measures in The Netherlands ranged from 4. 3 million euros per life year saved in 2002 to 17. 7 million euros in 2005. It was discussed that the cost-effectiveness of BSE control strategies will further deviate from regular health economics thresholds as BSE prevalence and incidence declines...|$|R

The favourite for the race was the Luca Cumani-trained High-Rise an unbeaten three-year-old colt who had won the Epsom Derby on his most recent appearance.

40|$|Biosecurity <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> (BRM) {{presents}} {{a clear and}} significant threat to national and international environmental and economic assets. Intercepting BRM carried by non-compliant international passengers is a key priority of border biosecurity services. Global travel rates are constantly increasing, which complicates this important responsibility, and necessitates judicious intervention. Selection of passengers for intervention is generally performed manually, {{and the quality of}} the selection depends on the experience and judgement of the officer making the selection. In this article we report on a case study to assess the predictive ability of statistical profiling methods that predict non-compliance with biosecurity regulations using data obtained from regulatory documents as inputs. We then evaluate the performance arising from using risk predictions to select higher risk passengers for screening. We find that both prediction performance and screening higher risk passengers from regulatory documents are superior to manual and random screening, and recommend that authorities further investigate statistical profiling for efficient intervention of biosecurity <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> on incoming passengers.

40|$|Today's social {{awareness}} {{of environmental protection}} presents the electronic companies with an irreversible trend towards green manufacturing. It raises harsh requirement for the sourcing process and imposes unprecedented pressure to the QA system, majorly due to the <b>risk</b> of hazardous <b>material.</b> As QA procedures are becoming more complicated for coping with increasing <b>material</b> <b>risk</b> and meanwhile the time and resource available are tightly constrained, {{the development of an}} effective mechanism for material testing turns up to be a critical issue. In this study, a hierarchical <b>material</b> <b>risk</b> assessment approach is proposed based on FMEA framework. Taking into account the risk occurrence, the difficulty in detection and the severity the risk causes, it enables companies to estimate their <b>material</b> <b>risks</b> dynamically using Bayesian network. With its help, companies can assess and prioritize the <b>material</b> <b>risk</b> in a systematic and efficient manner which will drive QA towards a more high-performance process. © 2010 IEEE. published_or_final_versionThe IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM 2010), Macao, China, 7 - 10 December 2010.
