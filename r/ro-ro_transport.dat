40|$|The {{design of}} new ships for {{container}} and/or <b>Ro-Ro</b> <b>transport</b> on short or medium distances as, for example, on Mediterranean routes is proposed and analysed. The ship hull design is a trimaran SWAH hull (Small Waterplane Area Hull), which was defined and tested at DINMA towing tank {{to determine the}} most appropriate design solution. In particular the interference factors between the main hull and the outriggers are examined and analysed. The resistance components are calculated and compared for the different dispositions of the hull components. Then the main general characteristics for a container ship will be presented and discussed by setting in evidence the faults and the qualities for this solution...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a methodology to evaluate rail-road freight policies {{such as new}} services and/or incentives for long- distance freight transport by using a mixed what-if/what-to approach. It uses a specific mode-service choice model to share the freight demand among alternatives (rail-road combined <b>transport,</b> maritime <b>Ro-Ro</b> and road <b>transport)</b> and a service network design model to identify new rail-road freight services. This methodology {{is designed to be}} easily integrated within a Decision Support System to allocate the freight transport policies. Finally, in order to show the applicability of the proposed approach, some application examples carried out to support Italian Ministry of Transport {{in the development of the}} new Italian National Transport Plan are presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of the EU funded FP 6 collaborative research project LOGBASED was to develop innovative <b>ro-ro</b> vessels and <b>transport</b> systems enabling motorways of the sea to become competitive against their land borne competitors. The developed methodology and tools, which consider requirements and expectations of all transport chain stakeholders, permitted the design of higher performance and efficiency ships operating {{as an integral part}} of dynamic intermodal transport chains. The implementation of the LOGBASED-approach, provides a unique guidance to ship designers, yards, cargo owners and ship owners in realising a business opportunity within intermodal transport where the sea transport is the dominating leg. This paper summarizes results of the LOGBASED project and presents the latest enhancements to the LOGBASED approach and its application to other ship types and markets...|$|R
40|$|The sinkings of the European Gateway, the Herald of Free Enterprise and the Estonia have {{highlighted}} {{the potential for}} tragedy when water floods the car deck of <b>RO-RO</b> ferries. <b>Transport</b> Canada, through the Marine Safety Directorate and the Transportation Development Centre, sponsored model experiments {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the current SOLAS regulations and to determine if they can be safely relaxed when applied to domestic ships operating in sheltered waters. The first model tested was a prismatic hull, with the overall dimensions and stability characteristics of a 160 m ferry. The subject of this paper is the results for the second model tested which was a simplified ship shaped hull with a waterline length of approximately 87 metres. The basic hull form was derived from smaller ferries, but was modified to be symmetrical about midships. The program of experiments was carried out over ranges of residual freeboard, vertical centre of gravity and area of freeing ports (fitted with flaps). The estimated maximum significant waveheight that the ship will survive is presented against various stability parameters and freeing port areas. The limits of survivability are evaluated against the current SOLAS requirements, and are also compared with the findings from the Joint North West European R&D Project 'Safety of Passenger/RO-RO Vessels'. These results were developed from ships with fully enclosed car decks, rather than typical North American designs. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
30|$|The waterway, both inland {{and on the}} sea, was {{the most}} {{important}} freight transport mode before the appearance of the railway in Japan. Shipbuilding has seen its own development and Japanese ships were widely used (Benzai-sen, also known as Sengoku-bune) until the Edo and early Meiji Periods for domestic freight transport. Since the seventeenth century, along with the development of the market economy, off-shore waterways and seaports along the coast were gradually developed. The western routes (so-called Kitamae-bune, connecting Osaka and Hokuriku to Hokkaido via the Seto Inland Sea and Kanmon Straits), which was run by shipowner-merchants, saw a particular prosperity (See e.g. [12]). After industrialization in the late nineteenth century, the railway and later the truck overtook the role as the main mode for long-distance freight transport. However, around 40 % to 45 % of the goods within Japan are still transported by ship (based on ton-km). In the last decades, as Japan increased its imports and exports and along with the globalization of the economy, the role of international bulk, <b>Ro-Ro</b> and container <b>transport</b> is becoming more important.|$|R
40|$|The marine {{atmosphere}} {{is one of}} the most corrosive environments due to its high content of wind-transported salts and high relative humidity. Transporting vehicles with corrosion sensitive parts on open decks is advised against in cargo handling manuals however this recommendation contravenes with the transporterâ€™s need for flexibility regarding cargo placement on board. There is also a strong suspicion that regarding exposure to marine salts, some areas on the open decks can actually be compared to the fully closed main deck, where the vehicles are being transported today. The purpose of this study is to examine if this theory can be confirmed through surface salinity measurements, in order to provide the transporter with the knowledge needed as a ground for decision-making of whether it is possible to start shipping corrosion-sensitive cargo placed in such areas or not. This report contains results from a field study made during September-November 2015 on <b>ro-ro</b> vessels <b>transporting</b> vehicles in the North Sea. Using the Bresle method the surface salinity at predetermined cargo spaces is measured before departure and after arrival. These values are then compared to evaluate if there is a difference pre and post the sea voyages and if there are any variations between the cargo space areas. The measured salinity values are supplemented by results from weather observations during the voyages for the purpose of identifying eventual relationships. The results show that most of the areas on board that were considered for shipping of the vehicles have a very small increase in surface salinity. These areas are deemed as suitable for transportation under calm weather conditions. During more severe weather conditions most areas appeared to be unsuitable for transportation as they had a high increase in surface salinity...|$|R
