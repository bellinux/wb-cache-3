Seven passengers were killed and 51 passengers were taken to hospital with injuries when a CityRail electric interurban train collided with the <b>rear</b> <b>wagon</b> of the long-haul Perth-to-Sydney Indian Pacific.|$|E
50|$|Track renewal trains {{have now}} {{replaced}} labour-intensive permanent way gangs. Long welded rail {{was hard to}} install manually. An early demonstration of mechanised track-laying with two 600 ft lengths of long welded rail {{took place on the}} Fighting Cocks branch in 1958. The two lengths were loaded on ten wagons, attached to the existing track by a steel rope and drawn back at 30 ft a minute. As the train moved back, the old rails were levered out and the new ones dropped into the chairs. A hoist on the <b>rear</b> <b>wagon</b> dropped {{the last part of the}} rail into place.|$|E
5000|$|The {{crash was}} {{examined}} by Captain Henry Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate, {{and he was}} able to pinpoint the disaster in a broken axle on one of the goods wagons of the first train. The engine driver stopped his train when he discovered that several <b>rear</b> <b>wagons</b> had suddenly derailed, one of which blocked the adjacent line. He then saw the second train approaching at speed on the next line, and tried to warn him, but to no avail. The passenger train collided with the wagon across the line, the fatalities occurring in several of the lead carriages.|$|R

5000|$|The two-wagon {{train was}} {{originally}} {{armed with a}} WWII German 20mm gun and two 9K11 Malyutka missile launchers; [...] a Bofors 40mm gun was added later. A pair of M-53 7.9mm light machine guns were mounted to defend the blind spots. The 40mm cannon was removed in 1992 and replaced by a Soviet-designed 76mm gun mounted on the <b>rear</b> <b>wagon.</b> The convoy was enlarged with a third wagon mounting two 20mm cannons. Two Zastava M84 machine guns and a twin 57mm multiple rocket were also added in 1992. [...] The following year marked the definitive configuration of the armored train, when the 76mm gun was supplanted by an American M18 Hellcat tank destroyer. There was an open wagon with two 120mm mortars, but their operational use was limited. [...] The {{end of the war}} in Croatia frustrated plans of mounting an 88mm flak gun.|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{of a team}} {{of horses}} pulling a covered wagon in Scott Valley, Siskiyou County, ca. 1905. A team of six horses pulls a covered wagon along a dirt road which bisects the middleground of the image horizontally. The leading pair of horses in the team is light in color, while the {{remaining}} four are darkly-colored. A low cloud of dust hangs at the horses' feet. The covered wagon is in two connected parts: a larger wagon in the front, and a smaller wagon in the rear. Both sections of the wagon appear to be made of wood, with wooden wheels, while their tops are made of cloth. Ropes criss-cross the sides of both wagons. The cloth top of the larger wagon sits crooked, creating a gap that reveals the top of the wagon's side, while a metal pail hangs {{from the middle of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>wagon.</b> A large hillside, dotted with trees, sits behind the road. Two wooden box-like structures, their sides made of angled slats, rest near the bottom of the hill. Intermittent wooden posts line the road on the side closest to the hill...|$|E

60|$|From Crowland the marauders proceeded, taking Turgar with them, {{to another}} large and wealthy abbey in the neighborhood, which they plundered and destroyed, {{as they had}} the abbey at Crowland. Sidroc made Turgar his own attendant, keeping him always near him. When the {{expedition}} had completed their second conquest, they packed the valuables which they had obtained from both abbeys in wagons, and moved toward the south. It happened {{that some of these}} wagons were under Count Sidroc's charge, and were {{in the rear of the}} line of march. In passing a ford, the wheels of one of these <b>rear</b> <b>wagons</b> sank in the muddy bottom, and the horses, in attempting to draw the wagon out, became entangled and restive. While Sidroc's whole attention was engrossed by this difficulty, Turgar contrived to steal away unobserved. He hid himself in a neighboring wood, and, with a degree of sagacity and discretion remarkable in a boy of his years, he contrived to find his way back to the smoking ruins of his home at the Abbey of Crowland.|$|R
50|$|Although the Electra and LeSabre coupes and sedans {{had both}} {{switched}} to new {{front wheel drive}} platforms by 1986, the model names also continued to be used on the <b>rear</b> wheel drive <b>wagons</b> through 1989.|$|R

60|$|Ten {{days later}} they drove into Williams, in Colusa County, {{and for the}} first time again {{encountered}} a railroad.

50|$|That evening Chelmsford issued his orders. The British, {{having learned}} a bitter lesson at Isandlwana, would take no chances meeting the Zulu {{army in the}} open with their normal line of battle such as the 'Thin Red Line' of Balaclava fame. Their advance would begin at first light, prior to forming his {{infantry}} into a large hollow square, with mounted troops covering the sides and <b>rear.</b> Neither <b>wagon</b> laagers nor trenches would be used, to convince both the Zulus and critics that a British square could “beat them fairly in the open”.|$|R
60|$|Tying {{the lines}} fast, Matt sprang out. He {{had seen a}} loose stone of fair size close at hand, and this he now picked up. Running around to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>wagon,</b> he {{placed it on the}} sloping ground so that one of the wheels was blocked from further slipping.|$|R
50|$|The {{forces of}} Mollingen adopted a semi circle formation, which would permit a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Portuguese front and flanks. Matias de Albuquerque, marching in a slow pace towards Portugal, had prepared for a rear attack by placing the infantry in two defensive lines with the strongest formations in the <b>rear,</b> the baggage <b>wagons</b> in the vanguard and the cavalry split between the two flanks.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} his protestations and pleadings, Barberry was tightly bound and {{fastened}} to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>wagon.</b> Then Billy, who had had quite a rest, was harnessed up once more, and with Matt on the seat and Ramson going on ahead to pick the way, they started off for the village, Andy keeping in the rear {{to see to it}} that their prisoner should not escape.|$|R
25|$|Brig. Gen. George A. Custer, a brigade {{commander}} under Kilpatrick, received intelligence {{from a local}} civilian {{that the}} <b>rear</b> of Ewell's <b>wagon</b> train was approaching a large summer resort hotel named Monterey Springs, which sat atop the Pass. Despite being warned of a Confederate artillery placement ahead, Kilpatrick ordered his entire force to advance.

50|$|For {{the first}} model year, the 810 Deluxe was the only version to receive the {{five-speed}} manual, while the luxurious 810 Maxima only came with a three-speed automatic. The Maxima's introduction to North America followed the successful introduction of the Nissan S30, and used the same engine and transmission while offering luxurious accommodations and four doors. The sedans have independent rear suspension while the wagon has a leaf sprung live <b>rear</b> axle. The <b>wagon</b> also received <b>rear</b> drums rather than disc brakes.|$|R

60|$|This was {{sufficiently}} awkward; for, by going {{near enough to}} give a warning in a low voice, and have that warning followed by {{a change in the}} discourse, we should be betraying ourselves, and might fall into serious danger.

5000|$|The {{equivalent}} LTDs came {{on stream}} as the DA series in June 1988. Like the previous generation, all N-series Fairlanes and D-series LTDs were {{built on the}} Falcon/Fairmont station wagon platform and this legacy is most noticeable in the disproportionally narrow station <b>wagon</b> <b>rear</b> doors on what {{was meant to be}} a limousine and in a car that otherwise caters well for rear seat passengers with a large amount of interior seating and legroom space. Nonetheless, these large sedans and were [...] "limousine enough" [...] to be one of the most common platform used by Australian body building companies to make stretch limousines.|$|R
5000|$|With ECP, a {{power and}} control line is {{installed}} from wagon to wagon {{from the front of}} the train to the rear. Electrical control signals are propagated effectively instantaneously, as opposed to changes in air pressure which propagate at a rather slow speed limited in practice by the resistance to air flow of the pipework, so that the brakes on all wagons can be applied simultaneously, or even from rear to front rather than from front to <b>rear.</b> This prevents <b>wagons</b> at the <b>rear</b> [...] "shoving" [...] wagons at the front, and results in reduced stopping distance and less equipment wear.|$|R
60|$|While {{some of the}} men chopped sage-brush and we {{children}} {{carried it}} to the fires that were kindling, other men unyoked the oxen and let them stampede for water. Next the men, in big squads, moved the wagons snugly into place. The tongue of each wagon was {{on the inside of the}} circle, and, front and <b>rear,</b> each <b>wagon</b> was in solid contact with the next wagon before and behind. The great brakes were locked fast; but, not content with this, the wheels of all the wagons were connected with chains. This was nothing new to us children. It was the trouble sign of a camp in hostile country. One wagon only was left out of the circle, so as to form a gate to the corral. Later on, as we knew, ere the camp slept, the animals would be driven inside, and the gate-wagon would be chained like the others in place. In the meanwhile, and for hours, the animals would be herded by men and boys to what scant grass they could find.|$|R

The Kingswood Estate had the [...] two-barrel engine as standard with the same engine options as the coupes and sedans. Station wagon models came only with single exhaust systems which meant lesser power ratings than coupes and sedans.|$|R
50|$|The car was rear-wheel drive, with {{longitudinally}} mounted engines, canted over {{to bring}} a lower bonnet line to the styling. Manual or Automatic transmission was offered. The suspension system consisted of MacPherson struts and coil springs at the front and with either semi-trailing arms with coil springs or coil springs and live axle at the <b>rear.</b> The station <b>wagon</b> and most of non European versions used an unusual torque tube layout with huge suspension travel, and great strength, meant that the 504 was suited to rough road conditions, and the car proved extremely reliable in conditions found in Africa, Asia, Australia and the like. Pickup versions were available with a live axle.|$|R
5000|$|The E100 {{sedan and}} hatchbacks {{introduced}} in 1991 lasted until {{the introduction of}} the E110 in May 1995, while the E110 wagons and the related van continued in the Japanese market alongside the newer Corolla and Sprinter Carib models. Passenger wagons were available in G-Touring, L-Touring and high-performance BZ-Touring guises, while [...] "Van" [...] and [...] "Business Wagon" [...] models were basically stripped out wagons with leaf-sprung solid axle <b>rear</b> suspensions. Business <b>Wagons</b> typically had slightly higher equipment levels than simpler vans. The Corolla Touring Wagon continued until 2000, while both commercial versions continued to serve the Japanese market until July 2002, long outliving the mainstream E110 models in Japan. It was succeeded by the Probox.|$|R

The United States Department of Transportation as well as the various Canadian provinces, have established regulations that dictate the minimum required size of the sign, and grant exemptions for displaying the sign for certain religious groups having an objection to displaying a sign, which are operating horse-drawn carriages or wagons on public highways, provided they use an alternative reflective marking on the <b>rear</b> of the <b>wagon</b> or carriage.

Whether the last also saw the pretended chief was more than I knew, but he decided to let the conversation go on, rather leaning to the anti-rent side of the question, as the course that could do no serious evil, while it might secure our own safety.

2500|$|The final B-body Caprice was {{not well}} {{received}} by critics and did not hold on to high sales numbers. The car's styling was criticized with car aficionados calling it a [...] "beached whale" [...] and [...] "an upside-down bathtub". For 1993 there were some revisions, the most obvious being {{the removal of the}} skirted rear wheel wells in favor of more conventional, open wheel wells. This applied only to the sedan model; station wagons retained the skirted wheel wells. A final appearance tweak appeared on the 1995 Caprice sedan {{in the form of a}} restyled side window between the back door and C pillar (windows on Caprices of the generation through 1994 were triangular, but the 1995 window had 4 sides and lacked the sharp corner pointed toward the <b>rear),</b> and the <b>wagon</b> was given the same mirrors as the sedan. In 1996 the Impala SS was exported to Middle Eastern markets badged as the Caprice SS, with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel & the badge on the dashboard saying Caprice SS.|$|R
