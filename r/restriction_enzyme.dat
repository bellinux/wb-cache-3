5|$|The {{development}} of such tools {{has been driven}} by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms, including the human genome. It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find <b>restriction</b> <b>enzyme</b> sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{numerous}} types of <b>restriction</b> <b>enzymes,</b> {{each of which}} will cut DNA differently. Most commonly used <b>restriction</b> <b>enzymes</b> are Type II restriction endonuclease (See article on <b>Restriction</b> <b>enzymes</b> for examples). There are some that cut a three base pair sequence while others can cut four, six, and even eight. Each enzyme has distinct properties that determine how efficiently it can cut and under what conditions. Most manufacturers that produce such enzymes will often provide a specific buffer solution that contains the unique mix of cations and other components that aid the enzyme in cutting as efficiently as possible. Different <b>restriction</b> <b>enzymes</b> may also have different optimal temperatures under which they function.|$|R

25|$|The first {{methods for}} finding out {{genetics}} used for DNA profiling involved RFLP analysis.

25|$|EBV can {{be divided}} into two major types, EBV type 1 and EBV type 2. These two subtypes have {{different}} EBNA-3 genes. As a result, the two subtypes differ in their transforming capabilities and reactivation ability. Type 1 is dominant throughout most of the world, but the two types are equally prevalent in Africa.

25|$|The <b>restriction</b> <b>enzyme</b> DpnI can {{recognize}} 5'-GmeATC-3' sites and digest the methylated DNA. Being {{such a short}} motif, it occurs frequently in sequences by chance, and as such its primary use for researchers is to degrade template DNA following PCRs (PCR products lack methylation, as no methylases {{are present in the}} reaction). Similarly, some commercially available restriction enzymes are sensitive to methylation at their cognate restriction sites, and must as mentioned previously be used on DNA passed through a dam-/dcm- strain to allow cutting.|$|E
25|$|A <b>restriction</b> <b>enzyme</b> is {{an enzyme}} that cuts {{double-stranded}} or single stranded DNA at specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction sites. Such enzymes, found in bacteria and archaea, {{are thought to}} have evolved to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses. Inside a bacterial host, the restriction enzymes selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called restriction; host DNA is methylated by a modification enzyme to protect it from the restriction enzyme's activity. The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded, in 1978, to Daniel Nathans, Werner Arber, and Hamilton O. Smith for the discovery of restriction endonucleases.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{recombination}} detailed above is advantageous as {{it provides an}} alternative to the low-efficiency, laborious, and multi-step recombination processes using endonucleases and ligases. Therefore, λ-red recombination is more specific in terms of possible genomic alterations that are not governed by locations of <b>restriction</b> <b>enzyme</b> recognition sites. However, it also has many limitations. Multiple rounds of transformations can increase the risk of error and increase recombination time. Therefore, efficiency can be low (0.1–10% for point mutations; 10−5–10−6 for insertions, deletions, or replacements) and requires long growth into workable colonies between transformations and recombinant selections. All together, this contributes to a lengthy and inefficient mutagenesis procedure for even single mutations. This technique can also leave scars that can contribute to destabilization of the chromosome and impact the success of the manipulation.|$|E

500|$|In an {{influential}} 1953 publication, primatologist William Charles Osman Hill also consolidated all the slow lorises in one species, Nycticebus coucang, and considered other forms distinct at the subspecies level. Osman Hill thus listed Nycticebus coucang pygmaeus, while acknowledging that [...] "it may be deemed necessary to accede this form specific rank." [...] In 1960, Dao Van Tien reported a species from Hòa Bình Province, Vietnam, {{that he called}} N.intermedius, {{but it turned out}} that his specimens were merely adults of the pygmy slow loris, which had originally been described {{on the basis of a}} juvenile. After studying slow lorises from Indochina, primatologist Colin Groves proposed that the pygmy slow loris was morphologically unique enough to be considered a distinct species. The validity of this opinion was later corroborated by studies of chromosomal structure, genetic distance determined by protein variation at polymorphic loci, and mitochondrial DNA <b>restriction</b> <b>enzyme</b> analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cloning vector}} is {{treated with a}} {{restriction}} endonuclease to cleave the DNA at the site where foreign DNA will be inserted. The <b>restriction</b> <b>enzyme</b> is chosen to generate a configuration at the cleavage site that {{is compatible with the}} ends of the foreign DNA (see DNA end). Typically, this is done by cleaving the vector DNA and foreign DNA with the same <b>restriction</b> <b>enzyme,</b> for example EcoRI. Most modern vectors contain a variety of convenient cleavage sites that are unique within the vector molecule (so that the vector can only be cleaved at a single site) and are located within a gene (frequently beta-galactosidase) whose inactivation can be used to distinguish recombinant from non-recombinant organisms at a later step in the process. To improve the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant organisms, the cleaved vector may be treated with an enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) that dephosphorylates the vector ends. [...] Vector molecules with dephosphorylated ends are unable to replicate, and replication can only be restored if foreign DNA is integrated into the cleavage site.|$|E

The influence of neighbouring sequences {{on the ability of}} a given sequence to adopt unusual DNA structure, presumably left handed Z conformation, was studied through single hit analysis. Using multiple cut <b>restriction</b> <b>enzymes</b> such as NarI and FspI, it could be shown that under identical topological strain, the extent of structural alteration is greatly influenced by the neighbouring sequences.

2500|$|Unlike other methods, {{cassette}} mutagenesis {{need not}} involve primer extension using DNA polymerase. [...] In this method, {{a fragment of}} DNA is synthesized, and then inserted into a plasmid. It involves the cleavage by a <b>restriction</b> <b>enzyme</b> at a site in the plasmid and subsequent ligation {{of a pair of}} complementary oligonucleotides containing the mutation in the gene of interest to the plasmid. Usually, the restriction enzymes that cut at the plasmid and the oligonucleotide are the same, permitting sticky ends of the plasmid and insert to ligate to one another.

Plasmids may be used specifically as transcription vectors and such plasmids may lack crucial sequences for protein expression. Plasmids used for protein expression, called expression vectors, would include elements for translation of protein, such as a ribosome binding site, start and stop codons.|$|E
2500|$|For plasmid manipulations, other site-directed {{mutagenesis}} techniques have been supplanted largely by techniques {{that are highly}} efficient but relatively simple, easy to use, and commercially available as a kit. [...] An example of these techniques is the Quikchange method, wherein a pair of complementary mutagenic primers are used to amplify the entire plasmid in a thermocycling reaction using a high-fidelity non-strand-displacing DNA polymerase such as pfu polymerase. [...] The reaction generates a nicked, circular DNA. [...] The template DNA must be eliminated by enzymatic digestion with a <b>restriction</b> <b>enzyme</b> such as DpnI, which is specific for methylated DNA. [...] All DNA produced from most Escherichia coli strains would be methylated; the template plasmid that is biosynthesized in E. coli will, therefore, be digested, while the mutated plasmid, which is generated in vitro and is therefore unmethylated, would be left undigested. Note that, in these double-strand plasmid mutagenesis methods, while the thermocycling reaction may be used, the DNA need not be exponentially amplified as in a PCR. Instead, the amplification is linear, and it is therefore inaccurate to describe them as a PCR, {{since there is no}} chain reaction.|$|E
