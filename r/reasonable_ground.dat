Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

2500|$|After {{an arrest}} warrant was issued for the Sudanese {{president}} in March 2009, the Prosecutor appealed to add genocide charges.

The definition adopted by the Pre-Trial Chamber is the definition of the Genocide Convention, the Rome Statute, and some ICTY cases. On 3 February 2010 the Appeals Chamber of the ICC found that the Pre-Trial Chamber had applied [...] "an erroneous standard of proof when evaluating the evidence submitted by the Prosecutor" [...] and that the Prosecutor's application for a warrant of arrest on the genocide charges should be sent back to the Pre-Trial Chamber to review based on the correct legal standard.
