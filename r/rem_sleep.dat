However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> while still standing.

5|$|The {{immune system}} is {{affected}} by sleep and rest, and sleep deprivation is detrimental to immune function.

5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, {{although}} the concept originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992). Development was led by Sonic Team veterans Yuji Naka, Naoto Ohshima, and Takashi Iizuka. Naka began the project with the main idea revolving around flight, and Ohshima designed the character Nights to resemble an angel that could fly like a bird. Ohshima designed Nights specifically as an androgynous character. The team conducted research on dreaming and <b>REM</b> <b>sleep,</b> and was influenced by the works and theories of psychoanalysts Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. An analogue controller, known as the Saturn 3D controller, was designed alongside the game and was included with some retail copies sold.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E

The hypothesis that there are differences in the temporal reference of the mnemonic sources of <b>REM</b> and <b>sleep</b> onset dreams has been confirmed. Day residues are significantly more associated with <b>sleep</b> onset than <b>REM</b> dreams. Moreover, in sleep onset, Day residues are significantly more frequent than Remote residues, while this is not true for REM dreams. Day residues are more easily available to <b>sleep</b> onset than <b>REM</b> dreaming because of the recent encoding which characterizes this kind of memory traces.

25|$|REM Stage (<b>REM</b> <b>Sleep</b> – 20–25% {{of total}} sleep in adults): <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> is where most muscles are paralyzed, and heart rate, {{breathing}} and body temperature become unregulated. <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> {{is turned on}} by acetylcholine secretion and is inhibited by neurons that secrete monoamines including serotonin. REM is {{also referred to as}} paradoxical sleep because the sleeper, although exhibiting high-frequency EEG waves similar to a waking state, is harder to arouse than at any other sleep stage. Vital signs indicate arousal and oxygen consumption by the brain is higher than when the sleeper is awake. <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> is characterized by high global cerebral blood flow, comparable to wakefulness. In fact, many areas in the cortex have been recorded to have more blood flow during <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> than even wakefulness- this includes the hippocampus, temporal-occipital areas, some parts of the cortex, and basal forebrain. The limbic and paralimbic system including the amygdala are other active regions during <b>REM</b> <b>sleep.</b> Though the brain activity during <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> appears very similar to wakefulness, the main difference between REM and wakefulness is that, arousal in REM is more effectively inhibited. This, along with the virtual silence of monoaminergic neurons in the brain, may be said to characterize REM.|$|E
25|$|Chronic use {{of alcohol}} used to induce sleep can lead to insomnia: {{frequent}} moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches and diaphoresis. Stopping chronic alcohol abuse {{can also lead to}} profound disturbances of sleep with vivid dreams. Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> and <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> fragmentation.

25|$|The neural {{control of}} normal sleep {{states and the}} {{relationship}} to narcolepsy are only partially understood.

The changes in the motor and proprioceptive systems during <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> have been studied in both human and animal models. During normal <b>REM</b> <b>sleep,</b> spinal and brainstem alpha motor neuron hyperpolarization produces almost complete atonia of skeletal muscles via an inhibitory descending reticulospinal pathway.

40|$|Background We {{previously}} {{suggested that}} abnormal sleep behaviors, i. e., {{as found in}} parasomnias, may often be the expression of increased activity of the reward system during sleep. Because nightmares and sleepwalking predominate during <b>REM</b> and NREM <b>sleep</b> respec-tively, we tested here whether exploratory excitability, a waking personality trait reflecting high activity within the mesolimbic dopaminergic (ML-DA) system, {{may be associated with}} specific changes in <b>REM</b> and NREM <b>sleep</b> patterns in these two sleep disorders. Methods Twenty-four unmedicated patients with parasomnia (12 with chronic sleepwalking and 12 with idiopathic nightmares) and no psychiatric comorbidities were studied. Each patient spent one night of sleep monitored by polysomnography. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) was administered to all patients and healthy controls from the Geneva popu-lation (n = 293). Result...|$|R
50|$|Empirically, it is a {{ultradian rhythm}} of {{approximately}} 90 minutes (80-120 minutes) that {{is characterized by}} different level of excitement and rest. The cycle is mediated by the human biological clock. It is most readily observed in stages of sleep, for example, rapid eye movement <b>sleep</b> (<b>REM)</b> and the delta activity cycle.|$|R
5000|$|Sleep {{studies can}} also {{determine}} problems with stages of sleep. The two primary categories of sleep are non-{{rapid eye movement}} (NREM) and rapid eye movement <b>sleep</b> (<b>REM).</b> Normally, four to five series of NREM and REM make up a night's sleep. A change in this cycle may {{make it hard to}} sleep soundly.|$|R
25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} {{of sleep}} paralysis {{has not been}} concretely identified, although there are several theories about its cause. The first of these stems from the understanding that sleep paralysis is a parasomnia resulting from dysfunctional overlap of the REM and waking stages of sleep. Polysomnographic studies found that individuals who experience sleep paralysis have shorter <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> latencies than normal along with shortened NREM and <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> cycles, and fragmentation of <b>REM</b> <b>sleep.</b> This study supports the observation that disturbance of regular sleeping patterns can instigate an episode of sleep paralysis, because fragmentation of <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> commonly occurs when sleep patterns are disrupted and has now been seen in combination with sleep paralysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> is physiologically {{different}} from the other phases of sleep, which are collectively referred to as non-REM sleep (NREM sleep, NREMS, synchronized sleep). REM and non-REM sleep alternate within one sleep cycle, which lasts about 90 minutes in adult humans. As sleep cycles continue, they shift towards a higher proportion of <b>REM</b> <b>sleep.</b> The transition to <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> brings marked physical changes, beginning with electrical bursts called PGO waves originating in the brain stem. Organisms in <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> suspend central homeostasis, allowing large fluctuations in respiration, thermoregulation, and circulation which do not occur in any other modes of sleeping or waking. The body abruptly loses muscle tone, a state known as REM atonia.|$|E
25|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (<b>REM)</b> <b>sleep</b> {{is a normal}} stage of sleep characterized by rapid movements of the eyes. <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> is classified into two categories: tonic and phasic. The phenomenon of <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> and its association with dreaming was discovered by Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman with assistance from William C. Dement, a medical student at the time, in 1952 during their tenures at the University of Chicago. Kleitman and Aserinsky's seminal article was published September 10, 1953.|$|E

25|$|There are {{significant}} similarities between sleep in birds {{and sleep in}} mammals, {{which is one of}} the reasons for the idea that sleep in higher animals with its division into <b>REM</b> and NREM <b>sleep</b> has evolved together with warm-bloodedness. Birds compensate for sleep loss in a manner similar to mammals, by deeper or more intense SWS (slow-wave sleep).|$|R
25|$|In narcolepsy, {{the order}} and length of NREM and <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> periods are disturbed, with <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> {{occurring}} at sleep onset instead of {{after a period of}} NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (<b>REM)</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{sentinel}} {{hypothesis of}} <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> was {{put forward by}} Frederick Snyder in 1966. It {{is based upon the}} observation that <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> in several mammals (the rat, the hedgehog, the rabbit, and the rhesus monkey) is followed by a brief awakening. This does not occur for either cats or humans, although humans are more likely to wake from <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> than from NREM sleep. Snyder hypothesized that <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> activates an animal periodically, to scan the environment for possible predators. This hypothesis does not explain the muscle paralysis of REM sleep; however, a logical analysis might suggest that the muscle paralysis exists to prevent the animal from fully waking up unnecessarily, and allowing it to return easily to deeper sleep.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{in general}} aids memory. <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> may favor the {{preservation}} of certain types of memories: specifically, procedural memory, spatial memory, and emotional memory. In rats, <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> increases following intensive learning, especially several hours after, and sometimes for multiple nights. Experimental <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> deprivation has sometimes inhibited memory consolidation, especially regarding complex processes (e.g., how to escape from an elaborate maze). In humans, the best evidence for REM's improvement of memory pertains to learning of procedures—new ways of moving the body (such as trampoline jumping), and new techniques of problem solving. REM deprivation seemed to impair declarative (i.e., factual) memory only in more complex cases, such as memories of longer stories. <b>REM</b> <b>sleep</b> apparently counteracts attempts to suppress certain thoughts.|$|E
