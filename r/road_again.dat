5|$|The road, {{also known}} as Old Post Road, was {{incorporated}} in 1813 as the Elk and Christiana Turnpike {{in order to get}} more money for repairs. The turnpike was completed in April 1817. As a turnpike, tolls were collected to pay for the maintenance of the road. The construction of the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad lowered the revenues of the turnpike and it became a public <b>road</b> <b>again</b> in 1838. The road historically went through agricultural areas; however, the surroundings have become more developed over the years. Much of the Old Baltimore Pike remains two lanes.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 93 northwest of Congress and southeast of Nothing. Beginning at US 93 southbound, SR 97 crosses US 93 northbound after several feet. It crosses through a desert region in a northeasterly direction, meeting {{a dirt road}} that connects back to US 93. SR 97 curves northward before heading eastward at an intersection with Burro Creek <b>Road.</b> <b>Again</b> turning northeastward, the roadway meets various local roads, most of them dirt. The highway meets its northern terminus at SR 96, which continues northwestward toward Bagdad.|$|E

Not long after Malcolm's arrival, the band recorded their act for posterity by filming two concerts at Detroit's Traxx club.

They purchased their first 8-track recorder at this time, and used it to record two songs later used on the A-side of Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis.|$|E
5|$|M-204 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with M-22 (Manitou Trail) south of Leland next to Duck Lake.

Route434 heads to the northeast, passing businesses and homes before leaving the community. The highway then gets into a more scenic rural region, with trees surrounding the highway. Route434, which makes several curves {{for the next few}} miles, passes to the south of a lake. The highway continues on for several miles in this way. A short time later, the highway passes a couple homes and crosses Shohola Creek. Just north of the creek, the area becomes somewhat urbanized with homes beginning to surround the <b>road</b> <b>again.</b> However, this does not last long, with forests returning once more. Just north of the community, Route434 intersects U.S. Route6.|$|E
5|$|The route briefly {{forms the}} border between the borough of Hatboro to the east and Upper Moreland Township to the west before fully {{entering}} Hatboro past the Newington Drive intersection.

At this point, the route crosses the Pennypack Creek and heads into downtown Hatboro as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The route turns north at Byberry Road and becomes North York Road at the Moreland Avenue intersection before it comes to a junction with the western terminus of PA 332 (East Montgomery Avenue).

50|$|As the Interstate Highway System {{approached}} completion {{during the}} 1980s, states began constructing toll <b>roads</b> <b>again</b> to provide new controlled-access highways {{which were not}} part of the original interstate system funding. Houston's outer beltway of interconnected toll roads began in 1983, and many states followed {{over the last two decades}} of the 20th century adding new toll roads, including the tollway system around Orlando, Florida, Colorado's E-470, and Georgia State Route 400.|$|R

5|$|K-383 and US-36 {{intersect}} K-261, a spur serving Prairie Dog State Park, {{before reaching}} the city of Norton. The highways curve northeast and back east and pass through {{the northern part of}} the city as Holme Street, a four-lane undivided road. K-383 and US-36 intersect US-283 (State Street) north of the downtown area. The highways become a two-lane <b>road</b> <b>again</b> as they leave Norton. K-383 and US-36 cross over the Kyle Railroad and begin to parallel the railroad and Prairie Dog Creek. The highways meet the southern end of K-67, a spur serving the Norton Correctional Facility, before they diverge. US-36 continues east and K-383 heads northeast parallel to the Kyle Railroad through the hamlet of Calvert. The state highway meets the northern end of K-60 just before it crosses over the Kyle Railroad on the edge of the city of Almena. K-383 continues east parallel to the Nebraska Kansas Colorado Railway into Phillips County. After they pass through the city of Long Island, that railroad splits to the north into Nebraska. K-383 passes through the village of Woodruff shortly before it reaches its northern terminus at US-183 about one half-mile south of the Nebraska state line.|$|E
5|$|MD 170 intersects the Baltimore Light Rail {{again and}} begins to {{parallel}} it as a two-lane road with a center turn lane. The light rail veers away to the east shortly before the highway's intersection with MD 762 (Andover Road), where the center turn lane ends. MD 170 enters Linthicum and intersects the light rail line a third time {{and begins to}} parallel it again shortly before the Linthicum station {{in the center of}} the community. The highway intersects MD 169 (Maple Road) and expands to a four-lane divided highway shortly before its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). There is no access from MD 170 to eastbound I-695 or from westbound I-695 to MD 170. The highway reduces to a two-lane <b>road</b> <b>again</b> and passes the North Linthicum station just south of MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard) in the center of Pumphrey. MD 170 continues northeast as Belle Grove Road, which veers away from the light rail line. The highway parallels the Patapsco River and passes under I-895 Spur (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) before entering Brooklyn Park. There, MD 170 reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with MD 2, Jack Street, and Hanover Street at the Baltimore city limits. MD 2 heads south as Governor Ritchie Highway toward Glen Burnie and north into the city as Potee Street.|$|E
5|$|Past this intersection, {{the road}} enters Snow Hill, where it becomes Church Street, and heads into {{inhabited}} areas with some businesses.

Within the downtown, the road passes by the Julia A. Purnell Museum and the Worcester County Courthouse. Here, MD 12 turns north to follow Washington Street, crossing the Pocomoke River out of downtown Snow Hill on a drawbridge.

5|$|Route 126 {{starts at}} the Kansas state line, where K-126 ends. The road travels east for around seven miles in a {{straight}} line, intersecting Route M and Route 43. Route 126 continues eastward, crossing through farmland and a few trees. After the route intersects Route J, it meets a frontage road parallel to I-49/US 71. The road crosses over North Fork Spring River and continues east. Soon, Route 126 intersects I-49/US 71 at a diamond interchange, and intersects a frontage <b>road</b> <b>again.</b> The route crosses a railroad owned by Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad, and intersects Routes JJ and T. Four miles later, the route enters Golden City and becomes Main Street. It becomes concurrent with Route 37. The routes goes through downtown Golden City, and turn slightly northeast. The two routes end at US 160 at a T-intersection. US 160 continues eastward toward Lockwood. In 2012, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 840 vehicles traveling east of I-49/US 71, and as few as 480 vehicles traveling west of I-49/US 71.
