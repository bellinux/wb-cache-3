40|$|Background: Aortic {{pressure}} waveforms {{are calculated}} non-invasively by applying generalized transfer functions (GTF) to tonometric radial pressure waveforms. Input errors mainly during acquisition and calibration of tonometric pressures are '' transferred '' to aortic pressure calculation. The present study aimed {{to quantify the}} proportion of specific input errors which is '' transferred '' by the GTFs {{in a wide range}} of hemodynamic conditions and for different error combinations in brachial systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure measurements. Methods: Aortic pulse wave analysis was performed in 103 subjects (52 normotensive and 51 untreated hypertensive) by the SphygmoCor (R) System. Each pressure waveform was initially calibrated by sphygmomanometrical brachial pressures. Isolated, parallel and <b>reverse</b> <b>errors</b> in brachial SBP/DBP from - 10 to + 10 mmHg were simulated, by recalibration of the recorded radial pressure waveforms, inducing specific '' errors '' of GTF-input values. For every recalculated aortic SBP and DBP, the difference from the initial estimated value was considered to represent the '' transferred error '' to the aortic pressure estimation. Results: Parallel errors by 5 mmHg in both SBP and DBP resulted to an identical change in GTF-derived aortic pressures, as expected. When an overestimation in SBP by 5 mmHg and an underestimation in DBP by - 5 mmHg occurred (<b>reverse</b> <b>errors),</b> almost 56 % of this error (- 2. 8 mmHg) was transferred. An isolated error in brachial SBP by 5 mmHg was transmitted by 76 % (- 3. 8 mmHg) to GTF-derived aortic SBP. In subjects with mean blood pressure > 117 mmHg or with heart rates < 74 bpm, a greater percent of the calibration error was transferred to GTF-derived blood pressures. Conclusions: Input errors in brachial pressure values result in a quantifiable effect on transfer function output (aortic pressures). The percent of the '' error transfer '' by the GTFs depends on heart rate and BP levels, which should be taken into account when applying GTFs at populations with different hemodynamic conditions.

40|$|Characteristic {{distributions}} of errors across fixed ratio schedules of reinforcement were studied for {{two types of}} discrimination paradigms. Two experiments studied error patterns {{as a function of}} hypothesis behavior in two species of animals, children and pigeons. Three key zero-delay matching-to-sample and two key simultaneous discrimination were reinforced for both species of animals on fixed ratio schedules of reinforcement. Experiment 1 involved children on matching-to-sample and simultaneous discrimination, and Experiment 2 involved pigeons on matching-to-sample and simultaneous discrimination. Both species of subjects experienced experimental conditions in which shift or stay response hypotheses were selectively reinforced using a high speed digital computer. Data protocols were scored into four exhaustive error classes; winstay, lose - shift; win-shift, lose-stay; win - stay, lose-stay; and win-shift, lose-shift errors. These four error types were scored by frequency of occurrence and response latency for the ordinal positions of the fixed ratio. Two types of error patterns were defined for individual subjects. A standard error pattern was defined as having 15 % more first half ratio errors than last half ratio <b>errors.</b> A <b>reversed</b> <b>error</b> pattern was defined as having 15 % more last half ratio errors than first half ratio errors. Experimental results indicated that selective reinforcement of particular response hypotheses produced only small effects for either species of animal on matching-to-sample or simultaneous discrimination. Response latencies for matching-to-sample and simultaneous discrimination were divided into two classes. The first class included long latency responses occurring immediately after reinforcement for children and pigeons. The second class included shorter latencies in the succeeding ordinal positions of the ratio for children and pigeons. A majority of standard error patterns were produced when the total errors were separated into specific error types for low accuracy subjects of both species. The standard error pattern was lost for total errors due to a very high frequency of win-shift, lose-shift errors which were not distributed in any characteristic pattern. Higher accuracy subjects of both species tended to show a majority of <b>reversed</b> <b>error</b> patterns or no patterning when total errors were separated into error types. These subjects had very low frequencies of win-shift, lose-shift errors. The high frequency of win-shift, lose-shift errors in both species of animals across discrimination paradigms could be due to the complexity of the discrimination, a developmental age base for human subjects, or a 0 -second intertrial interval...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} {{to the construction of}} classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with {{only a small percentage of}} "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the <b>reverse</b> <b>error.</b> Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C 4. 5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier.

40|$|Recent work by [1, 2] {{suggests}} that human sentence processing maintains uncertainty in input representations and reconciles it with prior grammatical knowledge. Here we explore {{the prediction of}} such rational noisy-channel theories that morphosyntactic production errors and comprehension garden-pathing should be inducible when context strongly biases expectations about syntactic category. We use unambiguous NN-phrases (“The voter hope”) differing in a single morpheme from unambiguous NV-phrases (“The voter hoped”). A noisy-channel model where morphemic realization errors are possible makes four key predictions regarding the processing of such phrases. First, the Bayesian size principle [3, 4] predicts that producers should complete NN-preambles as NV-preambles, creating apparent verb omission errors (1), more often than the <b>reverse</b> <b>error.</b> The NN-preamble can be produced from the NV-preamble by deleting a morpheme, whereas producing the NV-preamble from the NN-preamble requires inserting a morpheme. Because there are more ways to choose a random morpheme to insert than to delete, the posterior probability of NV given NN must be higher than NN given NV. Second, verb omission error rate should be higher the greater the NV bias of the phrase. Third, repetition errors for the preambles should pattern with other production errors: adding past or present tense morphology to NN-preambles should be more common than removing it from NV-preambles. Fourth, in comprehension, {{it should be possible}} to garden-path readers of “unambiguous ” NN-preambles onto N...|$|R

5000|$|Homeostasis {{does not}} govern every {{activity}} in the body. For instance the signal (be it via neurons or hormones) from the sensor to the effector is, of necessity, highly variable in order to convey information about the direction and magnitude of the error detected by the sensor. [...] Similarly the effector’s response needs to be highly adjustable to <b>reverse</b> the <b>error</b> - in fact it should be very nearly in proportion (but in the opposite direction) to the error that is threatening the internal environment. For instance, the arterial blood pressure in mammals is homeostatically controlled, and measured by stretch receptors in {{the walls of the}} aortic arch and carotid sinuses at beginnings of the internal carotid arteries. The sensors send messages via sensory nerves to the medulla oblongata of the brain indicating whether the blood pressure has fallen or risen, and by how much. The medulla oblongata then distributes messages along motor or efferent nerves belonging to the autonomic nervous system {{to a wide variety of}} effector organs, whose activity is consequently changed to <b>reverse</b> the <b>error</b> in the blood pressure. One of the effector organs is the heart whose rate is stimulated to rise (tachycardia) when the arterial blood pressure falls, or to slow down (bradycardia) when the pressure rises above set point. Thus the heart rate (for which there is no sensor in the body) is not homeostatically controlled, but is one of effector responses to errors in the arterial blood pressure. Another example is the rate of sweating. This is one of the effectors in the homeostatic control of body temperature, and therefore highly variable in rough proportion to the heat load that threatens to destabilize the body’s core temperature, for which there is a sensor in the hypothalamus of the brain.|$|R
