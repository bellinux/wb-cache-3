25|$|In the US {{and in most}} of {{the western}} world, skydivers are {{required}} to carry two parachutes. The <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> must be periodically inspected and re-packed (whether used or not) by a certified parachute rigger (in the US, an FAA certificated parachute rigger). Many skydivers use an automatic activation device (AAD) that opens the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> at a pre-determined altitude if it detects that the skydiver is still in free fall. Depending on the country, AADs are often mandatory for new jumpers, and/or required for all jumpers regardless of their experience level. Most skydivers wear a visual altimeter, and an increasing number also use audible altimeters fitted to their helmets.|$|E
25|$|The {{airborne}} divisions were disbanded {{after the}} Second World War, {{with only the}} 2nd Parachute Brigade (1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions) remaining. In February 1948, it was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade and posted to the British Army on the Rhine. The brigade remained in Germany until October 1949, when it relocated to Aldershot, which became {{the home of the}} Parachute Regiment for the next 50 years. The Territorial Army (TA) reformed after the war and raised the 16th Airborne Division with nine parachute battalions (10th to 18th) in three parachute brigades. The division was disbanded in the 1956 defence cuts, leaving the 44th Independent Parachute Brigade as the only <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> formation. The remaining reserve battalions were the 10th (City of London), 12th (Yorkshire), 13th (Lancashire), 15th (Scottish) and 17th (Durham Light Infantry). Further reductions resulted in the amalgamation of the 12th and 13th Battalions soon afterwards. In 1967, the TA battalions were reduced again, the 12th, 13th and 17th being amalgamated to reform the 4th Battalion. The 44th Independent Parachute Brigade was disbanded in 1977, leaving the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> battalions as independent units. Following the Falklands War in November 1983, the 5th Airborne Brigade was formed for out-of-area operations. The brigade consisted of two of the parachute battalions and its own parachute trained artillery, engineers, medics, signals and logistics units. The Options for Change restructuring after the Cold War again reduced the number of TA battalions. The 4th and 15th Battalions were amalgamated in 1993 as the 4th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion was disbanded. The 5th Airborne Brigade lasted until the 1999 Strategic Defence Review, which recommended that the 5th Airborne and 24th Airmobile Brigade be amalgamated as the 16th Air Assault Brigade.|$|E
25|$|The Parachute Regiment {{had their}} own {{distinctive}} uniform: the maroon beret at first with the Army Air Corps cap badge and from May 1943 the Parachute Regiment cap badge which is still in use today. Parachute wings were worn on the right shoulder above the airborne forces patch of Bellerophon riding the flying horse Pegasus. On operations, Paras wore the airborne forces pattern steel helmet instead of the normal Brodie helmet. Initially they wore a 'jump jacket' modelled on the German Fallschirmjäger jacket. After 1942, the Denison smock was issued as the first camouflaged uniform for the British Army. In 1943, a green sleeveless jacket was designed to wear over the Denison smock when parachuting. British Paras did not use a <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute,</b> as the War Office considered the £60 cost a waste of money.|$|E

25|$|Advanced Airborne Package – Extremely {{important}} to Force Recon for inserting Marines behind enemy lines. In this three-week period, Marines will transition from conventional Low Level Static Line (LLSL) insertions into the hallmark HAHO techniques. Usually {{it consists of}} consecutive night jumps with night combat equipment, but HAHO training {{is done in the}} Paraloft of the S3 Section using a complex virtual reality-based (VR) computer system. While wearing a VR headset device, the Marines hang suspended from the Paraloft ceiling that resembles the MC-5 Ram Air parachute. Many simulations are factored in this Virtual Reality Parachute Simulation; it allows the Marine to jump at high altitudes and visually check his main canopy for proper deployment, alleviate malfunctions, to cutaway and deploy a <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute,</b> then employ guidance and control to an unmarked drop zone (DZ).|$|E
500|$|They also {{disclosed}} that Cooper chose the older {{of the two}} primary parachutes supplied to him, rather than the technically superior professional sport parachute; and that from the two reserve parachutes, he selected a [...] "dummy"—an unusable unit with an inoperative ripcord intended for classroom demonstrations, although it had clear markings identifying it to any experienced skydiver as non-functional. (He cannibalized the other, functional <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute,</b> possibly using its shrouds to tie the money bag shut, and to secure the bag to his body as witnessed by Mucklow) The FBI stressed that inclusion of the dummy <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute,</b> one of four obtained in haste from a Seattle skydiving school, was accidental.|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 1980, {{at about}} 8:45a.m. CST, 33-year-old Kenneth Swyers of Overland, Missouri, {{parachute}}d {{onto the top}} of the arch. His plan was to release his main parachute and then jump off the arch using his <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> to perform a base jump. Unfortunately, after landing the wind blew him to the side, and he slid down the north leg to his death. The accident was witnessed by several people, including Swyers' wife, also a parachutist. She said her husband [...] "was not a hot dog, daredevil skydiver" [...] and that he had prepared for the jump two weeks in advance. Swyers, who had made over 1,600 jumps before the incident, was reported by one witness to have [...] "landed very well" [...] on {{the top of the}} arch, but [...] "had no footing." [...] Swyers was reportedly blown to the top of the arch by the wind and was unable to save himself when his <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> failed to deploy. The Federal Aviation Administration said the jump was unauthorized, and investigated the pilot involved in the incident.|$|E

50|$|Stephen Paul Hilder (12 December 1982 - 4 July 2003) was a 20-year-old Officer Cadet at the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom in Shrivenham, Wiltshire, England. On 4 July 2003, Hilder fell 4000 m to {{his death}} when, during a skydive, both his main and <b>reserve</b> <b>parachutes</b> failed.|$|R
2500|$|If a skydiver {{experiences}} a malfunction of their main parachute which they cannot correct, they pull a [...] "cut-away" [...] {{handle on the}} front right-hand side of their harness (on the chest) which will release the main canopy from the harness/container. Once free from the malfunctioning main canopy, the reserve canopy can be activated manually by pulling a second handle on the front left harness. Some containers are fitted with a connecting line from the main to reserve parachutes – known as a reserve static line (RSL) – which pulls open the reserve container faster than a manual release could. Whichever method is used, a spring-loaded pilot-chute then extracts the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> from {{the upper half of}} the container.|$|E
2500|$|Equipment failure rarely causes {{fatalities}} and injuries. Approximately one in 750 deployments of a {{main parachute}} {{result in a}} malfunction. Ram-air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably when malfunctioning, and must be jettisoned before deploying the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute.</b> [...] Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently; they are also designed more conservatively and built and tested to more exacting standards so they are more reliable than main parachutes, but the real safety advantage comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction although {{the possibility of a}} main malfunction that cannot be cutaway causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk.|$|E
2500|$|Riflemen were {{required}} to carry a panga, {{which could be used}} to chop down bush to create a landing zone so that helicopters could extract them. [...] Strangely, some riflemen tried not to carry this piece of equipment, while some gunners and stop commanders (also known as stick leaders and whose rank varied from Trooper to Captain) did carry them. Only the Stop Commanders carried mini-flares. [...] These devices were about {{the size and shape of}} a large pencil, which were used to signal positions, though never at night, and were popular with the troops. The parachute harnesses were Saviac Mk1s, of U.S. manufacture. They were extremely reliable with a <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> on the chest. The parachutes were overhead static line.|$|E

50|$|The {{spring-loaded}} {{pilot chute}} {{is used in}} conjunction with a ripcord. When the user pulls the ripcord, the container opens, allowing the pilot chute compressed inside and loaded with a large spring inside it to jump out. Spring-loaded pilot chutes are mainly used to deploy <b>reserve</b> <b>parachutes.</b> They are often also used to deploy the main parachute on skydiving students' parachute equipment.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} Redstone's engine shut down, the Mercury capsule's escape rocket jettisoned itself, leaving the capsule {{attached}} to the Redstone booster. The escape rocket rose to an altitude of 4000 ft and landed about 400 yd away. Three seconds after the escape rocket fired, the capsule deployed its drogue parachute; it then deployed the main and <b>reserve</b> <b>parachutes,</b> ejecting the radio antenna fairing in the process.|$|R
50|$|The Skyhook is United Parachute Technologies {{version of}} a Main-Assisted Reserve Deployment system (MARD), a safety feature on skydiving {{parachute}} systems. It builds on the concept underlying an ordinary reserve static line (RSL), which uses {{the force of the}} departing main parachute to open the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> compartment after the malfunctioning main parachute is cut-away, by further using the force of the departing main parachute to extract the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> out of the reserve compartment. This greatly decreases the time, and hence loss of altitude, required to fully open the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Exact {{numbers are}} {{difficult}} to estimate because parachute design, maintenance, loading, packing technique and operator experience has {{a significant impact on}} malfunction rates. Approximately one in a thousand sport main parachute openings malfunctions, requiring the use of the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute,</b> although some skydivers have many thousands of jumps and never needed to use their <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Modified Improved <b>Reserve</b> <b>Parachute</b> System (MIRPS) {{includes}} a standard T-10 <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> canopy assembly, integrated with a commercial deployment assistance device {{composed of a}} bridle line, pilot parachute, and spring. The pack tray {{includes a}} line bag for stowing suspension lines and an inner staging flap that holds the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> until sufficient tension is achieved through the bridle/pilot parachute assembly during deployment. The MIRPS pack tray is slightly larger {{than that of the}} T-10 reserve pack tray so it can accommodate a larger pilot chute, spring, and bridle. The pack tray has a yellow stripe along the rip cord protector flap and is made of nylon textile materials commonly used to make parachute systems.|$|E

5000|$|A {{parachute}} {{is carefully}} folded, or [...] "packed" [...] {{to ensure that}} it will open reliably. If a parachute is not packed properly it can result in a malfunction where the main parachute fails to deploy correctly or fully. In the United States and many developed countries, emergency and <b>reserve</b> <b>parachutes</b> are packed by [...] "riggers" [...] who must be trained and certified according to legal standards. Sport skydivers are always trained to pack their own primary [...] "main" [...] parachutes.|$|R

50|$|The reserve canopy is a {{derivative}} of the British Low Level Parachute (LLP) aero-conical design that includes apex scoop pockets {{at the top}} of the reserve canopy and skirt assist lines at the system’s hem to promote fast opening of the reserve system during low-speed malfunctions. Unlike the current <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> system, the T-11R reserve uses an omni-directional, center-pull deployment system. The T-11 harness is designed to displace opening shock forces of the <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> equally along the long axis of the jumper’s body.|$|E
50|$|A {{ballistic}} parachute, ballistic <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute,</b> or emergency ballistic <b>reserve</b> <b>parachute</b> is {{a parachute}} {{ejected from the}} casing by a small explosion, much like that used in an ejection seat. The advantage of the ballistic parachute over a conventional parachute is that it ejects the parachute canopy, causing it to open rapidly, this makes it ideal for attaching to small aircraft, hang gliders and microlights, where an emergency situation may occur {{in close proximity to}} the ground. In such a situation a conventional parachute would not open quickly enough.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{risk factor}} is that of [...] "canopy {{collisions}}", or collisions between two or more skydivers under fully inflated parachutes. Canopy collisions can cause the jumpers' inflated parachutes to entangle with each other, often resulting in a sudden collapse (deflation) {{of one or more}} of the involved parachutes. When this occurs, the jumpers often must quickly perform emergency procedures (if there is sufficient altitude to do so) to [...] "cut-away" [...] (jettison) from their main canopies and deploy their reserve canopies. Canopy collisions are particularly dangerous when occurring at altitudes too low to allow the jumpers adequate time to safely jettison their main parachutes and fully deploy their <b>reserve</b> <b>parachutes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the high}} flight speed (30-145 km/h or 20-90 mph), and close {{proximity}} to the slope and obstacles, injury and death are considerable risks in this sport. Over 25 pilots have already suffered fatal injuries worldwide since 2006. Also, because of its small size and high wing loading, the wing responds quickly to little pilot input which makes professional instruction very important. However, the high velocities help the glider remain pressurized and resistant to collapse even in turbulent conditions. Proper equipment such as helmets, padded harnesses, and <b>reserve</b> <b>parachutes</b> can help reduce injuries. Advanced wing and ski training, and thorough knowledge of site conditions and hazards are imperative to practicing this sport safely.|$|R
