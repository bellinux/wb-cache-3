40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>rioprostil,</b> a PGE 1 analogue, on the interdigestive {{motility}} {{of the upper}} human small intestine was investigated in 8 normal volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. <b>Rioprostil</b> was administered intraduodenally in a dose of 600 micrograms. The myoelectrical activity was recorded simultaneously at 8 different levels of the jejunum, at 10 cm intervals. <b>Rioprostil,</b> 600 micrograms, does not disrupt the migrating motor complex (MMC) and {{does not change the}} characteristics of phase 3 of the MMC, except for an increased propagation velocity. The main effect of <b>rioprostil,</b> 600 micrograms, is a marked inhibition of phase 2 contractions without induction of propulsive motility patterns during phase 2. This may explain why <b>rioprostil</b> in a dose of 600 micrograms is not markedly diarrheogenic in man. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is a {{double-blind}} evaluation of the efficacy and safety of <b>rioprostil,</b> 300 micrograms, compared with ranitidine, 150 mg, when given twice a day for 4 or 8 weeks in patients with active, uncomplicated gastric ulcer disease. A total of 194 patients are entered into the study, of which 182 are statistically evaluated for efficacy. Eighty-seven receive <b>rioprostil</b> and 95 receive ranitidine. All patients receive two oral doses of study medication daily. After 4 weeks' treatment, 47. 1 % of the patients receiving <b>rioprostil</b> are endoscopically healed compared with 53. 7 % of those receiving ranitidine. After 8 weeks' treatment, the cumulative cure rates are 76. 2 % and 80. 9 % respectively. Side effects occur in 26 % of the patients receiving <b>rioprostil</b> and in 15 % of the patients receiving ranitidine. Gastrointestinal side effects are most common. Changes in stool consistency (i. e. soft stools or mild diarrhoea) are the most reported symptoms in patients receiving <b>rioprostil.</b> These effects are generally self-limiting. Three patients on <b>rioprostil</b> and one patient on ranitidine discontinue treatment due to side effects. No clinically significant changes in biochemical variables occur in either group throughout the treatment period. <b>Rioprostil,</b> 300 micrograms b. d., is a safe and effective treatment for gastric ulcer disease. Healing rates and alleviation of pain are comparable for both treatment groups. The change in stool consistency with <b>rioprostil</b> is of only minor clinical importance, that is, it occurs on about 2 % of treatment days. status: publishe...|$|E
