40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} {{successful}} strategies for forgetting cases in a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) system applied to autonomous robot navigation. This extends previous work that involved a CBR architecture which indexes cases by the spatio-temporal {{characteristics of the}} sensor data, and outputs or selects parameters of behaviors in a behavior-based robot architecture. In such a system, the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> can be applied when a new situation unlike any current case in the library is encountered, but the library is full. Various strategies <b>of</b> determining which <b>cases</b> to remove are proposed, including metrics such as how frequently a case is used and a novel spreading activation mechanism. Experimental results show that such mechanisms can increase {{the performance of the}} system significantly and allow it to essentially forget old environments in which it was trained in favor of new environments it is currently encountering. The performance of this new system is better than both a purely reactive behavior-based system as well as the CBR module that did not forget cases. Furthermore, such forgetting mechanisms can be useful even when there is no major environmental shift during training, since some cases can potentially be harmful or rarely used. The relationship between the forgetting mechanism and the case library size is also discussed. I...|$|R

The previous research was equivocal. This study investigates the pattern and progress of women's labours following LETZ, {{and the effect of}} the experience on women. It also explores the basis of clinical decisions made by midwives. It takes place in North East England and involves women giving birth in 2004 - 2005. The case study strategy brings together quantitative retrospective case control results, qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews from women and midwives, and guidelines and protocols surrounding assessment and management of labour. The quantitative data is from 111 women after LETZ and 214 controls, reducing to 94 and 150 respectively after <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> with confounding variables. Interviews are from four women, three individual midwives caring for one of the women and a focus group of four midwives. In the interviews, women gave no thought to how their births may be affected by LETZ, as no one had discussed the possibility with them. Women having their second baby after LETZ take less time to reach full dilatation; a result related to grade of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia. Women having their first baby after LETZ are 1. 8 {{times more likely to be}} admitted later in their labours, an important emergent issue that needs further research. Women having their first or second baby after LETZ are 2. 3 times more likely to have a premature birth, confirming indications in previous research. This study for the first time reveals important differences in pattern and progress of labour after LETZ. It adds to our knowledge of premature birth after LETZ. Midwives, obstetricians and colposcopists need to incorporate the study results into counselling of women before LETZ and during any pregnancy after LETZ.

Second, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> TIVAP is a surgical procedure that {{may interfere with}} {{the management of the}} ongoing sepsis [12 – 15].

Likewise, no study regarding the prognosis of TIVAP-related infections has been conducted outside the ICU [16 – 20]. In light with this, the present study was designed to address three main objectives: (1) to determine the proportion of confirmed TIVAP-related infections in a population of patients admitted in the ICU in whom a TIVAP was removed for life-threatening sepsis, (2) to identify predictive factors of confirmed TIVAP infection in patients admitted to the ICU and (3) to assess short- and long-term outcome of patients with TIVAP-related infection and compare them with their counterparts in whom TIVAP was removed without confirmation of infection.|$|R
