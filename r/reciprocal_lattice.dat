5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, {{and there may be}} disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the mean}} free path of low energy {{electrons}} in a crystal {{is only a few}} angstroms, only the first few atomic layers contribute to the diffraction. This means that there are no diffraction conditions in the direction perpendicular to the sample surface. As a consequence the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> of a surface is a 2D lattice with rods extending perpendicular from each lattice point. The rods can be pictured as regions where the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> points are infinitely dense.|$|E
25|$|Projected lattice {{geometries}} can {{be represented}} by so-called ‘lattice-fringe fingerprint plots’ (LFFPs), also called angular covariance plots. The horizontal axis of such a plot is given in <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> length and {{is limited by the}} point resolution of the microscope. The vertical axis is defined as acute angle between Fourier transformed lattice fringes or electron diffraction spots. A 2D data point is defined by the length of a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> vector and its (acute) angle with another <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> vector. Sets of 2D data points that obey Weiss’s zone law are subsets of the entirety of data points in an LFFP. A suitable search-match algorithm using LFFPs, therefore, tries to find matching zone axis subsets in the database. It is, essentially, a variant of a lattice matching algorithm.|$|E
25|$|These Bloch {{wave energy}} eigenstates are written with {{subscripts}} as ψn k, where n is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present {{because there are}} many different Bloch waves with the same k (each has a different periodic component u). Within a band (i.e., for fixed n), ψn k varies continuously with k, as does its energy. Also, for any <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> vector K, ψn k = ψn,(k+K). Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for k-values within the first Brillouin zone of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice.</b>|$|E

25|$|Figure 4 {{shows the}} Ewald's sphere {{for the case}} of normal {{incidence}} of the primary electron beam, as {{would be the case}} in an actual LEED setup. It is apparent that the pattern observed on the fluorescent screen is a direct picture of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> of the surface. The size of the Ewald's sphere and hence the number of diffraction spots on the screen is controlled by the incident electron energy. From the knowledge of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> models for the real space lattice can be constructed and the surface can be characterized at least qualitatively in terms of the surface periodicity and the point group. Figure 5.a shows a model of an unreconstructed (100) face of a simple cubic crystal and the expected LEED pattern. The spots are indexed according to the values of h and k.|$|E
25|$|If {{the sample}} is tilted {{with respect to the}} {{incident}} electron beam, one can obtain diffraction patterns from several crystal orientations.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the wavelength}} of an electron accelerated in a TEM {{is much smaller}} {{than that of the}} radiation usually used for X-ray diffraction experiments.

Detailed analysis of the optical response in a very wide spectral range (0. 4 ≤ a/λ ≤ 2, where a is the conventional lattice constant), as well as at perpendicular and off-normal directions, unambiguously shows that the interparticle distance coincides very approximately with the expected diameter only along directions contained in the same close-packed plane but differs significantly in directions oblique to the [111] one. A full description of the real and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattices</b> of actual opal films is provided, {{as well as of the}} photonic band structure of the proposed arrangement.

40|$|Electron {{diffraction}} {{has been}} used to carefully investigate the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattices</b> of a range of iron-bearing sphalerites looking for evidence of Fe clustering and/or Fe/Zn ordering in the form of either additional satellite reflections or a structured diffuse intensity distribution accompanying the strong Bragg reflections of the underlying sphalerite-type average structure. While a highly structured diffuse intensity distribution in the form of transverse polarized f 110 g sheets of diffuse intensity has been detected and found to be characteristic of all compositions,it does not appear to arise from Fe clustering and/or Fe/Zn ordering. Rather inherently low frequency,and therefore strongly thermally excited,phonon modes propagating along reciprocal space directions perpendicular to each of the six / 110 S real space directions of the average structure are suggested to be responsible for these f 110 g sheets of diffuse intensity. Monte Carlo simulation (for a range of Zn–S,Zn–Zn and S–S interaction strengths) and subsequent Fourier transformation is used to confirm the existence of these low-frequency phonon modes of distortion as well as to show that they are an intrinsic,predictable property of the corner-connected tetrahedral structure of sphalerite. The low-frequency phonon modes involve coupled (Zn,Fe) and S motion in one-dimensional strings along / 110 S real space directions...|$|R

25|$|In reality, {{there is}} {{interaction}} between the electrons {{with each other and}} the atomic cores of the crystal. This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an electronic band structure is formed. Measuring the momentum of one electronic state gives a distribution of momenta which are all separated by <b>reciprocal</b> <b>lattice</b> vectors. Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely filled bands (i.e. on an insulator) gives a continuous distribution. An ACAR measurement on a metal has discontinuities where bands cross the Fermi level in all Brillouin zones in reciprocal space. This discontinuous distribution is superimposed by a continuous distribution from the entirely filled bands. From the discontinuities the Fermi surface can be extracted.|$|E

The giant magnetocaloric effect of the R 5 (Six,Ge 1 -x) 4 alloys (where R=rare-earth and 0 ≤x≤ 1), which was discovered in 1997, make them perfect candidates for magnetic refrigeration applications. In this study the microstructures of Gd 5 (SixGe 1 -x) 4 alloys have been characterized using electron microscopy techniques, with the focus being on distinctive linear features first examined in 1999. These linear features have been observed in R 5 (Six,Ge 1 -x) 4 alloys prepared from different rare-earths (Gd, Tb, Dy and Er) with different crystal structures (Gd 5 Si 4 -type orthorhombic, monoclinic and Gd 5 Ge 4 -type orthorhombic). Systematic scanning electron microscope studies revealed that these linear features are actually thin-plates, which grow along specific directions in the matrix material. The crystal structure of the thin-plates has been determined as hexagonal with lattice parameters a=b= 8. 53 A and c= 6. 40 A, using selected area diffraction (SAD). Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis, carried out in both scanning and transmission electron microscopes, showed that the features have a composition approximating to R 5 (Six,Ge 1 -x) 3. phase. Orientation relationship between the matrix and the thin-plates has been calculated as [- 1010](1 - 211) p//[010](10 - 2) m. The growth direction of the thin plates are calculated as (22 0 19) and (- 22 0 19) by applying the Deltag approach of Zhang and Purdy to the SAD patterns of this system. High Resolution TEM images of the Gd 5 Ge 4 were used to study the crystallographic relationship.

40|$|Until now, {{progress}} of the microelectronic industry has been maintained by scaling devices. Physical limits now necessitate alternative approaches such as enhancing material properties through strain engineering or increasing functionality through use of Si/SiGe heterostructures (e. g. optoelectronic integration), requiring control of strain, which may enhance electrical properties but {{can also lead to}} deleterious structural and electronic effects. Strain can be controlled via growth of stress-balanced structures on a fully strain relaxed virtual substrate (VS) which acts as a growth template for, and maintains strain in, the active layers, which need to be ordered and defect free. The crystalline quality of the VS therefore impacts directly upon the device. These basic elements are realised in a molecular beam epitaxy system using gaseous hydride precursors. Compositionally graded VS are used to investigate strain-relaxation processes. High resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD) allowed examination of <b>lattice</b> <b>reciprocal</b> space, where compositional and strain information is dispersed. Localised distortions of the lattice revealed the mosaic nature of the structure. Nomarski contrast microscopy and atomic force microscopy enabled quantitative analysis of surface defects and roughness, including characteristic crosshatch. VS grading rates, growth temperatures and precursor fluxes were varied to assess relaxation kinetics. The nucleation and propagation of strain-relieving dislocations were investigated through the growth of different VS structures on vicinal Si(001) substrates. XRD analysis showed tilting of the epitaxial layer with respect to the substrate. A correlation of tilt angle with offcut angle was observed, following energy barrier asymmetries on the available slip systems. Development of the tilt was seen to be a non-linear function of both Ge composition and grading rate, and was explained by interdislocation interactions. Stress-balancing was investigated by designing distributed Bragg reflector stacks. Structures without detrimental strain relief were achieved, with a reflectance in excess of those reported in the literature, demonstrating the applicability of the VS growth and stress-balance methods. The elastic properties of SiGe could also be probed via this approach, and small deviations from linear interpolation of bulk Si and Ge values were found, supported by theoretical modelling.
