Bourdieu argued that there are also significant non-economic <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>distribution</b> effects social stratification and inequality.

40|$|Studies on the {{distribution}} of mammalian carnivores in fragmented landscapes have focused mainly on structural aspects such as patch and landscape features; similarly, habitat connectivity is usually associated with landscape structure. The influence of food resources on carnivore patch use and the important effect on habitat connectivity have been overlooked. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the relative importance of food resources on patch use patterns and to test if food availability can overcome structural constraints on patch use. We carried out a patch-use survey of two carnivores: the beech marten (Martes foina) and the badger (Meles meles) in a sample of 39 woodland patches in a fragmented landscape in central Italy. We used the logistic model to investigate the relative effects on carnivore distribution of patch, patch neighbourhood and landscape scale variables as well as the relative abundance of food resources. Our results show how carnivore movements in fragmented landscapes are determined not only by patch/landscape structure but also by the relative abundance of food resources. The important take-home message of our research is that, within certain structural limits (e. g. within certain limits of patch isolation), by modifying the relative amount of <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>distribution,</b> it is possible to increase suitability in smaller/relatively isolated patches. Conversely, however, there are certain thresholds above which an increase in resources will not achieve high probability of presence.

First, the level and growth rate of national income increased the risk of war by reducing the cost of organizing rebellions and the government’s ability to counteract the rebellions. Second, while regional ethnic dominance served {{as a basis for}} mobilization of rebellions, ethnic antagonism was also an obstacle to the expansion of civil wars beyond the province of origin.

40|$|In Vietnam, the {{remarkable}} economic growth {{that resulted from}} the doi moi (renovation) reforms was based largely on the rural households that had become the new basic unit of agricultural production in the early 1990 s. The technical, economic, and social changes that accompanied the decollectivization process transformed agricultural production, resource management, land use, and the institutions that defined access to <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>distribution.</b> Combined with the extreme biophysical, technical, and social heterogeneity encountered in the northern mountains, these rapid changes led to the extreme complexity of the agrarian dynamics that today challenges traditional diagnostic approaches. Since 1999, a participatory simulation method has been developed to disentangle the cause-and-effect relationships between the different driving forces and changes in land use observed at different scales. Several tools were combined to understand the interactions between human and natural systems, including a narrative conceptual model, an agent-based spatial computational model (ABM), a role-playing game, and a multiscale geographic information system (GIS). We synthesized into an ABM named SAMBA-GIS the knowledge generated from the above tools applied to {{a representative sample of}} research sites. The model takes explicitly into account the dynamic interactions among: (1) farmers' strategies, i. e., the individual decision-making process {{as a function of the}} farm's resource profile; (2) the institutions that define resource access and usage; and (3) changes in the biophysical and socioeconomic environment. The next step consisted of coupling the ABM with the GIS to extrapolate the application of local management rules to a whole landscape. Simulations are initialized using the layers of the GIS, e. g., land use in 1990, accessibility, soil characteristics, etc., and statistics available at the village level, e. g., population, ethnicity, livestock, etc. At each annual time step, the agrarian landscape changes according to the decisions made by agent-farmers about how to allocate resources such as labor force, capital, and land to different productive activities, e. g., crops, livestock, gathering of forest products, off-farm activities. The participatory simulations based on SAMBA-GIS helped identify villages with similar land-use change trajectories to which the same types of technical and/or institutional innovations could be applied. Scenarios of land-use changes were developed with local stakeholders to assess the potential impact of these changes on the natural resource base and on agricultural development.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For a large {{proportion}} of the world’s population, our inability to match water demand to its supply has meant a lack of provision of adequate water for domestic use. This has resulted in a significant loss of time and effort, especially on the part of women, who are often bear most of the burden of water collection. Economically, this loss of time represents a loss of human capital, and as a result, reduces the ability of the household to capitalise fully on its other resources. In order to address this problem, the challenge for the scientific and development community is to identify ways in which this capacity deprivation (Sen, 1999) can be reduced. If this can be achieved, a significant improvement in household wellbeing may result and poverty can be eradicated. As water stress increases across many nations of the world, the need for effective water management becomes more pressing. Physical science and hydrological modelling can provide us with detailed assessments of water resource availability, but little to date has been done to link this to our knowledge of human <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> geographical <b>distributions.</b> To achieve this, a more holistic approach needs to be taken to address the questions of water availability, and its relationship to human and ecological needs, and for this reason, efforts are being made to develop a water management tool known as the Water Poverty Index (WPI).

This study estimated the temporal variations of surface water <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> spatial <b>distribution</b> in the Mankran watershed of Ghana through the collection of recorded hydrological data in the bench mark watershedfrom 2008 to 2010. Since most inland valley rice cultivation highly depends on rainfall, the watershed precipitation data over a decadal period showed sufficient wet years with a potential to sustain a high cultivation of paddy rice. Peak wetness occurred in June and October over a bi-modal precipitation pattern. Rating curve data for the Mankran-kesse river-upstream depicted low discharge values despite having a higher stream order. Thus stream order alone was not sufficient to estimate water resources potential. It was presumed that the geomorphology and lithology of the highly porous river bed and the presence of high sub-surface water resources stored in this zone may be implicated for this observation. Provision of water storage options for zones like Kesse-upstream seems a feasible option in order to cater for supplementary irrigation while indirectly tapping on subsurface water resources stored in the porous aquifers through basin interflows. Base flow data also showed that the discharge from upstream locations to the downstream exit of the watershed was high through direct surface river discharge and subsurface interflow. The temporal patterns of the hydrology indicate that annual paddy rice cultivation is ideal between May and October...|$|R

Nevertheless, concerns {{on the availability of}} Li <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> uneven <b>distribution</b> across the world are growing. As an alternative, Na-ion batteries (NiBs) are highly attractive due to the abundance of Na as well as its electrochemical similarity with Li. Na is also environmentally benign, thus promising a more sustainable energy storage. Although NiBs are unlikely to outperform LiBs in energy density, they are being actively pursued for low-cost grid storage where size or weight is not the most critical factor. The identification of a high-performance anode is a key challenge, particularly for NiBs. Anode materials investigated so far for NiBs can be classified into three categories: (i) layered materials, such as titania or titanates and transition metal dichalcogenides with a specific capacity of 50 - 250 mAh g- 1; (ii) carbon-based materials, such as hard carbons; and (iii) nanostructures like nanowires and graphene-based carbon nanosheets offering capacities exceeding 300 mAh g- 1. Here, we present our recent results regarding novel nanostructured negative electrodes, comprising TiO 2 nanotubes, Ga 2 O 3 nanorods and graphene-based carbon nanowalls (Fig. 1). The resulting Li-/Na-ion cells exploting the newly elaborated nanostructures as working electrodes provide very high capacity retention even upon highly stressful conditions and very long-term cycling (up to > 2000 cycles). High surface area, self-induced doping, short diffusion path and fast kinetics of the nonostructured arrays are intriguing features, which can account for the noticeable electrochemical performance. Moreover, the characteristics and electrochemical behaviour of the annealed samples in comparison with the non-annealed ones were thoroughly investigated. These results demonstrate that stable, long-term performing nanostructured anodes, which can be obtained by fast and low cost procedures, are suitable for Li-/Na-ion battery applicatio...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises a close {{analysis of}} decentralization in Bolivia, employing a methodology that marries {{qualitative and quantitative}} techniques. It first examines the effects of decentralization on public-sector investment {{and the provision of}} public services in Bolivia using a unique database that includes measures of municipalities' social and institutional characteristics and information on its policy-making processes. I find that decentralization changed both the sectoral uses of public <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> geographic <b>distribution</b> significantly by increasing government sensitivity to local needs in human capital investment and the provision of basic services. I then investigate the determinants of central and local government investment respectively in order to investigate why the shift in regime produced such large changes in investment patterns. I then turn to a much deeper examination of local government via nine case studies, selected to broadly represent Bolivia's national diversity. I begin with an account of the workings of local government in the best and worst of these, analyzing the character and interactions of the major societal actors. I locate fundamental causes of good and bad government in the economic structure of a district {{as it relates to the}} political party system, and the cohesiveness and organizational capacity of its civil society. These ideas are used to build a conceptual model of the local government process in which the interactions of political, economic and civic actors reveal information and enforce accountability. I show how imbalances between them can cripple accountability and distort the policy-making process. Lastly, the dissertation tests the model by examining government performance in seven additional municipalities. I show that the framework can explain the emergence of good or bad government institutions, and thus the quality of government a district ultimately receives, through the interactions of key players —notably civic organizations — deep in the local political economy...|$|R

Building on a considerable legacy of existing operational web portals developed and used by the Structural Biology / WeNMR user community, WP 4 aims at provisioning a consistent einfrastructure to allow gradual integration of the existing isolated solutions to a single computing and data processing environment, based {{on the state of the}} art grid and cloud open source software tools and frameworks. This report follows the document D 4. 3, delivered at project month 15, and the document M 4. 4 delivered at month 24, so that only the progress achieved until project month 26 not already described previously will be reported here. The document starts with an updated description of the resources potentially available for the project from the EGI e-infrastructure, on top of which the consolidated West-Life platform is being built. It then presents a detailed view of <b>resource</b> usage <b>and</b> <b>their</b> geographical <b>distribution</b> in the second year of the project, as obtained from the EGI Accounting Portal. The remaining of the document reports the latest experiences and updates the activity plans on the consolidated job management mechanism, the programmatic access to datasets and the unified security and accounting model...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} impact of nectar availability for biological pest control is of increasing relevance due to the disappearance of non-crop plants in intensified agricultural landscapes. However, {{little is known about}} how floral <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> spatial <b>distribution</b> in <b>and</b> around crop fields influence cereal aphid parasitoid (Hymenoptera, Aphidiidae) survival and population dynamics. Cereal aphid parasitoids may be less dependent on flowers as they can use honeydew from their aphid hosts as an alternative food resource. However, honeydew appears to be less suitable as a food source for parasitoids when compared to nectar. Here the effects of flower distribution (nectar), aphid abundance (honeydew quantity) and honeydew quality on parasitoid life history parameters were explored using a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model. In addition, effects of the availability of floral resources in field margins on parasitism levels in winter wheat were investigated in a field study. In the simulation study three flower distributions were compared: (i) flowers restricted to the field margin (most common in agricultural landscapes) or (ii) flowers in strips within the crop, and (iii) random flower distribution in the field. Simulations suggest that nectar feeding increases parasitoid longevity and parasitism at low aphid densities, but only in fields with randomly distributed flowers. In contrast, the spatial distribution of flowers did not affect the parasitoid longevity and parasitism rate at high aphid densities, where parasitoid feeding was restricted to the abundant honeydew resources. In simulations, parasitoid survival and the number of aphids parasitized were also affected by the nutritional quality of the honeydew, with low quality honeydew having a less positive effect on parasitoid longevity and parasitism rate. The field study did not indicate evidence of a significant relationship between flower cover in field margins and parasitism rates in wheat near the margins. This finding is compatible with results from simulations and suggests that honeydew feeding is more prevalent in cereal aphid parasitoids than nectar feeding. In conclusion, nectar may be an important factor for the potential biocontrol success of cereal aphid parasitoids, but most likely only at low aphid densities and especially when flowers are broadly distributed in the field...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} the general and excellent in the Arctic policy of India and China {{and the likelihood}} of rivalry between the two Asian powers in the allocation of resources to the Arctic. Also, Indian and Chinese research trends on Arctic topics were considered. Since the middle of XX century. India and China act as long-standing rivals. Periodically, military clashes broke out between the two sides on a common border. Despite the fact that the key territorial issues on the common border between India and China are resolved military provocations from both sides do not stop. The latest incident was the transfer of Indian troops to the Chinese border zone in the province of Sikkim. Both powers of Asia are major consumers of energy resources, they are more or less interested in the situation on the global energy market. In the Arctic there are colossal reserves of various <b>resources.</b> Certain difficulties <b>and</b> limitations with access to <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> equitable <b>distribution</b> can force these countries to compete with each other. However, the lack of a specific position on Arctic issues or the formulated regional strategy for India and China creates a lot of doubt about their true intentions. The study of research trends, the activity of Indian and Chinese business structures, as well as the arctic activities of India and China, gives approximate answers to this question. The potentials of India and China are very different in the Arctic. China’s strengths are active participation in international scientific research, the availability of a qualified ice-class crew, active investment in energy and infrastructure projects in the Arctic countries, and fairly stable trade relations with most Arctic countries. The weak side of China is its negative image. Residents of many Arctic countries are very wary of the «rise of China» and its growing interest in the Arctic. Strengths of India are a positive image and a representative diaspora in the Arctic countries, especially in the US and Canada. In the future this will allow Delhi to successfully promote initiatives in the Arctic. The weak side of India can be considered the absence of a ship «icebreaker class», the weak investment activity of Indian business structures and poor knowledge of Arctic problems {{from the point of view}} of Indian issues. </p...|$|R
40|$|Current {{strategies}} for early missions to Mars are {{highly dependent on}} the assumption of nuclear power as the primary near-term energy supply. Since political considerations may prohibit the launch of nuclear systems, this paper investigates the potential for utilizing in situ energy sources on Mars to either supplement or replace nuclear power. The current knowledge of solar, wind, <b>and</b> areothermal energy <b>resources</b> on Mars is discussed, and the studies required to identify these <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> further characterize <b>their</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>and</b> abundance is given. A non-nuclear power system for the first Mars mission could {{be based on a}} combination of solar and wind energy coupled with a liquid fuel storage system. Indications are that such a system, using the latest solar cell technology, could be cost competitive with nuclear power in terms of kiloWatts per kilogram delivered to the Martian surface. Areothermal energy has significant potential, but the development of this resource will require longer term space and surface based exploration. The work reported herein advances the current knowledge base with the following accomplishments: (1) collecting models to jointly estimate solar and wind power production; (2) utilizing terrestrial geothermal exploration techniques coupled to remote sensing data from Mars to refine potential regions of exploitable planetary heat sources; and (3) suggesting that an early Mars mission that relies heavily on in-situ energy sources will require additional precursor information on energy <b>resource</b> location, extent, <b>and</b> accessibility. It is proposed that the production of energy on Mars, solely from local resources, may be practical enough to render a small outpost completely self-sufficient. Moreover, the addition of in-situ energy resource development to that for life support and transportation may advance the development of larger permanent self-sufficient human colonies on Mars...|$|R
