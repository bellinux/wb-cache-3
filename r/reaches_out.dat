40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of a brief school-based intervention on help-seeking behaviour among Australian adolescents. The aim of the intervention was to encourage adolescents to seek help, focusing on the use of the <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> website (www. reachout. com. au) as a help-seeking source. Male and female adolescents were compared. The evaluation involved 243 students from ten government and non-government schools across rural and regional Victoria. They received a presentation that contained information on <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!,</b> what to do if they or a friend was going through a tough time, and help-seeking options. Questionnaires assessing help-seeking knowledge, intentions, behaviour, and use of <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> to seek help were administered six months following the presentations. The majority of participants, with more females than males, knew where to go for help and who they could talk to. Almost half of the participants had been to the <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> website following the presentation, and approximately two-thirds reported that they would use <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> to seek help if they were going through a tough time. There were no significant gender differences in visiting <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> or in intending to visit it. The results demonstrate that young people in Australia are likely to use the Internet, and especially <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!,</b> to seek help when they are going through tough times...|$|R

5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E

It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form. Instead, Harry must deal with the {{knowledge}} that he has been targeted by Sirius Black, his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school, he <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> to Remus Lupin, a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf.

In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised – in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.|$|E
