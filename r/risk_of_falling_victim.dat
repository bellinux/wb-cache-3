50|$|Victims of {{trafficking}} and exploitation are coerced through fear tactics, violence, {{and a lack}} of knowledge of the resources available to them. Rescue is only the first step. The goals of ITEMP are: protection, prevention, and, on a smaller scale, prosecution. Many of those rescued are at a very high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> <b>victim</b> to trafficking or exploitation again. Long-term rehabilitation, including education and counseling, provides tools to resist being victimized in the future and requires significant funding to ensure its success. ITEMP and Nuestros Ahijados are dedicated to the complete rehabilitation of rescued persons regardless of the amount of time it takes. Children that enter the program at the age of six or seven will be taken through the program until the completion of their education, sometimes all the way through medical or law school. Such long-term commitment is rarely available and makes ITEMP an essential asset to the people it serves.|$|E

To this end, they assign an area of their web page to an advertising company (so called ad exchange) that will use it to display promotional content. By doing this, the website owner im-plicitly trusts that the advertising company will offer legiti-mate content and it will not put the site’s visitors at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> malware campaigns and other scams. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale study of the safety of the advertisements that are encountered by the users on the Web. In particular, we analyze to what extent users are exposed to malicious content through ad-vertisements, and investigate what are the sources of this malicious content. Additionally, we show that some ad ex-changes are more prone to serving malicious advertisements than others, probably due to their deficient filtering mech-anisms. The observations that we make in this paper shed light on a little studied, yet important, aspect of advertise-ment networks, and can help both advertisement networks and website owners in securing their web pages and in keep-ing their visitors safe...|$|R

40|$|The {{northern}} pike (Esox lucius) {{is an important}} and selective piscivore that chooses smaller prey than predicted from energy / time budgets. In a laboratory experiment, we investigated pike predatory behavior to explain this selectivity. Northern pike feeding on different prey sizes in aquaria were observed when foraging alone, when {{in the presence of}} chemical cues from similar-sized or larger conspecifics, and when in the presence of conspecifics that were allowed to interact with the focal pike. The results show that prey handling time increases with prey size and that the duration of manipulating and handling prey inflicts a risk of exposure to cannibals and kleptoparasites on the pike. Therefore, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> <b>victim</b> to cannibals or kleptoparasites increases with prey size. Attracting and experiencing intraspecific interactors can be regarded as major fitness costs. Chemical cues from foraging conspecifics have only minor effects on pike foraging behavior. Furthermore, the ability to strike and swallow prey head first improves pike predatory performance because failing to do so increases handling time. Our findings emphasize the increasing potential costs with large prey and explain previous contradictory suggestions on the underlying mechanisms of behavior, selectivity, and trophic effects of {{northern pike}} predation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} {{examined}} to which degree reformed ministers suffer from burnout symptoms, to which degree these symptoms are comparable with other occupational groups and which organizational and personal traits like extroversion and emotional stability, increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> <b>victim</b> to burnout. Ministers (n 424; 83 % men, 17 % women) completed the following questionnaires: a work-factor questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and the extroversion and emotional stability Personality Inventory. Ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church had identical {{scores on the}} three burnout dimensions as their reformed counterparts, a more doctrinal denomination. Compared with workers in other human service professions, ministers scored lower on the three burnout dimensions. Ministers who seriously suffered from pressure of work had high scores on the three dimensions of burnout. Young ministers {{proved to be more}} susceptible to burnout than their older counterparts. Gender did not contribute to the onset of burnout. However, lack of social support at home, satisfaction, and motivation may have influenced the ministers ’ burnout level. Personality factors, such as extroversion and emotional stability, appeared to be significantly related to burnout. Tasks found to be weighty were: to conduct a service and to prepare sermon, pastoral care, administration or managerial and organizational tasks, catechism and meetings.

30|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{substantial}} {{progress has been}} made in understanding and mitigating phishing attacks. Nonetheless, the percentage of successful attacks is still on the rise. In this article, we critically investigate why that is the case, and seek to contribute to the field by highlighting key factors that influence individuals’ susceptibility to phishing attacks. For our investigation, we conducted a web-based study with 382 participants which focused specifically on identifying factors that help or hinder Internet users in distinguishing phishing pages from legitimate pages. We considered relationships between demographic characteristics of individuals and their ability to correctly detect a phishing attack, as well as time-related factors. Moreover, participants’ cursor movement data was gathered and used to provide additional insight. In summary, our results suggest that: gender and the years of PC usage have a statistically significant impact on the detection rate of phishing; pop-up based attacks have a higher rate of success than the other tested strategies; and, the psychological anchoring effect can be observed in phishing as well. Given that only 25  % of our participants attained a detection score of over 75  %, we conclude that many people are still at a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> <b>victim</b> to phishing attacks but, that a careful combination of automated tools, training and more effective awareness campaigns, could significantly help towards preventing such attacks.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to assess}} the factors {{associated}} with the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> in patients undergoing surgical procedures. Method: quantitative and cross-sectional study carried out with 257 adult patients in a hospital {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil. Data were collected using the sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, the Morse Fall Scale, and the Quality of Recovery Score. Data were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis and multinomial logistic regression. The level of significance was set at 0. 05. Results: 35. 4 % of patients had high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> 38. 9 % had moderate risk and 25. 7 % had low risk. The mean value in the surgical recovery scale was 175. 37 points and no patient presented poor surgical recovery. Regarding the results of the bivariate analysis, it was found that age (p< 0. 001), SAH (p< 0. 001) and diabetes (p= 0. 017) were positively associated with high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall,</b> whereas cancer (p= 0. 004) was positively associated with moderate <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> Surgical recovery (p= 0, 008) was inversely associated with high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> Conclusion: {{the results of this study}} allowed the identification of five factors associated with the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> in adults in the postoperative hospital stay.

Many young people do not want to talk about {{difficulties}} and for themselves to seek help can be a big step even if they feel in need of both assistance and support. It is therefore essential to clearly state where assistance is available and that society picks up the young people who are in need of support. This paper aims to investigate the possibilities for young crime victims in the municipality of Boden to receive help and support, and to raise the question of developing a support center for young crime victims. Topics to be discussed in this paper are: How does crime exposed children in Boden receive help and support, what is the significance of a support center for young crime victims, how can young people find out where help is available? Statistics from the Crime Prevention Council shows that crime rates in Boden are high for reported crimes such as battery, assault and harassment in relation to the neighboring municipality of Luleå and the whole country.

Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identity articles published in English or Chinese from January 2000 to July 2012. Studies were located using an electronic search, a manual search, and an author search. Results: A total of 19 articles were identified and included in this review. This review of the literature revealed that female spousal caregivers, in general, experienced more mental morbidity (higher levels of distress, depression, and anxiety, lower levels of mental health), physical morbidity (lower physical health scores, poorer physical functioning, and loss of physical strength), and social morbidity (lower marital satisfaction and less social support) than male spousal caregivers.

40|$|Prey {{selection}} {{is a key}} factor shaping animal populations and evolutionary dynamics. An optimal forager should target prey that offers the highest benefits in terms of energy content at the lowest costs. Predators are therefore expected to select for prey of optimal size. Stalking predators do not pursue their prey long, which {{may lead to a}} more random choice of prey individuals. Due to difficulties in assessing the composition of available prey populations, data on prey selection of stalking carnivores are still scarce. We show how the stalking predator Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) selects prey individuals based on species identity, age, sex and individual behaviour. To address the difficulties in assessing prey population structure, we confirm inferred selection patterns by using two independent data sets: (1) data of 387 documented kills of radio-collared lynx were compared to the prey population structure retrieved from systematic camera trapping using Manly's standardized selection ratio alpha and (2) data on 120 radio-collared roe deer were analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Among the larger red deer prey, lynx selected against adult males-the largest and potentially most dangerous prey individuals. In roe deer lynx preyed selectively on males and did not select for a specific age class. Activity during high risk periods reduced the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> <b>victim</b> to a lynx attack. Our results suggest that the stalking predator lynx actively selects for size, while prey behaviour induces selection by encounter and stalking success rates...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Whether {{or not a}} high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> {{increases}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulants remains a matter of debate. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 991 patients ≥ 65  years of age who received anticoagulants for acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) at nine Swiss hospitals between September 2009 and September 2012. The study outcomes were as follows: the time to a first major episode of bleeding; and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. We determined the associations between the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and the time to a first episode of bleeding using competing risk regression, accounting for death as a competing event. We adjusted for known bleeding risk factors and anticoagulation as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-eight of 991 patients (46 %) were at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> The mean duration of follow-up was 16. 7  months. Patients at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> had {{a higher incidence of}} major bleeding (9. 6 vs. 6. 6 events/ 100 patient-years; P =  0. 05) and a significantly higher incidence of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (16. 7 vs. 8. 3 events/ 100 patient-years; P <  0. 001) than patients at low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> After adjustment, a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> was associated with clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding [subhazard ratio (SHR)  =  1. 74, 95 % confidence interval (CI)  =  1. 23 - 2. 46], but not with major bleeding (SHR =  1. 24, 95 % CI =  0. 83 - 1. 86). CONCLUSION: In elderly patients who receive anticoagulants because of VTE, a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> is significantly associated with clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, but not with major bleeding. Whether or not a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> is a reason against providing anticoagulation beyond 3  months should be based on patient preferences and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> VTE recurrence...|$|R

They have become a vital subsidiary industry to the night time business of bars and clubs within central city areas, a term now collectively referred to as the night time economy. However, while catering to these transport needs, overseas evidence suggests that they are at great <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> <b>victim</b> to criminal acts such as assault, robbery, and even murder. There is a need then to establish whether these findings are relevant in a New Zealand context and establish how the risk of victimisation interacted with taxi drivers’ involvement in the night time economy. This research was conducted using grounded theory methodology with taxi drivers interviewed from Auckland Co-operative Taxis. A total of nine drivers were interviewed in this study. Findings indicated that taxi drivers face a number of issues as a result of their occupation. It was found that the problems drivers face occur across day and night and are only further exacerbated by working within the night time economy. Economic insecurity was a primary motivator for continued involvement within this arena and affected drivers’ decisions to accept risky fares. The introduction of a working wage was identified as a potential solution to this problem, freeing drivers to make rational decisions without regard to financial necessity. Future research should investigate the experiences of drivers that operate for the smaller companies as it was put forward that they have more relaxed operating standards than those observed with Auckland Co-operative Taxis...|$|E

What do we learn about this teacher learning process by examining teacher artifacts, interactions and reflections? ^ Methods of this study include analyzing the collected artifacts from the teachers 2 ̆ 7 collaborative inquiry activities. Artifacts were analyzed by coding methods, themes and patterns, knowledge and performance frameworks (NCTM, 2000), the district 2 ̆ 7 s mathematics curriculum and Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s Taxonomy (OfficePort, 2005). The research findings show that teachers based their mathematics assessment task decisions on internal and external driving forces, they framed their method of assessment construction around design, frequency, and goals and they shifted their assessment practice, which transformed their teaching roles. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to assess}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in elderly, by {{comparing}} the sociodemographic and cognitive factors, history <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and self-reported comorbidities. Method: cross-sectional and quantitative study with 240 elderly. Data were collected based on the social profile, through the instrument <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and assessment <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> by univariate analysis, bivariate and multiple logistic regression. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19 was used for statistical analysis. Results: {{there was a significant}} association <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> as measured by the Fall Risk Score, with sex (< 0. 001), age (0. 054), cognitive status (< 0. 001) and history <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> (< 0. 001). All variables were statistically significant and contributed to the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> In logistic regression, the variables that showed association with <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> were: fall, with whom they live, hypertension and visual impairment. Conclusion: female gender, older elderly (over 80 years old), with low cognitive status and occurrence <b>of</b> previous <b>falls</b> {{in the last six months}} are factors that increase the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> In logistic regression, the variables that were associated with <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> were: fall, with whom they live, visual impairment and rheumatologic diseases...|$|R

40|$|A {{portfolio}} {{model to}} minimize the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> under uncertainty is discussed. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> {{is represented by the}} value-at-risk of rate of return. Introducing the perception-based extension of the value-at-risk, this paper formulates a portfolio problem {{to minimize the}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> with fuzzy random variables. In the proposed model, randomness and fuzziness are evaluated respectively by the probabilistic expectation and the mean with evaluation weights and λ-mean functions. The analytical solutions of the portfolio problem regarding the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> are derived. This paper gives formulae to show the explicit relations among the following important parameters in portfolio: The expected rate <b>of</b> return, the <b>risk</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and bankruptcy, and the rate <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> regarding the asset prices. A numerical example is given to explain how to obtain the optimal portfolio and these parameters from the asset prices in the stock market. Several figures are shown to observe the relation among these parameters at the optimal portfolios...|$|R
