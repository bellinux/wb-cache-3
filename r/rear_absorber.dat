40|$|Plug-in hybrid {{electric}} motorcycle (PHEM) is {{an alternative}} to promote sustainability of energy and lesser emission. However, the PHEM overall system packaging is constraint by limited space in a motorcycle chassis. In this paper, a chassis applying {{the concept of a}} Chopper is analysed to apply in PHEM. The chassis 3 dimensional (3 D) modeling is built with CAD software. The PHEM power-train components and drive-train mechanisms are intergraded into the 3 D modeling to ensure the chassis provides sufficient space. Besides that, a human dummy model is built into the 3 D modeling to ensure the rider’s ergonomics and comfort. The chassis 3 D model is then undergoing stress-strain simulation. The simulation predicts the stress distribution, displacement and factor of safety (FOS). The data are used to identify the critical point, thus suggesting the chassis design is applicable or need to redesign/modify to meet the require strength. Critical points mean highest stress which might cause the chassis to fail. This point occurs at the joints at triple tree and bracket <b>rear</b> <b>absorber</b> for a motorcycle chassis. As a conclusion, computational analysis predicts the stress distribution and guideline to develop a safe prototype chassis...|$|E

50|$|The DB6 {{continued}} with then high-tech Armstrong Selectaride cockpit-adjustable <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> as {{available on the}} DB5. Other highlights include adopting front-door quarter windows, an oil-cooler air scoop low on the front valance, quarter-bumpers at each corner, revised tail-lamp clusters; additionally the spoiler affected the overall proportions of the DB6, {{with an increase in}} length by approximately two inches.|$|R
50|$|Updates in 2000 saw {{the wheels}} change and get updated to all new Marchesini wheels. The front forks were also {{titanium}} nitrided to reduce stiction. The spokes also {{changed from the}} three-spoke rim style of the 916 to a new five-spoke scheme. In 2001 another overhaul saw the 996 <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorber</b> change from a Showa to an Öhlins.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2000 model year, a new version, the X4 LD ("Low Down"), was introduced. It {{offered a}} {{slightly}} lower seat and overall frame, improved suspension (with [...] "piggyback"-style Showa <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers),</b> and minor cosmetic differences including an unpainted engine block (versus {{the black of}} the original) and lightweight latticework inner rotors on the front brakes (the originals were solid discs).|$|R
5000|$|The Mark V Hawk {{announced}} in September 1952 {{was given a}} larger clutch, larger <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers,</b> a strengthened body-frame and other minor mechanical changes.

50|$|Classic classes {{exist for}} vintage bikes. Classes include pre-1965 or pre-1967 {{motorcycles}} (typically British), {{as well as}} newer vintage events for observed trials motorcycles with two <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers.</b> In most cases, twin-shock motorcycles were manufactured between 1967 and 1985 and are typically Japanese or Spanish. A recent addition has been a class for air-cooled monoshock bikes, this covers machines up to around 1990.|$|R
50|$|The Scrambler also {{featured}} a high, wide handlebar, a higher seat position, twin chromed Kayaba <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> (with increased 106 mm travel), 41 mm Kayaba front forks with 120 mm travel and rubber fork gaiters, a small single headlight {{with a simple}} speedo, and chunky, knobbly Bridgestone tyres on the thin 36-spoke 19 x 2.5-inch front wheel and the 40-spoke 17 x 3.5-inch rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|The electric-starting Triumph T140W TSS was {{launched}} in 1982 and featured an eight-valve cylinder head (derived from Weslake Engineering, hence the 'W' suffix) and a revised crankshaft designed to reduce vibration. All T140W had an electric start, the new Italian-made 4 gallon petrol tank, twin front disc brakes and Marzocchi Strada <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> as standard with Morris alloy wheels and an anti-vibration frame as options.|$|R
5000|$|From a {{price of}} $6000-$7250 for the S1, the Excalibur SII went up to $12,000 -$13,000 but {{justified}} that extra cost with its supplementary equipment. This included air conditioning, variable ratio power steering, adjustable steering column, servoed brakes, [...] "Positraction" [...] differential, chromed wire wheels, stereo radio, two spare tires mounted in the front fenders, driving lamps, air horns and constant level <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|PE250C {{released}} - 30+ detail improvements {{over the}} 250B.Main improvements were altered 3rd gear ratio, new leading-axle forks, longer <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers,</b> altered fork rake, new conical front hub, improved magneto coils, new headlight & tail-light assemblies, plastic 12 litre tank, optional trip-meter, optional centre-stand, engine bash-plate changed, timing, porting and crankshaft changes. New [...] "All-in-one" [...] tool on fork, stronger foot-pegs, rock-guard on swing-arm.|$|R
50|$|A magnet {{combined}} with a <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorber</b> forms the folding mechanism. The magnet connects and locks the back wheel section to the frame. To fold the bike in half, the magnet disconnects with one movement and in a second, and without having to use one's hands, the rear wheel rotates forward, and the bike folds vertically. This mechanism also enables one to roll the half-folded bike on its rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{recumbent}} {{bikes are}} increasingly being fitted with front and rear suspension systems for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces. Coil, elastomer, and air-sprung suspension systems have all been used on recumbent bikes, with oil or air-damping in the forks and <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers.</b> The maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided {{the development of these}} designs, which often use many of the same parts, suitably modified for recumbent use.|$|R
50|$|The 2003-04 Marauder {{utilized}} the Panther platform. Its brakes and many suspension components {{were derived from}} the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. In a modification of the suspension design, the <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> were moved outboard of the frame rails (a design later adopted across the Panther platform). As part of the chassis upgrades, the Marauder was fitted with rack-and-pinion steering, over the long-running recirculating ball design used by the Grand Marquis.|$|R
50|$|The XS400 {{had with}} a 6-speed transmission, wet plate, 6 {{friction}} disk clutch, chain drive, tachometer, self-canceling turn signals, both electric and kick starters, adjustable <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers,</b> center stand, and an automatic fuel petcock. Early and economy models came with spoked wheels and drum brakes, while later and upgraded models received cast alloy wheels and hydraulic disc brakes. Later models also upgraded the early mechanical points ignition system to a modern solid state electronic system.|$|R
50|$|Much {{the same}} as the Superbike World Championship but all the bikes are much closer stock to spec and there is an age {{restriction}} on riders. FIM Superstock 1000 motorcycles are allowed modifications more aimed at safety and crash survivability/repairability than outright performance such as fiberglass silhouette bodywork with fluid retention capabilities and improved hand and foot controls. FIM Superstock 1000 motorcycles are allowed performance modifications such as brake pads and discs, chaindrive systems, exhaust systems, fork internals and <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The frame {{lost the}} steel engine cradles, {{but also its}} bolt-on {{subframe}} and the rear ride height adjuster. The swingarm was a new unbraced, rectangular-section extruded design. The wheel sizes were the same, but the wheels were a new, lighter design. The brake calipers carried over, but the discs were smaller and lighter without stopping power being affected. The <b>rear</b> shock <b>absorber</b> changed from a remote-reservoir to a lighter, more compact piggyback design. The wheelbase dropped 30 mm to 1410 mm.|$|R
