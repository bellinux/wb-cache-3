40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 69 - 70) This report {{includes the}} design of a Thermistor Sensor Anemometer transducer to be used for continuous long term monitoring of respiratory flow and for performing pulmonary function tests. The transducer operates using a thermal principle of heat transfer from a heated thermistor sensor to the passing <b>respiratory</b> <b>air.</b> The thermistor sensor has a small heat capacity for rapid heat transfer. The loss of heat from the sensor to the passing <b>respiratory</b> <b>air</b> causes an increase in the resistance of the sensor. By placing the sensor in one leg of a Wheatstone bridge, the increase in resistance is detected as a voltage-unbalance in the bridge. This voltage-unbalance is used as a measure of respiratory flow. The use of a thermal principle in {{the design of}} a respiratory flow transducer avoids the slow response time, narrow frequency-range, large flow resistance and inaccuracy due to moisture and mucous associated with most commercially available flow transducers. These limitations make most commercial transducers less than ideal for long term continuous proximal airway flow measurement. The design of the Thermistor Sensor Anemometer transducer includes two thermistor sensors integrated into its own constant-current control bridge circuit, and a flow direction sensing circuit for bidirectional flow detection. The transducer's response time, linearity, flow-range and frequency-range were tested to verify if the design avoids the limitations of most commercial respiratory flow transducers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Because {{they have}} air stored in many body compartments, diving seabirds are {{expected}} to exhibit efficient behavioural strategies for reducing costs related to buoyancy control. We study the underwater locomotor activity of a deep-diving species from the Cormorant family (Kerguelen shag) and report locomotor adjustments to the change of buoyancy with depth. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using accelerometers, we show that during both the descent and ascent phases of dives, shags modelled their acceleration and stroking activity on the natural variation of buoyancy with depth. For example, during the descent phase, birds increased swim speed with depth. But in parallel, and with a decay constant {{similar to the one}} in the equation explaining the decrease of buoyancy with depth, they decreased foot-stroke frequency exponentially, a behaviour that enables birds to reduce oxygen consumption. During ascent, birds also reduced locomotor cost by ascending passively. We considered the depth at which they started gliding as a proxy to their depth of neutral buoyancy. This depth increased with maximum dive depth. As an explanation for this, we propose that shags adjust their buoyancy to depth by varying the amount of <b>respiratory</b> <b>air</b> they dive with. Conclusions/Significance Calculations based on known values of stored body oxygen volumes and on deep-diving metabolic rates in avian divers suggest that the variations of volume of respiratory oxygen associated with a respiration mediated buoyancy control only influence aerobic dive duration moderately. Therefore, we propose that an advantage in cormorants - as in other families of diving seabirds - of <b>respiratory</b> <b>air</b> volume adjustment upon diving could be related less to increasing time of submergence, through an increased volume of body oxygen stores, than to reducing the locomotor costs of buoyancy control...|$|E

The {{mechanism}} is based on cooling of the nasal vein blood and heat transfer in the cavernous sinus/carotid artery complex and is therefore not active in anaesthetised, intubated animals. The present experiment was made to investigate the effects of oxygen flushing of the nasal cavities in such animals. Nine anaesthetised, intubated male pigs were used. The temperatures in the third ventricle and rectum were measured continuously. Oxygen was infused into the nasal cavities during 10 min periods interrupted by 10 min without flow.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of <b>respiratory</b> <b>air</b> flow patterns {{is a subject}} of continuous interest. The pattern of the air flow curve is an individual characteristic which remains constant {{over long periods of}} time. Basically two different approaches have been proposed to determine the individual parameters of the respiratory flow, namely the graphical characterization, which originated from visual indices and subsequently led to harmonic analysis, and the optimal control modeling approach. It has been suggested that respiratory personality can be accurately characterized by the Fourier coefficients of the air flow curve. The first four Fourier sine components should reproduce the shape of the cycle and remain constant in different environmental conditions for one individual. This paper evaluates the possibilities of the Fourier approximation approach to characterize the respiratory personality. The Fourier sine coefficients which were assumed to be invariable were found to be very sensitive to changes in respiratory times. Both the amplitude and the angle of the Fourier sine transformation varied when duration of inspiration and expiration changed. # 2001 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
