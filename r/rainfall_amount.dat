The highest <b>rainfall</b> <b>amount</b> in the country was 4.37in (111mm) in northern New Brunswick. St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador recorded a record 1inch (26mm) of rainfall during the storm's passage. Gusty winds were observed across the region, and winds reached 68mph (109km/h) in Digby, Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, two 17-year-old girls were washed out to sea near Cape Forchu after being caught in rough swells produced by the storm. Rescue officials quickly began searching operations; however, it was later confirmed that the two had drowned. In Fredericton, New Brunswick, tropical storm-force winds downed trees and power lines, resulting in scattered power outages. Lightning associated with strong storms also reportedly struck some trees in the area. A two-story home in Pointe-Verte collapsed due to high winds. In Petit-Rocher, five fishing boats sank after being overwhelmed by large swells at port. Firefighters in the area were surveying the town all night on August20, checking for downed power lines and trees. Power outages were also reported on Prince Edward Island. The storm left about $1million in damage (1991CAD) on Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{design of}} flood mitigation {{and construction of}} crop growth models depend upon good understanding of the rainfall process and characteristics. Gamma distribution is usually used to model nonzero <b>rainfall</b> <b>amounts.</b> In this study, the mixed-gamma model is applied to accommodate both zero and nonzero <b>rainfall</b> <b>amounts.</b> The mixed-gamma model presented is for the independent case. The formulae of mean and variance are derived for the sum of two and three independent mixed-gamma variables, respectively. Firstly, the gamma distribution is used to model the nonzero <b>rainfall</b> <b>amounts</b> and {{the parameters of the}} distribution (shape and scale) are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method. Then, the mixed-gamma model is defined for both zero and nonzero <b>rainfall</b> <b>amounts</b> simultaneously. The formulae of mean and variance for the sum of two and three independent mixed-gamma variables derived are tested using the monthly <b>rainfall</b> <b>amounts</b> from <b>rainfall</b> stations within Kuantan district in Pahang Malaysia. Based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test, the results demonstrate that the descriptive statistics of the observed sum of <b>rainfall</b> <b>amounts</b> is not significantly different at 5 % significance level from the generated sum of independent mixed-gamma variables. The methodology and formulae demonstrated can be applied to find the sum of more than three independent mixed-gamma variables...|$|R
