5|$|While not {{uncommon}} in predominantly Catholic cultures, Christian metal is rooted in evangelical Protestantism, beginning {{as a means of}} evangelism among the non-Christian metal scene. Over the years the focus changed because of the increased secularization of Christianity in the West during the 1990s. Moberg (2008) notes that the current scene seems to have very little interest in evangelism, especially in Northern Europe. Instead, it is argued that the current Christian metal music scene ultimately provides its core members with important resources for the shaping of an alternative and complementary form of <b>religious</b> <b>expression</b> and practice and an alternative Christian identity. Thus, Moberg states that Christian metal serves four main purposes: an alternative form of <b>religious</b> <b>expression</b> and identity; as a legitimate form of religious expression; as an effective means of evangelism and fighting and standing up for the Christian faith; as a positive alternative to non-Christian metal.|$|E

It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative <b>religious</b> <b>expression</b> and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E
5|$|While these {{specific}} failings {{came back to}} haunt the Empire in subsequent decades, perhaps the greatest weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure {{to take into account}} the growing diversity of <b>religious</b> <b>expression</b> emerging in the evangelical (Lutheran) and Reformed traditions. Other confessions had acquired popular, if not legal, legitimacy in the intervening decades and by 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: Anabaptists, such as the Frisian Menno Simons (1492–1559) and his followers; the followers of John Calvin, who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; and the followers of Huldrych Zwingli were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg.

The research reveals three findings. In terms of translation techniques applied in the <b>religious</b> <b>expressions,</b> there are 13 techniques proposed by Molina and Albir employed by the translator. Out of 241 data, most of the data are translated using borrowing, combined translation techniques, literal translation, established equivalent, amplification, description, and generalization. The least techniques used are adaptations, particularization, transposition, reduction, variation, modulation, discursive creation, and unrealized translation. In terms of translation ideology, the most frequently occurred ideology is domestication at 45. 64...|$|R
