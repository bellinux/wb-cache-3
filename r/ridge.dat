50|$|Parting lineation is a {{sedimentary}} structure commonly {{found on the}} surface of parallel-laminated sandstones. It is aligned with the current direction, the alignment holding out in places over several square meters. The lineation is formed by flat, parallel <b>ridges</b> which are separated by depressions or grooves. The height of the <b>ridges</b> rarely exceeds several grain diameters. In profile the depressions are flat-bottomed and the <b>ridges</b> are rounded. <b>Ridges</b> and depressions are arranged en echelon, so that in downstream direction the <b>ridges</b> pass into depressions and vice versa. The crosswise distance between individual <b>ridges</b> typically varies between 0.59 and 1.25 centimeters. Length as well as spacing of the <b>ridges</b> augments with increasing grain size: in fine-grained sands the <b>ridges</b> are 3.5 to 12 centimeters long, whereas in medium-grained sands they can reach 30 centimeters in length. The long dimension of the <b>ridges</b> is therefore 5 to 20 times their crosswise spacing. The coarse(r) sediment fraction accumulates in the <b>ridges,</b> whereas dark heavy minerals and mica trails take up an intermediate position between the <b>ridges</b> and the grooves.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 199 - 206) A feature {{peculiar to}} certain Martian plains is {{the occurrence of}} numerous low-relief linear wrinkle <b>ridges.</b> They occur in flood basalts deposited penecontemporaneously, and numerous morphological indications imply a structural (as opposed to a magmatic) origin. Surface structures such as wrinkle <b>ridges</b> serve as clues to identify processes that shaped the Martian surface through its geologic development. This thesis is an examination of these Martian wrinkle <b>ridges.</b> Although morphologically the wrinkle <b>ridges</b> are similar in appearance across the discrete plains units, they occur in two conspicuous patterns: parallel and irregular. On thick plains units, the <b>ridges</b> are long, parallel, and narrow, and they demonstrate a wide, semi-regular spacing between adjacent <b>ridges.</b> On thinner plains units, the <b>ridges</b> develop more irregular orientational patterns. Spaces between adjacent <b>ridges</b> are narrow, and the <b>ridges</b> are comparatively short and wide. (See more in text...|$|R
40|$|Mare-type <b>ridges</b> on the Planet Mars were mapped and {{described}} based on Viking images. The <b>ridges</b> mapped range from 5 to 400 km long and 1 to 8 km wide. Most <b>ridges</b> on Mars are on plains and plateau units; 4, 321 <b>ridges</b> {{with a total}} length of 153, 835 km were mapped on these unit types. <b>Ridges</b> which resemble lunar mare <b>ridges</b> were also mapped in craters, basins, and several volcanic calderas on Mars. Mapping of <b>ridges</b> {{on a global scale}} reveals that they are preferentially developed in older, thinner plains units probably of flood basalt origin. Measuring the trends of <b>ridges</b> in plains units on Mars shows that there is a planetwide predominance of north, northwest and northeast trends. It is proposed that <b>ridges</b> are compressional tectonic features which have formed in response to changes in the planet's rotational equilibrium figure early in its history. In addition, the Tharsis uplift has created a regional stress system which accounts for the trends of <b>ridges</b> in areas near by. <b>Ridges</b> in craters and basins are similarly caused by shortening across the basin in response to regional stresses...|$|R

50|$|The Lunar Sounder Experiment {{also contributed}} to our {{understanding}} of wrinkle <b>ridges</b> on the Moon. These long, low <b>ridges</b> are found in many of the lunar maria. Most lunar geologists believe that these <b>ridges</b> formed when the Moon's surface was deformed by motion along faults ("moonquakes") in the Moon's crust more than 3 billion years ago. The weight of several kilometers of mare basalt in these areas caused the Moon's surface to sag somewhat, and this motion caused the surface to buckle in some places, forming the wrinkle <b>ridges.</b> However, other scientists suggested that these <b>ridges</b> are volcanic features, formed by the flow of magma either on the Moon's surface or within the crust. The Lunar Sounder Experiment studied several wrinkle <b>ridges</b> in southern Mare Serenitatis in detail, providing information about both the topography of these <b>ridges</b> and about structures in the crust below these <b>ridges.</b> These results support the idea that wrinkle <b>ridges</b> formed primarily by motions along faults.|$|R

40|$|The six {{species of}} Nematodirus {{parasitic}} in domestic ruminants of North America {{have been identified}} previously {{on the basis of}} characteristics of the bursa and tips of the spicules, and females could not be identified. In an effort to find additional diagnostic characteristics of both sexes, cuticular <b>ridges</b> were studied with light and scanning electron microscopy and in whole mounts and cross sections. After the cuticular <b>ridges</b> of males were characterized, females were matched with males by means of cuticular <b>ridges,</b> except for the rare species N. davtiani. Five of the six species have variations of an 18 -ridge bilaterally symmetrical system in the cervical region. The sixth species has 26 cervical <b>ridges.</b> Two groups of species were recognized on the basis of cuticular characteristics correlated with other morphological characters. The two species in Group I, Nematodirus filicollis and N. dalviani, lose <b>ridges</b> laterally in the postcervical region and have 14 <b>ridges</b> at midbody. They can be identified by their anteriorly extended pattern of <b>ridges</b> in the cervical region. These two species also share the characteristics of finlike <b>ridges,</b> a small number (30 - 35) of perioral denticles, a short cephalic expansion, and a large bursa without a separate dorsal lobe. Nematodirus davtiani can be distinguished from N. filicollis by its prominent dorsalmost and ventralmost <b>ridges</b> and its distinctive dorsal ray. In contrast, the four species of Group II, N. helvetianus, N. oiratianus interruptus ssp. n., N. abnormalis, and N. spathiger, share the characteristics of a more posteriorly distributed pattern of <b>ridges</b> in the cervical region, 18 or more <b>ridges</b> near midbody, smaller dorsal and ventral <b>ridges,</b> a larger number (50 - 65) of perioral denticles, a longer cephalic expansion, and a smaller bursa with separate dorsal lobes. Nematodirus helvetianus and N. oiratianus interruptus add <b>ridges</b> in the cervical and postcervical regions, and are characterized by having more than 18 <b>ridges</b> for most of their length; they do not add ventral <b>ridges</b> {{in the last quarter of}} the males. Nematodirus helvetianus has more <b>ridges</b> (30 - 36 at midbody) than any of the other species. Nematodirus oiratianus interruptus can be easily separated from all other species by its discontinuous <b>ridges</b> in the cervical region. Nematodirus oiratianus oiratianus from Asia and South America have continuous <b>ridges.</b> Nematodirus spathiger and S. abnormalis have 18 <b>ridges</b> for most of their length; they lose all dorsal <b>ridges</b> and add a few ventral <b>ridges</b> in the last quarter of the males. Nematodirus abnormalis can be distinguished from N. spalhiger by the cervical discontinuities in <b>ridges</b> numbered 2 and 8, by spicular and bursal characteristics, and a more anterior vulva position.

Good evidence to support both origins exists for a few individual <b>ridges</b> and the conclusion is reached that some <b>ridges</b> are tectonic, some result from volcanic processes (intrusive and/or extrusive activity), and others may involve a combination of both processes. The Mariner 10 mission to Mercury and Mariner and Viking missions to Mars have revealed <b>ridges</b> similar in size and morphology to mare <b>ridges</b> on the Moon. Because lunar mare <b>ridges</b> are formed on mare basalts, this relation has been taken as a tentative criterion for the identi-fication of basalt-like, or at least volcanic units on Mercury and Mars. At the same time, because some mare <b>ridges</b> are also demonstrably tectonic, other mare <b>ridges</b> have been used in studies of the structural deformation of planetary surfaces. Thus, in order for the interpretations of the tectonic and volcanic histories to be valid, the geology of the mare <b>ridges</b> upon which the interpretations are based must be well known.
