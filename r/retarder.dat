Because gypsum was plentiful, and available at a relatively low price, and because the manufacturing process was so simple, new firms flooded and fragmented the market, placing constant downward pressure on prices.|$|E

25|$|A {{waveplate}} or <b>retarder</b> is {{an optical}} device that alters the polarization state {{of a light}} wave travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa. A quarter-wave plate {{can be used to}} produce elliptical polarization as well.|$|E

2500|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} is emitted by a light source and linearly polarized by a polarizer. It can pass through an optional compensator (<b>retarder,</b> quarter wave plate) and falls onto the sample. After reflection the radiation passes a compensator (optional) {{and a second}} polarizer, which is called an analyzer, and falls into the detector. Instead of the compensators, some ellipsometers use a phase-modulator {{in the path of}} the incident light beam. Ellipsometry is a specular optical technique (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). The incident and the reflected beam span the plane of incidence. [...] Light which is polarized parallel to this plane is named p-polarized (p-polarised). A polarization direction perpendicular is called s-polarized (s-polarised), accordingly. The [...] "s" [...] is contributed from the German [...] "senkrecht" [...] (perpendicular).|$|E
2500|$|The {{speed of}} the cars rolling down from the hump into the {{classification}} bowl must be regulated according to whether they are full or empty, heavy or light freight, varying number of axles, whether there are few or many cars on the classification tracks, and varying weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed and direction. As concerns speed regulation, {{there are two types}} of hump yards—without or with mechanisation by retarders. In the old non-retarder yards braking was usually done in Europe by railroaders who laid skates onto the tracks. The skate or wheel chock was manually (or, in rare cases, mechanically) placed on one or both of the rails so that the treadles or rims of the wheel or wheels caused frictional retardation and resulted in the halting of the railway car. In the United States this braking was done by riders on the cars. In the modern <b>retarder</b> yards this work is done by mechanized [...] "rail brakes" [...] called retarders, which brake the cars by gripping the wheels. They are operated either pneumatically or hydraulically. [...] Pneumatic systems are prevalent in the United States, France, Belgium, Russia and China, while hydraulic systems are used in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.|$|E

60|$|Since that {{adventure}} he {{has been}} steadily bringing its use under control, and I have several times, and without the slightest bad result, taken measured doses under his direction; though I must confess I have not yet ventured abroad again while under its influence. I may mention, for example, that this story has been written at one sitting and without interruption, except for the nibbling of some chocolate, by its means. I began at 6.25, and my watch is now very nearly at the minute past the half-hour. The convenience of securing a long, uninterrupted spell {{of work in the}} midst of a day full of engagements cannot be exaggerated. Gibberne is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation, with especial reference to its distinctive effects upon different types of constitution. He then hopes to find a <b>Retarder</b> with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency. The <b>Retarder</b> will, of course, have the reverse effect to the Accelerator; used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time,--and so to maintain an apathetic inaction, a glacier-like absence of alacrity, amidst the most animated or irritating surroundings. The two things together must necessarily work an entire revolution in civilised existence. It is the beginning of our escape from that Time Garment of which Carlyle speaks. While this Accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our utmost sense and vigour, the <b>Retarder</b> will enable us to pass in passive tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium. Perhaps I am a little optimistic about the <b>Retarder,</b> which has indeed still to be discovered, but about the Accelerator there is no possible sort of doubt whatever. Its appearance upon the market in a convenient, controllable, and assimilable form is a matter of the next few months. It will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists, in small green bottles, at a high but, considering its extraordinary qualities, by no means excessive price. Gibberne's Nervous Accelerator it will be called, and he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths: one in 200, one in 900, and one in 2000, distinguished by yellow, pink, and white labels respectively.|$|E

In the following the light intensity equations of dark- and light-field polariscopes with both crossed and parallel optical <b>retarders</b> are reviewed. In particular, it is shown that the retardance error of the quarter-wave plates produces an attenuation of the maximum intensity in dark field and an increase of minimum intensity in light field.

An electro-magnetic <b>retarder</b> uses the rotation of the axle to generate electricity, the energy for which has to come from the movement of the axle. Using such a <b>retarder</b> means that the frictional brakes are kept cool for use at slow speeds. A local newspaper, the Yorkshire Post, staged a trial two weeks later: a coach which had been fitted with the <b>retarder</b> was put out of gear and allowed to run away down the hill without braking and the <b>retarder</b> kept the coach's speed within safe limits. The Dibbles Bridge crash brought the issue to a wider public and ultimately legislation required improved braking systems.|$|E
