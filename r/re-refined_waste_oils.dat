Prior to 1960, {{a significant portion of the}} demand for automotive lubricating oil was met by re-relined used oil. At the time, 150 re-refineries produced 300 million gal of motor oil annually. Since 1960, however, the production of re-refined oil has steadily declined.

40|$|AbstractLarge {{quantities}} of catalysts {{are used in}} the Egyptian refining industry for the purification and upgrading of various petroleum streams. These catalysts gradually lose activity through deactivation with time and the spent catalysts were usually discarded as solid waste. On the other hand, <b>waste</b> lube <b>oil</b> contains heavy metals coming from undergirded base oil and additives, these metals have carcinogenic effect and cause serious environmental problems. Studies are conducted on the reclamation of metals, rejuvenation and reuse of the spent hydrotreating catalyst (Mo–Ni/Al) which have been used in <b>re-refining</b> of <b>waste</b> lube <b>oil</b> at Alexandria Petroleum Company. Three leaching solvents were used: oxidized oxalic acid, benzoic acid and boric acid at different concentrations (4 %, 8 % and 16 %), different oxidizing agents (H 2 O 2 and Fe(NO 3) 3) and different modes of addition of oxidizing agents (batch and continuous). The results indicated that 4 % oxalic acid+ 5 % Fe(NO 3) 3 at continuous addition of oxidizing agents was the most efficient leaching solvent to facilitate metal removal and rejuvenate catalyst. The fresh catalyst was applied for <b>re-refining</b> of <b>waste</b> lube <b>oil</b> under different reaction temperatures (320 – 410) °C in order to compare the hydrodesulphurization (HDS) activity with both the fresh, treated and spent catalysts.

40|$|Two novel {{processes}} {{based on}} ionic liquid methodology, including steps {{to recover the}} ionic liquids for reuse and recycle, are developed for the recovery of key value components from food wastes: namely glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from seafood waste (scallop gut) and chitin-glucan complexes from cider yeast wastes. Both these components are high-added value materials in nutraceuticals and the chitin- glucan complexes are of particular interest because they are recovered from a vegetarian source. GAG recovery from scallop gut involves treatment of the wet waste with the ionic liquid, HBetNTf 2, in a low temperature (30 oC) process to separate the insoluble GAG mixture from other components of the waste, which are soluble. The important aspects of this process {{from the point of}} view of economic viability are: (i) it is a low-temperature process, (ii) the extraction of the unwanted components occurs quickly, (iii) the product GAGs are obtained in good yield, and (iv) all solvents used can be recovered. The recovery of chitin-glucan involves enzymatic pre-treatment of the cider yeast waste to give a digested pellet from which the complex can be recovered by treatment with the IL, BMIMCl. Two low temperature ionic liquid processes (TESA/TESAC and P 6, 6, 6, 14 Cl) for <b>re-refining</b> <b>waste</b> lubricant <b>oils</b> to recover base oils, of sufficient quality to be reused in lubricant applications, are also developed. The TESA/TESAC process is based on a reversible reaction from a solvent, TESA, in which the base oil is soluble to an ionic liquid, TESAC in which the base oil is insoluble. The conversion occurs when carbon dioxide is passed through the solvent and reversed by heating above 50 oC. In the P 6, 6, 6, 14 Cl process the base oils are recovered from a direct solution of the hydrocarbon content of the waste in the ionic liquid. In both processes all solvents used can be recovered for reuse. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Geophysics {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} in identifying areas contaminated by waste disposal, contributing to the greater efficiency of soundings programs and the installation of monitoring wells. In the study area, four trenches were constructed with a total volume of about 25, 000 m(3). They were almost totally filled with <b>re-refined</b> lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>waste</b> for approximately 25 years. No protection liners were used in the bottoms and laterals of the disposal trenches. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the potential of the resistivity and ground penetrating radar (GPR) methods in characterizing the contamination of this lubricant <b>oil</b> <b>waste</b> disposal area in Ribeiro Preto, SP, situated on the geological domain of the basalt spills of the Serra Geral Formation and the sandstones of the Botucatu Formation. Geophysical results were shown in 2 D profiles. The geophysical methods used enabled the identification of geophysical anomalies, which characterized the contamination produced by the trenches filled with lubricant <b>oil</b> <b>waste.</b> Conductive anomalies (smaller than 185 Omega m) immediately below the trenches suggest the action of bacteria in the hydrocarbons, as has been observed in several sites contaminated by hydrocarbons in previously reported cases in the literature. It was also possible to define the geometry of the trenches, as evidenced by the GPR method. Direct sampling (chemical analysis of the soil and the water in the monitoring well) confirmed the contamination. In the soil analysis, low concentrations of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were found, mainly naphthalene and phenanthrene. In the water samples, an analysis verified contamination of the groundwater by lead (Pb). The geophysical methods used in the investigation provided an excellent tool for environmental characterization in this study of a lubricant <b>oil</b> <b>waste</b> disposal area, and could be applied in the study of similar areas...|$|R

40|$|According to a {{decision}} of the European Court of Justice material recycling of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> must take priority over thermal recycling. The present study investigates the possibilities to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples according to their potential for material recycling on-site at the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> producer. The {{first part of the}} study surveys {{the state of the art}} in chemical analysis of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> and in oil quality monitoring with sensing elements in vehicles. It was shown, that the chemical analysis of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> is dominated by methods for monitoring the oil quality and by methods for the determination of harmful substances. For sensor-based oil condition monitoring in vehicles different approaches were discussed in literature. Most sensor systems work in a capacitive mode and use the change of the electrical properties of the oil for analysing oil quality. The second part of the study investigates, whether <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> can be classified according to its potential for material recycling by the following physical parameters: viscosity, density, viscoelastic properties, conductivity and relative permittivity. This was done by performing and evaluating measurements at 26 different <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples with a combi-SAW-/IDK-dipstick sensor. The results showed, that the SAW- und IDK-signals contain only little information permitting to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples according to their potential for material recycling. A classification of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples with the combi-SAW-/IDK-dipstick sensor was impossible, even when the signal evaluation was done by using modern methods of chemometrics, as e. g. the multivariate statistics. A further series of measurements showed, that since the conductivity of the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples is too low, cyclovoltammetry is also an unsuitable method to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples on-site. On the other hand, the study showed that the investigated <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples can be classified by IR-spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistics. By evaluating the IR-spectra of the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples with a partial-least-square procedure the samples can be divided into samples that have the potential for material recycling and samples that have not. Having in mind that the problem is complex, that only a few <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples have been investigated and that the number of measurements was restricted, this empirically found correlation can only be seen as an indication how the problem could be solved. A definite proof that IR-spectroscopy in combination with a PLS-procedure allows to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> is still not produced. The study indicates that, from a technical point of view, an on-site testing device for the classification of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> can be realized most likely in terms of a mobile IR-spectrometer with an ATR probe and an integrated signal evaluation module.

40|$|The marine {{ecological}} environment and fishery resources can be severely polluted or destroyed by <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> from fishing vessels {{if they are}} emitted directly into the ocean without any proper pre-treatment process. International conventions such as MARPOL 73 / 78 regulate waste-oil emissions and require the installation of a waste oil-water separator only for ocean-going ships of over 400 gross tons. Hence, these international conventions are not applicable to most fishing ships due to their low gross tonnages. In addition, space on most fishing vessels is too limited to allow waste-oil storage tanks or a waste oil-water separator to comply with international maritime regulations. Because {{a significant amount of}} <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> is produced by fishing vessels around the world every day, effective strategies or measures are needed to prevent this <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> from polluting the marine environment. This study thus investigates strategies and measures for improving the effectiveness of waste-oil collection from fishing vessels. This study found that existing procedures for the collection and treatment of <b>waste</b> lubricating <b>oil</b> on land could be applied to the management of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> and bilge water from fishing vessels. Sufficient oil-water separators and storage facilities for the collection of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> should be placed at each fishing port and shipyard. Fishermen should then be required to deliver their <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> to these storage facilities, from where it can be transported to legal recycling companies for further treatment. In addition, fishing harbor authorities should bear definitive responsibility for monitoring the illegal dumping of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> and for checking the waste-oil record books of fishing vessels.

The analysis {{was carried out in}} 2011 for the system that is composed of a treatment procedure collecting the treated oil for re-refining, followed by the production of expanded clay and recycling for electricity production. Methodology: Carbon footprint analysis was conducted by using the Umberto software 5. 5 based on the concepts of life cycle assessment with respect to international standards (ISO). Within this context, the substances considered for such carbon footprint analysis are directly relevant to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007). Results: The results showed that managing <b>waste</b> <b>oils</b> may contribute to the reduction of carbon footprint due to the avoided emissions of greenhouse gas through the reuse of treated <b>waste</b> <b>oils.</b> The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from collection and treatment of <b>waste</b> <b>oils</b> would not outweigh such benefit earned from the substitution of virgin lubricant oil even though the use of treated <b>waste</b> <b>oils</b> for producing expanded clay may end up some more carbon dioxide emissions. Conclusion: The carbon footprint analysis in this study has shown the potential for improvements in the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> management system in Portugal. The most significant improvement that could be made is the increase of using treated <b>waste</b> <b>oils</b> for the expanded clay production.
