This species grows to a length of 100 cm SL though most do not exceed 40 cm SL. It is important to local peoples as a food fish and is popular as a game fish though {{it has been reported}} to carry the ciguatera toxin. It is also utilized as bait.

40|$|Originally invented to {{describe}} magnetism, the Ising model {{has proven to}} be useful in many other applications, as, for example, inference problems in computer science, socioeconomic physics, the analysis of neural data [1, 2, 3] and modeling of neural networks (binary neurons). Despite its simplicity, there exists no general solution to the Ising model, i. e. the partition function is unknown {{in the case of an}} interacting system. Mean field theory is often used as an approximation being exact in the noninteracting case and for infinite dimensions. A correction term to the mean field approximation of Gibb's free energy (the effective action) of the Ising model was given by Thouless, Anderson and Palmer (TAP) [4] as a “fait accompli” and was later derived by different methods in [5, 6, 7], where also higher order terms were computed. We present a diagrammatic derivation (Feynman diagrams) of these correction terms and embed the problem in the language of field theory. Furthermore, we show how the iterative construction of the effective action used in the Ising case generalizes to arbitrary non-Gaussian theories.

40|$|The {{conditions}} {{for the formation of}} local bumps in the activity of binary attractor neural networks with spatially dependent connectivity are investigated. We show that these formations are observed when asymmetry between the activity during the retrieval and learning is imposed. An analytical approximation for the order parameters is derived. The corresponding phase diagram shows a relatively large and stable region where this effect is observed, although critical storage and information capacities drastically decrease inside that region. We demonstrate that the stability of the network, when starting from the bump formation, is larger than the stability when starting even from the whole pattern. Finally, we show a very good agreement between the analytical results and the simulations performed for different topologies of the network. The authors thank A.

40|$|Abstract. We test four fast mean {{field type}} {{algorithms}} on Hopfield networks as an inverse Ising problem. The equilibrium behavior of Hopfield networks is simulated through Glauber dynamics. In the low temperature regime, the simulated annealing technique is adopted. Although {{two of these}} network reconstruction algorithms, Sessak-Monasson approximation and inversion of Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations, were found {{to do a good}} job when applied to analyze the data from a simulated network of spiking neurons (<b>Roudi</b> Y, Tyrcha J and Hertz J 2009 Phys. Rev. E 79 051915), the analysis of Hopfield networks is lacking so far. Surprisingly the case for Hopfield networks is different. In the retrieval phase favored when the network wants to memory one of stored patterns, all the reconstruction algorithms fail to extract interactions within a desired accuracy, while in the paramagnetic or high temperature spin glass phase, albeit unfavored during the retrieval dynamics, the algorithms work well to reconstruct the network itself. This implies that the paramagnetic or spin glass phase is conversely useful for reconstructing the network while the retrieval phase loses all the information about interactions in the network.

30|$|Our study {{confirms}} {{the study by}} Baughn et al. (2006) that overall, “gender equality itself does not predict the proportion of female entrepreneurs”. It {{is important to note}} that the reasons behind the lack of female entrepreneurial activity in developing economies seem to be different from the developed economies. One could argue that women in developed countries are more likely to find an appropriate job than women in developing areas who are less likely to be absorbed in the labor market due to gender issues and unfriendly entrepreneurial environments. “As economies develop entrepreneurship tends to decline, because society provides more employment options (Kelley et al. 2011). Thus, it appears that in developed economies, gender equality increases women’s opportunities to become entrepreneurs or be employed, whereas in developing countries, gender inequality impedes women’s economic contribution both in starting a business and in becoming employed. The importance of fostering female entrepreneurial activities seems to be more essential in developing countries with high gender gap in employment. For instance, in Turkey, the unemployment rate among university-educated women is more than 3 times higher than that of university educated men; nearly 3 times higher in Iran and the United Arab Emirates, and 8 times higher in Saudi Arabia (<b>Roudi,</b> 2011). Hence, it can be concluded that the low rate of female entrepreneurship in developed economies does not necessarily imply the low rate of female contribution to the economy whereas, the low rate of female entrepreneurship in developing economies accompanied by high women unemployment rate may indicate the low contribution of women in the socio-economic development.|$|E

Master’s Thesis in Exercise Physiology. 58 pages. Fatigue represents {{a reduction in}} the ability of muscle to generate force and in the context of football, it has been often related with injury. Surface electromyography is a valuable technique for evaluating muscle activation and fatigue but it has never been applied during a football match. The development of washable textile electrodes has opened up possibilities to investigate muscular activity in non-laboratory settings, without skin preparation and wires hanging around the body. It has also been shown to be a valid and feasible method for assessing the average rectified value of electromyography (EMG). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of football specific fatigue on EMG activity of right and left hamstring (RH, LH) and quadriceps (RQ, LQ) during an entire football match, using bursts analysis method. Muscle activity and inactivity were compared between the first 15 minutes of the 1 st half (PRE) and last 15 minutes of the 2 nd half (POST). Seven professional players (age 23. 1 ± 3. 13 years; height 181 ± 5. 24 cm and mass 78. 4 ± 10. 5 kg) wore shorts with EMG electrodes during a match. EMG was normalized to maximal voluntary contraction (EMGMVC) and inactivity threshold was defined as an EMG level below 2 % of EMGMVC. A low, moderate and vigorous activity threshold was determined during a 3 stages (1 minute) treadmill test. Low, moderate and vigorous threshold were defined as EMG value corresponding to the 3 running speeds (6 km/h, 12 km/h and 16 km/h). Percentage of average normalized EMG (aEMGMVC,) decreased for RQ (- 27. 2 %), RH (- 29. 6 %) and LH (- 18. 1 %), (p< 0. 05). Burst analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in burst duration for RH (- 31. 9 %), LQ (- 22. 8 %) and an increase for LH (29. 1 %), (p< 0. 05). Burst amplitude significantly decreased for RQ (- 23. 8 %) and RH (- 20. 2 %), (p< 0. 05). Burst rate showed a significant decrease only for RQ (- 20 %). Inactivity time significantly increased for LQ (+ 10. 8 %) and LH (+ 35. 6 %), (p< 0. 05). Low activity significantly increased for RQ (6. 6 %), (p< 0. 05). Moderate activity time decreased for RH (- 17. 9 %) and LH (- 23 %), (p< 0. 05). Vigorous activity time was significantly reduced for RQ (- 31. 3 %), RH (- 37 %) and LH (- 27. 5 %), (p< 0. 05). For the first time EMG was measured during an actual football match. It can be concluded that at the end of the match, EMG activity decreased, inactivity and low activity time increased while vigorous activity time decreased. These results suggest that a full 90 minutes football match reduces overall EMG activity. Further, at the end of the match EMG bursts were shorter and had a lower amplitude...|$|E
