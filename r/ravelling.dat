That, probably for any Nation in the long-run, and certainly for the Prussian Nation straightway, life or death depends on the Army: Friedrich Wilhelm's head, in an inarticulate manner, was full of this just notion; and all his life was spent in organizing it to a practical fact. The more of potential battle, the more of life is in us: a MAXIMUM of potential battle, therefore; and let it be the OPTIMUM in quality! How Friedrich Wilhelm cared, day and night, with all his heart and all his soul, to bring his Army to the supreme pitch, we have often heard; and the more we look into his ways, the more we are impressed with that fact. It was the central thing for him; all other things circulating towards it, deriving from it: no labor too great, and none too little, to be undergone for such an object.

40|$|Poroelastic {{road surface}} (PERS) {{is a type}} of low-noise {{pavement}} surface, which was derived from porous asphalt (PA). Because of its high elasticity, large air void content and an inter-connected air void structure, PERS provides excellent performance in traffic noise reduction. However, it also faces the challenging problem of poor <b>ravelling</b> resistance, which limits its more widespread application. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of various composition factors on the <b>ravelling</b> resistance of PERS so as to provide recommendations on appropriate PERS composition. To this end, 20 PERS mixtures with different compositions were designed and characterized after various stages of polishing applied by the Aachener-Raveling-Tester (ARTe). The <b>ravelling</b> resistance of PERS was quantified by measuring the material loss after polishing, while their acoustic performance and rutting resistance were also tested for validation purpose. It was concluded that binder content and degree of compaction are the critical factors affecting the <b>ravelling</b> resistance of PERS. To ensure sufficient durability, a minimum binder content of 15 % and a minimum compaction degree of 98 % were recommended. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} damage development in the adhesive zone and the mortar of porous asphalt concrete. The motive of this {{research is}} the loss of stone from the pavement surface, the so-called <b>ravelling</b> of noise reducing surface wearing courses. <b>Ravelling</b> is the dominant defect of porous asphalt resulting in huge costs of maintenance and resurfacing in the Netherlands. <b>Ravelling</b> is a mixture-associated problem and {{is directly related to the}} binding failure within the stone-to-stone contact regions. This research is thus towards a better understanding of the processes responsible for <b>ravelling,</b> i. e. cohesive failure in the mortar bridge and adhesive failure at the mortar/aggregate adhesive zone on the basis of meso-mechanics. An intensive experimental program was carried out on various adhesive zones and mortars at a meso-sale of millimetres. This program was designed based on a better understanding of stress/strain states in porous asphalt concrete under moving traffic loadings. The aim was to develop fatigue/damage models for the adhesive zone and mortar which allows life expectancy to be predicted. Tension and shear tests as well as tests in which tension and shear were combined were performed on the adhesive zones. Among these tests, uniaxial tension testing was conducted using Dynamic Mechanics Analyzer. Shear testing was performed using Dynamic Shear Rheometer. A test which combined tension and shear was specially designed. Various types of load signals were applied accounting for complex stress signals to which the adhesive zones are subjected in practice. A damage model based on a linear cumulative damage rule was used to explain the obtained test data. The proposed model is making use of the integration of an equivalent uniaxial tensile stress signal to compute the development of damage. To do this, an internal-friction theory was applied to translate any combination of shear and normal stresses into a simple equivalent uniaxial tensile stress. Model fit indicated that the predicted number of cycles to failure is in agreement with the measured data. A practical mortar fatigue model based on the dissipated energy concept was developed for the life predictions under complex multiaxial loadings. The fatigue model is based on the initial dissipated energy per cycle. Model parameters can be determined on the basis of commonly used fatigue tests. The proposed model gave very good results in explaining the laboratory fatigue data. By combining the mortar stress and strain signals provided by response calculations the dissipated energy per tyre passage can be calculated and the number of load repetitions to failure can be estimated using the mortar fatigue model. The developed fatigue/damage models were applied to explain the <b>ravelling</b> damage of four different porous asphalt mixtures used in a full-scale accelerated pavement testing (APT) experiment. Finite element simulations of the behaviour of these four mixtures were made. A 2 D idealized model was used for practical reasons. The life expectancy predicted by this way was in good agreement with the results of full scale <b>ravelling</b> tests. The life time predictions as made explain the initiation of <b>ravelling.</b> In reality however maintenance will only be applied if <b>ravelling</b> has extended over a certain area and at a certain level of severity. To relate the computed life expectancy with the actual lifespan of porous asphalt or the maintenance moment, a <b>ravelling</b> development model was proposed. By combining this model with the initial <b>ravelling</b> damage obtained from the simulations, the moment for maintenance and resurfacing can be estimated for planning pavement preservation strategies. Finally, it was concluded that the meso-scale fatigue characterization of the adhesive zone and mortar is feasible. The developed adhesive zone damage model and mortar fatigue model together with the finite element model for the prediction of stress, strain and dissipated energy allow to arrive at a proper ranking in performance of porous asphalt mixtures. It has been shown that the developed models are very useful tools to design porous asphalt concrete with a better raveling resistance and a longer lifetime.
