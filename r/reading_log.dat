40|$|Carlisle This article {{introduces}} {{the activity of}} student-written <b>reading</b> <b>logs</b> as a practical application of reader-response theory in EFL literature teaching.

Students make notes in their <b>reading</b> <b>logs</b> as they <b>read</b> a novel, setting down their thoughts and feelings. This encourages them to interact with the text, and to tap into their individual responses to the literature. While <b>reading</b> <b>logs</b> are already used in L 1 literature teaching, this article argues that the activity is particularly appropriate for L 2 use, since it stimulates foreign language readers to go beyond the first barrier of semantic understanding and to move towards critical appreciation.

40|$|This {{research}} was to investigate parental involvement {{in the development of}} children’s reading skills in a nursery school in northern Nigeria. The teachers of this school perceived that parents needed to give more support to children when it comes to reading. This study therefore sought to explore parental attitudes towards assisting children to read by attempting to provide answers to the following research questions : (1) to what extent do parents/carers’ that do and do not complete the <b>reading</b> <b>log</b> read with the children; (2) do other family members read with children; (3) what do parents/carers’ do when reading with their children;(4) does what the parents/carers’ do share any feature with any of the established reading intervention programmes; (5) is parents /carers’ completion of the <b>reading</b> <b>log</b> associated with children’s reading progress? A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was employed. The target population comprised of twenty nine pupils along with the parent/carer who reads with the child at home and also three teachers. The instruments for data collection were questionnaires, semi structured interviews and the <b>reading</b> <b>log</b> book. Analysis of data revealed that parents always sign the reading logbook of their child and employed various approaches when reading with their child. These approaches share some features with already established reading intervention programmes. However, the quality of interaction that takes place between the child and the parent could only be deduced by the teacher through the comments in the logbook. The study concluded that {{there appears to be a}} relationship between reading progress and the signing of the logbook and in turn translates to the outcome seen in reading. There is a need not only to train parents in specific reading strategies but also to foster a more positive relationship between parents and teachers. In the light of this study, there will be need for further research to explore in depth specific challenges encountered by parents in attempting to support their child’s reading...|$|E

Title I parents and students from three schools in a rural North Carolina school district participated in a parent development session that focused on reading strategies to use at home. Parents and Title I teachers were in contact during the summer via telephone or face-to-face and students kept a <b>reading</b> <b>log</b> in order to collect data regarding reading routines. Quantitative data were collected using a pretest/posttest method using the end-of-year second-grade oral reading fluency assessment using Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS Next). Quantitative data from reading logs and questionnaires were also used to analyze the impact of parent development and a home-based summer reading program on summer reading loss as measured by oral reading fluency (rate). Qualitative data were collected from questionnaires, parent contact logs, and reading logs. Quantitative and qualitative methods (QUAN-qual) were used to collect and analyze data in order to answer four research questions: (1) What is the impact of the parent development seminar on parents 2 ̆ 7 abilities to demonstrate mastery of reading strategies? (2) What is the impact of summer reading volume (number of books initially and repeatedly read) on summer reading loss as measured by the difference in May and August oral reading fluency scores?

The log messages need to be viewed in a Traceviewer tool to read in a human readable form {{and have to be}} extracted to text files by applying manual filters in order to further analyze the behavior. There is a need to evaluate machine learning/data mining methods which could potentially assist in error analysis. One such method could be learning patterns for “normal” messages. “Normal” could even mean that they contain keywords like “exception”, “error”, “failed” but are harmless or not relevant to the bug that is currently analyzed. These patterns could then be applied as a filter, leaving behind only truly anomalous messages that are interesting for analysis. A successful application of the filter would reduce the noise, leaving only a few “anomalous” messages. After evaluation of the researched candidate algorithms, two algorithms namely GSP and FP Growth were found useful and thus implemented together in a prototype. The prototype implementation overall includes processes like pre-processing, creation of input, executing algorithms, creation of training set and analysis of new trace logs.

40|$|Software {{testing is}} {{a crucial part of}} the {{software}} development process, because it helps developers ensure that the software works correctly and according to stakehold- ers’ requirements and specifications. Faulty or problematic software can cause huge financial losses. Automation of testing tasks can {{have a positive impact on}} software development, by reducing costs and minimizing human error. Software testing can be divided into three tasks: choosing test cases, running test cases on the software under test (SUT) and evaluating the test results. To evaluate test results, testers need to examine the output of the SUT to determine if it performed as expected. Programs often store some of their outputs in files known as log files. The task of evaluating test results can be automated by using a log file analyzer. The main goal of this thesis is to design an approach to generate log file analyzers based on a set of state machine specifications. Our analyzers are generated in C++ and are capable of <b>reading</b> <b>log</b> files from disk or shared memory areas. Regular expressions have been incorporated, so that analyzers can be adapted to different logging policies. We analyze the purpose and benefits of this framework and discuss differences with a previous implementation based on Prolog. In particular, we discuss the results of a series of experiments that we performed in order to compare the performance between Prolog–based analyzers and C++ analyzers. Our results show that C++ analyzers are between 8 and 15 times faster than Prolog–based analyzers...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, many {{systems have}} {{employed}} NAND flash memory as storage devices {{because of its}} advantages of higher performance (compared to the traditional hard disk drive), high-density, random-access, increasing capacity, and falling cost. On the other hand, the performance of NAND flash memory is limited by its “erase-before-write” requirement. Log-based structures {{have been used to}} alleviate this problem by writing updated data to the clean space. Prior log-based methods, however, cannot avoid excessive erase operations when there are frequent updates, which quickly consume free pages, especially when some data are updated repeatedly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture for the NAND flash memory storage, of which the log region is implemented using phase change random access memory (PRAM). Compared to traditional log-based architectures, it has the following advantages: (1) the PRAM log region allows in-place updating so that it significantly improves the usage efficiency of log pages by eliminating outof-date log records; (2) it greatly reduces the traffic of reading from the NAND flash memory storage since the size of logs loaded for the read operation is decreased; (3) the energy consumption of the storage system is reduced as the overhead of writing and <b>reading</b> <b>log</b> data is decreased with the PRAM log region; (4) the lifetime of NAND flash memory is increased because the number of erase operations are reduced. To facilitate the PRAM log region, we propose several management policies. The simulation results show that our proposed methods can substantially improve the performance, energy consumption, and lifetime of the NAND flash memory storage 1. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of the study}} is to examine the learning process in trying to develop literary competence and {{to find out how to}} describe the competence shown by the students. My starting-point is a discussion about literary competence and the theory and model of literary competence by Örjan Torell. In examining literary competence, by how students use their constitutional competence as well as performance and literary transfer competences, Torell´s model shows the possibility and the need for both knowledge of literature and personal reception by focusing on the dialogue between author and reader. The method is qualitative and the empirics are material collected in one senior high school class in the Social Science programme during their second and third year. The material contains written <b>reading</b> <b>logs,</b> written answers to tasks and transcribed recordings of discussions of literature. The analysis shows a variety among the literary competence shown and developed by the students and points to the complexity of understanding the concept of literary competence. The model proves to be useful in focusing the teaching and learning of literature and the results indicate that teaching of literature by combining learning of epochs, genres, ideas and conceptions with personal reading is a valuable approach.
