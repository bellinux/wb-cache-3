5|$|<b>Rammed</b> <b>earth</b> {{structures}} may be long lasting. Most of the Great Wall of China {{was made}} from <b>rammed</b> <b>earth,</b> as was the Alhambra in the Kingdom of Granada. In Northern Europe there are <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> buildings up to seven stories high and two hundred years old.|$|E
5|$|In China, <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> {{walls were}} {{built by the}} Longshan people in 2600–1900 BC, during the period when cities first {{appeared}} in the region. Thick sloping walls made of <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> became a characteristic of traditional Buddhist monasteries throughout the Himalayas and became very common in northern Indian areas such as Sikkim. The technique spread to the Middle East, and to North Africa, and the city of Carthage was built of <b>rammed</b> <b>earth.</b> From there the technology was brought to Europe by the Romans.|$|E

50|$|The {{line was}} built with 16 equally spaced {{turnouts}} {{each with a}} water pump and timber shed. A maintenance station responsible for perhaps eight miles (13 km) of track was based at each turnout. The station overseer surveyed half of that track daily, and effected minor repairs such as making secure loose bars of iron, punching down protruding spikeheads, chamfering wheel flange rubs off the rails, <b>ramming</b> <b>earth</b> around the piles, and so on. The overseer was also responsible for maintaining adequate supplies of water and timber at the station, and for calling on the Superintending Engineer for nonroutine derangements.|$|R
5000|$|The New Earth Organization, or [...] "NEO", {{seeks to}} rebuild Earth and return order and {{prosperity}} to it. Until it was conquered by <b>RAM,</b> <b>Earth</b> was the dominant {{planet in the}} solar system. It is this former glory that drives NEO. Most NEO members use nicknames recalling the former glory of Earth, such as Beowulf or Washington. NEO uses as its headquarters a secret base, Salvation III Station. Salvation is hidden inside a junkyard satellite in a Lagrange point in orbit around Earth. Some notable members of NEO are Buck Rogers, Beowulf (the leader of NEO), and Carlton Turabian (who runs Salvation Station).|$|R

5|$|Timber was {{the chief}} {{building}} material in Han architecture. It was used for grand palace halls, multi-story towers, multi-story residential halls, and humble abodes. However, due to wood's rapid decay over time and susceptibility to fire, the oldest wooden buildings found in China (i.e. several temple halls of Mount Wutai) date no earlier than the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp describes the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, {{as well as the}} often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources used by historians for clues about non-existent Han architecture. What remains of Han-dynasty architecture are ruins of brick and <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> walls (including aboveground city walls and underground tomb walls), <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> platforms for terraced altars and halls, funerary stone or brick pillar-gates, and scattered ceramic roof tiles that once adorned timber halls. Sections of the Han-era <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> Great Wall still exist in Gansu province, along with the Han frontier ruins of thirty beacon towers and two fortified castles with crenellations. Han walls of frontier towns and forts in Inner Mongolia were typically constructed with stamped clay bricks instead of <b>rammed</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Climatic {{conditions}} {{are a major}} concern while building earthen structures. [...] Typically, earthen buildings are found {{in areas where the}} climate is dry and arid. Wayanad, where Banasura Hill Resort is located, has a tropical wet climate – also known as a tropical monsoon climate – with an annual average rainfall of well over 2,300mm. While the heavy monsoon rains are responsible for the tropical rain forests and the rich bio-diversity found in these parts, building a <b>rammed</b> colossal <b>earth</b> structure under such climatic conditions is a challenge. Despite this, construction of the main building was completed within 18 months.|$|R

His costume is the same color and style as Planet's, but the globe on his chest is torn in the middle. His voice has a California Valley twang to it. Captain Pollution is {{defeated}} twice by Captain Planet; first in Mission to Save <b>Earth</b> by being <b>rammed</b> through <b>earth,</b> lava, air and water, and then again in A Mine is a Terrible Thing to Waste by being tricked into going into an underground magma chamber.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{palisade}} constructions {{are known}} from buildings from the Viking Age. Logs were {{split in two}} halves, set or <b>rammed</b> into the <b>earth</b> (generally called post in ground construction) and given a roof. This proved a simple but very strong form of construction. If set in gravel, the wall could last many decades, even centuries. An archaeological excavation in Lund uncovered the postholes of several such churches.|$|R

5|$|Rammed earth: The archaeological {{evidence}} {{of the use of}} <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> has been discovered in Neolithic archaeological sites of the Yangshao and Longshan cultures along the Yellow River in China, dating back to 5000 BC. By 2000 BC, rammed-earth architectural techniques were commonly used for walls and foundations in China.|$|E
5|$|Stronger soils make {{stronger}} walls. Adobe builders {{can test}} cured blocks for strength by dropping from a specific height or by breaking {{them with a}} lever. Builders using immediate techniques like earthbag, cob, or <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> may prefer approximate crushing tests on smaller samples that can be oven-dried and crushed under a small lever.|$|E
50|$|One {{historical}} {{example of}} in-hill earth shelters would be Mesa Verde, {{in the southwest}} United States. These building are constructed directly onto the ledges and caves {{on the face of}} the cliffs. The front wall is built up with local stone and earth to enclose the structure. Similarly today, in-hill earth shelter construction utilizes the natural formation of a hillside for two to three of the exterior walls and sometimes the roof of a structure. Alternative builders craft a type of in-hill structure known as an Earthship. In Earthship construction, tires <b>rammed</b> with <b>earth</b> are used as structural materials for three of the walls and generally have a front façade of windows to capture passive solar energy.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 25th century, certain Terrans (inhabitants of Earth) form the New Earth Organization ("NEO"). This society plans to rebel against the rule of <b>RAM</b> and restore <b>Earth</b> to its former glory. After the revival of Buck Rogers, NEO is {{strengthened}} by alliances with other governments and space pirates. NEO is able to repel the occupation by RAM and fend off the ensuing large-scale attack by RAM.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-We have {{analyzed}} the trace-element and isotopic composition {{of a series}} of lavas and their constituent pyroxenes and calcite from near the town of Skien in the Permo-Carboniferous Oslo Rift. The series decreases in alkalinity upsection: the lowermost layaS are n~heli~t~, followed by basanites and finally alkali basalts. This sequence is accompanied by decreasing light <b>ram</b> <b>earth</b> element (LREE), Th, Nb and U concentrations. Nd isotopic change is strongly correlated with the petrologic and chemical evolution. The nephelinites are characterized by cNd (300 Ma) of 1. 0 to 1. 6, the basanites 1. 9 to 2. 2 and the alkali basalts 2. 4 to 3. 9. cSr (300 Ma) ranges from- 10 to- 15 and shows little change from one group to the next. Calcite segregations in the basaltic rocks show 6 ’-‘C =- 2. 825, 6 ’* 0 = 7. 7 to 9. 6 %, tsr =- 6. 5 to- 9. 9 and Q. +, = 0 to + 2, values which are compatible with formation from magmatic CO, exsolved from a mantle-derived silicate melt. The Sr isotope values are unradiogenic relative to Nd for the nephelinites, causing these samples to fall to the lefthand side of most rn~tl~~y ~ rocks on a eNd vs. 6 sr diagram. They are similar to rocks from “high p ” (HIMU) sources and the recently proposed “LoNd array ” f HART et al., 1986). The alkali basal&, with their higher cNd, lie close to the mantle array for 300 Ma ago and resemble tholeiitic magmatism in the Oslo Rift. We interpret these trends as representing evolution in which the earliest magmas were derived from a source with HIMU-LoNd characteristics, and successive magmas gradually acquired the more dominant mantle isotopic composition.

5|$|Earth {{structure}} materials may be {{as simple}} as mud, or mud mixed with straw to make cob. Sturdy dwellings may be also built from sod or turf. Soil may be stabilized by the addition of lime or cement, and may be compacted into <b>rammed</b> <b>earth.</b> Construction is faster with pre-formed adobe or mudbricks, compressed earth blocks, earthbags or fired clay bricks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rammed</b> <b>earth</b> is {{generally}} made without much water, {{and so does}} not need much time to dry as the building rises. It is susceptible to moisture, so must be laid on a course that stops rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.|$|E
5|$|Thatched or tiled roofs were {{supported}} by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, <b>rammed</b> <b>earth,</b> or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof. Stone and plaster were also used for domestic architecture. Tiled eaves projecting outward were built to distance falling rainwater from the walls; they {{were supported}} by dougong brackets that were sometimes elaborately decorated. Molded designs usually decorated the ends of roof tiles, as seen in artistic models of buildings and in surviving tile pieces.|$|E
6000|$|For {{methods of}} digging holes {{in which to}} plant the hut-poles, see the chapter on [...] "Wells." [...] The holes made in the way I have there {{explained}} are far better than those dug with spades; for they disturb no more of the hardened ground than {{is necessary for the}} insertion of the palisades. To jam a pole tightly in its place, wedges of wood should be driven in at its side, and <b>earth</b> <b>rammed</b> down between the wedges.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{occupants of}} Surkotada had affiliations with an antecedent culture. They built a citadel with mud-brick and mud-lump fortification with a rubble veneer {{of five to}} eight courses over a raised platform of hard <b>rammed</b> yellow <b>earth.</b> The platform had an average height of 1.5 m and the average base width of the fortification wall was 7 m. The bricks used were in the ratio 1:2:4 which conforms with mature Harappan standards. The height of this wall was 4.5 m. The residential area was also built with a fortification wall having a thickness of 3.5 m. The citadel had two entrances one on the southern side {{and one on the}} eastern side for accessing the residential area. In the residential area a drain, a bathroom with a small platform and a soakage jar in every house prove the well known sanitary arrangement and drainage system of the Harappans.|$|R
5|$|Though Han wooden {{structures}} decayed, some Han-dynasty ruins made of brick, stone, and <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> remain intact. This includes stone pillar-gates, brick tomb chambers, rammed-earth city walls, rammed-earth and brick beacon towers, rammed-earth {{sections of the}} Great Wall, rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood, and two rammed-earth castles in Gansu. The ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang'an and Luoyang still stand, along with their drainage systems of brick arches, ditches, and ceramic water pipes. Monumental stone pillar-gates, twenty-nine of which survive from the Han period, formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites. These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles, eaves, and balustrades.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} life was {{improved}} with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with {{the invention of the}} seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or <b>rammed</b> <b>earth</b> still stand today.|$|E

50|$|Argali {{range from}} central Kazakhstan {{in the west}} to the Shanxi Province in China in the east and from the Altai Mountains in the north to the Himalayas to the south. They are a species of mountainous areas, living from {{elevations}} of 300 to 5800 m. In protected areas, the species generally prefers gently sloping areas with soft broken terrain, although ewes with lambs often take up residence in more precipitous areas, characterized by canyons and jagged rocks. In areas where they are extensively hunted (such as Kazakhstan), {{they are more likely to}} be found in forested areas. In parts of China and Russia where they compete for resources with numerous domestic stock, argali more regularly take up residence in precipitous, jagged areas. Argali may search for regions in the mountains where snow cover is not heavy during the winter, following winds that blow snow off the <b>earth.</b> <b>Rams</b> are generally found at higher elevations more regularly than females and stay at higher elevations longer during the winter.|$|R
