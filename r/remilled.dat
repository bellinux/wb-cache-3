40|$|Durum wheat plays a {{major role}} on nutritional, cultural, {{economic}} and social development of the Mediterranean basin, where almost two-thirds of the worldwide annual durum wheat production is consumed. The specific features of durum wheat (glassy texture, amber color, high protein level, etc.) makes it suitable to undergo primary and secondary transformations leading to a lot of diverse food products such as pasta, couscous, bulgur, frekeh, a variety of breads and pastries. For manufacturing, artisanal and traditional production methods are widely practiced, however heavily under pressure due to the increasing importance of globally and industrially produced durum wheat products. The identification and description of culinary practices and know-how appear as essential prerequisites to the protection and valorization of culinary heritages {{as well as to the}} maintenance of employment, especially for SMEs and small-scale businesses in Mediterranean regions and countries. Such a study is developed within the frame of the European FP 7 TRAFOON project. The presentation will provide an overview of the traditional Mediterranean durum wheat-based food products and elucidate main processing steps to highlight similarities and differences between production characteristics and end-use properties. Three main categories of durum wheat-based food products will be described: (1) Products consumed in the form of grains (whole grains or coarse-ground grains), (2) Products made by agglomeration of semolina (associated with the maintenance of granular structure), and (3) Products made by formation of a dough obtained by addition of water to semolina, <b>remilled</b> semolina and/or durum wheat flour. Based on such a classification, this paper will discuss the main bottlenecks and levers to develop these traditional Mediterranean products...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Options for {{recycling}} and reusing chromated-copper-arsenate- (CCA) treated material include dimensional lumber and round wood size reduction, composites, and remediation. Size reduction by <b>remilling,</b> shaving, or resawing CCA-treated wood reduces {{the volume of}} landfilled waste material and provides many options for reusing used treated wood. Manufacturing composite products from CCA-treated wood combined with untreated wood, plastic, or cement has been explored. Remediation strategies are numerous; chemica l extraction, bioleaching, chelation, and liquefaction {{or a combination of}} these techniques has been successful at removing metals from treated wood to varying degrees. Bioremediation is a novel approach to recycling CCA-treated waste wood and provides an opportunity to reuse this abundant fiber source in value-added composite products. In this method, oxalic acid extraction and bioleaching with a metal-tolerant bacterium have successfully removed 70 % copper, 81 % arsenic, and 100 % chromium from chipped CCA-treated Southern Pine. The two-step sequence of acid extraction followed by bioleaching removed more metals than either acid extraction or bioleaching alone. Reversing the sequence and bioleaching prior to acid extraction was also not as effective at metal removal. Metals that are released from CCA-treated wood during biomediation are recoverable from a liquid medium and available for reuse or disposal. The “cleaned ” wood particles were reassembled into medium-density particleboard prepared with urea-formaldehyde resin and evaluated for physical properties, such as internal bond strength, modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, thickness swell, and water absorption. Bioremediation removes 80 % to 100 % of the heavy metals from spent CCA-treated wood enabling the wood fiber to be reused in composite products. However, as long as CCA-treated wood can be disposed in landfills, economics will remain unfavorable for wide acceptance of alternative reuse and remediation options...|$|R
40|$|Inroduction Due to {{the usually}} fertile soil (especially in Java), the {{prevailing}} warm and moist climate well-suited to agriculture, and the industriousness of the farmers, just before World War II Indonesia was practically self-supporting in primary articles of food, especially rice, Indonesia's staple. Since 1957, rice imports {{have risen to}} an average of about 1, 000, 000 tons, or 8 procent of the consumption, and it has cost the government about 100 million US dollars a year: a substantial drain on its foreign exchange holdings. Another fact is that Indonesia still depends on agriculture for over 60 percent of her foreign exchange earnings. After the war output of agricultural export crops, with the exception of rubber, decreased. But, unfortunately, {{in the last few years}} rubber production, Indonesia's main export, commodity, normally accounting for a third to a half of its export earnings, also shows a decline. The rapidly growing population of Java, and the impossibility to expand the agricultural area, have resulted in a further decline of the average farm size since World War II. As non-agricultural activities have shown themselves unable to absorb the increase of Java's population, the pressure on agricultural land in this island has become more and more severe. Against this background, the need for replacement of food imports, for greater export of agricultural products and for a relief in the population pressure on land in Java, this study of prospects for increasing agricultural production has been undertaken. The present study will focus its attention on specific measures taken, or to be taken, by the government to solve the problems outlined above. It also attempts to analyse why the government's efforts have, or have not, been up to expectations, to arrive at some basic conclusions. Next, the question of how effectively the government had used its agricultural resources is dealt with. Finally the author will try to indicate the perspectives for agricultural development in Indonesia. As two thirds of its population is concentrated in Java and the data for this island are more complete than those for the other islands, this study is primarily concerned with Java. Agriculture in Indonesia has two aspects: the usually small-scale peasant agriculture and the estate agriculture. Peasant farming varies between the extensive type of shifting cultivation and the most intensive culture as exemplified by double cropping in Java and Bali. The concept of a small holding is a relative one, especially before the enactment of the Basic Agrarian Law of 1960 : the smallholder in one area of Indonesia may be considered a fairly large farmer in another area, depending on the local agricultural pattern, the crop or crops involved, the amount of available arable land and the type of land tenure. Generally hired labour is little used and not much capital is involved. The peasant primarily produces basic food commodities for himself and his family. Besides that, he produces cash crops for local and export markets, depending on regional circumstances. For local marketing only surpluses are sold, which generally are small. Also the total amount of cash crop product per farmer is usually small. Nevertheless, the number of farmers is so great that their combined surpluses may be substantial. Several crops raised by the fanners, both for consumption and for export are further processed by the farmer himself or in factories which purchase the crop. If such processing requires little, if any, capital or technical knowledge (as copra), this is done by the peasants themselves. If processing needs more capital and wider technical knowledge, the crude product is sold to processing enterprises, sometimes through a dealer. Examples are the <b>remilling</b> enterprises for the peasant's rubber and the processing of cassava-flour. The large-scale production of world commodities on so-called estates is a commercial enterprise. Land, usually comprising a fairly large area, is obtained by renting uncultivated 'waste land' on a regular long-term basis or by purchasing it (in the old days) from the government (so-called 'particuliere landerijen'). Here labour is normally paid in money and substantial capital is employed. Estate agriculture, as a rule, is not limited to the cultivation of crops: in most cases, the crude product is processed in a factory connected with the estate. On the whole, modem and scientifically established methods of cultivation and processing are used. The estates produce cash crops for the international markets. Another form of estate agriculture occurs in the production of sugar. Here the enterprise owns only the factory (mill) and rents its land from the farmers. Thus it would be better if the word factory be used here instead of estates. The same applies to a number of enterprises which process tobacco and other annual crops (such as cassava). The figures of production area and other economic data of the crops grown for these factories are included in the tables for the estate crops. This study is primarily based on data collected from various publications, especially those of the Central Bureau of Statistics. But these statistics are not all equally reliable or complete. For example, no sufficiently detailed studies on the national income and its composition were available. Data from the population census, conducted in October 1961 are still being processed and only some of its results could be included. Results of the agricultural census, executed in October 1963, were even more difficult to obtain. There are good data on production in particular sectors, on some elements of the balance of payments and on retail prices in Djakarta, compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics. Some of the gaps could be filled by the author's own reports on the aspects of agricultural development planning which he drew up since he joined the Indonesian State Planning Bureau in 1952. Although technical, political, social and other problems will be touched, the nature of this study is primarily economic. The problems of agricultural development are its central objective, and therefore agricultural considerations play a decisive role. Of course the author feels the limitations of such a presentation, but readers who are interested in Indonesian agricultural development in a broader context should consult other studies. The most important are included in the bibliography. As to the set-up of this publication the following scheme has been followed. Chapter 2 gives in brief the theoretical background of why agriculture should be developed and how this applies to the Indonesian situation. The next three chapters contain a brief description to the historical development of agriculture in Indonesia since 1815 up till now: Chapter 3 indicates the development of the whole of Indonesia with special emphasis on the islands outside Java (the so-called Outer Islands), Chapter 4 is focussed on the agricultural development in Java, and Chapter 5 treats the effects of population pressure in Java. Chapters 6 to 9 describe the approaches, the policies and the measures adopted by the government to face the problems after World War II as outlined in the previous chapters. They briefly discuss the successive agricultural development plans launched after World War II (Chapter 6) and the measures to relieve pressure on land in Java by agricultural resettlement (Chapter 7); the attempts to increase agricultural exports and the rehabilitation of the sugar factories as an example are given in Chapter 8, whereas Chapter 9 discusses the measures to improve peasant's agriculture with special attention to rice production. Chapter 10 analyses the significance of the failure of the agrarian policy of the Indonesian government to overall agricultural development in Java. Chapter I I identifies the need to integrate the agricultural development of Java in the economic development of the whole of Indonesia. Finally Chapter 12 summarizes the main conclusions of the study. Conclusions The present study reviews the main aspects of the agricultural development in Java. The main conclusions emerging from it are the following. 1. Increasing productivity of peasant agriculture is of crucial importance in the initial period of economic growth of a country. 2. Therefore, the central problem of agricultural development in Indonesia is how to get peasant agriculture moving in Java, where we face the problem of an already excessive yet still increasing agricultural population. The government has taken several measures to relieve this unfavourable situation, such as: (a) To transfer Javanese farmers to the sparsely populated Outer Islands. (b) To pay special attention to the rehabilitation of the sugar factories which are mostly under state management. (c) To increase the productivity of peasant agriculture by applying more fertilizers, better seeds and other improved agricultural techniques. But the results have not been up to expectations due to various factors, as will be explained in the following point. 3. In Chapter 10 it is shown that agricultural development in Java has been retarded by the following three main causes: (a) The political instability of the country. (b) The multitude and inconsistency of government's objectives in pursuing agricultural development. (c) The non-existence of any clear doctrinal concept in the government's agrarian policy as regards the political attitude towards the peasants. Other constraints on recent agricultural growth are: (a) The more rapid population growth after World War H. (b) The diversion of some economic resources for non-economic development purposes. (c) The weakness of the first attempts in comprehensive agricultural planning. 4. It is evident from the study that increasing productivity of the peasant's agriculture on a revolutionary scale requires technical, economical, attitudinal and political transformation of the rural society that cannot be brought about quickly. The transformation of peasant agriculture requires a series of interlocking changes in so many different aspects of rural life that a perspective for a period considerably longer than the eight years anticipated in the Overall National Development Plan 1961 - 1969 is required. 5. Next, an identity of purpose and common responsibility between the government and the peasants is necessary to accelerate agricultural development. 6. Another important conclusion of the study, which is also stressed by Joosten and others, is that expansion of the markets for the agricultural products is necessary for agricultural development. Such an increase would certainly alleviate the situation of Javanese farmers for a time, but ultimately it would not solve their problem. Only if most of that increase can be siphoned off into industrial investment does it seem that the application of more and better agricultural inputs will really contribute something dynamic to the general economic situation. If it cannot be drawn off, it will merely further the process of 'involution', not just in agriculture now, but throughout the whole of the Javanese society. 7. It is also shown that Java's rural economy is simply unable to absorb population growth without falling standards of living. In Chapter 11 it is illustrated that a solution of Java's problem requires that the 1, 600, 000 persons or 360, 000 families added each year to its population should be absorbed elsewhere in the economy, into industries in Java or the Outer Islands, or into agriculture in the Outer Islands. Only an effective policy of agricultural resettlement to the Outer Provinces and industrialization could enable Java to provide employment for its annual population increase. Such a policy, vigorously applied and accompanied by an adequate educational program, will give the government a breathing space to reconstruct the national economy. Then it might be obligatory for the government, in order to achieve rapid economic development, to persuade the population to stop looking on the maximum of babies as a 'bliss'. 8. Looking at Indonesia from these perspectives, the final conclusion is that it is unwarranted to expect that economic (including agricultural) development occurs easily and quickly. Accordingly, economic development is a long-term goal and the program to carry it out must be equally long in term. However, natural and human resources, climate and location are such that, when the government does succeed to prepare the basis for the 'plane to take off' (to use the familiar metaphor of economic growth as introduced by Rostov), it has the potential 'to fligh high and fast'...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} impact of semolina dough formulation (percentage of sourdough [SD] addition and presence of yeast [Y] or common wheat gluten [G]) added singly and in combination on the sensory and physicochemical profiles of fresh and stored sourdough-started durum breads, particularly Moddizzosu type. Main distinctive features of breads were identified, and optimal amounts of SD addition in presence of either yeast or gluten were used to achieve high-quality fresh and stored soured durum breads made with semolina and <b>remilled</b> semolina {{at a ratio of}} 80 : 20. Common features of durum breads included color parameters and crumb grain characteristics of either fresh or stored samples. Increasing SD significantly increased scores for overall acceptability. In yeasted costarted samples, a linear promotion of both aroma and taste intensity resulted from increasing amounts of SD, whereas the opposite trend was observed for unyeasted breads. Higher values for degree of acidification, specific volume, crumb cohesiveness, resilience, and springiness but lower pH, moisture content, crumb hardness, and chewiness in durum samples were achieved with increased SD. The presence of Y counteracted acidification, harmonized volume increase, hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, and resilience, minimizing the effects of the SD added. Y and G acting singly as crumb softeners when added together to soured durum breads started with SD at a dose > 10 % provided lower and slower crumb firming kinetics. Breads with especially slow retrogradation kinetics corresponded to yeasted started samples with or without added gluten, regardless {{the presence or absence of}} SD. In unyeasted soured breads, the dose of SD slightly decreased the rate and extent of amylopectin retrogradation, irrespective of gluten addition...|$|E
40|$|Founded in 1972, the Trust for Public Land (TPL) is a {{national}} non-profit organization that works to protect land for its natural, scenic, and recreational values as parks and open space. One way that TPL accomplishes this is through holding property temporarily until the land can be permanently protected by a government agency or a community land trust. In 1990, TPL purchased a 34 -acre property located near Bridal Veil Falls in the Columbia River Gorge. The Bridal Veil mill site property has a lengthy history dating back to 1886. The site was first used for a paper mill. Later, a milling operation received rough-cut timbers from a lumber mill high in the surrounding forests and <b>remilled</b> it into a finished product. It was then transported to market by boat or train. Over the next century the site would see different owners and uses, mainly related to mill operations. Since 1990, the land has remained largely unused and under the ownership of TPL. In keeping with its mission, TPL {{wants to see the}} Bridal Veil mill site transferred to an owner that would ensure its restoration and preservation. Students enrolled in the 2002 Master of Urban and Regional Planning (MURP) Workshop at Portland State University (PSU) worked with TPL to develop a future vision for the site. This document presents one possible restoration plan that incorporates unique features of the site for the enjoyment of those who live in and visit the area. The restoration plan reviews the existing conditions, examines opportunities and constraints, considers the regulatory guidelines, and offers specific strategies for the site 2 ̆ 7 s restoration. The plan incorporates natural, scenic, recreational, and historic elements. It is hoped that those who ultimately own the property and who are entrusted with its welfare will look at this document, use the research that has been compiled, and consider the proposed restoration plan that has resulted from this effort...|$|E
