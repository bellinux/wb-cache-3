5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its <b>ripeness</b> levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards <b>ripeness</b> the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of <b>ripeness</b> over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|The grapes exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these {{varying levels of}} <b>ripeness,</b> while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in {{the high cost of}} some Zinfandels.|$|E
5|$|The {{taste of}} the red wine depends on the <b>ripeness</b> of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like {{raspberry}} predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring {{the sweetness of the}} wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having a higher level of <b>ripeness</b> and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the <b>ripeness</b> of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different <b>ripeness</b> levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced {{to high levels of}} rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve <b>ripeness.</b> If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape. The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.|$|E
5|$|Carménère wine has a {{deep red}} color and aromas found in red fruits, spices and berries. The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon {{and it is a}} medium body wine. As a result many find it can be drunk easily with fish. Although mostly used as a {{blending}} grape, wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carménère which, when produced from grapes at optimal <b>ripeness,</b> imparts a cherry-like, fruity flavor with smoky, spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color. Its taste might also be reminiscent of dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. The wine is best to drink while it is young.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>ripeness</b> levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E
5|$|The cheese {{course was}} {{served by a}} Maître d'hôtel on a trolley. White's rules {{dictated}} that after lunch, the cheese was reviewed {{to ensure that a}} sufficient serving was left to present for the dinner seatings. One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn {{against the wall of the}} kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the <b>ripeness</b> of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall for the rest of the service.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of <b>ripeness</b> to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be {{collected}} once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E
5|$|In California, {{the main}} stylistic {{difference}} in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain vineyards {{and those on}} flatter terrain like valley floors or {{some areas of the}} Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils which produces smaller berries with more intense flavors, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of aging to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to be characterized by deep inky colors and strong berry aromas. Throughout California there are many wine regions that have the potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to full <b>ripeness</b> and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.|$|E
5|$|When a {{vegetable}} is harvested, it {{is cut off}} from its source of water and nourishment. It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops. Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can {{be left in the}} ground and harvested over an extended period. The harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to the crop. Onions and garlic can be dried for a few days in the field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm, moist surroundings, during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens. Before marketing or storage, grading {{needs to be done to}} remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality, size, <b>ripeness,</b> and color.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is grown}} {{in nearly every}} South American country {{including}} Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically limited by the excessively high yields that were commonplace throughout the country. As producers begun to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences began to emerge that distinguished Chilean Cabernets. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the climate of the region {{is the most important}} consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a greater concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time in the bottle to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavors that can be perceived as sweet due to the <b>ripeness</b> of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.|$|E
25|$|In viticulture, <b>ripeness</b> is the {{completion}} of the ripening process of wine grapes on the vine which signals the beginning of harvest. What exactly constitutes <b>ripeness</b> will vary depending on what style of wine is being produced (sparkling, still, fortified, rosé, dessert wine, etc.) and what the winemaker and viticulturist personally believe constitutes <b>ripeness.</b> Once the grapes are harvested, the physical and chemical components of the grape which will influence a wine's quality are essentially set so determining the optimal moment of <b>ripeness</b> may be considered the most crucial decision in winemaking.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{distinctive}} characteristic of German wines {{is the high}} level of acidity in them, caused both by the lesser <b>ripeness</b> in a northerly climate and by the selection of grapes such as Riesling—which retain acidity, even at high <b>ripeness</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Sensory qualities vary {{according}} to genetic background, environmental conditions during development, <b>ripeness</b> at harvest, postharvest conditions, and storage duration.|$|E

25|$|Prädikatswein, {{recently}} (August 1, 2007) renamed from Qualitätswein mit Prädikat (QmP) wines {{made from}} grapes of higher <b>ripeness.</b> As <b>ripeness</b> increases, the fruit characteristics and price increase. Categories within Prädikatswein are Kabinett, Spätlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein. Wines {{of these categories}} can not be chaptalized. All these categories within Prädikatswein are solely linked to minimum requirements of potential alcohol. While these may correlate with harvest time, there are no legally defined harvest time restrictions anymore.|$|E
25|$|After {{veraison}} has begun, viticulturists {{will test}} several hundred individual berries picked from clusters throughout the vineyard in increasing intervals as the harvest draws closers. The berries will usually {{be taken from}} the middle of the cluster bunch, avoiding vines on the end of rows that tend to be exposed to the most unusual elements. The must weight is then plotted on a chart to see the increasing <b>ripeness</b> and sugar levels of the grape. What must weight reading is most desirable will depend on the winemaker's personal goal for <b>ripeness.</b> A wine with the intended potential alcohol level of 12% will need to be harvested at around 21.7°Bx/12 degree Baumé/93°Oe. A wine with the intended potential alcohol level of 15% will need to be harvested at around 27.1°Bx/15 degree Baumé/119°Oe. The desired <b>ripeness</b> for most table wines tend to fall somewhere between those two must weight measurements.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{means that}} a Prädikatswein has been {{harvested}} {{at a higher level}} of <b>ripeness</b> than the minimum required, and can mean that the wine is sweeter or more intense.|$|E
25|$|Rules {{three and}} five of the {{avoidance}} doctrine thus echo concerns addressed by the constitutional and prudential limitations of standing and <b>ripeness.</b> In some cases, the tenets of the avoidance doctrine addressed above— rules 1, 2, 3 and 5— may serve to buttress the conclusion that a case is not justiciable, or that a case is justiciable but the court will voluntarily decline to exercise its jurisdiction for prudential reasons. The avoidance doctrine {{as set out in}} these rules functions primarily as a supplement to established doctrines of standing and <b>ripeness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Coffee {{berries and}} their seeds undergo several {{processes}} {{before they become}} the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries {{at the peak of}} <b>ripeness.</b> More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of <b>ripeness</b> by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methods—the dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.|$|E

25|$|German wine {{classification}} {{is sometimes}} {{the source of}} confusion. However, to those familiar with the terms used, a German wine label reveals much information about the wine's origin, minimum <b>ripeness</b> of the grapes used for the wine {{as well as the}} dryness/sweetness of the wine.|$|E
25|$|However, {{for some}} sweet wines, a {{successful}} harvest requires manual work {{and training for}} pickers to pick only clusters where the berries have reached optimum <b>ripeness</b> or {{have been affected by}} noble rot (for the Sélection de Grains Nobles). For sparkling wines hand picking is recommended and it is absolutely necessary for white wines from grapes with coloured skin.|$|E
25|$|Some {{producers}} {{also use}} additional propriate designations to denote quality or <b>ripeness</b> level within a Prädikat. These {{are out of}} the scope of the German wine law. Especially for Auslese, which can cover a wide range of sweetness levels, the presence of any of these designations tends to indicate a sweet dessert wine rather than a semi-sweet wine. These designations are all unregulated.|$|E
25|$|Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy is {{also used}} to analyze and {{characterize}} different food products. Some examples are the assessment of food/package interactions, the analysis of milk composition, the characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream mixes, the measure of meat ageing, the investigation of <b>ripeness</b> and quality in fruits and the determination of free acidity in olive oil.|$|E

25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate <b>ripeness.</b> Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine <b>ripeness</b> will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E
25|$|The USDA food {{database}} {{reveals that}} many common fruits contain nearly {{equal amounts of}} the fructose and glucose, {{and they do not}} present problems for those individuals with fructose malabsorption. Some fruits with a greater ratio of fructose than glucose are apples, pears and watermelon, which contain {{more than twice as much}} fructose as glucose. Fructose levels in grapes varies depending on <b>ripeness</b> and variety, where unripe grapes contain more glucose.|$|E
25|$|Then {{they are}} sorted by <b>ripeness</b> and color and most often {{the flesh of}} the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the seeds are {{fermented}} to remove the slimy layer of mucilage still present on the seed. When the fermentation is finished, the seeds are washed with large quantities of fresh water to remove the fermentation residue, which generates massive amounts of coffee wastewater. Finally, the seeds are dried.|$|E
25|$|The German wine {{classification}} system puts {{a strong emphasis}} on standardization and factual completeness, and was first implemented per the German Wine Law of 1971. Almost all of Germany's vineyards are delineated and registered as one of approximately 2,600 Einzellagen ('individual sites'), and the produce from one {{can be used to make}} wine at any quality level, depending not on yields but on the <b>ripeness,</b> or must weight of the grapes.|$|E
25|$|Grüner Veltliner is a mid-ripening grape {{variety that}} usually {{does not have}} an issue {{achieving}} physiological <b>ripeness</b> in most of the northern European wine regions where it is grown. The vine can be very fruitful and high yielding producing small, yellowish-green berries. Grüner Veltliner is very susceptible to the viticultural hazards of downy and powdery mildews as well as infestation from a species of rust mites that feed on grape leaves.|$|E
25|$|Beerenauslese wines ("berry selection") {{are made}} from grapes that have {{achieved}} minimum defined potential alcohol levels. The concentration of the grape juice may have been facilitated by a fungus Botrytis, which perforates {{the skin of the}} grape forcing water to drip out and all remaining elements to concentrate. Due to the high potential alcohol level required for this category of <b>ripeness,</b> these wines are generally made into sweet wines and can make good dessert wines.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{difficult}} to objectively measure the qualities of physiological <b>ripeness,</b> researchers in the wine industry have been continuing pursuing methods that give some indication of the grapes development in these areas. For instance, some wineries have started using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to determine the concentration of color producing anthocyanins in the skins of grapes. A sizable amount of research has gone into studying methods to determine the presence of flavor precursors and glycosides in the ripening grapes.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most of the}} Loire, {{the main}} red grape of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil is Cabernet franc (known locally as Breton) with Cabernet Sauvignon {{accounting}} for an increasing amount of plantings. Vineyards are densely planted with 5000 grapevines per hectare. Both Cabernet varieties are usually trained to the guyot simple system with one long cane pruned to seven or eight buds each winter. Both grapes are late-ripening varieties that require a long growing season ideally ending with an Indian summer {{in order to achieve}} full <b>ripeness.</b>|$|E
