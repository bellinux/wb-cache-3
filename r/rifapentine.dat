In 2014, <b>rifapentine</b> was approved for the treatment of latent TB infection in patients at high risk of progression to active disease and is currently under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency. Expanding indications of <b>rifapentine</b> largely affect diabetes patients, since about one-third of them harbor latent TB. Clinical consequences of <b>rifapentine</b> use in this population and potentially harmful interactions with hypoglycemic agents are widely underexplored and generally considered similar to the ones of rifampicin. Indeed, <b>rifapentine</b> too may decrease blood levels of many oral antidiabetics and compete with them for protein-binding sites and/or transporters. However, the two drugs differ in protein-binding degree, the magnitude of cytochrome P 450 induction and auto-induction, the degree of renal elimination, and so on. <b>Rifapentine</b> seems to be more suitable for use in diabetes patients with renal impairment, owing {{to the fact that it}} does not cause renal toxicity, and it is eliminated via kidneys in smaller proportions than rifampicin.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} optimal doses of 1 st-line antituberculosis dosing regimens using a population pharmacokinetic approach, quantify food effects, drug combinations and pharmacological effects. The population pharmacokinetics of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide in 76 children with tuberculosis were described using a population pharmacokinetic approach, and then Monte Carlo simulation were performed to evaluate adequacy of newly recommended weight band based doses in World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. Food effect (breakfast) was evaluated on <b>rifapentine</b> pharmacokinetic data in 35 healthy male volunteers. Effect of co-administered intermittent <b>rifapentine</b> on the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin was evaluated in 28 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, who participated in a multicenter controlled clinical trial evaluating high dose <b>rifapentine</b> in combination with moxifloxacin. The moxifloxacin pharmacokinetic model, together with a previously published ofloxacin pharmacokinetic model, {{was used to evaluate}} the efficacy between moxifloxacin and ofloxacin. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic summary variables of <b>rifapentine</b> and moxifloxacin were evaluated as predictors of treatment outcome. Simulations based on the final models suggested that with the new guidelines, and utilizing available paediatric fixed dose combinations, children will receive adequate rifampicin exposures when compared to adults, but with a larger degree of variability. However, pyrazinamide and isoniazid exposures in many children will be lower than in adults. For food effect, all meals compared with the fasting state, high fat meal had the greatest effect on <b>rifapentine</b> oral bioavailability, increasing it by 86 %; bulky low-fat, bulky-high-fat, and chicken soup resulted in 33 %, 46 %, and 49 % increases in <b>rifapentine</b> oral bioavailability, respectively. Similar trends were observed for the metabolite 25 -desacetyl <b>rifapentine.</b> For drug-resistant tuberculosis, using a target ratio of ≥ 100 for multidrug-resistant strains (without resistance to injectable agents or fluoroquinolones), the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was 88 % for moxifloxacin and only 43 % for ofloxacin. The higher dose of 800 mg moxifloxacin was needed to achieve a CFR target of ≥ 90 %. In terms of drug-interaction, <b>rifapentine</b> increased the clearance of moxifloxacin by 8 % during antituberculosis treatment compared to that after treatment completion without <b>rifapentine.</b> Also, the effect moxifloxacin and <b>rifapentine</b> pharmacokinetics indices on outcome treatment outcome support that combined effect of longer treatment duration and higher <b>rifapentine</b> exposures are associated with better treatment response. In summary, the newer WHO doses for children may give lower pyrazinamide and isoniazid exposures in many children than in adults. Meals have a substantial impact on <b>rifapentine</b> exposure. <b>Rifapentine</b> did not result in a clinically significant change in moxifloxacin exposure.

Nevertheless, the more favorable pharmacokinetics of <b>rifapentine</b> over rifampin was addressed in other experimental models.
