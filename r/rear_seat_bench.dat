5000|$|Development for the {{passenger}} car started {{at about the}} same time. The car was intended as being [...] "the first and only farm-designed car", meaning that it would meet the farmer's requirements better than the competition, and was named the [...] "Whole Family Car", as it seated up to nine passengers. The conventional steel ladder frame had a wheelbase of 118 in. The <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> <b>bench</b> and jump seats of this touring car were quickly removable, thus providing ample payload. Power was delivered by the Chevrolet FB four-cylinder engine, rated at 37 bhp. General Motors announced this new automobile in 1919 and planned to build 2,250 units in its first season and 5,000 for 1920. However, only one prototype was built, making the Samson the only car ever that GM announced but never produced.|$|E
