40|$|Recent {{experiments}} on s-wave neutron scattering from ^ 192, 194, 196 Pt {{found that the}} <b>reduced</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>width</b> distributions deviated significantly from the expected Porter-Thomas distribution (PTD). Several explanations have been proposed for this PTD violation within the statistical model of compound nucleus reactions. Here, we study the statistics of the reduced neutron widths in the reaction n+ ^ 194 Pt within a model that combines the standard statistical model of the compound nucleus with a realistic treatment of the neutron channel. We find that the reduced width distribution is well described by the PTD for a reasonable range of the neutron-nucleus coupling strength and depth of the neutron channel potential. We also find that the energy dependence of the average width {{in the presence of}} a near-threshold bound or virtual state of the neutron channel potential differs from the √(E) dependence, commonly assumed in experimental analysis, and is in excellent agreement with the analytic form proposed by H. A. Weidenmüller [1]. In these cases, the <b>reduced</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>width</b> distributions extracted using the √(E) dependence are significantly broader than the PTD.

Earlier analysis of data on <b>reduced</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>widths,</b> Γ 0 n, showed that the distributions of Γ 0 n for 192, 194 Pt deviate significantly from the Porter-Thomas distribution (PTD) predicted by random matrix theory. In this contribution we report on preliminary results of the analysis of distribution of total radiation widths, Γγ, in 192, 194, 195, 196 Pt+n reactions. Comparison of experimental data with predictions made within the nuclear statistical model indicates that standard models of Photon Strength Functions (PSFs) and Nuclear Level Density predict Γγ distributions which are too narrow. We found that satisfactory agreement between experimental and simulated distributions can be obtained only by a strong suppression of the PSFs at low γ-ray energies and/or by violation of the usual assumption that primary transitions from neutron resonances follow the PTD.
