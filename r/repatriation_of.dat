5|$|To repopulate the claimed {{areas with}} Armenians, the Soviet {{government}} organized a <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> Armenians living abroad, mostly {{survivors of the}} Armenian Genocide. Between 1946 and 1948, 90,000 to 100,000 Armenians from Lebanon, Syria, Greece, Iran, Romania, France, and elsewhere moved to Soviet Armenia.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the Germans {{introduced}} the Flamenpolitik, intended to divide German-occupied Belgium by favouring Dutch speakers over French ones. In February 1941, <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> Flemish prisoners began.

50|$|Państwowy Urząd Repatriacyjny (abbreviated PUR, {{translated}} into English as State Repatriation Office, State Office <b>of</b> <b>Repatriation,</b> National Repatriation Office or National Office <b>of</b> <b>Repatriation)</b> was a Polish communist governmental body created on 7 October 1944 {{to oversee the}} repatriations in Poland. At first, PUR oversaw <b>repatriations</b> <b>of</b> Poles from Kresy, and from 1945, <b>repatriations</b> <b>of</b> Germans from Regained Territories.

The population was previously larger, but in 2006 1,500people left the island during a <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation was motivated by wide-scale reductions-in-force in the phosphate mining industry. It is the least-populated country in Oceania.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of the Ottoman Empire to the Allies in October 1918, the city of Marash had come under the joint-occupation of the British and French armies (the latter largely composed of Armenians from the French Armenian Legion). In February 1919, Field Marshal Edmund Allenby appointed a number of French officers to oversee {{the administration of the}} region of Cilicia and the <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> tens of thousands of Armenians who had been deported during the war {{in the course of the}} Genocide. Within a few months, approximately 150,000 Armenians had been repatriated, including 20,000 natives from Marash.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures {{as a metaphor for the}} reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} in Europe the Australian government decided against contributing Australian forces to the occupation forces that were sent to Germany {{as part of the}} post war settlement so that it could begin the <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> the AIF early.

5|$|Following the surrender, IX Corps was {{assigned}} command of occupation {{forces on the}} northern island of Hokkaidō. IX Corps transferred its headquarters in October 1945 to Sapporo for occupation duties. The next few years were a period during which {{the terms of the}} surrender were supervised and enforced; Japanese military installations and material were seized, troops were disarmed and discharged, and weapons of warfare disposed of. The duties of the occupation force included conversion of industry, <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> foreign nationals, and supervision of the complex features of all phases of Japanese government, economics, education, and industry.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, the {{construction}} of war cemeteries, graves and their associated memorials were typically placed {{under the control of}} a central state authority. The Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) took on this role for Britain and her empire. The Commissione nazionale per la onoranze ai caduti di guerra in Italy coordinated the military <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> bodies and {{the construction}} of cemeteries. The German war graves commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge (VDK), was established in 1919, and took strict control over the creation and style of German war cemeteries. The American Battle Monuments Commission oversaw US military graves in a similar fashion.|$|E

5|$|Quisling {{spent the}} last months of the war trying to prevent Norwegian deaths in the {{showdown}} that was developing between German and Allied forces in Norway. The regime worked for the safe <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> Norwegians held in German prisoner-of-war camps. Privately, Quisling had long accepted that National Socialism would be defeated. Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945 left him free to pursue publicly his chosen end-game, a naïve offer of a transition to a power-sharing government with the government-in-exile.|$|E
5|$|<b>Repatriation</b> <b>of</b> Canadian internees and {{remaining}} American internees {{was announced in}} August 1943 (not all American internees had been repatriated in June 1942). Preparations similar to the prior repatriation were made, including messages and reports to be delivered. The ship, the Teia Maru, reached Hong Kong on 23 September, taking on board 73 Canadian internees, 24 American internees, and 13 Latin American internees. The ship sailed to Goa, where an exchange of prisoners and internees with Japan took place.|$|E

She made another three Magic Carpet trips between Pearl Harbor and the continental United States to ferry more soldiers home. During the first months of 1946, Arkansas lay at San Francisco. In late April, the ship got underway for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on 8 May, and departed Pearl Harbor on 20 May, bound for Bikini Atoll, earmarked for use as target for atomic bomb testing in Operation Crossroads. On 1 July, Arkansas was exposed to an air burst in ABLE, but survived with extensive shock damage to her upperworks, while her hull and armored turrets were lightly damaged.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, {{the three major}} allied powers ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line. Following {{the destruction of the}} Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> Poles from Kresy, Poland became {{for the first time in}} its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar Soviet sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following the Surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, Japanese {{military}} personnel and civilians were repatriated to Japan between 1945 and 1946, although some 350 labourers and technicians were permitted to remain behind to carry out repair works to Palau's infrastructure. However, offspring of Japanese-Palauan intermarriages were allowed to remain, although a few migrated to Japan with their fathers. In the 1950s, Japanese-Palauans formed an organisation, Sakura-kai to assist Japanese-Palauans and Japanese youths who were abandoned by their parents to search for their parents and kinsmen who were forcibly separated {{as a result of}} forced <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> Japanese settlers back to Japan. The organisation became a cultural organisation from the 1980s onwards, as most Japanese-Palauans had reunited with their Japanese families or voluntarily chose to leave certain family separations as they were.|$|E
