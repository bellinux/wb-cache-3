50|$|The {{transformation}} {{is made possible}} by a centrally located electric motor, which stretches the vehicle with the help of two mechanical screw-and-nut gears by exactly 746 millimetres to its full extended length of 3.74 metres. The longitudinal members run on low-friction precision rollers and disappear like a drawer in the <b>rear</b> of the <b>floor</b> <b>pan.</b> Despite its variable length the engineers succeeded in designing the adjustable <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> with the torsional rigidity necessary for a roadster. To ensure absolute operational safety the extension mechanism also features self-locking safety latches. The car lacks a roof and doors.|$|R

5|$|The fold {{that connects}} {{the back of the}} sublingua and tongue to the <b>rear</b> <b>floor</b> of the mouth is called the plica sublingualis. In lemurs, this is an {{underdeveloped}} structure consisting of only a tiny outgrowth {{on the floor of the}} mouth. The point where the plica sublingualis attaches to the <b>rear</b> <b>floor</b> of the mouth marks the location of the submandibular salivary glands.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} presented by this project was the <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> since in left hand drive, the driver had the most space available. The engine and gearbox offset had to be reversed with the use of Tickford engineered brackets, and unique <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> sections, to achieve the necessary space for the driver in RHD. In addition, an all new dashboard and interior trimmings had to be installed. In effect, TVE re-manufactured the Mustang at a cost of A$4 million remaining the biggest ever project for Tickford in Australia.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The article {{provides}} {{a discussion on}} the studies on material vibration propagation in <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> of the passenger car. The purpose was to analyse the vibration signals in multiple measuring points. The time-frequency distribution of the signals allows to identification the dominant component of the signal useful for material natural frequency calculation. Design/methodology/approach: The investigations were conducted based on the modified method of experimental and operating modal analysis. The investigation comprised 3 steps: research and measurements of vibration accelerations in a vertical direction perpendicular to the horizontal surface of vehicle in four selected points (impact excitation), analysis of the time courses of the vibration response, signal processing {{and analysis of the}} time-frequency distribution of the vibrationFindings: The distribution of the signal allows to identify the dominant frequency band. For the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> it is low frequencies, between 20 and 40 Hz. In this band the natural frequencies of the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> material can be identificationResearch limitations/implications: Number of the acceleration sensors and impossibility of the impact excitation signal recorded. Originality/value: Application of the modified method of experimental and operating modal analysis for the vehicle frame and car body. Research on the material properties influence on the vehicle vibration research.

25|$|The Daimler DS420 Limousine was {{introduced}} in 1968 to replace their Daimler DR450 and BMC's Vanden Plas Princess. The DS420 used a Jaguar Mk X unitary carcass with a restyled roof and a <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> extended by 21inches behind {{the front seat and}} strengthened. The extension of the Mark X unit bodies was done by Motor Panels, a subsidiary of Rubery Owen. The <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> with mechanicals was available to coachbuilders as a rolling chassis for use with specialised bodywork, usually as hearses; Startin of Birmingham built more than 300 DS420-based hearses. Finishing from the bare metal, including final assembly and trimming the interior, was done by Vanden Plas, who had earlier made the Princess for BMC.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 {{he started}} to make the open Sonic model which no longer relied on the Beetle <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> but had a proper space frame. Later {{versions}} could have VW Straight-4 or Renault 25 engines. A fixed head coupé version was also made.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel tank}} was a 55-litre {{capacity}} FIA ‘bag’ tank located beneath the <b>rear</b> <b>floor.</b> Wheels were Tarmac 7 x 17 in aluminium wheels or 6 x 15 in aluminium wheels for gravel.|$|R
50|$|All models {{share the}} same hood, fenders, <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> lower door panels, rocker panels, engine {{compartment}} and front end. In mid-1971, Chevrolet introduced an optional GT package for hatchback and Kammback models, which included the RPO L11 two-barrel 140 engine, F41 handling option, special tires and trim.|$|R
5000|$|Rust is {{an issue}} for the Montecarlo and Scorpion. [...] Unless kept in a dry {{environment}} active prevention is required to fend off rust. The firewall and wheel wells are common locations for rust. [...] Rusted <b>floor</b> <b>pans</b> are {{a major cause of}} early Montecarlo/Scorpion demise.|$|R

50|$|A small {{sports car}} {{originally}} made by Cook Brothers using a Volkswagen <b>floor</b> <b>pan.</b> In 1983 Peter Clapham of Fibreglass Daytona Limited acquired the moulds. 30 kits {{were made by}} Cook Brothers and another 17 by Daytona. Six of the Daytona made cars were targa topped. In 1991 Daytona sold the moulds to a person from Rotorua.|$|R
50|$|The Dodge Omni 024 was a {{modified}} version of the popular Dodge Omni made from 1979 to 1982. Analogous to the VW Scirocco, this car was a lower, sportier 3-door hatchback version of the Chrysler/Simca Horizon, using the four-door hatchback's <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> and chassis as a basis. The cars were designed in-house at the prompting of Lee Iacocca.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Manxter 2+2 and Manxter DualSport were born. These two {{new models}} are modernizations of the {{original}} design, but are sized for a full-length Beetle <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> (and the DualSport can also {{be based on a}} Super Beetle chassis, unlike any other Manx model). Custom versions for higher-power engines and other variations are also available.|$|R
50|$|The drivetrain, suspension, <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> {{and many}} of the body panels of the 262C were taken {{directly}} from the Volvo 260 sedan, with Bertone building the roof pillars, roof pan, windshield surround, cowl, and the upper parts of the doors. The roof of the 262C is about 10 cm lower than that of the 260 sedan.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1973, {{because of}} the oil crisis Peugeot {{presented}} the 504 L. It featured a coil sprung live rear axle and a smaller 1796 cc engine rated at [...] ( [...] for Automatic). The different rear axle required somewhat more space; this required some alterations to the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> which meant marginally less boot space and rear headroom.|$|R
2500|$|The cabin held three seats, {{pilot and}} {{passenger}} side-by-side and the observer behind, facing either forwards or rearwards.

50|$|Manufactured in Wolfsburg, West Germany (1968-74), Hannover, West Germany (1974-83), Puebla, Mexico (1970-80), and Jakarta, Indonesia (1973-80), the Type 181 shared its {{mechanicals}} with Volkswagen's Type 1 (Beetle) and the pre-1968 Volkswagen Microbus, its <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> {{with the}} Type 1 Karmann Ghia, and its concept with the company's Kübelwagen, {{which had been}} used by the German military during World War II.|$|R
50|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} design was of semi-trailing arm configuration and, similarly {{to most of the}} body and <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> structure aft of the A-Pillar, was shared between the 1000 and Type 110. However, the front suspension of the Typ 110 was a new double-wishbone design with longer wishbones, better noise isolation and longer wheel travel than those of the 1000 models.|$|R
50|$|Molded carpet {{generally}} {{refers to}} the carpets used in the interiors of cars. The molded carpet is designed to hug the floorpans {{so there are no}} pockets of loose fitting carpet. The process of creating the molded carpet requires the original <b>floor</b> <b>pans</b> and having the carpet laid upon the pans with a backing in between. There are generally two types of backings, poly backing and mass backing. Mass backing is the original type of backing that most car makers use. It's thicker and more rubber-like than poly backing. Poly backing is lighter, easier to bend and more mesh like than mass backing. Some molded carpets come with jute backing where your feet rest on the <b>floor</b> <b>pans.</b> This helps prevent the carpet from wearing out prematurely because the majority of the wear is where feet contact the carpet. The jute padding also helps prevent mildew which was more of a problem in older leaking cars than modern cars.|$|R
5000|$|County Rider (France, 1993): Intended {{to appeal}} to equestrians, the County Rider was {{equipped}} with a <b>rear</b> <b>floor</b> liner, rub-strips and wheel-arch protectors, mudflaps, floor mats, an adjustable tow hitch, and a saddle rack. Available as either a three- or five-door, all were painted green with special decals.|$|R
5000|$|After {{shelving}} {{a planned}} upgrade for the [...] {{in light of}} a technical review of the team, Virgin Racing decided to re-introduce the upgrade for the Italian Grand Prix. The upgrade is a complete overhaul of the Virgin MVR-02, including a new engine cover, sidepods, exhaust and <b>rear</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Moke's {{construction}} is simple. The body mainly {{consists of two}} box-section [...] "pontoons" [...] or [...] "sideboxes" [...] running between {{the front and rear}} wheels, and include (non-hollow) extensions of that {{from the back of the}} car all the way up to the front. These are connected by the <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> the firewall and a sturdy lateral torque box that runs under the front seats and stiffens the body in torsion. The left-hand pontoon contains the fuel tank; the right-hand has a compartment for the battery and a small lockable storage area. The 1972 [...] "Moke, Special Export", commonly referred to as a [...] "Californian" [...] Moke, has an Austin Sprite/MG Midget type fuel tank fitted beneath the <b>rear</b> <b>floor</b> area to meet the American FMVSS safety requirements of the time. Standard Mokes of the same period and later Californian Mokes use the conventional tank mounted in the left sidebox. Later Portuguese Mokes have additional lockable storage space at the rear of the vehicle. The optional cloth canopy has plastic side windows, and is held up by a thin tubular structure that can easily be removed when not needed. In later versions this was replaced with a more solid roll cage. The windscreen can easily be unbolted and removed if not needed. There are just three curved panels in the Moke, the bonnet, the firewall and the floor, each of which is only curved in one direction. This makes it relatively straightforward to reproduce and replace Moke body components without access to sophisticated machine tools.|$|R
