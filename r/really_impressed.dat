Every religion is interested in death, but Catholicism takes it to a particularly high level. [...] Seriously, in Catholicism, you're supposed to love your enemy. That <b>really</b> <b>impressed</b> me as a kid, and it has helped me as an actor. [...] The way that I view the characters I play is part of my religious upbringing. To abandon curiosity in all personalities, good or bad, is to give up hope in humanity." ...|$|E

After {{discovering}} Sia's music online, Guetta picked her to appear on his fifth studio album, Nothing but the Beat. Guetta told an insider from Los Angeles, [...] "I was totally amazed by Sia...This has made me more curious to study her music more because I was <b>really</b> <b>impressed.</b> I have the biggest people on the album {{and she has a}} different profile, more like an indie kind of artist and it makes her song even more special, it makes it stand out I think." ...|$|E

His wild brown eyes--wilder than ever in the moonlight--rested entreatingly, with a strange underlying expression of despair, on Naomi's face. His hands, clasped lightly in front of him, trembled incessantly. Little as I liked the man, he did <b>really</b> <b>impress</b> me as a pitiable object at that moment.|$|R
500|$|... "Cocktails" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Human Resources {{representative}} Toby Flenderson on the series. Lost series creator J. J. Abrams was hired on as episode director, his first such credit for the series. Abrams disliked the American series when it first premiered, due to his love for the original British series. The director explained, [...] "I resented it before I saw it, because I thought, 'well, {{how are you going}} to do what Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice. And that's despite having to make 22 episodes, which is twice the length of what the BBC show did. And I thought that the show became brilliant. I was <b>really</b> <b>impressed</b> by how it worked." ...|$|E

We collaborated on the wardrobe and had meetings about hair and makeup people, we talked {{a lot on the}} phone and met Tone and Rich — two of the best choreographers. [...] ' so sweet and funny and so normal and down to earth. It's really fun as a director to see her in front of the camera. She's so creative with this stuff. The video is very simple, it's very, very minimal. So it's her, her, her. And she's totally engaging every second. She really knows how to work with a camera and move. I was <b>really</b> <b>impressed,</b> and I have worked almost with every female artist in the business".|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{impact on}} him was {{likewise}} emphatic: [...] "I saw {{a cousin of}} mine dance to... 'Hound Dog' and I {{had never seen her}} get up and be moved so much by anything. It <b>really</b> <b>impressed</b> me, the power of the music. I started getting records immediately after that." [...] By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as [...] "mesmerizing... like someone from another planet."

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Stephen Cook stated [...] "The range of styles found on drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson's Decode Yourself is amazing, but what <b>really</b> <b>impresses</b> {{is the way}} Jackson unifies the {{disparate}} strains with his unique arrangements and varied rhythmic support". Jeff Eldredge said [...] "Despite {{the return of the}} violin, the addition of the trombone, some interesting stylistic forays into country, bebop, and space funk, and the promise of a Bill Laswell production, the third Island release, Decode Yourself, is marred by a thin sound, gimmicky electronic drum and synthesizer timbres, and (surprisingly) a plodding, four-square rhythmic monotony".|$|R
500|$|On {{the quality}} of 3-D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, [...] "I think it's good, actually. I {{think people are going}} to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be <b>really</b> <b>impressed</b> with it, actually." [...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX {{magazine}} about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way." ...|$|E
500|$|The trophy was {{presented}} to Arteta by former Arsenal player and assistant coach Pat Rice. Arsenal's win marked the biggest victory in the Community Shield since 1998. Wenger was delighted with his team’s performance and described their play {{in the first half}} as complete. He noted that although Arsenal lost possession in the second half and looked [...] "less fluent", the team retained [...] "spirit and organisation". He described the win as significant because it gave Arsenal a confidence boost going into the season and suggested it was important to beat a top-six league team because of their poor record last season. Wenger was happy with how Arsenal's new signings came through the match and reserved special praise for Chambers: [...] "He played with a maturity and intelligence that I was <b>really</b> <b>impressed</b> with." [...] Olivier Giroud, the man of the match, said of his goal: [...] "I tried instinctively to shoot and to hit the target. I was a bit lucky but that's what I wanted to do." ...|$|E
500|$|David Blackwell of the American review site Enterline Media said, [...] "MI-5 <b>really</b> <b>impressed</b> me {{with the}} first two seasons. The third season does start {{out for the first}} three episodes before it reaches some highs and lows until it stabilizes with the last two episodes of season 3." [...] He felt that Tom Quinn's exit was his {{favourite}} moment in the first two episodes, and that Adam is [...] "just [...] cold" [...] as Tom. He also praised the character development, stating [...] "character development is excellent in this season. Danny receives great moments as he is brought into the spotlight from his feelings for Zoe to his conflicted feelings about things he does in the name of Queen and Country, but Danny doesn't break and let his emotions become a crutch like Tom did (when Tom wanted a sleeper agent not to the job MI-5 wanted the sleeper to do)." [...] Blackwell concluded by saying [...] "sometime MI-5 fails as a show this season, but it still reaches levels of greatness. It {{will be interesting to see}} what they have in store for season 4." ...|$|E

Zinedine Zidane also praised Iniesta, stating on the Spanish radio station Cadena COPE, [...] "Iniesta <b>really</b> <b>impresses</b> me. He's got so much influence in Spain's game.

The jurors reportedly {{were not made}} aware of the composer of the songs in contention until after the selection for the 2015 Eurovision entrant for the Czech Republic had been made. Juror Michael Kocáb stated: [...] "The songs we were choosing from were quite on par with each other in my opinion. However, the winning song 'Hope Never Dies' was a candidate of mine too.

500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile.

The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000.

500|$|Jolin's artistic {{education}} {{started at}} the Technical School (later known as Konstfack) in Stockholm in 1906. The school mainly taught painting techniques and Jolin {{was more interested in}} learning about style. Within the year, he started looking for another place to continue his studies. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Konstnärsförbundet (The Artist's Association) had a school on Glasbruksgatan in Stockholm. Jolin applied there in the autumn of 1907. His future teacher Karl Nordström reviewed his drawings and Jolin was admitted to the school the same year. Jolin joined the inner circle at the school, a group of Scandinavian artists who would later become known as De Unga (The Young Ones) or 1909 års män (The Men of 1909). Among these were Isaac Grünewald, Leander Engström, Birger Simonsson and Gösta Sandels. Jolin described the pupils at the school as: [...] "...a bunch of individuals with long hair, great muffler scarves and slouch hats worn askew in a way that <b>really</b> <b>impressed</b> me since I was only seventeen and the youngest of the bunch. The most amazing of them all was of course Isaac who had longer and more raven hair than anybody else and a fluttering violet scarf. I had not yet beheld such a creature. We became good friends." [...] Jolin's education at the Artist's Association was curtailed by the school's closure in the spring of 1908.|$|E

[...] Two reviews of Honey on the website Anime Jump greatly diverged: site maintainer Mike Toole rated the series 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "tons of fun, a light, tasty action-comedy that's... spirited and silly and tongue-in-cheek", and praised its character designs as [...] "letter-perfect to Go Nagai's original (quite appealing!) character designs"; Jason Carter praised Calvello's voice work in his review of the 2004 ADV release, but rated it 1.5 out of 5 stars, said that much of Cosplay City [...] "goes back and forth between looking like an ordinary modern metropolis and resembling some sort of Smurf town built of polluted marshmallows", and concluded [...] "The characters are largely annoying, the plot is , the nudity is absurd, the fighting is rarely more than average, and the whole thing is ultimately pointless - as the series' later attempts at developing Honey as a person make all too clear." [...] Sandra Dozier of DVD Verdict was also unimpressed with Honey: [...] "I can see why it is popular—the glossy animation, the well-endowed chicks, the scant clothing. If that isn't your thing, however, there is very little to draw you to this series." ...|$|E
