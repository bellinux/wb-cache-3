[...] The authors used integral field spectroscopy, from the SWIFT and Palm 3K instruments, to perform a spatially-resolved spectroscopic analysis of four GPs, numbered 1,2,4 and 5. Among the results are that GPs 1 & 2 are rotationally-supported (they have a <b>rotating</b> <b>centre),</b> while GPs 4 & 5 are dispersion-dominated systems. GPs 1 & 2 show morphologies indicative of ongoing or mergers. However, GPs 4 & 5 show no signs of recent interactions and have similar star-forming rates. This indicates mergers are not [...] "a necessary requirement for driving the high star formation in these types of galaxies".|$|E
5000|$|Rotary {{vane pumps}} (fixed and simple {{adjustable}} displacement) have higher efficiencies than gear pumps, {{but are also}} used for mid pressures up to [...] in general. Modern units can exceed [...] in continuous operation, although vane pumps are not regarded as [...] "high pressure" [...] components. Some types of vane pumps can change {{the centre of the}} vane body, so that a simple adjustable pump is obtained. These adjustable vane pumps are in general constant pressure or constant power pumps: the displacement is increased until the required pressure or power is reached and subsequently the displacement or swept volume is decreased until an equilibrium is reached. A critical element in vane pump design is how the vanes are pushed into contact with the pump housing, and how the vane tips are machined at this very point. Several type of [...] "lip" [...] designs are used, and the main objective is to provide a tight seal between the inside of the housing and the vane, {{and at the same time}} to minimize wear and metal-to-metal contact. Forcing the vane out of the <b>rotating</b> <b>centre</b> and towards the pump housing is accomplished using spring-loaded vanes, or more traditionally, vanes loaded hydrodynamically (via the pressurized system fluid).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} study of polygons forming on the free surface of a water flow {{confined}} to a stationary cylinder and driven by a rotating bottom plate as described by Jansson et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 96, 2006, 174502). In particular, we study {{the case of a}} triangular structure, either completely ‘wet’ or with a ‘dry’ centre. For the dry structures, we present measurements of the surface shapes and the process of formation. We show experimental evidence that the formation can take place as a two-stage process: first the system approaches an almost stable rotationally symmetric state and from there the symmetry breaking proceeds like a low-dimensional linear instability. We show that the circular state and the unstable manifold connecting it with the polygon solution are universal in the sense that very different initial conditions lead to the same circular state and unstable manifold. For a wet triangle, we measure the surface flows by particle image velocimetry (PIV) and show that there are three vortices present, but that the strength of these vortices is far too weak to account for the rotation velocity of the polygon. We show that partial blocking of the surface flow destroys the polygons and re-establishes the rotational symmetry. For the rotationally symmetric state our theoretical analysis of the surface flow shows that it consists of two distinct regions: an inner, rigidly <b>rotating</b> <b>centre</b> and an outer annulus, where the surface flow is that of a point vortex with a weak secondary flow. This prediction is consistent with the experimentally determined surface flo...|$|E

This field has progressed {{over the last couple of}} decades with the application of new technology. The HERMES European curriculum recommendations include interventional bronchoscopy skills in the modules of thoracic tumours and bronchoscopy [1]. However, interventional bronchoscopy is not available in all training centres and consequently, not all trainees will obtain experience unless they <b>rotate</b> to <b>centres</b> specifically offering such training. In this review, we give an overview of interventional bronchoscopic procedures used for the treatment and palliation of thoracic malignancy. These can be applied either with flexible or rigid bronchoscopy or a combination of both depending on the anatomical location of the tumour, the complexity of the case, bleeding risk, the operator’s expertise and preference as well as local availability. Specialised anaesthetic support and appropriately trained endoscopy staff are essential, allowing a multimodality approach to meet the high complexity of these cases...|$|R
40|$|We study {{transient}} spiral {{structures in}} an isothermal, thin, galactic disc. We find no instability that can grow everywhere from infinitesimal disturbances, but spiral structure does {{grow in the}} disc due to an arbitrarily strong, asymmetric, central source. An initially finite spiral undergoes transient swing amplification as it is gradually wound-up by differential rotation. An independent sequence in negative time describes a leading spiral swinging to a trailing spiral. The dynamical coupling is established between the swinging potential and the arm particles, by ensuring that this potential constrains a locally <b>rotating</b> distribution function <b>centred</b> on the arms. This swing amplification propagates in radius at the constant rotational speed of the disc, and leaves behind an exponential density decline in space and time. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

5|$|The Solar System formed 4.568 {{billion years}} ago from the {{gravitational}} collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to <b>rotate</b> faster. The <b>centre,</b> {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200AU and a hot, dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} mosaicing for {{a sequence}} of images acquired by a camera <b>rotating</b> about its <b>centre.</b> The novel contributions are in two areas. First, in the automation and estimation of image registration: images (60 +) are registered under a full (8 degrees of freedom) homography; the registration is automatic and robust, and a maximum likelihood estimator is used.

The second novel area is in enhanced resolution. A region of the mosaic can be viewed at a resolution higher than any of the original frames. It is shown that the degree of resolution enhancement is determined by a measure based on a matrix norm.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the parallel computation of incompressible viscoelastic rotating flows. Such flows arise in many industrial settings being particularly important in the food industries, for materials such as dough. Here, the material is driven by one or two stirrers, <b>rotating</b> about the <b>centre</b> of a cylindrical vessel, fixed to a lid. The stirrers may be positioned in eccentric arrangement with respect to the axis of the vessel. The motivation for this workis to advance fundamental technology modelling the kneading of dough with the ultimate aim to predict the optimal design of dough mixers themselves, hence, leading to efficient dough processing. The numerical method employed is a time-marching semi-implicit Parallel-Taylor-Galerkin scheme, posed in a cylindrical polar coordinate system. This scheme is second-order in time and based on a fractional-staged pressure-correction formulation. Parallel computations are performed, via domain decomposition, on homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed networks using the Parallel Virtual Machine message passing protocol. Parallel timings are compared against those for sequential computation. Ideal linear speed-up is observed with increasing numbers of processors. This is achieved through a sophisticated implementation that effectively masks communication within pure computation costs. 1 A. Baloch, P. W. Grant and M. F. Webster...|$|R

They provide a large {{field of view}} for a given pixel count while maintaining a high resolution at {{the centre of the}} field of view and, in addition, produce a mapping that is scale and rotation invariant. The effectiveness of the sensor depends greatly upon the geometry used and the sampling methods employed. In this paper, we define a sensor geometry and introduce an ideal weighted sampling method, where the pixels in the image lying at the intersection of sensor cells, are subdivided into smaller sub-pixels, and an interpolation method using a variable width interpolation mask, whose size varies exponentially with {{the size and shape of}} the cells in the sensor array. We compare the computational requirements of these methods, and show that they are scale and rotation invariant, when the image is scaled or <b>rotated</b> about its <b>centre,</b> giving the sensor a functionality similar to that provided by the retinal mapping present in the mammalian retina.

To make a further study, material removal function of the tool is firstly established through theoretically modelling, next, a correlative function with weighted factors is built, which is suitable for specifying the wearing degree of the tool. Finally, to discover the relationship between the material removal rate and the tool wearing characteristics, and to optimize the grinding process, analysis and experiments are then carried out on a K 9 glass specimen by means of three kinds of tool materials, i. e., polyurethane pad, aluminum plate and pitch based on the proposed technique and model.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of superconductivity {{continues to be}} of considerable scientific and practical interest. Underlying this phenomenon is the formation of electron pairs, which in conventional superconductors do not <b>rotate</b> about their <b>centre</b> of mass ('s-wave' pairing; refs 1, 2). This contrasts with the situation in high-temperature superconductors, where the electrons in a pair {{are believed to have}} two units of relative angular momentum ('d-wave' pairing; ref. 3 and references therein), Here we report small-angle neutron-scattering measurements of magnetic nux lines in the perovskite superconductor Sr 2 RuO 4 (ref. 4), which is a candidate for another unconventional paired electron state-'p-wave' pairing, which has one unit of angular momentum(5 - 7). We find that the magnetic flux lines form a square lattice over a wide range of fields and temperatures, which is the result predicted by a recent theory(8, 9) of p-wave superconductivity in Sr 2 RuO 4. This theory also indicates that {{only a fraction of the}} electrons are strongly paired and that the orientation of the square nux lattice relative to the crystal lattice will determine which parts of the three-sheet Fermi surface of this material are responsible for superconductivity.
