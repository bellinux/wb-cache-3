50|$|The {{official}} {{coat of arms}} {{contains a}} black-white part and three red zig-zag lines. This shield became the official coat of arms in 1933. The red zig-zag lines <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> <b>landlords</b> of Bubenhofen, <b>the</b> former land owners. <b>The</b> black-white part <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> connections to Ulm.

50|$|Dunraven was {{the owner}} of the 39000 acre Adare Manor estate at Adare, County Limerick. Following the {{initiative}} of George Wyndham, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, he was instrumental in forming the 1902 Land Conference of which he was chairman, <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> <b>landlord</b> side. Together with William O'Brien, who <b>represented</b> <b>the</b> tenant side, the conference resulted in the publication of a unanimous report in January which led to the enactment of the Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act (1903). This terminated the last vestige of absentee landlordism in Ireland and enabled tenants to purchase land from their landlords under favourable financial provisions.|$|R
5|$|Ramarayaningar got {{his first}} taste of {{politics}} when he {{was appointed to the}} district board of North Arcot. In 1912, he was nominated to the Imperial Legislative Council of India and <b>represented</b> <b>the</b> <b>landlords</b> and zamindars of South India. He served as a legislator until 1915. During this period, Ramarayaningar earned the praise of the Viceroy, Lord Hardinge. He actively supported reforms in the Hindu society. In 1914, Ramarayaningar moved a legislation for the creation of separate Provincial departments for the welfare of depressed classes. In 1915, he was elected President of the Third Andhra Congress.|$|R
25|$|This led to {{tensions}} {{and finally a}} boycott by all labourers. The peasants withheld part of the harvest as a negotiating tactic. The Paddy Producers Association, <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> local <b>landlords,</b> organised external labourers to continue the harvest. Matters became fraught when a local shopkeeper who supported the protesters was kidnapped by supporters of <b>the</b> <b>landlords</b> and beaten up. Protesters attacked the kidnappers, forcing them to release their hostage. In the clash, one of the landlords' agents was killed.|$|R

For the 2013 political races in Brooklyn, they created the Jobs for New York PAC, a pro-development political action committee to support controversial Brooklyn councilwoman Laurie Cumbo and other candidates. The PAC gave Cumbo at least $80,000 through August 2013, an unpopular move with residents in a rapidly gentrifying area. (In an AARP-sponsored discussion a week later, Cumbo claimed that she received no money from REBNY.) In early 2015, REBNY <b>represented</b> <b>the</b> <b>landlords</b> of unsafe buildings in council member Margaret Chin's downtown district and pushed back when approached about having to pay to move tenants while the buildings were being fixed. REBNY president Steve Spinola said, [...] "This legislation would better protect tenants by strengthening the existing (Department of Housing Preservation and Development) program to relocate tenants instead of cutting into funds used for building repairs and maintenance." ...|$|R
50|$|The film is {{a seminal}} reformist melodrama critiquing the Zamindari system from the {{viewpoint}} of the Kisan Sabha (Farmer's Union) agitations in Andhra Pradesh. Small-time landowner Narsi Reddy (Raghawan) borrows money from a shavukar (rich person) who <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> major zamindar (<b>landlord)</b> (Sitapathy) of <b>the</b> village. When Narsi Reddy votes for a peasant candidate (Kosaraju) rather than a candidate of the political party supported by <b>the</b> <b>landlord,</b> his son is attacked and he is publicly humiliated.|$|R
50|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his son, the fourth Earl, {{who served in}} the Conservative {{government}} of Lord Salisbury as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1885 to 1886. A member of the Irish Unionist Party, he was also Lord Lieutenant of County Limerick from 1894 to 1926. When the Chief Secretary for Ireland, George Wyndham, called a Land Conference in 1902, Lord Dunraven was chairman <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> <b>landlord</b> side and together with William O'Brien played a decisive role in attaining agreement on the enactment of the Wyndham Land Purchase Act (1903) which enabled tenants to purchase lands from their landlords under favourable financial provisions. He was a Senator of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1926. He had no male heirs and on his death the barony of Kenry became extinct. The Fourth Earl published his memoir Past Times and Pastimes in 1922 (Hodder and Stoughton). He was succeeded in the other titles by his cousin, the fifth Earl. He had previously represented South Glamorganshire in Parliament as a Conservative from 1895 to 1906. The titles became extinct when the seventh Earl died on 25 March 2011 at his residence, Kilgobbin House.|$|R

60|$|Rising at {{five o'clock}} next morning, I took a walk about the village: none of the houses were strolling about to-day, but it was early for them yet, perhaps: and then amused myself by {{lounging}} {{in a kind of}} farm-yard behind the tavern, of which the leading features were, a strange jumble of rough sheds for stables; a rude colonnade, built as a cool place of summer resort; a deep well; a great earthen mound for keeping vegetables in, in winter time; and a pigeon-house, whose little apertures looked, as they do in all pigeon-houses, very much too small for the admission of the plump and swelling-breasted birds who were strutting about it, though they tried to get in never so hard. That interest exhausted, I took a survey of the inn's two parlours, which were decorated with coloured prints of Washington, and President Madison, and of a white-faced young lady (much speckled by the flies), who held up her gold neck-chain for the admiration of the spectator, and informed all admiring comers that she was 'Just Seventeen:' although I should have thought her older. In the best room were two oil portraits of <b>the</b> kit-cat size, <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> <b>landlord</b> and his infant son; both looking as bold as lions, and staring out of the canvas with an intensity that would have been cheap at any price. They were painted, I think, by the artist who had touched up the Belleville doors with red and gold; for I seemed to recognise his style immediately.|$|R

60|$|The evening shadows were {{beginning}} to gather over the quiet little German town, and the diligence was expected every minute. Before {{the door of the}} principal inn, waiting the arrival of the first visitors of the year, were assembled the three notable personages of Wildbad, accompanied by their wives--the mayor, <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants; <b>the</b> doctor, <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> waters; <b>the</b> <b>landlord,</b> <b>representing</b> his own establishment. Beyond this select circle, grouped snugly about the trim little square in front of the inn, appeared the towns-people in general, mixed here and there with the country people, in their quaint German costume, placidly expectant of the diligence--the men in short black jackets, tight black breeches, and three-cornered beaver hats; the women with their long light hair hanging in one thickly plaited tail behind them, and the waists of their short woolen gowns inserted modestly in the region of their shoulder-blades. Round {{the outer edge of the}} assemblage thus formed, flying detachments of plump white-headed children careered in perpetual motion; while, mysteriously apart from the rest of the inhabitants, the musicians of the Baths stood collected in one lost corner, waiting the appearance of the first visitors to play the first tune of the season in the form of a serenade. The light of a May evening was still bright on the tops of the great wooded hills watching high over the town on the right hand and the left; and the cool breeze that comes before sunset came keenly fragrant here with the balsamic odor of the first of the Black Forest.|$|R
