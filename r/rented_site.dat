50|$|Camp Amal was an {{experimental}} camp of the Habonim youth movement. Founded in 1948 on a <b>rented</b> <b>site</b> in Vermont, {{the camp was}} intended to give campers a thorough education in Hebrew, as opposed to simply using Yiddish or English, which were prominently in use at many Jewish camps at the time. After an inauspicious beginning, the camp attracted wide praise in the Jewish educational community {{for its ability to}} teach campers Hebrew. First moving the camp to a site in Connecticut in 1950, Habonim, due to financial troubles, was forced to move the camp again several times, in 1951 to the Cream Ridge Farm, in 1952 to Camp Moshava, and in 1953 to share the campsite of Camp Galil in Pennsylvania. The sharing of one campground by two different camps turned out to be untenable, so Habonim discontinued Amal after 1953. However, the camp influenced Habonim and other Jewish camping groups to start using and teaching Hebrew more aggressively at all their camps.|$|E

George Bunn, a Methodist ploughman who came to live in the village, preached twice a quarter and conducted a weekly class meeting. In 1910 William Wade a local coach builder became Society Steward. He helped to form the first Chapel Trust. It owned the organ, the pulpit Bible and the lamps.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a meta-analysis on 64 econometric models from 47 studies predicting forestland conversion to agriculture (F 2 A), forestland to development (F 2 D), forestland to non-forested (F 2 NF) and undeveloped (including forestland) to developed (U 2 D) land. Over 250 independent econometric variables were identified from 21 F 2 A models, 21 F 2 D models, 12 F 2 NF models, and 10 U 2 D models. These variables were organized into {{a hierarchy of}} 119 independent variable groups, 15 categories, and 4 econometric drivers suitable for conducting simple vote count statistics. Vote counts were summarized at the independent variable group level and formed into ratios estimating the predictive success of each variable group. Two ratios estimates were developed based on (1) proportion of times the independent variables had statistical significance and (2) proportion of times independent variables met the original study authors’ expectations. In F 2 D models, we confirmed the success of popular independent variables such as population, income, and urban proximity estimates but found timber <b>rents</b> and <b>site</b> productivity variables less successful. In F 2 A models, we confirmed success of popular explanatory variables such as forest and agricultural rents and costs, governmental programs, and site quality, but we found population, income, and urban proximity estimates less successful. In U 2 D models, successful independent variables found were urban rents and costs, zoning issues concerning forestland loss, site quality, urban proximity, population, and income. In F 2 NF models, we found poor success using timber rents but high success using agricultural <b>rents,</b> <b>site</b> quality, population, and income. Success ratios and discussion of new or less popular, but promising, variables was also included. This meta-analysis provided insight into the general success of econometric independent variables for future forest-use or -cover change research...|$|R
5000|$|There are broadly {{two forms}} of {{collaborative}} consumption:(1) Mutualization or access systems: resource distribution systems in which individuals may provide and obtain temporary access to resources, either free or for a fee.
