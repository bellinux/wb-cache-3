40|$|Combined {{heat and}} power on a {{residential}} scale, {{also known as}} micro-cogeneration, is currently gaining traction as an energy savings practice. The configuration of micro-cogeneration systems is highly variable, as local climate, energy supply, energy market and the feasibility of including renewable type components such as wind turbines or photovoltaic panels are all factors. Large-scale lithium ion batteries for electrical storage in this context can provide cost savings, operational flexibility, and reduced stress on the distribution grid {{as well as a}} degree of contingency for installations relying upon unsteady renewables. Concurrently, significant advances in component materials used to make lithium ion cells offer performance improvements in terms of power output, energy capacity, robustness and longevity, thereby enhancing their prospective utility in <b>residential</b> <b>micro-cogeneration</b> installations. The present study evaluates annual residential energy use for a typical Canadian home connected to the electrical grid, equipped with a micro-cogeneration system consisting of a Stirling engine for supplying heat and power, coupled with a nominal 2 kW/ 6 kW h lithium ion battery. Two novel battery cathode chemistries, one a new Li 2 Ì† 013 NCA material, the other a high voltage Ni-doped lithium manganate, are compared in the <b>residential</b> <b>micro-cogeneration</b> context with a system equipped with the presently conventional LiMn 2 O 4 spinel-type batteryPeer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|A new {{configuration}} for {{an existing}} PEM fuel cell based <b>residential</b> <b>micro-cogeneration</b> {{system has been}} proposed in which the conventional low temperature PEM fuel cell is replaced with a high temperature one. Detailed mathematical models for the fuel processor, HT- PEM fuel cell stack and all other components of the plant have been developed. The electrical and thermal performance of the system have been determined and the corresponding results have been compared with the performance indices achieved for the previous plant. The electrical efficiency and the primary energy savings index obtained for the proposed system are 29. 21 % and 17. 50 % respectively which are considerably higher than the ones obtained for the existing LT-PEM based plant (21. 18 % and 6. 07 %). In order to enlighten {{our understanding of the}} behaviour of the system a parametric study on the key parameters of the system has been carried out...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{storage units}} have become {{important}} components in <b>residential</b> <b>micro-cogeneration</b> (MCG) systems. As MCG systems are often connected to single residences or buildings {{in a wide}} variety of settings, they are frequently unique and highly customized. Lithium-ion batteries have recently gained some profile as energy storage units of choice, because of their good capacity, high efficiency, robustness and ability to meet the demands of typical residential electrical loads. In the present work, modeled scenarios are explored which examine the performance of a MCG system with an internal combustion engine, photovoltaic input and a Li-ion storage battery. An electricity demand profile from new data collected in Ottawa, Canada is used to provide a full year energy use context for the analyses. The demands placed on the battery are examined to assess the suitability of the battery size and performance, as well as control related functionalities which reveal significantly varying battery use, and led to a quantitative expression for equivalent cycles. The energy use simulations are derived from electrochemical fundamentals adapted for a larger battery pack. Simulation output provides the basis for techno-economic commentary on how to assess large-scale Li-ion batteries for effective electrical storage purposes in MCG systems, and the impact of the nature of the control strategy on the battery service life.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{examines}} {{the operation of}} a <b>residential</b> building-integrated <b>micro-cogeneration</b> system during the heating season {{by means of a}} dynamic simulation software. A wide sensitivity analysis was carried out by considering the influence of the climatic conditions, the size of the combined storage tank and the micro-cogeneration device control logic. The energy, environmental and economic performances of the alternative system were analyzed according to the Italian scenario and compared with those of a conventional system based on separate energy production in order to estimate the potential benefits...|$|R
40|$|Stirling engines (SE) are a market-ready {{technology}} {{suitable for}} residential cogeneration {{of heat and}} electricity to alleviate the increasing demand on central power grids. Advantages of this external combustion engine include high cogeneration efficiency, fuel flexibility, low noise and vibration, and low emissions. To explore and assess the feasibility of using SE based cogeneration systems in the residential sector, {{there is a need}} for an accurate and practical simulation model that can be used to conduct sensitivity and what-if analyses. A simulation model for SE based <b>residential</b> scale <b>micro-cogeneration</b> systems was recently developed; however the model is impractical due to its functional form and data requirements. Furthermore, the available experimental data lack adequate diversity to assess the model's suitability. In this paper, first the existing model is briefly presented, followed by a review of the design and implementation of a series of experiments conducted to study the performance and behaviour of the SE system and to develop extensive, and hitherto unavailable, operational data. The empirical observations are contrasted with the functional form of the existing simulation model, and improvements to the structure of the model are proposed based upon these observations.
