500|$|In 2001 East Worldham {{contained}} roughly {{two-thirds of}} the population of 336 people who lived in the whole Parish of Worldham. Most houses in the area date to the pre-20th century; however in recent times numerous farm buildings have been converted to housing and for industrial purposes. According to the parish website, there are now [...] "two significant industrial developments within the parish". The local economy is based around agriculture, particularly cattle farming. Beef cattle, sheep, grain crops, and hops are the main sources of income, Farmers from the area Worldham traded in Southampton and Alton throughout its history. Most inhabitants are either retired or commute to nearby towns to work. Golf is also important to the local economy, with Worldham Golf Course located just to west and Dean Farm Golf Course just to the east. The Jalsa Salana, an annual convention held at Oaklands Farm nearby, attracts numerous people from surrounding areas. <b>Red</b> <b>Bug</b> Productions are based in the parish cottages along the main road.|$|E

60|$|Through the din and desultoriness of noon, even in {{the most}} Oriental city, is seen the fresh and {{primitive}} and savage nature, in which Scythians and Ethiopians and Indians dwell. What is echo, what are light and shade, day and night, ocean and stars, earthquake and eclipse, there? The works of man are everywhere swallowed up in the immensity of Nature. The Aegean Sea is but Lake Huron still to the Indian. Also there is all the refinement of civilized life in the woods under a sylvan garb. The wildest scenes have an air of domesticity and homeliness even to the citizen, and when the flicker's cackle is heard in the clearing, he is reminded that civilization has wrought but little change there. Science is welcome to the deepest recesses of the forest, for there too nature obeys the same old civil laws. The little <b>red</b> <b>bug</b> on the stump of a pine,--for it the wind shifts and the sun breaks through the clouds. In the wildest nature, there is not only the material of the most cultivated life, and a sort of anticipation of the last result, but a greater refinement already than is ever attained by man. There is papyrus by the river-side, and rushes for light, and the goose only flies overhead, ages before the studious are born or letters invented, and that literature which the former suggest, and even from the first have rudely served, it may be man does not yet use them to express. Nature is prepared to welcome into her scenery the finest work of human art, for she is herself an art so cunning that the artist never appears in his work.|$|E

They have become major threat to cotton in Pakistan since last two years. The present studies were therefore planned to find out the role of sowing dates in cotton pest population. The dusky and <b>red</b> cotton <b>bug</b> population varied considerably with respect to date of sowing. The results revealed that invasion of both bugs was significantly more in case of early sowing (up to 15 red cotton bug/plant & 25 dusky bugs/boll) than in normal and late sowing (8 to 10 <b>red</b> cotton <b>bugs</b> & 10 to 12 dusky bug/boll respectively). Sampling dates exhibited that population of cotton <b>bugs</b> (dusky and <b>red</b> cotton <b>bug)</b> was higher during first week of October followed by mid September, 2013, whereas lower in late sowing.

50|$|Typically {{beginning}} {{their day}} {{at six o'clock}} in the morning, the men would rub their skin with an insect repellent (to ward off ticks and <b>red</b> <b>bugs).</b> Mostly they travelled on horseback and ideally with a guide. Epiphytic orchids (growing non-parasitically in trees) were collected by climbing the trees. Orchids found in trees too tall to climb were removed {{by the use of}} a fork-top sapling cut on site. When the plants were within reach a machete was used to separate the orchid plant from the tree (machetes were also necessary for opening up trails). At times, the men would dismount and tie up their horses to search deeper in the dense jungle. The first week they collected 75 plants of Odontoglossum powellii.
