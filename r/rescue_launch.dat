2500|$|Soon after sunrise {{the crew}} of the {{helicopter}} reported an item floating on Botany Bay. The crew of the air-sea <b>rescue</b> <b>launch</b> investigated the sighting and retrieved a piece of damaged upholstery. Airline staff confirmed the upholstery was from a Vickers Viscount pilot's seat. Searchers on the beach in the north-east of Botany Bay, near Bunnerong Power Station, found some cabin furnishings and human remains. At the south of the Bay the outer section of the right wing, still showing registration VH-TVC, was found protruding above the surface of shallow water near Kurnell. [...] Later in the day Police and Navy divers investigated a large fuel slick in the centre of Botany Bay and discovered the scattered wreckage of VH-TVC in [...] of water, [...] north of the outer section of the right wing. The aircraft had crashed [...] south-east of Sydney airport.|$|E
2500|$|When {{it became}} clear Flight 325 was not {{responding}} to radio calls and the aircraft could not {{be seen on the}} radar screen in the control tower the Alert Phase of search and rescue procedures was initiated. [...] The Police, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy and Volunteer Coastal Patrol were notified. A message was broadcast on the radio frequency used by coastal shipping. The Department of Civil Aviation air-sea <b>rescue</b> <b>launch</b> based on Botany Bay made a circuit of the Bay's foreshores. When Flight 325 failed to arrive at its destination, search and rescue procedures were elevated to the Distress Phase. In the hours after loss of contact with Flight 325 no report was received of an aircraft accident so there was general foreboding that it had crashed into the Tasman Sea. At first light the next morning two Douglas DC-3 aircraft began searching the sea to the east of Sydney. A helicopter and several motor launches also began searching Botany Bay.|$|E

Shelly sank quickly after the collision, which the Israel Broadcasting Authority said broke her in half. 11 crew members escaped, and most climbed aboard a <b>rescue</b> <b>launch</b> lowered by Salamis Glory and were subsequently rescued by the Israeli Navy. The rest were rescued by helicopter. The survivors refused {{to be taken to}} a local hospital for treatment. Salamis Glory subsequently returned to port in Haifa, showing slight damage to her hull. None of Salamis Glorys 700 or so passengers and crew was injured.|$|E

50|$|His wife (Karen Steele) begs his {{commanding}} officer to release Paul from his commitment. When Paul shows {{up to take}} the test, he finds Colonel Hughes suiting up. Imploring him to reconsider, Paul makes the case for doing the test to prove that a bailout is possible from the high-speed jet bomber. Flying with Dr. Gruener, Paul ejects, but when the ground observers ask him to indicate he is well by spread-eagling, he does not respond. On board the <b>rescue</b> <b>launch,</b> they pick up Paul and find he is fine; he was simply concentrating so hard that he forgot to spread-eagle. After he is cleared by the medics, Paul is greeted by Carol and his son Kit (Richard Eyer) and, with their blessing, decides {{to continue with the}} project.|$|E
50|$|The Maritime Museum {{provides}} cruises on two vessels: {{the steam}} tug Yelta and the navy work boat Archie Badenoch. Yelta was built at Cockatoo Dockyard in 1949 and {{fitted with a}} steam engine that had been built for a corvette but was left surplus when the war ended. Archie Badenoch was built by GMH’s Birkenhead factory in 1942 for the Royal Australian Navy and was later used as South Australia’s police <b>rescue</b> <b>launch.</b> The oldest vessels in the collection are the timber ketch Annie Watt that was built in 1870 and the iron trader Nelcebee that was shipped from Scotland in parts and launched in Port Adelaide’s Inner Harbor in 1883. Both are stored on hard stand. The collection also includes Sir James Hardy’s championship sailing dinghies, fishing cutters and a naval whaler.|$|E
