5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution, the River Beal was used to power large weaving mills. Within one {{generation}} during the late-19th century, and following a boom in nearby Oldham, Milnrow's staple industry changed from wool weaving to cotton spinning. Soon, distinctive rectangular brick-built mills dominated Milnrow's landscape. Milnrow, the location of some of the earliest <b>ring</b> <b>spinning</b> companies, had many of the characteristics of a company town. The Heaps of Milnrow exercised significant deferential and political influence in the local area. Following the Great Depression, the region's textile sector experienced a decline until its eventual demise in the mid-20th century. Milnrow's last cotton mill was Butterworth Hall Mill, demolished in the late 1990s. Milnrow experienced population growth and suburbanisation {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, spurred by the construction of the M62 motorway through the area, making Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire commutable. Milnrow Metrolink station opened as part of Greater Manchester's light-rail Metrolink network on 28 February 2013.|$|E

50|$|DREF yarns {{have been}} seen to be {{inferior}} in terms of unevenness, imperfections, strength variability and hairiness. DREF yarns occupy an intermediate position between ring-spun and rotor spun yarns as far as short hairs and total hairiness s concerned. For hairs longer than 3mm, the friction spun yarns are more hairy than the <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarns. Rotor spun yarns show the least value in both the values. DREF yarns are most irregular in terms of twist and linear density while <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarns are most even.|$|R
25|$|In Yorkshire, a mill is {{a textile}} factory. The {{original}} mill {{was built by}} John Moore in 1875 for worsted spinning. In 1919 the clock tower was built as a war memorial to those lost in World War I, and two floors were added. The mill was later sold to W & J Whitehead, who ran the <b>ring</b> <b>spinning</b> machine which {{is still in the}} spinning gallery. In 1970 Bradford Council bought the mill and it opened as a museum on 14 December 1974.|$|E
25|$|Fidgeting is the act {{of moving}} about restlessly. Fidgeting may {{be a result of}} nervousness, agitation, boredom or a {{combination}} of these. It may be a result of genes and is often an unconscious act. Fidgeting may involve playing with one's fingers, hair, or items of clothing. A common act of fidgeting is to bounce one's leg repeatedly. Rings are another common focus of fidgeting; variations include <b>ring</b> <b>spinning,</b> twirling or rolling along a table. Parents often consider fidgeting to be a bad habit, especially in schoolchildren.|$|E
25|$|This is a later {{development}} of the <b>ring</b> <b>spinning</b> frame. The passage of the yarn from the front rollers to the paper tube - used {{in place of a}} bobbin - is different from other types of spinning frames. When the yarn leaves the rollers it passes direct to the top of an elongated spindle and coils round it two or three times before forming a balloon to the ring traveller. This enables the twist to be imparted between the spindle top and roller nip, thus helping to produce a smoother yarn.|$|E
40|$|In this study, combed <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> {{and compact}} spun cotton yarns with {{different}} counts {{were selected from}} different textile mills to conduct singeing treatment. Yarn properties including hairiness, fineness, unevenness and tensile properties were tested after the treatment {{and the results were}} compared with those before treatment. Hairiness was greatly removed after singeing, especially for short hairs with length less than 3 mm. Compact <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> cotton yarns showed higher tex values and lower weight loss than combed <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> cotton yarns under the same counts. Coefficient of variation of yarns increased slightly after singeing treatment. The unevenness of yarn was divided into two parts: basic unevenness of yarn body and hairiness unevenness, to explain the worse yarn evenness after singeing treatment. In this way, the effect of singeing on yarn properties was investigated thoroughly so as to improve yarn quality with less hairiness and good evenness. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore whether the {{properties}} of worsted yarns, especially hairiness, can be improved by combining the Solospun and Sirospun processes into a single Solo-Siro spun process. Wool fibres of 19 and 21 μm in average diameter were spun into 40 tex yarns at different twist levels, using the conventional ring, Sirospun and Solo-Siro spun systems, respectively. These yarns were then tested for a range of properties, including hairiness, tenacity, elongation and evenness, for comparison purposes. The statistical analysis results indicate that the hairiness (S 3 value) of Solo-Siro spun yarns was significantly less than that of both Sirospun and normal <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarns. In addition, the tenacity of the Solo-Siro spun yarns was higher than that of the normal <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarns, while changes in yarn breaking elongation were not statistically significant.

2500|$|In mule {{spinning}} the roving is {{pulled off a}} bobbin and fed through some rollers, which are feeding at several different speeds. This thins the roving at a consistent rate. If the roving was not a consistent size, then this step could cause {{a break in the}} yarn, or could jam the machine. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cylinder called a spindle, which then produces a cone-shaped bundle of fibres known as a [...] "cop", as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than the less skilled <b>ring</b> <b>spinning.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Ring</b> <b>{{spinning}}</b> is {{a method}} of spinning fibres, such as cotton, flax or wool, to make a yarn. The ring frame developed from the throstle frame, which in its turn was a descendant of Arkwright's water frame. <b>Ring</b> <b>spinning</b> is a continuous process, unlike mule spinning which uses an intermittent action. In <b>ring</b> <b>spinning,</b> the roving is first attenuated by using drawing rollers, then spun and wound around a rotating spindle which in its turn is contained within an independently rotating ring flyer.

40|$|Cotton {{knitted fabrics}} were {{manufactured}} with different yarn types (conventional <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarn and torque-free <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarn) with different fibre types (combed cotton and combed Supima cotton) and yarn fineness (Ne 30 and Ne 40). These fabrics were then dyed with {{three types of}} dye (reactive, direct and sulphur dye) with three dye concentrations (0. 1 %, 1. 0 % and 5. 0 % on-weight of fabric (owf)) in three colours (red, yellow and blue). This study examined the impact of constructional parameters and dyeing on ultraviolet (UV) protection properties of cotton knitted fabric. In-vitro test with spectrophotometer was used for evaluating the UV protection property of dyed cotton knitted fabrics. Among the six parameters investigated, fineness of yarn and dye concentration were the most significant factors affecting UPF while the color effect is the least significant. Experimental results revealed that the UPF value of dyed fabrics made from combed cotton is generally higher than the combed Supima cotton since combed cotton is composed of shorter fibres which facilitate the blocking or absorption of UV radiation. Second, fabrics made with twist yarn (i. e. <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarn) have higher UPF value than the corresponding ESTex one (i. e. Torque-free yarn) in general since fabrics made with <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarn tend to shrink during wet processing {{and so it is}} more compact. Third, the UPF value of fabrics made with 30 Ne yarn was higher than the 40 Ne one since it is thicker and has lower fabric porosity. Fourth, fabrics dyed with lower concentration of dye gave the lowest UPF. Fifth, the sulphur dyed samples performed worse than the reactive and direct dyed samples in terms of UV protection property. Sixth, there is no significant difference in UPF for red, yellow and blue coloured fabrics. Seventh, this study also demonstrated that lightness of fabric is negatively related to UV protection property. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
