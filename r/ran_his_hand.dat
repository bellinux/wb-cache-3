60|$|The painter <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> through <b>his</b> hair, {{but stopped}} them half-way, as if {{aware that he}} was being guilty of ill-breeding.|$|R
60|$|Calm {{and dignified}} he <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over them feeling their muscles, and then forced back their lips and {{examined}} their teeth and mouths.|$|R
60|$|The chief arose and, {{walking to}} the ladder, <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> along one of the rungs.|$|E
60|$|The elderly shipping-clerk {{leaned back}} in his chair and <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through his hair, thoughtfully.|$|E
6000|$|Anderson {{turned away}} {{a little and}} <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over the papers on his desk. Did she only imagine that his hand shook a little? ...|$|E
60|$|A {{tall man}} in a white sweater towered over Ken. It was the famous trainer. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over Ken's smooth skin and felt of the muscles.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{standing}} on it." [...] Hendricks <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{over the surface}} of the well stones. [...] "The eye-lock responds to me, not to anybody else. It's my ship. Or it was supposed to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|WELLWYN. [Spasmodically.] Ah! Now that's what I want. [He dabs furiously at the canvas. Then {{standing}} back, <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> through <b>his</b> {{hair and}} turns a painter's glance towards the skylight.] Dash! Light's gone! Off you get, child--don't tempt me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] murmured the desperado, and <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{down the}} mare's nose. But this made her skittish, and she stamped sharply {{half a dozen}} times.|$|E
60|$|Michael Mont in flannels {{stood on}} the {{verandah}} smoking a cigarette. He threw it away as Soames came up, and <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through his hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too had; too bad!" [...] Phil Newell <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{through his}} bushy hair. [...] "I don't believe the navy-yard {{authorities}} will issue a duplicate order." ...|$|E
50|$|The series {{garnered}} controversy {{on release}} {{because of a}} scene where Frankie <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up Margie's skirt. Wallace says {{she had no idea}} Shorter was going to do this, which is why her reaction was so authentic. Many stations around Australia cut the scene.|$|R
60|$|Mor. Alas! I was betrayed myself. He came {{disguised}} like you, and I, poor innocent, <b>ran</b> into <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "To be shure I does, my lord: besides, they've proper gallops there, {{which we}} haven't--and they've betther manes of {{measuring}} horses:--why, they can measure a horse {{to half a}} pound, and tell his rale pace on a two-mile course, {{to a couple of}} seconds.--Take the sheets off, Larry, and let <b>his</b> lordship <b>run</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over him. He's as bright as a star, isn't he?" ...|$|R
60|$|Within {{the room}} that {{sheltered}} him Crispin chuckled, as he <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{along the edge of}} the door until he found the bolt, and softly shot it home.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} not stay {{here in the}} cold. I'll come when I have heard that boy's {{imposition}} and looked over these exercises.' And he <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through his hair again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then all Doing is evil?' Kim replied, lying {{out under}} a big tree at the {{fork of the}} Doon road, {{watching}} the little ants <b>run</b> over <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Craig's airport men's room arrest {{is used in}} a [...] "ripped {{from the}} headlines" [...] episode of Law & Orderâ€”episode 6 of Season 18 ("Political Animal") in the long running {{television}} series. A New York City councilman is shown [...] "foot tapping" [...] and <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> under {{the wall of the}} stall occupied by Lupo (Jeremy Sisto). Lupo subsequently arrests the councilman who later loudly declares [...] "I am not gay!" [...] to some assembled reporters much like Larry Craig did.|$|R
50|$|Lowry is {{selected}} next and, during the examination, is declared a mutant when the priest discovers a joint {{of his left}} index finger is missing. He, too, is sent to his death. Guided to the Survivors' settlement by the male mute, Morrow and Carter arrive in time to witness this butchery. Helena's turn comes next. She sobs, petrified, as the high priest <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over her face and body. Finding no deformity, he cries out, 'Clear!' Turning to the icon on the wall, he orders the summoning of the Spirits.|$|R
60|$|One by one {{the women}} and the men crawled up the ledge which ran along one side of 'Bullia's Room.' Degraded Muhammadan, pig-eating Musahr and wild Sonthal, Janki <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over them all.|$|E
60|$|Ingleby did it, {{and nothing}} more was said until a blaze sprang up. Then the {{corporal}} <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> along the horse's coat. There was a smear of blood on it when he glanced at it.|$|E
60|$|She {{left the}} gate, {{and crossed the}} road to where he held the horse. Shelton, to conceal embarrassment, looked at the horse's legs, and noticed that the grey was resting one of them. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> down.|$|E
60|$|In rushed also all the loungers {{from the}} other court. In such a place as Carrick-on-Shannon, a breach of promise of {{marriage}} case is not an every day treat, and, consequently, men are determined {{to make the most}} of it. Counsellor O'Laugher <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> through <b>his</b> dark grey hair, opens wide his light blue eye, pulls out the needful papers from that bottomless bag, and though but the other moment so signally defeated in the other court, with sure trust in his own resources prepares for victory.|$|R
60|$|On {{the edge}} of the {{sidewalk}} sat a poor, crippled beggar, holding out his hat, and beside him stood a prosperous-looking gentleman who was about to drop a penny into the beggar's hat. Jim knew this gentleman to be very rich but rather stingy, so he ventured to <b>run</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> into the man's pocket and take out his purse, in which was a $20 gold piece. This glittering coin he put in the gentleman's fingers instead of the penny and then restored the purse to the rich man's pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Shore your {{breast-bone}} ain't smashed," [...] replied Wilson, hopefully. And {{he began}} to <b>run</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> around one side of Anson's body and then the other. Abruptly he stopped, averted his gaze, then slowly ran the hand all along that side. Anson's ribs had been broken and crushed in {{by the weight of}} the horse. He was bleeding at the mouth, and his slow, painful expulsions of breath brought a bloody froth, which showed that the broken bones had penetrated the lungs. An injury sooner or later fatal! ...|$|R
60|$|Before him, in the darkness, stood a roadster. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{over the}} pedals and levers, {{breathing}} {{a sigh of}} relief as his touch revealed the familiar control of a standard make. Then he went to the double doors. They opened easily and silently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, a young millionaire like Waltham can {{get hold}} of cash {{whenever}} he wants it," [...] answered Dick. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through his hair thoughtfully. [...] "This looks bad to me. Perhaps I had better take a train back to New York without delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mowgli <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{down the}} {{diagonal}} checkerings of the immense back. [...] "The Turtle is harder-backed, {{but not so}} gay," [...] he said judgmatically. [...] "The Frog, my name-bearer, is more gay, but not so hard. It is very beautiful to see--like the mottling {{in the mouth of}} a lily." ...|$|E
60|$|The lad, terrified out of {{his poor}} wits, did not wait for further commands; he took to <b>his</b> heels and <b>ran,</b> <b>his</b> small <b>hand</b> {{clutching}} the piece of gold. Soon he had disappeared round {{the corner of the}} street.|$|R
6000|$|... "How I {{know which}} is which when they both of them take my hand. When Oscar takes it, a delicious tingle <b>runs</b> from <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> into mine, and steals all over me. I can't {{describe}} it any better than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, madam," [...] Collins interposed. [...] "The {{trick is}} {{absolutely}} safe. And it's a good one, a money-maker. Straighten up a moment." [...] With <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> he began feeling out {{her shoulders and}} back under her jacket. [...] "The apparatus is all right." [...] He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> down her arms. [...] "Now! Drop the hooks." [...] He shook each arm, and from under each of the fluffy lace cuffs fell out an iron hook fast to a thin cable of steel that evidently ran up her sleeves. [...] "Not that way! Nobody must see. Put them back. Try it again. They must come down hidden in your palms. Like this. See.--That's it. That's the idea." ...|$|R
