40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{implementation}} and financing of solid waste management in the Philippines. It assesses {{how much it costs}} forty-one local government units (LGUs) around the country to provide solid waste management services. It also looks at how much revenue these LGUs, and other private waste contractors and operatives, get from supplying these services. The study was carried out in response to a growing solid waste management crisis in the Philippines and legislation that requires LGUs to change their practices. Its main aim was to get information to help LGUs properly finance and implement the government's latest waste management policies and law. The study finds that there is generally a substantial "fiscal gap" between the amount of money needed for waste management and the amount of revenue obtained by LGUs from providing waste management services. However, when the total economic benefits of providing these services were considered (these included the revenues obtained by LGUs, earnings made by other parties and savings from avoided landfill costs), it was found that some LGUs enjoyed positive net benefits. If LGUs could exploit as many potential revenue streams as possible, they could narrow their SWM fiscal gap or even go 'into the black'. The study highlights a number of possible strategies {{that could be used to}} improve the financing of solid waste management. These included finding alternatives to expensive private contractors and looking into recycling as a <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activity.</b> Solid waste management, Philippines...|$|E

Farmer-to-farmer video (initiated by Africa Rice Center) {{was used by}} four local NGOs in the Department of Collines to disseminate the technology. In order to explore changes {{that have been made}} in this rural area following the use of this learning approach, 160 women and 17 women’s associations were surveyed in 16 villages where the video was shown. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using focus groups, semi-structured interviews, participant observations, questionnaires and photographs. The video had not only improved women’s creative spirit, but also their motivation and awareness about the importance of parboiling as a <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activity.</b> Women have become organized around rice parboiling leading to the creation of associations, more appeals to NGOs for additional training in rice parboiling, improved service delivery and improved packaging and marketing of parboiled rice. Improving women’s entrepreneurial spirit contributed to improving the quality of parboiled rice and therefore to an increase in its price, which increased women’s revenues and strengthened social cohesion. The video favored not only the improvement of extension methods used by facilitators, but also the strengthening of relationships among facilitators, rural communities, women processors, microfinance institutions, and input and output markets. Women had more access to formal credit because of their improved organization. Rice producers who attended the open-air video shows {{at the same time as}} the women rice processors became more willing to sell rice on credit to the women.

40|$|Pressure {{is growing}} for presidents of small {{independent}} {{colleges and universities}} to become more entrepreneurial in generating revenue for their schools. This study examined the entrepreneurial orientation of such presidents and how their orientations relate to their institutions' <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities.</b> Forty-seven presidents of small independent institutions were surveyed to determine their self-ratings on 10 characteristics of entrepreneurial orientation: innovative, risk taker, creative, change agent, team builder, competitive, opportunist, visionary, proactive, and persuasive. They also reported their institutions' <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities,</b> their education and professional preparation, and their schools' enrollments and endowments. Follow-up {{interviews were conducted with}} four of the presidents to gain further insights into the results. All of the presidents considered the 10 entrepreneurial characteristics to be, overall, somewhat to very self descriptive (mean 4. 11, range 3. 10 - 5. 00). There were no relationships between entrepreneurial orientation and previously held position or undergraduate education. Presidents believing they had been sufficiently prepared for their fundraising activities perceived themselves as more entrepreneurial than those believing they had not. Of 54 activities in 8 categories, the presidents' institutions carried out a mean of 21. 19 (range 9 - 38). Larger institutions generally carried out more educational programs, retail sales activities, and intellectual property activities than smaller schools. Institutions with endowments of less than 10 million dollars invested in fewer types of securities than those with larger endowments. Entrepreneurial orientation of the president was positively correlated with total <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities,</b> and with Fundraising, Small Business Development, Intellectual Property and Off-campus Real Estate activities. Presidents' entrepreneurial orientations were not related to their institutions' reported financial strength. Conclusions based on both surveys and interviews include the following: •Most presidents of small independent educational institutions have at least a fairly high entrepreneurial orientation, but they exhibit considerable differences in this respect. •Most small independent schools engage in a fairly large number of <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities,</b> but some engage in considerably more such activities than others. •Institutions led by presidents with higher entrepreneurial orientations tend to engage in more <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities.</b> •Becoming more entrepreneurial in developing <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities</b> is important to the financial well-being of many small colleges and universities...|$|R

A qualitative research study was carried out with decision makers in the incubation environment, using a questionnaire that elicited indicators of self-sustainability, internal and external challenges, funding sources and challenges relating to the distribution of institutional funding. This research found that profit and non-profit business incubators alike are evolving their business models to incorporate <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities</b> as a means to minimise the volatility of institutional sources of funding.

Located within KNP is the Makerere University Biological Field Station (MUBFS), with an extensive 25 -year research history and a mandate to assist KNP in protecting the ecosystems of the region through management-relevant research. While KNP and MUBFS have received much visibility within Uganda, East Africa and the tropics as an important biological resource, both institutions face formidable obstacles in meeting their respective conservation mandates. For KNP, severe human population pressures around the Park, coupled with chronic shortages of capital, personnel, and other resources, make maintaining current Park resources problematic, let alone ensuring their long-term viability and protection.

A second public university and new private universities have been established since 1986, but Makerere accounts for most university enrollment and government spending on higher education and it trains most of the country's high-level professional and technical manpower. Its revitalization after many years of neglect is central to government and donor plans for investment in human resource development. The authors emphasize how continuing austerity affects staff retention and staff engagement in academic work, as well as the quality of programs Makerere offers. They present a strategy for university development that involves establishing policy structures to: guide and coordinate investments in higher education as a whole; facilitate the expansion of higher education and the development of diploma-granting institutions to accommodate increasing social demand; and promote cost-saving and <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities</b> in the public universities - which would require giving them more autonomy in matters affecting their cost structure and budgeting.

This will allow management personnel to receive timely objective information about their cost price, identify the feasibility of production and sales, justify the assortment, plan profits. The procedure for determining the cost price of the project products (works, services) in the theory and practice of the state enterprise of the Astrakhan region “Kasprybproekt” is investigated in the work. With the existing practice of planning in design organizations, the planned cost price of design and survey works for established cost items is planned in the cost estimate for production by the design organization as a whole and by the types of work: design, survey and others, without subdividing it by orders (projects). According to this, accounting of the actual costs for work in the design organizations is based. The study showed that the state enterprise of the Astrakhan region “Kasprybproyekt” performs different projects with different execution periods; therefore, it is advisable to use one method of calculating the cost price - job (order) costing method, and link it to the responsibility centers depending on the department of the performer. Based on the research of the used method to the cost price calculate of the project products (works, services) in the state enterprise of the Astrakhan region “Kasprybproekt”, it was proposed to use the job (order) costing method that allows to detail all the project costs without distorting the final financial result and optimize the project costs.

However, CC arguably constrains creators {{in terms of the}} content they can use to produce new works and does nothing to necessarily overcome the complexities posed by copyright infringement should a licence be breached. Nonetheless, {{there are a number of}} intermediaries that provide CC-licenced content which suggests that the movement has traction. Following an analysis of the CC-orientated intermediaries in comparison with those engendered by copyright, it may be argued that the CC licensing system makes it difficult to transition from an amateur to a professional context. Nonetheless, its symbolic value remains important. This piece will address the intermediary market structure for CC works as well as the potential difficulties commercial exploitation in order to evaluate whether or not it can be seen as a beneficial system for content creation and dissemination. As is CC inherently limited by the intermediary structure built upon ‘free’ use, this may hinder a transition to <b>revenue-generating</b> creative <b>activity...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose and designDuring this financially {{challenging}} times, public labs receive {{government funding}} to create technological core facilities (TCFs), which offsets {{the obligation to}} be open to any users. In the context of Gradual Budgetary Autonomy of Universities, academic TCFs are the object of multiple institutional demands (public service mission: training, world-class research, and <b>revenue-generating</b> commercial <b>activity)</b> that can be potentially contradictory. This article has two objectives: (1) to identify the different institutional demands at play for technological core facilities and the tensions that this could give rise to and (2) to identify the different ways in which these tensions are addressed, illustrating the institutional work of the manager. With a qualitative analysis, ten institutional demands are identified, some of them are potentially contradictory. Findings and practical implicationsThe ways in which demands are balanced help us underline three institutional works made by academic facilities directors; “conciliatory,” “academic research focused,” or prioritizing “research support. ” In the studied cases, there is a clear link between the TCFs' founding legal structure and this institutional work. By contrast, the TCF size, the capability of the manager, scientific domain, and current equipment do not differentiate response strategies with respect to institutional demands. In financially challenging times, universities need to define precisely the different missions of TCFs and their potential complementarities, and they also need to be consistent in the selection of their legal form. At the end, this strategic vision of the TCFs activities appears to be a central issue for the university to improve its research and transfer activities. Originality/valueThe multi-level approach – institutional, organizational, and agency – gives account of the clearly contradictory nature of the institutional demands. These contradictory demands make possible an institutional work, and three possible trajectories of the TCFs could be identified. For each of them, a specific legal structure of TCF is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in integrating high penetrations (> 20 %) of solar- and wind-energy {{rests in the}} grid's {{ability to cope with}} the intrinsic variability of these renewable resources. Although such high levels of penetration may be a decade or two away in most operating regions, we must find measures to manage the variability of these sources, especially when conventional market-based approaches are exhausted or ineffective. Furthermore, besides assuring reliability, effective integration of high levels of solar- and wind-power can reduce the `hidden' environmental costs and emissions associated with larger than necessary backup capacity. With large-scale PV plants (> 250 MW) becoming significant generators on the grid in the near future, system operators became concerned about the plants' inherent variability, and questions were raised regarding the predictability and reliability of the output from such PV plants. In {{the first part of this}} research, the variability in the power output of six PV plants in the United States and Canada, with a total installed capacity of 195 MW (AC), is characterized. A new metric called the Daily Aggregate Ramp (DAR) is introduced to quantify, categorize, and compare daily variability across multiple sites. With this metric, and by harmonizing for climatic differences across the plants, we quantified the effect of geographic dispersion in reducing the cloud-induced power fluctuations. In addition, the reduction in variability was assessed by simulating a step by step increase of the plant size at the same location, using individual inverter data. Our data analysis showed maximum ramp rates 0. 7, 0. 58, 0. 53, and 0. 43 times the plant's capacity for 5, 21, 48, and 80 MW (AC) plants, respectively. After the variability in plant outputs was understood and quantified, we investigated algorithms for operating Energy Storage Units (ESU) to perform ramp rate control at the plant level. This task is designed to support proposed plans of grid balancing authorities to deal with ramps of variable energy resources (i. e., solar and wind). ESUs can be used to mitigate penalty fees caused by sharp ramps and perhaps allow for additional revenue streams by participating in grid balancing markets (e. g. frequency regulation). Consequently, we focused on building and optimizing ESU dispatch models for controlling ramp rates of individual PV plants within predetermined levels. The model comprised dispatch strategies tailored to specific fast response ESU technologies (e. g., flywheels, capacitors, batteries). The optimization involved trial and error testing of different combinations of ESU technologies, power and energy capacities, dispatch strategies and violation reduction requirements. For four PV plants (5, 21, 30. 24 and 80 MW) in various North American locations, we found a required ESU power capacity of 2. 2, 9, 12 and 22 MW respectively, to mitigate 99 % of the violations of a 10 %/minute ramp rate limit. These ESU capacities may add capital costs of about $ 0. 35 - 0. 63 per Watt PV for the 80 MW plant and $ 0. 56 - 0. 94 per Watt PV for the 5 MW plant. Lowering the mitigation requirement to 90 % reduces the necessary ESU power capacity (and per Watt PV costs) to 1. 1 MW ($ 0. 27), 4. 4 MW ($ 0. 27), 6. 4 MW ($ 0. 27) and 10. 8 MW ($ 0. 18), respectively. Curtailment of power at the inverter during upward ramps reduces the number of violations even further and effectively decreases the necessary ESU capacity to approximately: 0. 8, 3. 1, 4. 5, and 7. 6 MW (for the 90 % violation mitigation). It is noted that the reported ESU capacity additions and associated costs are based on the assumption of no forecasting or only a one-minute ahead forecasting of cloud-induced solar variability. If forward time forecasting is available, the optimization we developed should result in lower ESU capacity requirements as gradual ramp rate controls could be implemented in advance. Another way to reduce the costs associated with ramp-rate controls is to use the ESU for other <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities,</b> such as frequency regulation for which markets exist in different operating regions (e. g. the Real-Time Market of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)). Since ramp rate violations in the various facilities we studied, occurred in less than 2 % of the time during the year, such additional uses of ESUs are possible...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides the}} first {{treatment of the}} origins {{and development of the}} roofed arena in the United States and Canada. Supported by archival resources of graphics and text, and informed by direct contact with arena architects, design and operations staff, this study examines the arena as a place for spectacle within the larger environments of city and campus. The arena 2 ̆ 7 s site, massing, and design revealed the expectations of its sponsorship. The arena 2 ̆ 7 s internal configuration of roofed seating bowl, floor, portals, and passages was a purposeful arrangement intended to accommodate attendees and manage their movement through architectural space. The first chapter focuses on the transmission to the nineteenth century, via the architecture of theater, circus, and other spaces of public assembly, of the Greek and Roman hippodrome oval for accommodation of multiple kinds of <b>revenue-generating</b> <b>activities</b> situated within a circular, elliptical, or rectilinear seating bowl. The significance of the Royal Albert Hall, London, as the conceptual model for the presentation of modern indoor spectacle is recognized. But {{within the context of the}} growth or urban centers and the expansion of commercial leisure, Stanford White 2 ̆ 7 s Madison Square Garden, New York, is documented as the principal formal model. White 2 ̆ 7 s facility, a hippodrome within a rectangular industrial shed, whose impact was amplified by the communications media that disseminated its image and the reports of its spectacle, generated successors on a continental scale. The research method identified buildings, sought to find relevant information, and fixed the buildings along a time line. Populated with enough examples, the time sequence yields affinities and clarifies differences, making possible useful generalizations about site and design in context. Across the time period considered, enclosure evolved from arched and pitched forms, and thin-shell experiments, toward the anti-industrial dome and drum. The emergence of tensile solutions allowed roof support to act as a design element as well as engineering. But by the end of the 1960 s, circular and ovoid buildings receded in favor of the operationally more efficient rectilinear footprint covered by a flat truss or space frame. Exteriors of brick and stone became complex fields of concrete, glass, and multiple forms of metal. Over the long term, internal treatment of attendee space emphasized presentation of finished surface. This dissertation identifies those formal architectural attributes that carried the arena 2 ̆ 7 s programmatic objectives. It examines the emergence of the commercial, mercantile arena; higher education 2 ̆ 7 s recognition of the capacity of the architectural fabric of arenas to support institutional growth; and municipalities 2 ̆ 7 use of the form to project government-defined civic values. The chronological narrative recognizes the intensity of concurrent strands of development between the World Wars and concludes by noting arena managements 2 ̆ 7 increasing interest in building commercial destinations for attendees outside the seating bowl. Finally, the work establishes the role of the arena in large-scale repurposing of urban land in the 1960 s. The Appendix is an extensive census of the large roofed arenas built in North America between 1853 and 1968. It provides the name of the facility, dates of design and opening, architect, type of siting, and configuration of building envelope. The Appendix introduces distinctions useful for analysis. Component siting, in contrast to independent siting, indicates placement of the arena within a system of buildings of associated purpose. Centroidal positioning indicates a building 2 ̆ 7 s occupation at the functional center of mass. Building envelope [...] with pitched or arched roof or other kind of enclosure [...] operates with siting as another indicator of sponsors 2 ̆ 7 Intent. By assembling and reading the evidence of site, design, and operation, this paper ventures an approach to understanding the place of the roofed arena in the North American urban landscape. It is hoped that this work will invite and assist investigation into related issues, e. g., the architectural profession 2 ̆ 7 s approach to arena projects and, particularly, the commercial archaeology and human geography of the arena 2 ̆ 7 s interior zones...|$|R
40|$|Many organisations are {{becoming}} increasingly aware that the usefulness of their data is limited by its poor quality. Surprising (and sometimes alarming) proportions of data in databases are inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent or out of date. One-off data cleaning methods can help {{the situation in the}} short term, but they are costly and do little to improve data quality in the long term. However, in order to plan and monitor the progress of long term data quality improvement programmes, it is necessary to be able to assess the quality of data across an organisation. Since resources for such programmes are generally limited, and since much of the data in question resides in mission critical systems, it is vital that these assessment activities do not intrude on normal day-to-day business processing. In this paper, we present an approach to assess organisational data quality on a regular basis, which does not delay or disrupt <b>revenue-generating</b> data processing <b>activities.</b> We have adapted techniques from distributed query processing and distributed integrity checking to produce a system that takes account of the workload at each local site when distributing the defect checking work in the distributed information system. The approach assesses the data quality during the periods of low system activity, and ships data defects found to a global site, which time stamps them and records them for later analysis. ...|$|R
