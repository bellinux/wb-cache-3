40|$|In {{the years}} that preceded the Great Recession of 2008 - 09, many {{financial}} institutions {{in the developed world}} engaged in practices that increased the risk of systemic failure in the markets. The economics profession itself, overly confident of its ability to engineer stability, encouraged financial actors to exceed the traditional dictates of caution. The financial crisis that ensued also revealed many fault lines. One of the most glaring was an absence of international coordination, which encouraged <b>regulatory</b> <b>shopping.</b> Dramatic actions taken by public authorities in the fall of 2008 avoided collapse, but left a legacy of increased moral hazard, to which the best long-term answer is radical structural reform. Asian emerging markets were, by and large, spared the worst of the storm. They should learn from the mistakes of their peers in the developed world, but not reject wholesale the benefits of free markets.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} {{to analyze the}} closing gap between regulation and enforcement of environmental protection in China and present a number of resulting implications for doing business there. We identify three major dimensions that characterize change in regulatory systems generally: priorities and incentives, bureaucratic alignment, and transparency and monitoring. Using these dimensions, we first unpack the mechanisms that characterized China's prior period, during which enforcement of environmental protection was decoupled from regulation. These mechanisms include (a) the intense emphasis on economic growth leading to misaligned incentives and regulatory competition across regions, (b) fragmented bureaucratic organization, and (c) lack of transparency and monitoring, all of which undermined enforcement. Then we show how, {{in each of these}} dimensions, regulation and enforcement are becoming realigned or recoupled over time. We show how this results from (a) a change in national development strategy to focus more on sustainable development and a harmonious society, (b) reorganization of the bureaucracy, and (c) an increase in monitoring by both the government and the general public. Correspondingly, we advance managerial implications that stem from these recent changes, illustrated by recent MNC and Chinese domestic firm successes. To address changes in policies and incentives, firms should align with governmental signals and embrace environmental innovation. Regarding bureaucratic alignment, firms should avoid <b>regulatory</b> <b>shopping</b> and integrate local and global standards. Finally, to address transparency and monitoring issues, firms should be transparent and compete on reputation. We conclude with a more general discussion of the contributions of our framework to understanding managerial practice in emerging-market regulatory contexts...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} {{points out}} that retail trade regulations may {{have a significant impact}} on prices, employment and productivity. In the case of Spain, the retail trade sector is subject to a rich set of regional regulations. This paper provides a database and a set of indicators on the main restrictions to retail trade in place in Spain’s Autonomous Regions (Comunidades Autónomas) between 1997 and 2007. Those restrictions bear on the following <b>regulatory</b> aspects: <b>shopping</b> hours, blue laws, seasonal discounts, definitions of "big" stores, licensing of discount stores, moratoria in retail trade licence issuing and taxes on big stores. The paper presents then an aggregate indicator constructed on the basis of these restrictions using factor analysis. Finally, this research estimates the effect of the commercial restrictiveness (using the aggregate indicator) among the regions on the commercial density, the number of employees of the sector and the rate of inflation. For that, panel data techniques are applied to the analysis. On the one hand, the results of this research point to an increase in the level of regulation throughout the period. On the other hand the estimates show that an increase in the level of restrictiveness increases commercial density and inflation among the regions but diminishes the number of persons employed in the sector. In either case, the results of this research must be taken with care due to the limitations of the regulation indicator studied and the limited availability of data for the period under study. Regulation in services markets, barriers to entry, retailing, blue laws...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{demonstrates}} how {{the composition of}} VM based on <b>regulatory</b> focus influences <b>shopping</b> value and how shopping value influences shopping satisfaction. A survey form was developed and 90 copies were used for analysis. SPSS 19. 0 for Windows Package was used to perform frequency analysis, factor analysis, and regression analysis. The {{results of the study}} were: First, convenience of VM had a significantly positive (+) influence on utilitarian shopping value. Second, both utilitarian shopping value and hedonic shopping value had a statistically significant influence on shopping sat-isfaction. Third, in terms of promotion focus, suitability, fashionableness, reconcilability, and attractiveness of VM had a significantly positive (+) influence on the hedonic shopping value. In terms of preventive focus, convenience and rec-oncilability of VM had a significantly positive (+) influence on utilitarian shopping value, and convenience, suitability, and fashionableness had a significantly positive (+) influence on hedonic shopping value. In the promotion focus, both util-itarian shopping value and the hedonic shopping value had a significantly positive (+) influence on shopping satisfaction. In the preventive focus only the utilitarian shopping value had a significantly positive (+) influence on shopping sat-isfaction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Specialized drug shops such as {{pharmacies}} {{and drug}} shops are increasingly becoming important sources of treatment. However, knowledge on their regulatory performance is scarce. We {{set out to}} systematically review literature on the characteristics, knowledge and practices of specialized drug shops in Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, WEB of Science, CAB Abstracts, PsycINFO and websites for organizations that support medicine policies and usage. We also conducted open searches using Google Scholar, and searched manually through references of retrieved articles. Our search included studies of all designs that described characteristics, knowledge and practices of specialized drug shops. Information was abstracted on authors, publication year, country and location, study design, sample size, outcomes investigated, and primary findings using a uniform checklist. Finally, we conducted a structured narrative synthesis of the main findings. Results We obtained 61 studies, mostly from Eastern Africa, majority of which were conducted between 2006 and 2011. Outcome measures were heterogeneous and included knowledge, characteristics, and dispensing and <b>regulatory</b> practices. <b>Shop</b> location and client demand were found to strongly influence dispensing practices. Whereas shops located in urban and affluent areas {{were more likely to}} provide correct treatments, those in rural areas provided credit facilities more readily. However, the latter also charged higher prices for medicines. A vast majority of shops simply sold whatever medicines clients requested, with little history taking and counseling. Most shops also stocked popular medicines at the expense of policy recommended treatments. Treatment policies were poorly communicated overall, which partly explained why staff had poor knowledge on key aspects of treatment such as medicine dosage and side effects. Overall, very little is known on the link between regulatory enforcement and practices of specialized drug shops. Conclusions Evidence suggests that characteristics and practices of specialized drug shops differ across rural and urban locations, and that these providers are highly responsive to client demand. However, there is a dearth in knowledge on how regulatory enforcement influences their characteristics and practices, and what strategies can be employed to strengthen the governance of the retail pharmaceutical sector. </p...|$|R
40|$|This Master's thesis' {{purpose is}} to analyse the {{challenges}} that the offshore finance/economy causes to the modern state sovereignty. The offshore finance consists of tax havens, flags of convenience registers, export processing zones, offshore financial centres and international banking facilities, and has grown {{to such an extent}} that if we want to understand the international political economy the offshore simply cannot be left unnoticed. I approach the concept of sovereignty by adopting Giorgio Agamben's idea of the close link between sovereignty and the ability to issue a state of exception. Agamben argues that sovereignty is defined by the ability to issue a state of exception and that in contemporary world the exception takes increasingly often the form of a camp. Albeit Agamben's theory focuses mostly on his idea of biopolitics, I find it imperative to extend its reach. Ronen Palan has shown how offshore jurisdictions commercialise their sovereignty by turning the right to draft legislation into a tradable asset. I will analyse the phenomenon of commercialised sovereignty by using Agamben's theory. The question is who has the de facto power to issue and control the commercialised states of exception within the offshore world? Can we see some kind of shift of sovereignty from states to non-traditional actors of politics? My methodological approach to this question comes from international relations’ constructivism. In line with Nicolas Onuf's constructivist method that operates around the concepts of structures and agents, I start by setting focus on how different types of offshore jurisdictions (structures) establish and use the states of exception. I will then analyse role of the agents that benefit from the special legislation, with particular focus transborder corporations. Onuf argues that the relationship between agents and structures is not mechanical or rigid relation. I agree with him on this. I will take Onuf's point into account by presenting the connections that the politics of offshore has with larger trends of contemporary economical and financial globalisation Susan Strange's theory of the competition state will be extremely helpful in this research process. After focusing on some empirical case studies I conclude that control of the state of exception within the offshore has, at least in some cases, partially shifted to transborder corporations. Therefore, there are some grounds for analysing transborder corporations as participants in politics and bearers of sovereignty. I argue that these kinds of corporations should be called transnational, while their competitors that do not have significant offshore businesses are essentially multinational. Too often these terms are used interexchangeably and without proper definitions. I end my dissertation by suggesting that our fixation on modern state sovereignty is badly outdated in face of the tremendous rise of the offshore world. In the final chapter I introduce one solution for overcoming the difficulties in combining national regulation with increasingly transnational corporations: the new accounting standards proposed by accountant Richard Murphy. The proposed standards would tax transborder corporations as global entities, thus making the <b>regulatory</b> or tax <b>shopping</b> in offshore by and large useless...|$|R
