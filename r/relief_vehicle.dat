40|$|This paper {{presents}} a flexible emergency rescue system which is chiefly composed of three parts, namely, disaster assistance center, <b>relief</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and disaster areas. A novel objective of utility maximization {{is used to}} evaluate the entire system in disasters. Considering the uncertain road conditions in the relief distribution, we implement triangular fuzzy number to calculate the vehicle velocity. As a consequence, a fuzzy mathematical model is built to maximize the utility of emergency rescue system and then converted to the crisp counterpart. Finally, the results of numerical experiments obtained by particle swarm optimization (PSO) prove the validity of this proposed mathematical model...|$|R

Additionally, people claiming to help others [...] took selfies on social media, sparking a disaster tourism frenzy of [...] "I was there helping", whereby actual <b>relief</b> <b>vehicles</b> were delayed by the excessively clogged traffic.

40|$|During {{initial stage}} of {{disaster}} relief, real time requirement and limited relief source quantity {{are the main}} features of relief work. To improve the efficiency and precision of emergency goods scheduling, a model is established for the multi-depot and multi disaster places, single category material requirement emergency scheduling problem.

The model is under {{the constraints of the}} <b>relief</b> <b>vehicle</b> number and the specified time by disaster places. Genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the routes, to determine the number of participated vehicles and routes of varied emergency relief centers, thus the minimum emergency time and vehicles can be obtained.

40|$|Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) {{considers}} how {{to provide}} communication in contexts where {{it is unreasonable to}} assume end-to-end connectivity. Network devices exchange buffered messages when they come into communication range; messages may be buffered and carried physically several times before ultimately being received. Service characteristics of a DTN depend intimately on the underlying movement of devices through physical space; correspondingly, an assessment of DTN technology (e. g. routing protocols, message exchange policies, etc.) depends on that same movement. Existing mobility models provided in simulators lack characteristics one expects in post-disaster communication. We propose a mobility model that includes the impact of the disaster on the transportation network, and that models population and <b>relief</b> <b>vehicle</b> movement. We augment the “Opportunistic Network Environment ” (ONE) simulator of DTNs with required extensions and show that characteristics of the DTN are very different using the new model than it is under models that ONE currently provides. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{critical}} issues in areas which have recently faced natural disasters is transportation of both injured people to medical centers and relief commodities to their desired destinations. In such situation, due to disruptions, some routes may lose all or part of their capacities {{and not be able to}} accept as much vehicles as before. Consequently, the <b>relief</b> <b>vehicles</b> face difficulties to follow their itinerary. Such critical circumstance calls for finding reliable solutions. This study develops a new bi-objective, multi-mode and multi-commodity model, in which the reliability is taken into account to help managers in making more reliable decisions. To solve this model, the TH method is used in order to find the equivalent single objective model and this new model is exactly solved by coding in GAMS software...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} guide <b>relief</b> <b>vehicles</b> to safety and quickly pass through environments {{affected}} by fires {{is critical in}} fighting forest fires. In this paper, we focus on route determination {{in the case of}} forest fires, and propose a data model that supports finding paths among moving obstacles. This data model captures both static information, such as the type of the response team, the topology of the road network, and dynamic information, such as sensor information, changing availabilities of roads during disasters, and the position of the vehicle. We use a fire simulation model to calculate the fire evolution. The spread of the fire is represented as movements of obstacles that block the responders? path in the road network. To calculate safe and optimal routes avoiding obstacles, the A? algorithm is extended to consider the predicted availabilities of roads. We prove the optimality of the path calculated by our algorithm and then evaluate it in simulated scenarios. The results show that our model and algorithm are effective in planning routes that avoid one or more fire-affected areas and that the outlook for further investigation is promising.

Similar routing and allocation decisions are studied for commercial settings where efficiency, {{in terms of}} minimizing cost, is the primary objective.

We explore how efficiency, efficacy, and equity influence the structure of vehicle routes and the distribution of resources.

As late as August 2, floodwaters remained 1.5 to 2 ft deep along Military Trail near West Palm Beach. Flooding in some areas was the worst since a hurricane in October 1924. Winds disrupted communications with small settlements, and Stuart was unreachable for many hours.

Winds at Okeechobee reached 40 to 50 mi/h km/h as the center moved south of that town early on July 31. Heavy rains extended over the area, with 24-hour amounts of 12.02 in in Indiantown and 15.6 in at a water transport lock. Additional heavy rains fell over the west coast of Florida, but to a lesser extent than on the east; as was the case elsewhere, notable wind damage was almost non-existent. Little immediate damage from wind and rain resulted in the Everglades and near Lake Okeechobee. Winds peaked at 30 mi/h km/h in Pahokee, along the lake's eastern shore, and the lake level rose 18 in on July 30-31, which was not enough to induce flooding, although the Kissimmee River, which fed into Lake Okeechobee, rose steadily, owing to heavy rains. The Weather Bureau office in Tampa recorded peak winds of 39 mi/h km/h. In St. Petersburg, citizens enjoyed a refreshing northeast breeze that removed dead fronds from palms, uprooted scattered plants, and sent waves splashing over seawalls. An anemometer operated by United States Airways at Grand Central Airport, a now-defunct airport on Weedon Island, clocked 40 mi/h km/h winds.|$|R
