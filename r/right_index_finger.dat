5|$|On December 18, 2010, Pressey tallied 11 assists while adding 15 {{points against}} the Central Arkansas Bears. This tied a Missouri Tigers {{freshman}} single-game assist record (Shawn Teague, 1980 vs. Lamar). Then, {{he broke his}} <b>right</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> prior to the December 22, 2010 Braggin' Rights game against Illinois. Pressey missed four games and {{did not return to}} the lineup until the January 8 Big 12 Conference opener against Colorado, where he appeared in the second half. Another highlight for Pressey came when he posted 6 steals for the Tigers against the Texas A Aggies in the 2011 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament on March 10, 2011. This established a new Missouri Tigers postseason single-game record. Freshman single-game records do not appear in the media guide. He started 12 games for the 2010–11 Tigers and set numerous Missouri freshman season records, including average steals (2.0), average assists (3.9) and total assists (117).|$|E
5|$|On October 12, Burke {{broke his}} <b>right</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> below the middle knuckle. He {{had been a}} {{favorite}} for NBA Rookie of the Year, but was listed as out indefinitely. On October 14, an October 15 surgery to insert surgical pins was announced. The 2013–14 Jazz were scheduled to begin the 2013–14 NBA season on October 30. Although early reports suggested an 8‑to12-week hiatus, ESPN The Magazine Chris Broussard reported only a 6-week absence was expected. On November 11, Burke's finger was reevaluated. Without Burke, the Jazz began the season 0–8 with Lucas and Jamaal Tinsley playing point guard. On November 12, the Jazz announced that Burke had only been cleared to begin individual drills, {{that he would be}} reevaluated November 25 and that Tinsley had been waived. Jazz head coach Tyrone Corbin reported that by November 13 Burke was dribbling a basketball painfree. On November 20, Burke announced he would make his career debut against the New Orleans Pelicans for the 1–11 Jazz, but he was not expected to start.|$|E

25|$|The Buddha of Enlightenment is {{enshrined}} in the Birojeon. It is 1.77meters in height and made from gilt-bronze. The head of the Buddha has an usnisa, a symbol of supreme wisdom. The head of the Buddha was made by fusing two shells {{to each other and}} the face is elongated and soft. The robes of the Buddha are highly detailed and the simulation of folded cloth rippling down from the shoulder to the lap is done with high skill. The hands of the Buddha are in a position, the <b>right</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> covered by the left hand, which often is used to symbolize the Buddha of Enlightenment. The figure is estimated to be from the 9th century due to stylistic evidence, including the overly wide lap and the lack of tension in the depiction of the robes and face of the Buddha.|$|E

25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his <b>right</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next.

25|$|During the 2009–10 season, Bryant made six game-winning shots {{including}} a buzzer-beating, one-legged 3-pointer against the Miami Heat on December 4, 2009. Bryant considered the shot {{one of the}} luckiest he has made. A week later, Bryant suffered an avulsion fracture in his <b>right</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> {{in a game against}} the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite the injury, Bryant elected to continue playing with it, rather than take any time off to rest the injury. Five days after his finger injury, he made another game winning shot, after missing on an opportunity in regulation, this time against the Milwaukee Bucks in an overtime game. Bryant also became the youngest player (31 years, 151 days) to reach 25,000 points during the season, surpassing Chamberlain. He continued his dominant clutch plays making yet another game-winning three-pointer against the Sacramento Kings, and what would be the game-winning field goal against the Boston Celtics. The following day, he surpassed West to become the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. After being sidelined for five games from an ankle injury, Bryant made his return and made another clutch three-pointer to give the Lakers a one-point lead with four seconds remaining against the Memphis Grizzlies. Two weeks later, he made his sixth game-winning shot of the season against the Toronto Raptors.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the first}} 14 {{games of the}} season, the Lakers ranked second {{in the league in}} {{defensive}} field-goal shooting (41.7%).

After Gasol's return, the Lakers went 10–0, which included a game on December 4 when Bryant made a three-pointer as time expired to lift the Lakers past the Miami Heat 108–107. Their 11-game winning streak ended on December 12 against the Utah Jazz. On December 11, Bryant suffered a fracture in his <b>right</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, but it didn't force him to miss any games. On December 16, Bryant made another game-winning shot, this time against the Milwaukee Bucks in overtime. The Lakers went on a five-game winning streak heading into their Christmas Day game at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers. They lost the game for their third home defeat of the season. Later that night, Ron Artest suffered a concussion from tripping over a box and falling down a flight of stairs. He missed five games to recover. The Lakers struggled with his absence, giving up 100 or more points in four consecutive games. On January 1, Bryant made a three-pointer at the buzzer to beat the Sacramento Kings. It was the third time that season that Bryant made a buzzer-beater to win a game. On January 3, Gasol mildly strained his left hamstring in the first quarter against the Dallas Mavericks and had to leave the game. Artest returned to play the next game versus the Houston Rockets, and Odom almost recorded a triple double with 17 points, 19 rebounds, and 9 assists. After Christmas, the Lakers struggled, going 6–5. Since then, both Walton (28 games) and Gasol (six games) returned from injuries and the Lakers played with a full roster {{for the first time that}} season against the Clippers on January 15.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether skin blood flow is local or takes part in general regulatory mechanisms, we recorded laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF; left and <b>right</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers),</b> blood pressure, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), R-R interval, and respiration in 10 healthy volunteers and 3 subjects after sympathectomy. We evaluated 1) the synchronism of LDF fluctuations in two <b>index</b> <b>fingers,</b> 2) {{the relationship with}} autonomically mediated fluctuations in other signals, and 3) the LDF {{ability to respond to}} arterial baroreflex stimulation (by neck suction at frequencies from 0. 02 to 0. 20 Hz), using spectral analysis (autoregressive uni- and bivariate, time-variant algorithms). Synchronous LDF fluctuations were observed in the <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> of healthy subjects but not in sympathectomized patients. LDF fluctuations were coherent with those obtained for blood pressure, MSNA, and R-R interval. LDF fluctuations were leading blood pressure in the low-frequency (LF; 0. 1 Hz) band and lagging in the respiratory, high-frequency (HF; approximately 0. 25 Hz) band, suggesting passive "downstream" transmission only for HF and "upstream" transmission for LF from the microvessels. LDF fluctuations were responsive to sinusoidal neck suction up to 0. 1 Hz, indicating response to sympathetic modulation. Skin blood flow thus reflects modifications determined by autonomic activity, detectable by frequency analysis of spontaneous fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|Background: There are {{controversial}} evidences on {{the association}} between fingerprint traits and schizophrenia. We compared fingerprint traits of patients with schizophrenia and normal individuals in Iranian population.

The distance between the hands was varied orthogonally with crossing of the hands. We found that TOJs were affected by both the posture of the hands and the spatial separation between the hands. Performance with hands uncrossed was significantly better than with hands crossed. As the hands {{moved closer to the}} midline, larger stimulus onset asynchronies were needed for correct report of the temporal order of the stimuli. The distance effect was obtained in both hands crossed and uncrossed positions but was more pronounced when the hands were crossed.

After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine-gunning him, he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau, with the help of two New Guinea natives. When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23April, a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his <b>right</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> Having survived his trek through the jungle, he dismissed the wound as [...] "a mere scratch". On 27April, Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No.75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros. Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat. The senior officers' comments had evidently stung him, however, as he declared to his pilots: [...] "Tomorrow I'm going to show you how". According to journalist Osmar White, who saw him {{on the night of the}} 27th, Jackson's [...] "hands and eyes were still and rock steady" [...] but he appeared [...] "weary in soul" [...] and [...] "too long in the shadows". White concluded: [...] "He had done more than conquer fear—he had killed it". The next day, Jackson led No.75 Squadron's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort. He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed. His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet; Jackson was identified only by his size-ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore.

In the first two experiments we compared hand versus foot responses and found equivalent advantages for the hands-far posture. In the final experiment the stimuli were presented to either the same or different digit on each hand (<b>index</b> <b>finger</b> or thumb) and we found that only when the same digit on each hand was stimulated was there an advantage for the hands-far posture. The finding that temporal precision was better with greater distance contradicts predictions based on attention-switching models of temporal-order judgments, and also contrasts with results from similar experimental manipulations in other modalities (eg vision). These results provide support for a rapid and automatic process that transforms the representation of a tactile stimulus from a skin-centred reference frame to a more external (eg body-centred or allocentric) one...|$|R
