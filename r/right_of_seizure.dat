60|$|Proposals {{of a more}} {{original}} kind {{than those}} of Sir Henry Parkes {{have been made by}} the Earl of Dunraven, though they are hardly more successful in standing cross-examination. Lord Dunraven has seen, {{a great deal of the}} world, and has both courage and freshness of mind. He scolds Liberals for attaching too little importance to colonies, and not perceiving that our national existence is bound up with our existence as an empire. We are dependent in an increasing degree on foreign countries for our supply of food, and therefore we might starve in time of war unless we had an efficient fleet; but fleets, to be efficient, must be able to keep the sea for any length of time, and they can only do this by means of the accommodation afforded by our various dependencies and colonies dotted over the surface of the globe. This is a very good argument so far as it goes, but of course it would be met, say in South Africa, by keeping Table Mount and Simon's Bay, and letting the rest go. It might, too, as we all know, be met in another way, namely, by the enforcement at sea of the principles of warfare on land, and the abandonment of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> of the property of private individuals on the ocean.|$|E

40|$|Partial {{seizures}} produce increased cerebral {{blood flow}} {{in the region of}} seizure onset. These regional {{cerebral blood flow}} increases can be detected by single photon emission computed tomography (ictal SPECT), providing a useful clinical tool for seizure localization. However, when partial seizures secondarily generalize, there are often questions of interpretation since propagation of seizures could produce ambiguous results. Ictal SPECT from secondarily generalized seizures has not been thoroughly investigated. We analysed ictal SPECT from 59 secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizures obtained during epilepsy surgery evaluation in 53 patients. Ictal versus baseline interictal SPECT difference analysis was performed using ISAS ([URL] SPECT injection times were classified based on video/EEG review as either pre-generalization, during generalization or in the immediate post-ictal period. We found that in the pre-generalization and generalization phases, ictal SPECT showed significantly more regions of cerebral blood flow increases than in partial seizures without secondary generalization. This made identification of a single unambiguous region of seizure onset impossible 50 % of the time with ictal SPECT in secondarily generalized seizures. However, cerebral blood flow increases on ictal SPECT correctly identified the hemisphere (left versus <b>right)</b> <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> onset in 84 % of cases. In addition, when a single unambiguous region of cerebral blood flow increase was seen on ictal SPECT, this was the correct localization 80 % of the time. In agreement with findings from partial seizures without secondary generalization, cerebral blood flow increases in the post-ictal period and cerebral blood flow decreases during or following seizures were not useful for localizing seizure onset. Interestingly, however, cerebral blood flow hypoperfusion during the generalization phase (but not pre-generalization) was greater on the side opposite to seizure onset in 90 % of patients. These findings suggest that, with appropriate cautious interpretation, ictal SPECT in secondarily generalized seizures can help localize the region of seizure onset...|$|E

The pediatric neurologist made the final diagnosis. The gestational age, neonate admission age, type of delivery, and laboratory and radiological investigations were reviewed from the medical records. The relation <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> etiology and other variables were compared using the Chi-square test. All the statistical analyses were performed sing SPSS (ver 11. 5). esults total of 100 neonates were hospitalized with a diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>seizures.</b> The overall incidence rate <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> was 2. 6 per 1, 000 live births. A total <b>of</b> 59 <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> happened in the first three days of life. The etiologies <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> were hypoxicischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (36), hyponatremia (12), hypoglycemia (11), intracranial hemorrhage (11), infections (10), hypocalcemia (8), metabolic disorders (7), the structural anomalies (5), and hypomagnesaemia (4). In 23 of neonates, no specific etiology was found and 23 had multiple etiologies. In 45 of neonates, the EEG was not recorded. The type <b>of</b> the <b>seizures</b> were focal-clonic (26), tonic (25), multifocal clonic (34), subtle (11), and myoclonic (4).

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{develop and}} test a {{prognostic}} index for the recurrence <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> after a minimum remission <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> {{two years in}} people {{with a history of}} epilepsy. DESIGN [...] Information from a large prospective randomised study of withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs was used to identify clinical and treatment factors of prognostic importance in determining the recurrence <b>of</b> <b>seizures.</b> A split sample approach was used to test the internal validity of predictions {{made on the basis of}} identified prognostic factors. SETTING [...] Centres in six European countries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Comparison of predicted and observed rates <b>of</b> recurrence <b>of</b> <b>seizure.</b> SUBJECTS [...] 1013 patients randomised to the Medical Research Council study for antiepileptic drug withdrawal. RESULTS [...] The Cox proportional hazards model identified several factors that increased the risk <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> recurring. These included being 16 years or older; taking more than one antiepileptic drug; experiencing seizures after starting antiepileptic drug treatment; a history of primary or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures; a history of myoclonic seizures; and having an abnormal electroencephalogram. The risks <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> recurring decreased with increasing time without seizures. The model allowed estimation of the risk <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> recurring in the next one and two years under the policies of continued antiepileptic drug treatment and slow withdrawal of drugs.

Female gender, age at onset <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> more than 2 years, and the duration of withdrawal {{were found to be}} significant risk factors in relapse rate following univariate analysis. However, gender was not found to be significant in multivariate analysis. All other factors, including the duration <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> prior to starting antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment, the number <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> before the start of AED treatment, the period between AED induction and control <b>of</b> <b>seizures,</b> diagnostic yield from electroencephalogy (EEG) at diagnosis, the number <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> after the onset of AED therapy, length of seizure-free period, aetiology <b>of</b> the <b>seizures,</b> a history <b>of</b> epilepsy in the immediate family, or previously experienced febrile convulsions were not significant factors in relapse rate. Significant risk factors for relapse rate also significantly affected relapse time.

In this study, we examine the causes <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> in poisoned patients in Iran, and their outcomes. Methods: This retrospective and analytical-descriptive study investigated the sex, age, type of poison, presence and type <b>of</b> <b>seizure,</b> seizure treatment and outcome from the records of 2, 220 hospitalized poison victims from 2001 to 2003 in poison emergency departments in Noor Hospital. Data was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and chi square tests using SPSS. Results: Of the 2, 220 patient records examined, 66 patients developed seizure. Seizure was more common in men (33 patients), and most common in the 15 - 40 year age group (28 patients). The most common causes <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> were tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) (39. 7 %), organophosphates (17. 5 %), carbamazepine (7. 9 %) and organochlorines (6. 3 %). However, status epilepticus was more common in organochlorine (25 %), organophosphate, TCA (18. 75 %), and carbamazepine (12. 5 %) poisoning. There was a negative relationship between age and type <b>of</b> <b>seizures.</b> Seizure was not related to previous history <b>of</b> <b>seizure.</b> Midazolam alone (25 %) was the most effective drug for controlling seizures. Death occurred in six patients with or without renal complication. The mortality rate among poisoned patients with seizure was 37. 5 %.

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a <b>seizure</b> incidence <b>of</b> 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a <b>seizure</b> incidence <b>of</b> 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day.

For the effective application of this method as a successful treatment, improving the accuracy <b>of</b> the early <b>seizure</b> detection is crucial. In this paper, we proposed {{the application of a}} frequency-based algorithm derived from principal component analysis (PCA), and demonstrated improved efficacy for early seizure detection in a pilocarpine-induced epilepsy rat model. A total of 100 ictal electroencephalographs (EEG) during spontaneous recurrent seizures from 11 epileptic rats were finally included for the analysis. PCA was applied to the covariance matrix of a conventional EEG frequency band signal. Two PCA results were compared: one from the initial segment <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> (5 sec <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> onset) and the other from the whole segment <b>of</b> <b>seizures.</b> In order to compare the accuracy, we obtained the specific threshold satisfying the target performance from the training set, and compared the False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), and Latency (Lat) of the PCA based feature derived from the initial segment <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> to the other six features in the testing set. The PCA based feature derived from the initial segment <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> performed significantly better than other features with a 1. 40 % FP, zero FN, and 0. 14 s Lat. These results demonstrated that the proposed frequency-based feature from PCA that captures the characteristics of the initial phase <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> was effective for early detection <b>of</b> <b>seizures.</b> Experiments with rat ictal EEGs showed an improved early seizure detection rate with PCA applied to the covariance of the initial 5 s segment <b>of</b> visual <b>seizure</b> onset instead <b>of</b> using the whole seizure segment or other conventional frequency bands...|$|R
30|$|This {{study also}} {{evaluated}} the adverse events associated with cell therapy. Out of 7 patients with an abnormal EEG {{and a history}} <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> pre-intervention, only 1 patient had an episode <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> within 3 months after intervention. The episode <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> {{could be due to}} activation of epileptogenic foci or abnormal innervation during neurogenesis. Seizures, as adverse events, have been recorded earlier in studies of stroke and autism (Sharma et al. 2013 c; Lee et al. 2010), Hence its possibility in TBI cannot be eliminated. Future detailed study will include an in-depth analysis.|$|R
5000|$|In {{preclinical}} trials, {{the effect}} of lacosamide administration on animal models of epilepsy was tested using the Frings audiogenic seizures (AGS)-susceptible mouse model <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> activity with an effective dose (ED50) of 0.63 mg/kg, i.p. [...] The effect of lacosamide was also assessed using the MES test to detect inhibition <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> spread. [...] Lacosamide administration was successful in preventing the spread <b>of</b> <b>seizures</b> induced by MES in mice (ED50 = 4.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and rats (ED50 = 3.9 mg/kg, p.o.). [...] In preclinical trials, administration of lacosamide {{in combination with other}} AEDs resulted in synergistic anticonvulsant effects. Lacosamide produced effects in animal models of essential tremor, tardive dyskinesia, schizophrenia, and anxiety. [...] Preclinical trials found the S-stereoisomer to be less potent than the R-stereoisomer in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>seizures.</b>|$|R
