40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyze the {{implementation}} process of Basel II so to understand whether {{and to what extent}} national discrepancies might cause problems of competitive neutrality and thus invalidate the significant level of harmonization in capital adequacy regulation which was successfully achieved by Basel I. To achieve this result, this work looks at three different issues. The first paper looks at the negotiation process of an international soft law agreement and tries to understand whether it is able to explain its implementation results in terms of the actual degree of compliance across different countries. A game theory coordination model is suggested as a theoretical answer to this question, while the two Basel Accord cases are used to test the model empirically. The appreciation of the circumstances that led to the two Accords is proved as indicative of the reasons behind the widespread adoption of the Basel I Accord as opposed to the piecemeal implementation of Basel II. The {{aim of the}} second paper is then focus on the actual implementation of Basel II and to analyze how its second Pillar is likely to impact the banking industry in Europe. It finds evidence of a piecemeal implementation of Pillar II rules across Member States (MSs) which, in turn, is able to cause an alteration of the level playing field among banks depending on the country they are incorporated in,. It concludes that there is a clear case for further harmonization not only by reducing the extent of national discretions at the regulatory level, but more importantly in building up further arrangements for supervisory convergence and coordination. With the third paper the attention is finally drawn to possible problems of competitive neutrality arising from the fact that under Basel II "standardized" banks' level of capital is indirectly determined by rating agencies. Being their predictions often inconsistent one with the other, banks can in principle enact regulatory arbitrage strategies. And despite minimum standards are required by means of a common recognition process, the consistency of national authorities' assessment is still not guaranteed and banks might thus be provided with undue <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>relief.</b> A more institutional answer is needed if Europe wants in real fact to ensure competitive neutrality across MSs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five chapters. In {{the first chapter}} I provide {{the introduction to the}} three essays examined in this thesis. In the second chapter I examine the impact of securitization on U. S. bank holding companies’ (hereafter BHCs) credit risk, credit risk taking, profitability, and capital level between 2001 and 2013. I also study the effect of the credit enhancements and liquidity provision on BHCs’ performance between 2001 and 2013. Since securitization is an endogenous decision, I use the treatment-effects model to control for the selection bias and observe a positive relationship between securitization and credit risk. I also find that securitization decreases BHCs’ profitability, but that securitization increases BHCs’ capital levels. Although it is possible that relatively risk-averse BHCs may consciously increase their capital buffer by retaining earnings, for example, I do not exclude the possibility that BHCs engaged in regulatory capital arbitrage to increase their capital level. Nevertheless, I find that use of securitization for capital regulatory purposes is mitigated by the risk-retention mechanism, i. e. credit enhancements and liquidity provision—banks had to keep the required capital for their extended guarantees. However, as was uncovered during the financial crisis, these credit and liquidity risk-reducing tools were not sufficient to prevent the recent turmoil in the securitization markets. The third chapter analyzes information opacity and systemic risk for the U. S. BHCs {{in the context of the}} asset-backed commercial paper (hereafter ABCP) between 2001 :Q 2 and 2012 :Q 4. Banks which set up costly ABCP conduits might have benefited from the <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>relief</b> and from providing financing alternatives to their clients. However, they faced costs in terms of the increase in information opacity through the provision of ABCP guarantees to BHCs’ own and third-party sponsored ABCP conduits. Furthermore, I observe that higher information asymmetry about BHCs’ value is associated with higher volatility of returns and also with higher systemic risk. In the fourth chapter I examine the proposal to limit bank size, which is known as tackling the banks’ incentive to become “too big to fail”, and also how this regulation to curb bank size may affect banks’ operating costs. I examine the relationship between the size of BHCs and BHCs’ operating costs from 2001 :Q 2 to 2014 :Q 1 to evaluate the costs that the newly suggested regulations on bank size might bring. I find that rules to limit the size of banks could significantly reduce economies of scale. In particular, if large and cost-efficient banks become split into smaller parts, data processing, legal fees, audit and consulting expenses, in addition to expenses on premises and automated teller machines (hereafter ATMs) are likely to increase. I also pay particular interest to legal fees and litigation settlement; I find evidence that larger banks, but not necessarily systemically more risky banks, face litigation charges more frequently. I do not find evidence that larger banks face a lower probability of being fined. This suggests that another phenomenon known as “too big to jail” may not be true, if the assumption is that the misconduct detection is perfect. I do, however, observe that penalties had little effect on BHCs’ profitability, and that some of the largest banks continuously face litigation charges. In turn, this could possibly imply that benefits from wrongdoing outweighed the costs. The fifth chapter summarizes major findings and concludes...|$|R
