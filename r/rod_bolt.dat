40|$|The {{theory of}} {{acoustic}} propagation in strained media is examined, with {{particular emphasis on}} <b>rod</b> (<b>bolt)</b> geometries. The continuous wave (CW) approach {{is the basis of}} the study, and the theory is developed from a frequency domain analysis standpoint in order to obtain an applied stress/normalized frequency shift relationship. CW measurements may be influenced by such factors as propagation effects, mode conversion, frequency, material properties, and geometry. After the first loading cycle, axial stress measurements for a preloading with an initial frequency of 4. 995 36 MHz dropped to 4. 989 19 MHz, indicating a 6. 17 kHz change. CW and pseudo-CW ultrasonic techniques are found to be reliable for axial stress measurements, and acoustic attenuation measurements correlated to residual stress fields may possibly involve transducer phase cancellation. It is thus concluded that signal drop is an artifact of the transducer directivity, rather than an actual acoustic power decrease...|$|E

50|$|The {{connecting}} rod is under tremendous stress from the reciprocating load {{represented by the}} piston, actually stretching and being compressed with every rotation, and the load increases as {{the square of the}} engine speed increase. Failure of a {{connecting rod}}, usually called throwing a rod, {{is one of the most}} common causes of catastrophic engine failure in cars, frequently putting the broken rod through the side of the crankcase and thereby rendering the engine irreparable; it can result from fatigue near a physical defect in the rod, lubrication failure in a bearing due to faulty maintenance, or from failure of the <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> from a defect, improper tightening or over-revving of the engine. In an unmaintained, dirty environment, a water or chemical emulsifies with the oil that lubricates the bearing and causes the bearing to fail. Re-use of <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> is a common practice as long as the bolts meet manufacturer specifications. Despite their frequent occurrence on televised competitive automobile events, such failures are quite rare on production cars during normal daily driving. This is because production auto parts have a much larger factor of safety, and often more systematic quality control.|$|R

40|$|Out-of-plane {{collapse}} of masonry walls in unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings {{has been identified}} as a major local failure mechanism affecting the global stability of a structure. Continuity between structural elements maintains proper load paths during seismic action, discouraging the formation of out-of-plane mechanisms. This is a key factor for an engineer to consider when trying to fully utilize the in-plane capacity of a masonry wall. This paper focuses on the seismic retrofit of wall-to-floor connections of URM buildings with wood diaphragm floors. The solution consists of a tie <b>rod</b> <b>bolted</b> to a timber floor joist and anchored to the masonry wall using an anchor plate. Several cyclic pull-out tests were carried out to characterize the behaviour of the strengthened connection so that an ‘engineered’ strengthening can be developed. The resultant behaviour has the contribution of different failures from yielding of the steel components to masonry cone breakout. The strengthen connection presents a higher increase in tensile capacity, displacements, and consequently energy dissipation...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{connecting rod}} beam (forging ID C9OE-A) featured drilled oil squirt bosses to lubricate the piston pin and cylinder bore and rectangular-head <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> mounted on broached shoulders. A number of fatigue failures {{were attributed to}} the machining of the part, so the bolt head area was spot-faced to retain metal in the critical area, requiring the use of 'football head' bolts. In 1975, the beam forging (D6OE-AA) was updated with more metal in the bolt-head area. The oil squirt bosses were drilled for use in export engines, where the quality of accessible lubricants was questionable. The rod cap forging remained the same on both units (part ID C9OE-A). In 1982, {{the design of the}} Essex V6 engine used {{a new version of the}} 351W connecting rod (E2AE-A), the difference between the two parts was that the V6 and V8 units were machined in metric and SAE units, respectively. The cap featured a longer boss for balancing than the original design.|$|R

40|$|Connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> {{have the}} effect of {{compressing}} the bearing cap when preload is applied, placing the journal into an out of form state when exacting levels of torque are not exercised. In this paper, this effect has been highlighted by means of practical measurements and then simulated with FEA models. A further study into ultrasonic velocity through torque to yield fasteners has highlighted as torque is increased, there is a coherent decrease in sound wave velocity. Testing also highlighted a change in Young’s modulus during the elastic region, throwing animosity to the conventional linearity of Hooke’s law. Based on current literature, a relationship linking increased hardness to a reduction in ultrasonic velocity resulted in further testing that indicated as fasteners yield, the material locally strain hardens, causing a decrease in sound velocity in the heavily yielded region. It is then regarded that high frequency ultrasonic testing can identify localised micro structural changes due to strain hardening, giving a variation in Young’s modulus during the elastic region when compared to the linearity of the conventional bulk tensile test that cannot identify such details...|$|R
5000|$|When {{building}} a high-performance engine, great {{attention is paid}} to the connecting rods, eliminating stress risers by such techniques as grinding the edges of the rod to a smooth radius, shot peening to induce compressive surface stresses (to prevent crack initiation), balancing all connecting rod/piston assemblies to the same weight and Magnafluxing to reveal otherwise invisible small cracks which would cause the rod to fail under stress. In addition, great care is taken to torque the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> to the exact value specified; often these bolts must be replaced rather than reused. The big end of the rod is fabricated as a unit and cut or cracked in two to establish precision fit around the big end bearing shell. Therefore, the big end [...] "caps" [...] are not interchangeable between connecting rods, and when re{{building a}}n engine, care must be taken to ensure that the caps of the different connecting rods are not mixed up. Both the connecting rod and its bearing cap are usually embossed with the corresponding position number in the engine block.|$|R
