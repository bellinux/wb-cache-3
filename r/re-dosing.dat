40|$|Abstract Background When {{patients}} are {{asked what they}} find most anxiety provoking about having surgery, the top concerns almost always include postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Only until recently have there been any published recommendations, mostly derived from expert opinion, as to which regimens to use once a patient develops PONV. The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the responses to a written survey to address the following questions: 1) If no prophylaxis is administered to an ambulatory patient, what agent do anesthesiologists use for treatment of PONV in the ambulatory Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) ?; 2) Do anesthesiologists use non-pharmacologic interventions for PONV treatment?; and 3) If a PONV prophylaxis agent is administered during the anesthetic, do anesthesiologists choose an antiemetic in a different class for treatment? Methods A questionnaire with five short hypothetical clinical vignettes was mailed to 300 randomly selected USA anesthesiologists. The types of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for PONV treatment were analyzed. Results The questionnaire was completed by 106 anesthesiologists (38 % response rate), who reported that on average 52 % of their practice was ambulatory. If a patient develops PONV and received no prophylaxis, 67 % (95 % CI, 62 % – 79 %) of anesthesiologists reported they would administer a 5 -HT 3 -antagonist as first choice for treatment, with metoclopramide and dexamethasone being the next two most common choices. 65 % (95 % CI, 55 % – 74 %) of anesthesiologists reported they would also use non-pharmacologic interventions to treat PONV in the PACU, with an IV fluid bolus or nasal cannula oxygen being the most common. When PONV prophylaxis was given during the anesthetic, the preferred PONV treatment choice changed. Whereas 3 %– 7 % of anesthesiologists would repeat dose metoclopramide, dexamethasone, or droperidol, 26 % (95 % confidence intervals, 18 % – 36 %) of practitioners would <b>re-dose</b> the 5 -HT 3 -antagonist for PONV treatment. Conclusion 5 -HT 3 -antagonists are the most common choice for treatment of established PONV for outpatients when no prophylaxis is used, and also following prophylactic regimens that include a 5 HT 3 antagonist, regardless of the number of prophylactic antiemetics given. Whereas 3 % – 7 % of anesthesiologists would repeat dose metoclopramide, dexamethasone, or droperidol, 26 % of practitioners would <b>re-dose</b> the 5 -HT 3 -antagonist for PONV treatment. </p...|$|R
50|$|Samples can be {{collected}} on artificial or natural substrata, either in situ {{or in the}} laboratory. There must be a series of samples exposed to different concentrations of contaminant and a control sample. In situ sampling involves setting up a sampling device in an aquatic ecosystem and allowing it to colonize for some time (e.g. a couple of weeks). One example is the diatometer, a device that is deployed in the water that becomes colonized by diatoms, and then is removed for analysis. In situ sampling devices are set up at increasing distances from the pollution source {{in the case of}} point source pollution. The samples thus represent a gradient in contaminant concentration, assuming that the contaminant becomes more dilute with increasing distance from the point source. An example of laboratory sampling was used in a study by Schmitt-Jansen and Altenburger (2005). For 14 days communities were allowed to establish on discs set up in laboratory aquariums which were continuously mixed and inoculated with algae from a pond. The aquariums were dosed with different concentrations of herbicide to get a gradient of long-term (14-day) contaminant exposures. Once a week the aquarium water was completely replaced and <b>re-dosed</b> with herbicide.|$|R
40|$|The {{promise of}} gene therapy as a {{treatment}} and/or cure for cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease {{is yet to be}} fulfilled. Lentiviral (LV) vectors possess many of the properties that would satisfy the requirements for an effective clinical gene correction treatment; the capacity to hold the large CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, pseudotyped envelopes that provide broad tropism for a range of cells and tissue types, the ability to transduce dividing and non-dividing cells, the potential for long-term gene expression from genomic integration, and the lack of pre-existing blocking antibodies for majority of the CF population. To determine the persistence of LV gene expression, the same mice were repeatedly assessed throughout their lifetimes. The utilization of the biological compound lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) as a pre-treatment enhanced nasal airway gene expression of the HIV- 1 based LV vector containing reporter genes, or the functional CFTR gene, in normal and CF mice in vivo. Nasal luciferase (Luc) gene expression from a single LPC/LV nasal dose was sustained for the life time of normal mice, possibly suggesting an involvement of stem/progenitor cells or long-lived terminally differentiated cells. In contrast, stable long-term Luc gene expression was detected in the lung airways without the requirement of LPC pre-treatment. The loss then re-emergence of lung luminescence in CF mice demonstrated that stem/progenitor cells were transduced. This was the first examination of persistence of LV reporter gene and functional gene expression, in individual CF mice over their lifetimes. CF mice treated with LPC/LV-CFTR demonstrated a significant partial functional correction of the nasal CFTR electrophysiological defect that was sustained for up to 1 year. Importantly, this significantly increased survival, close to that observed in normal mice. Since the level of functional expression diminished over time in CF mice the ability to <b>re-dose</b> and evade blocking host immune responses was addressed. Multiple doses of a LV vector over a short time frame were feasible but did not significantly increase expression compared to a single dose. Circulating antibodies to both the vector envelope and the transgene protein were detected after repeat dosing conducting over a longer time frame. The timing of additional LV vector doses may be crucial for effective boosting of waning gene expression. The addition of a transient immunosuppressive treatment did not significantly enhance the level of gene expression produced by a single dose, but did reduce circulating antibodies to both the delivered foreign transgene and to the pseudotyped envelope protein. The demonstration of longevity of gene expression, the functional correction of the CFTR defect, the substantial increase in CF animal survival, the ability to <b>re-dose</b> and the use of immune-suppression to reduce antibody production provides strong and specific support for the continued investigation of LV CFTR gene transfer towards a clinical gene therapy treatment for CF airway disease.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHereditary {{angioedema}} (HAE) is a {{rare disease}} characterized by C 1 -esterase inhibitor (C 1 -INH) deficiency, resulting in periodic attacks of acute edema, which can be life-threatening if they occur in the upper airway. No head-to-head comparisons of different treatment options for acute HAE attacks are available. Because immediate symptom relief is critical for potentially life-threatening laryngeal attacks, {{it is important to}} determine the treatment option that provides optimal treatment response. ObjectiveReview and compare data from clinical studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of treatments for laryngeal HAE attacks. MethodsWe conducted an indirect comparison of clinical outcomes from prospective studies for treatment of 881 acute laryngeal attacks with plasma-derived C 1 -INH concentrate (pdC 1 -INH) at fixed doses (500 or 1000 U) or a body weight-adjusted dose (20 U/kg), recombinant C 1 -INH concentrate at a fixed dose (2100 U), or a body weight-adjusted dose (50 U/kg), icatibant (30  mg), or ecallantide (30  mg). Comparisons included time to onset of symptom relief and need for <b>re-dosing</b> or emergency procedures. ResultsThe median time to onset of symptom relief ranged between 15  min and approximately 2  h, and was shortest with body weight-adjusted doses of pdC 1 -INH. The proportion of laryngeal attacks with <b>re-dosing</b> ranged between 0 % and 72 %. No <b>re-dosing</b> was needed after treatment with a single body weight-adjusted dose of pdC 1 -INH (48 attacks). ConclusionsAvailable data suggest that among different HAE treatments, body weight-adjusted pdC 1 -INH (20 U/kg) provides the most reliable treatment response for treatment of laryngeal HAE attacks...|$|E

Additionally, in the group taking Indoprocaf, two different oral formulations were tested: effervescent tablets and encapsulated coated tablets. RESULTS: Of 297 patients randomised (150 assigned to Indoprocaf and 147 to sumatriptan), 281 {{were included in the}} intention-to-treat efficacy analysis. The initial dosing of Indoprocaf and sumatriptan was similarly effective with pain-free rates higher than 30 % (95 % CI of odds-ratio: 0. 57 - 1. 28) and headache relief rates of about 60 % (95 % CI of odds-ratio: 0. 82 - 1. 84) with both the drugs. The efficacy of <b>re-dosing</b> of Indoprocaf as rescue medication was more effective than that of sumatriptan with pain-free values of 47 % vs. 27 % in the total attacks with a statistically significant difference in the first migraine attack in favour of Indoprocaf. The efficacy of <b>re-dosing</b> to treat a recurrence/relapse was very high without differences between the drugs (pain-free: 60 % with Indoprocaf and 50 % with sumatriptan in the total attacks). Indoprocaf and sumatriptan were well-tolerated. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that {{the efficacy of}} the initial dosing of Indoprocaf was not higher than that of sumatriptan, but that the strategy to use the lowest effective dose as soon as the headache occurred, followed by a second dose if the headache has not relieved or to treat a relapse, was very effective, especially with Indoprocaf...|$|E

40|$|Background: Viral infections cause {{most cases}} of pharyngitis (sore throat); consequently, {{antibiotics}} {{are generally not}} warranted. However, a treatment targeting pain and inflammation, e. g. a topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory spray, may be helpful for patients. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of flurbiprofen 8. 75 mg spray. Methods: This randomised, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted at six community based clinical research centres in Australia and two in New Zealand. Adults with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection (onset ≤ four days) took one dose of flurbiprofen (n = 249) or placebo spray (n = 256); after six hours, they could <b>re-dose</b> every three–six hours as required, for three days (max. five doses/day). The primary endpoint was the area under the change from baseline curve in throat soreness from zero–two hours (AUC 0 – 2 h). The change from baseline in other sore throat symptoms also assessed efficacy. Results: The mean AUC 0 – 2 h for throat soreness was significantly greater with flurbiprofen spray (- 1. 82; 95 % CI: - 1. 98 to 1. 65) compared with placebo (- 1. 13; 95 % CI: - 1. 27 to 0. 99) (P P < 0. 05 for all).

40|$|AbstractAs {{expected}} {{with all}} antithrombotic agents, {{there is a}} risk of bleeding complications in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) because of the DOAC itself, acute trauma, invasive procedures, or underlying comorbidities. For many bleeding events, a prudent course of action will be to withdraw the DOAC, then “wait and support” the patient, with the expectation that the bleeding event should resolve with time. Likewise, DOAC therapy may be interrupted ahead of a planned procedure, the stopping time being dependent on the agent involved and the patient’s renal function. However, urgent reversal of anticoagulation is required in patients with serious or life-threatening bleeding or in those requiring urgent surgery or procedures. Novel specific reversal agents, either under development or recently approved, will need to be incorporated into local anticoagulation reversal protocols. For dabigatran-treated patients, idarucizumab recently has been approved for clinical use in cases of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding or when patients require emergency surgery or urgent procedures, both associated with a high risk of bleeding. As clinical experience with individual specific reversal agents grows, their roles in managing major bleeding events in DOAC—treated patients will become better defined. Future research, as well as ongoing use of idarucizumab, should help establish when it is appropriate to <b>re-dose</b> with idarucizumab, coadminister with prothrombin complex concentrates, or re-initiate DOAC after idarucizumab use. Ongoing trials should help identify the appropriate doses and expected durations of effect for andexanet alfa and ciraparantag, which are likely to vary depending on the individual oral anticoagulants...|$|R

New SCB’s such as 5 f-AKB 48 and 5 F-PB- 22 have been detected in French seizures and in sudden death post mortems in the US. The aim was to describe development of dependence on herbal smoking mixtures containing the SCB’s, 5 f-AKB 48 and 5 F-PB- 22 and subsequent withdrawal syndromes. Dependent users of herbal smoking mixtures known to contain the SCB’s 5 f-AKB 48 and 5 F-PB- 22 with an average Severity of Dependence Score (SDS) of 13 were interviewed using a structured guide (three males/three females). Narratives were analysed using the Empirical Phenomenological Psychological (EPP) five step method. Six themes with 68 categories emerged from the analysis. Themes are illustrated as 1) Networks and Product Availability; 2) Drivers and Motives for Use; 3) Effect and Pathways toward Dependence; 4) Poly Substance Use and Comparisons to Natural Cannabis; 5) Dependence and Withdrawal and 6) Self-detoxification Attempts. Two higher levels of abstraction above these theme-levels emerged from the data, with sole use of herbal smoking mixtures containing 5 f-AKB 48 and 5 F-PB- 22 centering on the interplay between intense cravings, compulsive all-consuming seeking, use and <b>re-dose</b> behaviours, and fear of the psychiatric and self-harms caused when in withdrawal. This is the first study describing dependence and withdrawal experiences in users dependent on 5 f-AKB 48 and 5 F-PB- 22.

The {{field work}} {{portion of this}} project began September 22, 2012, with an {{expected}} completion date of November 10, 2012. The field work will involve traveling by canoe down the entire Chattahoochee-Apalachicola River system from the source spring near Chattahoochee Gap to the Gulf of Mexico, collecting water quality data, documenting illegal incursions into the river channel, and gathering such other information as {{may seem to be}} valuable. As of September 30, 2012, 89. 4 miles of the river system has been covered. What makes this project unique and of particular value will be the Lagrangian design of the observations. The purpose of a Lagrangian sampling scheme is to follow an initial mass or “parcel” of water as it moves through its containing channel, tracking changes to the water’s constituents over space and time. Hydraulic modeling work done by others was used to make initial estimates of average river velocities {{along the length of the}} system, which were used to calculate doses of a tracking dye sufficient to be detected but not so large as to violate EPA guidelines. Rhodamine WT dye was chosen for tracking and it was detected using a fluorometer. The concept of an initial water mass is used in recognition of the fact that a small mass of water emerging from the source spring will be increasingly dispersed as the mass moves downstream due to the mixing within the channel and the variability of water velocity across the channel. Because of this, it is easier to think of trying to follow the centroid of the dispersing mass than it is to think of predicting the likely position of a single molecule that emerges from the source. Due to low rhodamine WT doses used, the dye is <b>re-dosed</b> at roughly 25 to 50 kilometer intervals along the system. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division; U. S.

40|$|Abstract — Methoxetamine (MXE), a {{ketamine}} analogue, {{is one of}} the new “legal highs ” sold on the Internet. The aim of this {{qualitative study}} was to provide an initial understanding of what character-izes the experiences induced by MXE. Anonymously written reports (33 persons) on the effects of MXE were collected from public Internet forums and analyzed using the Empirical Phenomenological Psychological Method. The analysis generated 10 themes: (1) preparation, motivation and anticipation; (2) initial effects; (3) malfunction of cognitive processes stabilizing normal state; (4) inner personal processes and learning; (5) emotional processes; (6) altered sensory perception; (7) dissolution and transition; (8) spiritual and transcendental experiences; (9) effects and processes after the experience; (10) <b>re-dosing</b> and addiction. MXE induced a heavily altered state of consciousness. The effects were similar to those induced by classic hallucinogens (such as LSD, psilocybin) and the dissociative ketamine. MXE seemed to have quite a high abuse potential. Beside the positive effects described, negative effects like fear and anxiety were also reported. Acceptance was considered the best coping strategy.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} how long single-dose prophylactic antibiotic regimens for burns surgery maintained plasma concentrations above the MICs for target organisms during surgery. Patients and methods: We monitored antibiotic plasma concentrations in 12 patients (mean +/- SD 43 +/- 12 % total burn surface area) throughout debridement surgery after {{administration of the}} standard prophylactic antibiotic dosing regimens of either 1 g of intravenous cefalotin or 4. 5 g of intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam. Results: The eschar debridement and grafting procedures ranged in duration from 2. 25 to over 8. 5 h. The duration of total plasma cefalotin concentration above an MIC of 0. 2 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus was 6. 49 +/- 2. 85 h, whereas the mean duration of total plasma piperacillin concentration above an MIC of 64 mg/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only 1. 15 +/- 0. 59 h. None of the patients dosed with piperacillin/tazobactam was adequately protected {{for the duration of}} their surgery and adequate prophylaxis was only evident in four of the nine patients administered cefalotin. Conclusions: These results suggest a need to review antibiotic prophylaxis dosage regimens for burns surgery and the adoption of regimens that will minimize the risk of infection in this high-risk patient group. It is suggested that the antibiotic prophylaxis guideline for burn debridement surgery be modified to include <b>re-dosing</b> or a continuous infusion of P-lactam antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{intensive}} {{research efforts}} and therapeutic advances {{over the last}} few decades, the pediatric neural crest tumor, neuroblastoma, continues to be responsible for over 15 % of pediatric cancer deaths. Novel therapeutic options are needed for this tumor. Recently, investigators have shown that mice with syngeneic murine gliomas treated with an engineered, neuroattenuated oncolytic herpes simplex virus- 1 (oHSV), M 002, had a significant increase in survival. M 002 has deletions in both copies of the γ 1 34. 5 gene, enabling replication in tumor cells but precluding infection of normal neural cells. We hypothesized that M 002 would also be effective in the neural crest tumor, neuroblastoma. We showed that M 002 infected, replicated, and decreased survival in neuroblastoma cell lines. In addition, we showed that in murine xenografts, treatment with M 002 significantly decreased tumor growth, and that this effect was augmented with the addition of ionizing radiation. Importantly, survival could be increased by subsequent doses of radiation without <b>re-dosing</b> of the virus. Finally, these studies showed that the primary entry protein for oHSV, CD 111 was expressed by numerous neuroblastoma cell lines and was also present in human neuroblastoma specimens. We concluded that M 002 effectively targeted neuroblastoma and that this oHSV may have potential for use in children with unresponsive or relapsed neuroblastoma...|$|E

BACKGROUND: Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{is caused}} by a defect in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity, often resulting in an incurable airway disease. Gene therapy into the conducting airway epithelium is a potential cure for CF; however, most gene vectors do not result in long-lived expression, and require <b>re-dosing.</b> Perversely, intrinsic host immune responses can then block renewed gene transfer. METHODS: To investigate whether persistent gene expression could be achieved after a single dosing event, thus avoiding the issue of blocking host responses, we used a gene transfer protocol that combined an airway pretreatment using lysophosphatidylcholine with a human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotype) derived lentiviral vector to test whether an integrating vector could produce gene expression able to last for a substantial part of the lifetime of the laboratory mouse. RESULTS: We found that a single dose of LV-LacZ produced immediate as well as lifetime mouse airway expression, confirming our hypothesis that use of an integrating vector extends transgene expression. Importantly, LV-CFTR dosing achieved at least 12 months of CFTR expression, representing partial functional correction of the CFTR defect in CF-null mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings validate the potential of this methodology for developing a gene transfer treatment for CF airway disease. Alice G. Stocker, Karlea L. Kremer, Rachel Koldej, Darren S.

40|$|The {{macrolide}} antibiotic clarithromycin (CLARI) has a {{wide spectrum}} of activity and efficacy for Mycoplasma species. In addition, CLARI accumulates during <b>re-dosing</b> of Mojave desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii). Here, we characterized plasma concentrations after a single dose, after 3. 5 months of dosing, and after per rectum administration; all doses were 15 mg/kg. After a single dose, the median maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) was 1. 69 mg/ml and occurred at a median of 6 h after administration, the estimated elimination half-life was 6. 9 h, and the median accumulation index was 10 %. Plasma concentrations after long-term dosing showed consistent intraturtle concentrations of at least 2 μg/ml, with 1 turtle showing increasing accumulation of CLARI at all 3 time points and the remaining 5 turtles showing increases by 3. 5 mo. Compared with expected Cmax values, the median long-term values were approximately 3 times higher than expected in 4 of 6 turtles and approximately 2 / 3 of that expected in the remaining 2 turtles. Per rectum dosing caused antibiotic retention below target values. Together, these results support accumulation of CLARI after repeated oral dosing and indicate that stable concentrations are reached long-term. Either cystoenteric recycling of CLARI or large intestinal absorption of bypass CLARI may explain the observed cumulative increases. In addition, twice-weekly CLARI maintains target concentrations over time, and per rectum dosing will require higher doses or increased dose frequency to be successful. Based on this work, pharmacokinetic studies in exotic species should include multidose studies to verify initial kinetic estimates from single-dose trends...|$|E

Introduction: Pediatric ambulatory surgery has experienced a surge in popularity as new surgical and anesthetic techniques have made it a more viable option for a host of surgical procedures. While the vast majority of patients are successfully discharged upon recovery from anesthesia, a small proportion 1 - 2. 5 % in previous studies must be admitted to the hospital's inpatient unit. Many of these patients present with conditions such as uncontrollable post-operative pain and nausea and vomiting associated with anesthesia. As such we sought to characterize the unplanned admissions population at Children's Hospital Boston, a tertiary care pediatric hospital and investigate Anesthesia's role in their care. Methods: Patients were identified as possible candidates for inclusion into this study if they experienced a status change in the Children's Hospital Boston records system from "Day Surgery Unit" to "Inpatient Unit". Data from these patients was gathered using Anesthesia records, medical record number summaries, growth charts, and other electronic medical records. Results: The unplanned admission rate at Children's Hospital Boston was 1. 29 % from January 2010 through June 2011, representing 347 patients from a day surgery population of 26, 951. No statistically significant differences were observed in regards to patient fitness, as measured by American Association of Anesthesiologist classification, when compared to patients successfully discharged. The leading causes of admission were uncontrollable postoperative pain (n= 117, 39. 8 %) and post-operative nausea and vomiting (n= 94, 32. 0 %). When compared to the successfully discharged patient population; orthopedic surgery experienced a statistically significant increase in its contribution rate while genitourinary surgery experienced a statistically significant decrease. Pre-operative acetaminophen usage was only 19 %, while midazolam pre-medication was 51. 4 %. Regional anesthesia was utilized in only 11. 5 % of cases overall and 27. 3 % of orthopedic patients. Patients experiencing post-operative nausea and vomiting were primarily treated with ondansetron and dexamethasone as prophylaxis while overwhelmingly receiving a <b>re-dosing</b> of ondansetron post operatively. Post-operative utilization of metaclopramide in these patients was 3. 7 %. Conclusion: At Children's Hospital Boston 71. 8 % of unplanned admissions are either for pain or nausea and vomiting, two conditions that are intimately related. It is reasonable to presume that an increased emphasis on prophylaxis analgesia in the form of pre-operative acetaminophen and regional anesthesia would help alleviate a portion of these cases directly related to uncontrollable pain. It is also not unreasonable to assume that these options may decrease post-operative opioid usage, a significant risk factor for post-operative nausea and vomiting. In cases where nausea and vomiting is still present and patients have received ondansetron and dexamethasone intraoperatively, {{there seems to be a}} reliance on <b>re-dosing</b> with ondansetron, whereas based on physiological pathways of nausea patients, a third drug-class may be a better option. Improvements in these areas could decrease the unplanned admission rate at Children's Hospital Boston...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Report {{long-term}} {{safety and}} effectiveness of natalizumab over 240 weeks in the prospective, observational, open-label Safety of TYSABRI <b>Re-dosing</b> and Treatment (STRATA) Study. Methods: Patients (N 5 1, 094) previously enrolled in natalizumab multiple sclerosis clinical trials received natalizumab 300 mg IV every 4 weeks, up to 240 weeks. Serious adverse events, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, and annualized relapse rates were analyzed. Results: At data cutoff (February 9, 2012), natalizumab exposure was 3, 460 patient-years; a median of 56 (range 1 - 70) infusions were received. Serious adverse events, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, were consistent with natalizumab's known profile. Upon natalizumab re-exposure, rates of anti-natalizumab antibodies and hypersensitivity reactions were 3 % and 5 % overall, and 40 % and 24 % among patients with 1 to 2 prior natalizumab doses. Patients originally randomized to placebo/another disease-modifying therapy vs natalizumab in previous studies had significantly higher EDSS scores at STRATA baseline; this difference persisted over 240 weeks. EDSS scores generally remained stable. Patients initially randomized to natalizumab had lower annualized relapse rates over 240 weeks. Conclusions: Serious adverse events were consistent with natalizumab's known safety profile; short exposure with a gap before redosing was associated with higher incidences of antinatalizumab antibodies and hypersensitivity reactions. Stability of EDSS scores and consistently low relapse rates over 5 years of natalizumab treatment are consistent with its known efficacy profile. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that in patients with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis, natalizumab stabilizes EDSS scores, decreases relapse rates, and is {{associated with an increased}} risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. © 2014 American Academy of Neurology...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{surgical}} site infection (SSI) is {{a frequent}} complication following gastrointestinal surgery, but the careful selection and administration of prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a package of interventions that could be used to improve surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) at our institution. Methods: A pre-post quality improvement project at a private hospital in Saudi Arabia was conducted between January 2014 until July 2016. A multidisciplinary team was assembled to identify and overcome barriers that were responsible for patients receiving suboptimal antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients were included if they had undergone surgery on their appendix, colon, rectum, or small intestine. Compliance with use of an adapted order form, as well as appropriate antibiotic selection, dosing, timing, and timing of <b>re-dosing,</b> were measured. Data on the rates of SSI before and after the intervention were also obtained. Results: Of the 269 patients included in the study, 161 (61. 5 %) had appendix surgery, 86 (32. 8 %) had colorectal surgery, and 15 (5. 7 %) had small bowel surgery. The surgery was performed laparoscopically in 218 (83. 5 %) of patients. Utilization of the adapted order form increased from 1. 8 % to 92. 0 % following the intervention (p <  0. 001). Compliance with a bundle of appropriate antibiotic selection, dosing and timing improved from 47. 3 % to 82. 2 % after the intervention (p <  0. 001). Additionally, there was a non-statistically significant reduction in SSI rate (9. 1 % vs 5. 1 %; p =  0. 27). Conclusions: Our quality improvement intervention was successful in improving SAP for patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery at our institution...|$|E
