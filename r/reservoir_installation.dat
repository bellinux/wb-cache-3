30|$|The average {{impact of}} {{irrigation}} {{water over the}} simulation period {{was an increase in}} annual crop revenue of $ 13.00 /hectare. However, due to the cost of irrigation and <b>reservoir</b> <b>installation,</b> this on average created a net cost of $ 147.00 /hectare each year in order to cover the infrastructure and operation costs. Converting cropland to the high-value potato crop did not provide a positive net revenue when irrigation was applied. Irrigation and <b>reservoir</b> <b>installation</b> at Pelly’s Lake was too costly to enable positive net crop revenue throughout the simulation period, even when low-value crops are converted to high-value potato crops.|$|E
30|$|The {{cost of the}} 250 -micron {{mesh screen}} for the 7 -in. casing of Well 2 B- 35 - 55 - 6 is $ 450.00 per foot (source: Fitzpatrick, Halliburton), which totals $ 5, 850.00 for 13  feet of casing. The cost of the {{workover}} to remove the tubing and to install screens and packers/hangers approximately amounts to $ 80, 000.00. The installation would take about 5  days. Assuming an oil production rate of 51 bbl/day and price of oil as $ 30.00 per barrel, $ 7, 650.00 will {{be lost in the}} installation process. Hence, a total of $ 87, 650.00 is an approximate expense for installing screens. After screens are installed, there might be periods when screens need to be cleaned in case of plugging. This imposes an additional expense that needs to be considered as well. Due to the high oil viscosity, low oil flowrate, and high unconsolidated level of the <b>reservoir,</b> <b>installation</b> of screens is currently considered to be uneconomic.|$|E
40|$|Regions {{dependent}} on agricultural production {{are concerned about}} the uncertainty associated with climate change. Extreme drought and flooding events are predicted to occur with greater frequency, requiring mitigation strategies to reduce the associated negative impacts. Retention pond installation schemes designed to capture surface water may be a viable option to reduce water stress during drought periods by supporting irrigation. The retention systems would serve to capture excess spring runoff and extreme rainfall events, reducing flood potential downstream. Additionally, retention ponds may be used for biomass production and nutrient retention. The purpose of this research was to investigate the economic viability of adopting on-farm surface water retention systems as a strategic water management strategy. A retention pond was analysed using a dynamic simulation model to predict its storage capacity, installation and upkeep cost, and economic advantages. The average impact of irrigation application under present day conditions was an increase in crop revenue of $ 11. 38 /hectare. However, due to the cost of irrigation and <b>reservoir</b> <b>installation</b> this on average leaves the farmer to pay $ 148. 50 /hectare each year. Replacing existing low value crops within the study area with high value potato crops also resulted in a negative net revenue. Irrigated crops under future climate scenarios also experienced a net decrease in revenue due to the associated irrigation and reservoir infrastructure costs. However, gross crop revenue increases were more consistent throughout the future study time periods and required less irrigation water, making irrigation application more beneficial in the future. Farmers who harvest cattails from retention systems for biomass and available carbon offset credits can gain $ 642. 70 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. Cattail harvest also removes phosphorus and nitrogen, providing a monetized impact of $ 7, 014 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. The removal of phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, and avoided flooding damages of the retention basin itself provide an additional $ 17, 850 to $ 18, 470 /hectare of retention system/year depending on the valuations of avoided flooding damages. The recommended use of retention systems is for avoiding flood damages, nutrient retention, and biomass production. This is due to the economic gains these three functions of retention systems provide. The revenue gained from these functions can support farmers wanting to invest in irrigation while providing economic and environmental benefits to the region...|$|E

40|$|Water {{managers}} in the Willamette River Basin face a number of difficult and closely interrelated challenges associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), and other associated concerns. For example, under the CWA, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) has recently released a total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for temperature in the Willamette Basin.

Some of the major factors impacting temperature in the Willamette include operation of the multiple reservoirs, permitted industrial and municipal discharges, land-use types, and irrigation practices.

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the year}} 2011 the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation started a project aiming to develop a model for {{monitoring}} and evaluation of impacts on fish farming in cages. The project needs to define an aquaculture park of the Furnas <b>reservoir</b> for the <b>installation</b> of a platform for collecting meteorological and limnological data. The choose of the appropriate location for positioning the platform should be based on knowledge of the topography and the land use and cover of the contribution area of each aquaculture park, so that we can establish the relationship of these factors with the water quality. This paper aims to delimit the contribution area of the Furnas reservoir and the catchment area of aquaculture parks in order to characterize the topographic factor and land use and cover around the reservoir. Therefore has the purpose of collecting information to assist in choosing an aquaculture park among the sixteen existing in Furnas <b>reservoir</b> for the <b>installation</b> of a platform for data collection. A digital elevation model generated based on SRTM data was used for the delimitation of the contributing areas. Were used images from Landsat- 5 and ResourceSat- 1 addition to field surveys to characterize the use and land cover around the reservoir. We found that the Furnas reservoir have a catchment area estimated at 52. 264 km 2 while the catchment area of aquaculture parks varies from 2. 5 to 630 km 2.

50|$|If {{the aquifer}} is suitable, {{all of the}} {{associated}} infrastructure must be developed from scratch, increasing the development costs compared to depleted <b>reservoirs.</b> This includes <b>installation</b> of wells, extraction equipment, pipelines, dehydration facilities, and possibly compression equipment. Since the aquifer initially contains water {{there is little or}} no naturally occurring gas in the formation and of the gas injected some will be physically unrecoverable. As a result, aquifer storage typically requires significantly more cushion gas than depleted reservoirs; up to 80% of the total gas volume. Most aquifer storage facilities were developed when the price of natural gas was low, meaning this cushion gas was inexpensive to sacrifice. With rising gas prices aquifer storage becomes more expensive to develop.|$|R
40|$|Since {{people living}} in a karst area {{periodically}} face a crisis {{due to a lack}} of fresh water, it is necessary to re-evaluate the ability to use water resources. An appropriate and effective management is required to use available water resource sustainably. We describe a management process of exploring underground river in karst region as water resources. The activities completed included four phases, namely exploration, pre-lifting activities, the water lifting and post-lifting activities. The exploration phase included speleological surveys and data collection for the cave mouth using remote sensing instrument. The pre-lifting was done to prepare various requirements before the lifting process was completed. The water lifting phase consisted of the construction of an underground river dam, the installation of submersible pumps, the construction of <b>reservoirs</b> and the <b>installation</b> of piping to connect to the public hydrant. The post-lifting phase was mainly conducted to organise water distribution evenly. This management model was evidenced to successfully overcome drought in Pucung village by providing fresh water to the local community.

40|$|The {{explored}} {{stocks of}} oil of Russia make 11. 6 % of total stocks of oil of the world, gas stocks make 33. 5 % of the explored world's gas reserves. Now export of gas from Russia takes {{the first place}} in the world; oil export – the second place. In this connection Russia plays the main role in the world market of hydrocarbonic resources. Export of oil to China makes approximately 2 % from total exports of oil of Russia. Now there are two problems of manufacture and oil and gas refining in Russia: 1) updating and increase of the equipment quality degree for processing and oil and gas transportation, increase of technological level of oil refining and quality of mineral oil is required; 2) maintenance of long duration of manufacture and new oil fields exploration. For the decision of these problems the investment of huge means is required: in the sum of 200 - 210 billion US dollars. In this connection there is a cooperation prospect between China and Russia on exploration of oil and gas resources. Within the next 20 years China will turn to the most perspective consumer market of oil and gas in the world that will provide switching of attention to exploration of hydrocarbonic resources of East Russia and change of a direction of oil and gas export to Asian-Pacific region. It gives favorable chance for building in Xinjiang pipelines of hydrocarbonic resources and for considerable development of cooperation with Russia as a whole. In Xinjiang there are highly effective deep petropumps, oil-field <b>installations,</b> force <b>reservoirs,</b> electrocontrol <b>installations</b> for the petroindustry and others. Accordingly there are possibilities for trade and cooperation between Xinjiang and Russia in the field of oil refining.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2010. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Francis A. Kulacki. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxii, 184 pages, appendices A-D. Natural convection in a horizontal fluid-superposed porous layer heated locally from below is studied in this thesis. This problem occurs in numerous engineering and geophysical systems, such as fibrous and granular thermal insulations, water <b>reservoirs,</b> grain storage <b>installations,</b> solid-matrix heat exchangers, solidifying castings, and post-accident cooling of nuclear reactors. In nature, thermal circulation in lakes, shallow coastal areas and other reservoirs {{occurs in a}} system having a fluid layer superposed {{on top of a}} porous matrix that is heated locally at the base. In spite of its fundamental nature, there are virtually no studies in the literature pertaining to this problem. To address this shortcoming, the fundamental aspects of this problem are studied in this work. The goal of the thesis is to study how free convective heat transfer in a composite layer with a localized bottom heat source is affected by parameters such as the size of the heat source, the fluid-to-porous layer height ratio, the Darcy number, the aspect ratio, the solid-to-fluid conductivity ratio, and the fluid Prandtl number. To that end, two particular aspects of the problem are studied: (a) the steady-state and transient flow and temperature fields, and (b) measurement and prediction of the overall heat transfer characteristics of the system. A numerical approach has been used to study the development of the temperature and flow fields in the system and predict overall heat transfer rates. A one-domain formulation, which uses a single set of governing equations to model fluid flow and heat transfer throughout the entire composite domain, is used. To solve the governing equations, a control volume based numerical solution technique is used. Results show that the nature of convective motion in a composite system with a localized bottom heat source is identical to that observed when the base is uniformly heated. A cellular flow pattern is observed with flow penetration occurring from the overlying fluid layer to the underlying porous layer. Penetration, however, is significant only near the fluid-porous layer interface. The overall heat transfer coefficients are found to depend strongly on the heater length, height ratio, and the fluid-to-porous layer conductivity ratio, while the effects of the aspect ratio and the fluid Prandtl number are not very significant. The effect of the Darcy number is moderate up to Darcy numbers of 10 - 3 beyond which there is a sudden increase in heat transfer coefficients Experiments are performed to validate the numerical solutions and develop empirical Nusselt-versus-Rayleigh number correlations. Experiments are conducted in a cubical chamber with 3 mm DIA glass beads as the porous layer and distilled water as the saturating fluid. Two different heater lengths and three different height ratios are investigated. Experimental results confirm the numerical predictions that the Nusselt number increases with a decrease in the heater length and an increase in the height ratio. However, significant numerical differences are seen when experimental and numerical results are compared. The most likely reason for the observed discrepancy is the implementation of the one-domain model for the numerical solution. This discrepancy calls into question the results of prior numerical studies for the fully heated bottom which have used a one-domain formulation and emphasizes the necessity of validation via experiment...|$|R
