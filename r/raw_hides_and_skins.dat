40|$|Abstract Introduction to {{the topic}} Formal {{commitments}} {{by the private sector}} and governments on zero net deforestation have increased since the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests. Majority of companies with commitments are manufacturers and retailers located in developed countries, while those operating upstream of supply chains and in developing countries still lag behind. Recent scientific studies single out livestock as the largest driver for tropical deforestation followed by soy, palm oil and timber production. Despite the significant impact and several multiparty initiatives, the sector still lags behind in terms of commitments and policies towards deforestation free production. The situation is especially dare in Brazil, the biggest cattle producer country in the world, with constant conflict and diverse interests over forest resources. As the result of exploiting by product of meat production, the leather industry is indirectly linked to land use changes on the ground. Recently, leather was identified as deforestation risk commodity by several NGO reports. The industry is facing significant customer and civil society pressure to establish full traceability of the supply chain and to ensure consumers deforestation free products. Being an European market leader, Italian leather industry is also the biggest European importer of <b>raw</b> bovine <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> from Brazil. The objective of the paper is to explore deforestation responsibilities and potentialities in green marketing of the Italian leather and meat industries with reference to the Brazilian context. Description of data and research methodology Using the content analysis method, analysing publicly available information, documents and company reports and through data collection with experts’ interviews, this study reveals that there is a significant lack of awareness regarding the issue of deforestation and its link to leather industry among Italian tanneries and meat industry and in general public. Although deforestation was revealed as an important concern during personal communication and interviews, there is a significant lack of consistent public communication of the issue. Discussion of theoretical and/or empirical results Given the market value of the Italian leather and its global image, the industry has the power to transform markets. However, it faces several challenges on the way such as lack of awareness, negotiation power and complexity of supply chains. This is further exacerbated by inherent challenges of implementing zero deforestation commitments in general. Based on already existing public-private initiatives in related sectors, this study concludes by suggesting further directions {{to address the issue of}} deforestation by the leather industry. Paper’s potential for generating discussion during the conference The topic of the paper is of some interest in highlighting the need for a new approach in the evaluation of the impacts of industries not directly involved in wood working on the processes of forest degradation and deforestation. Analysing the impact of production and consumption of meat and leather on embedded forest degradation and deforestation gives a new perspective for the evaluation of North-South trade...|$|R

40|$|Most {{countries}} have implemented export-oriented development strategies with {{the objectives of}} improving their economic stability and improving resource allocation efficiency. Export tax, which has been {{an integral part of}} trade policies for centuries, has not been given adequate attention by the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the economic literature. Export taxes on primary commodities serve as indirect subsidies to manufacturing and processing industries by lowering the domestic price of inputs, and also {{have a positive effect on}} government revenue. Conversely, export taxes can have a negative impact on the producers of raw materials and externalities for trade partners. The government of Ethiopia applied a 150 % export tax on <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> (RHS) and semi-finished leather products in 2008, and another 150 % export tax on crust leather in 2012 in order to encourage the leather manufacturing industry. The aim of this study is to examine the export trends of Ethiopia s <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> and finished leather products, and to analyse the effect of export tax on Ethiopia s leather industry s export competitiveness. A linear trend analysis model was used to analyse the export trends of <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> and finished leather products. This study evaluated export volume data from 1997 to 2014 in order to estimate the trend coefficients. The results of the model showed that Ethiopia s RHS and semi-processed leather products export had declined by - 38. 06 % and significant at 1 % significant level; this is due to the heavy export tax imposed by the government to increase the production and export of finished leather products. Meanwhile, finished leather products and footwear have increased by 75. 34 % and 44. 37 % respectively, and significant at 1 % significant level. The comparative advantage analysis was used to examine the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) of Ethiopia by comparing selected countries. The results indicated that Ethiopia was a RCA of <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> and semi-processed leather products more than one (RCA > 1) before 2008; after the export tax implementation in 2008, the RCA became decreased, conversely, the RCA of Ethiopia s finished product more than one for the period 2006 to 2014 and increased more after 2008. South Africa has comparative advantage only on the export of raw hides skins and semi-processed leather product (RCA> 1). Nigeria was not stable RCA for both <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> and finished leather products and in most year revealed comparative advantage greater than one (RCA > 1). The RCA indexes of footwear for all three countries were less than one except Ethiopia in (2007, 2008 and 2012). The RCA provides information on advantage to exports, such as product comparisons with other competitive countries. However, the RCA does not show the sources of advantage (growth), therefore the constant market share (CMS) model was used to indicate the source of advantage. The CMS model has been used to evaluate the competitiveness of Ethiopia s leather products. The export value data of 2007 were used as the base year, whereas data in 2013 were considered as the year after the export tax implementation and increase. The results indicate that the implementation of the export tax has reduced the competitiveness of <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> and semi-processed leather products, but increased the competitiveness of the finished leather products in the world markets. The overall results showed positive export growth (2. 55), which is most likely achieved by an increase in the export competitiveness of the leather industry of 2. 25. The positive competitiveness value indicates that Ethiopian finished leather products are competitive with other exporters in selected markets (Italy, China and Hong Kong). Conversely, Ethiopia s leather products have negative commodity composition effects and market composition effects (- 0. 132 and - 0. 262, respectively). The negative commodity composition effect shows that, because of the export tax, the export of Ethiopian <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> and semi-processed leather products have decreased, while the imports of these products have grown faster in selected markets. The same is true for negative market composition effects; because of the export tax, the demand for <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> and semi-finished products decreased in selected markets.

Curing removes water from the <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> using a difference in osmotic pressure. The moisture content of <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> is greatly reduced, and osmotic pressure increased, {{to the point that}} bacteria are unable to grow. In wet-salting, the hides are heavily salted, then pressed into packs for about 30 days. In brine-curing, the hides are agitated in a saltwater bath for about 16 hours.

40|$|Making {{more from}} goat hides Cue: The hide or {{skin of a}} goat may be small, {{compared}} with cattle, but they can still be a valuable source of income to farmers. Typically they can earn around 10 per cent of {{the total value of}} a goat, but farmers can ensure they earn a better price through good management of the animal while it is alive, and by taking care in slaughtering and curing processes. In Malawi, the government has established a project to improve the income that farmers can earn from their livestock skins and hides. Dr Grey Matita is the national project coordinator, and he spoke to Excello Zidana about what farmers can do to get more benefits from their goat hides. He began by suggesting that good care of the live animal, including good feeding and health care, was the first step to a better quality hide. IN:		?If you have got an animal that is well fed ? OUT:		?instead of indulging in export of <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> [...] ? DUR?N		 4 ? 34 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Grey Matita describing progress in the processing of goat hides in Malawi. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Matita	If you have got an animal that is well fed in a good state of nutrition without diseases, {{we are talking about a}} very good raw commodity, the skin that comes from these goats. So it is worth investing in good animal husbandry so that we have got very good hides and skins produced from these animals. Zidana	Going around villages in this part of Africa, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and even Kenya and Tanzania you would not definitely find people using goat skins as mats. Don?t they know that there is a market somewhere? Matita	That is exactly our core function with the Commercialisation of Hides and Skins project. We want to create awareness on the commercial value of hides and skins especially from the smallholder farming sector, from the rural sector. You are right that some of these hides or skins are just thrown away, some of them are consumed, some of them are turned into mats some of them are turned into drums, some of them turn into furniture but the real commercial value of hides and skins is in the production of a good quality raw product that is going to be transformed or processed into leather and leather is a high value commodity. So what we are saying in the project is, let?s not throw away these hides and skins, let?s recover them. And then also we are intervening in the quality issues of the hides and skins. Flaying is very very crucial. We want our flayers and butcher men to skin these animals properly so that we do not damage them because if we have good quality material coming from Malawi we will enhance the image of our hides and skins and that earns us a lot of foreign exchange. Even at domestic level farmers can earn very good livelihood from hides and skins. So the message is loud and clear from me, nobody should ever ever throw away a hide or skin and the market, the domestic market for hides and skins is there. Zidana	Are there any special types of houses for goats to make sure that they produce high quality skins? I am looking at barbed wire kholas? Matita	Yes Mr Zidana, not only for goats but also for other classes of livestock, even for cattle. What we are advising farmers or the message is let?s put up kholas that do not have barbed wires or any other things, sharp instruments that can cause scratches on the skins or hides of our animals because these scratches affect the quality of the skin or the hide. Remember a good quality hide or skin starts from the animal, the live animal. So very basic good animal husbandry, good housing, good nutrition is key to good production of quality hide and skin. You will see that this will be translated all along the value chain to the finished leather. If you start with a poor animal the finished leather will also be very poor. So we are saying along the value chain we must do things properly. Good animal husbandry from the field, very good slaughterhouse operations at killing, good curing of the hide and skin when we have removed it from the animal, good transportation and good storage. Storage is very very important because if you do not store them using an insecticide like actellic they get eaten by beetles. So we want to keep these insects away from our raw material so that when we sell it to the international market or to the domestic market we are presenting a good quality material that is going to fetch good money for us. Zidana	And lastly I remember one time I found somebody, this should be a Tanzanian, he was carrying bundles and bundles of goat skins and he was heading for Tanzania. Does this show that there is no market in Malawi for goat skins? Matita	Well that is a very true observation. We are aware of this problem in the Ministry of Trade and Private Sector Development on how to tackle this. We are also discussing this with other key stakeholders like in the Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development with our butcher men and with our collectors and sooner or later we will come up with a mechanism to bring down the flight of Malawi?s raw material into neighbouring countries because as I can confirm with you Mr Zidana we have now a local tannery in this country, Liwonde Tannery that has started processing <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> into a stage and it is a middle stage called wet blue, so that we can export at least a value added product instead of exporting to the international market or domestic market bulky <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins.</b> So we want to put up policies that are going to encourage processing of our raw material instead of indulging in export of <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins.</b> End of track. Value of goat hides, protecting goat hides from damage, good storage, and the importance of processing rather than exporting raw hides...|$|E

The consumption of these products is low for reasons of low quality and market imperfection. Measures to solve the problem in the area were limited because of little research and consideration. The objectives of the study were to identify the roles of the major actors and market channels, analyze strengths and weakness of the marketing system, and estimate the potential demand of the <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins.</b> A survey was conducted in which data and information were collected from 15 local collectors 5 butcheries <b>and</b> 6 <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> traders using structured questionnaire. Secondary data including prices, marketing, and purchase and sales of the raw material were collected from government bodies and private organizations. In addition, the production <b>and</b> quality of <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> were studied by selecting 121 sample rural household heads from 4 villages of the wereda using two stage random sampling. Formal and informal data collection tools of both primary and secondary data were also used. In analyzing the marketing conditions of the raw materials, descriptive statistics and SCP paradigm were used. Results indicate that 66 % of rural households sell <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> to local collector in rural areas, while 34 % supplied to the wereda wholesalers. Buying process was done without following the grading standards of <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins,</b> by simple sorting based on visible defects. The concentration analysis indicated that the market was highly oligopolistic with narrow range of market concentration. The marketing margin and marketing cost analysis showed transport charges, income and municipality tax, labour cost, preservation material cost and store rent were costs that influenced the marketing margin. High market concentration, barriers to entry in terms of capital and credit, and high marketing margin in the study area reveal that <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> marketing was inefficient. Therefore, to improve marketing system, correcting malpractices, implementation of standard grades and provision of market information, capacity building for all actors in the chain, strengthening the extension service on the product handling and management to farmers were recommended.

In response, Gulf Arab states have started to make strategic investments in the country, with Saudi Arabia building livestock export infrastructure and the United Arab Emirates purchasing large farmlands. Most livestock is exported through the northern Port of Bosaso and Port of Berbera. In March 2013, livestock traders also resumed exports from the southern Port of Mogadishu. After inspection at a newly constructed animal quarantine facility in Mogadishu, 13,000 goats and 2,435 camels were sent to markets in Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.A ten-year-old manufacturing, distributing, wholesale and import/export company, the Bosaso Tannery processes wet salted, dry salted, wet blue, limed, pickled, and air/frame dried sheep <b>and</b> goat <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin.</b> It has some of the highest quality natural skins on the continent. The firm exports a little over 90,000 tonnes of <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> every year from Bosaso to Ethiopia, Turkey, Pakistan, India, China <b>and</b> Italy. <b>Raw</b> camel <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> sheep <b>and</b> goat <b>skin</b> are also dispatched to the United Arab Emirates. The wet blue type is exported to the Middle East and various parts of Europe. As of 2012, the company is moving toward ready-made leather production for eventual exportation to consumer markets in the Middle East and other areas.|$|R
