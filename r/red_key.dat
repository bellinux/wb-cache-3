50|$|A simple {{discrimination}} learning procedure {{is one in}} which a subject learns to associate one stimulus, S+ (positive stimulus), with reinforcement (e.g. food) and another, S− (negative stimulus), with extinction (e.g. absence of food). For example, a pigeon can learn to peck a <b>red</b> <b>key</b> (S+), and avoid a green key (S−). Using traditional procedures, a pigeon would be initially trained to peck a <b>red</b> <b>key</b> (S+). When the pigeon was responding consistently to the <b>red</b> <b>key</b> (S+), a green key (S−) would be introduced. At first the pigeon would also respond to the green key (S−) but gradually responses to this key would decrease, because they are not followed by food, so that they occurred only a few times or even never.|$|E

40|$|In a six-key chamber variable-interval initial links of concurrent-chain {{schedules}} {{operated on}} two lower white keys. Terminal links operated on four upper keys; green keys {{were correlated with}} fixed-interval reinforcement and <b>red</b> <b>keys</b> with extinction. Free-choice terminal links arranged three green <b>keys</b> and one <b>red</b> key; forced-choice terminal links arranged one green <b>key</b> and three <b>red</b> <b>keys.</b> Thus, terminal links were equivalent in number, variety, and information value (in bits) of the keylights. Preferences (relative initial-link rates) were studied both with location of the odd key color varying over successive terminal links and with the odd color fixed at key locations that had controlled either relatively high or relatively low terminal-link response rates. Free choice was consistently preferred to forced choice. Magnitude of preference did not vary systematically with terminal-link response rate or stimulus control by green and <b>red</b> <b>keys.</b> The origins of free-choice preference could be ontogenic or phylogenic: organisms may learn that momentarily preferred alternatives are more often available in free than in forced choice, and evolutionary contingencies may favor the survival of organisms that prefer free to forced choice...|$|R

50|$|It is also {{important}} to provide the protection of data stored in the base. In this scope, two levels of data access are implemented in the TOC search. The first level is named “blue key” and it is available for students and researchers in academic institutions and research centers. The “blue key” enables the access to all open-source data stored in the base. The second level of data access, named “red key” is reserved for legal authorities, state institutions, and state government. The “red key” opens the part of the TOC search with confidential data. The owner of the “red key” also has access to the open source data, as the “blue key” owner. Only state institutions and agencies which have a contract with TOC search have an access to the <b>red</b> <b>key</b> data and they are <b>red</b> <b>key</b> members.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{suggestion}} of Thomas Perronet Thompson Poole developed a special keyboard to compel a [...] "musician {{to know what he}} is doing", although A. U. Hayter, the King's Chapel organist, had complained about the care required by the existing plan. The new keyboard organized pitches in a similar fashion to an ordinary piano keyboard but also emphasized the different classes of pitches by using different shapes and colors of keytops. The 1/1 series was assigned to large white natural keys arranged rising in diagonal rows, the 5/4 series on raised black sharp keys between the white keys, the 7/4 series on square <b>red</b> <b>keys</b> followed by square yellow 63/32 and blue 45/32 keys behind the white keys (a 6/5 series could be added using buttons raised above the sharp keys if desired). Key motion was linear and used two guide pins. The staggered keyboard arrangement separated distant key signatures and aligned octaves and was transpositionally invariant but not generalized, although the abbreviated pedalboard implied 3, 5, and 7 axes for 14 key-notes using three ranks of identical key levers.|$|R
40|$|Key presses of 1 monkey (called the {{performer}}) {{became the}} basis upon which a 2 nd monkey (called the judge) solved conditional-discrimination tasks. First, the performer was trained to press one of two colored choice <b>keys</b> (<b>red</b> or green) depending on {{the location of a}} white light in her chamber. The performer's key-pressing behavior was brought {{under the control of the}} experimenter by this procedure. Subsequently, the judge was trained to discriminate the performer's key-pressing behavior. In Experiment 1, the judge had to press Key 1 when the performer pressed the <b>red</b> choice <b>key</b> and Key 2 when the performer pressed the green choice key. In Experiment 2, a sample key was introduced. The judge had to press Key 1 when the performer pressed the same colored choice key as the sample; the judge had to press Key 2 when the performer pressed the different colored choice key. In both experiments, the judge was required to attend to the behavior of the performer. It was shown that the performer's behavior served as a discriminative stimulus for the judge's responses in a conditional-discrimination task...|$|R
40|$|A pigeon's pecking {{at each of}} two {{or three}} {{simultaneously}} available <b>red</b> <b>keys</b> was reinforced at different frequencies with a conditioned reinforcer, an orange key, on which 25 pecks resulted in a presentation of grain. Pecking was occasionally punished with a period of no reinforcement during which each key was dark. Both with two and with three keys, the relative frequency of pecking on a key was equal to the relative frequency of reinforcement obtained by pecks on that key. Also, the absolute frequency of pecking on each key was a linear function with zero intercept of the absolute frequency of reinforcement associated with that key. The slope of this function varied with the number of available keys; it was steeper with two than with three. The relative frequency of switching from any key (two successive pecks on different keys) approximated a linear function with zero intercept and slope slightly greater than 1. 0 of the total relative frequency of reinforcement associated with the keys to which the bird could switch. However, the relative frequency of switching to a particular key often showed systematic irregularities. The invariance in these data is the equality between the relative frequency of pecks on one {{of two or three}} keys and the relative frequency of reinforcement associated with that key...|$|R

50|$|Behavioral {{contrast}} {{refers to}} a change in the strength of one response that occurs when the rate of reward of a second response, or of the first response under different conditions, is changed. For example, suppose that a pigeon in an operant chamber pecks a key for food reward. Sometimes the key is red, sometimes green, but food comes with equal frequency in either case. Then suddenly pecking the key when it is green brings food less frequently. Positive contrast is seen when the rate of response to the <b>red</b> <b>key</b> goes up, even though the frequency of reward in red remains unchanged. Likewise, increasing the reward to green tends to reduce the response rate to red (negative contrast). This sort of contrast effect may occur following changes in the amount, frequency, or nature of the reward, and it has been shown to occur with various experimental designs and response measures (e.g. response rate, running speed).|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} and active site of Aurora-2-adenosine complex has been determined. The hinge (yellow), glycine-rich loop (blue), and activation loop (<b>red)</b> are <b>key</b> {{features of the}} protein kinase fold involved in binding adenosine. The protein backbone atoms of residues Glu-211, Ala-213 in the hinge region of Aurora-2, and the sidechain of residue Trp-277, located in the activation loop, bind adenosine through specific hydrogen bonds. There are no hydrogen bonds between the 2'-OH or 3'-OH groups of the ribose moiety and Aurora-2. Residues Lys-162 and Asp-274 are essential for Aurora-2 kinase activity but do not hydrogen bond {{to each other as}} seen in crystal structures of several other protein kinases.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of Pointillism is {{in sharp contrast}} to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette.

Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.|$|R
