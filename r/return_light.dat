40|$|A sensor is {{described}} for detecting {{the difference in}} phase {{of a pair of}} <b>returned</b> <b>light</b> pulse components, such as the two components of a light pulse of an optical gyro. In an optic gyro, the two light components have passed in opposite directions through a coil of optical fiber, with the difference in phase of the <b>returned</b> <b>light</b> components determining the intensity of light shining on the sensor. The sensor includes a CCD (charge coupled device) that receives the pair of <b>returned</b> <b>light</b> components to generate a charge proportional to the number of photons in the received light. The amount of the charge represents the phase difference between the two light components.

40|$|Abstract-Recently, {{arraying}} {{of large}} or small and distributed reflector antennas for uplink applications has attracted attention for a capability upgrade to the Deep Space Network (DSN). This interest {{is driven by the}} desire to maximize the usefulness of existing DSN large apertures in case of spacecraft emergency and to develop the necessary knowledge of how the array of small and distributed reflector antennas can meet other future uplink throughput needs. The primary challenge for uplink arraying of distributed reflector antennas for deep space applications is the lack of feedback from deep space within a reasonably short period. Furthermore, the individual reflectors (and their transmitter subsystems) are thousands of wavelengths apart, which make the phase coherence of individual transmitted signals an extremely challenging task.

40|$|Identification of refugia is an {{increasingly}} important adaptation strategy in conservation planning under rapid anthropogenic climate change. Granite outcrops (GOs) provide extraordinary diversity, including {{a wide range of}} taxa, vegetation types and habitats in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR).

Our customized AMCW lidar system captures all shown trigonometric moment images within 113 ms. This is all data that enters our closed-form reconstruction. Using a GPU implementation we can reconstruct 2. 2 · 105 transient frames per second. The reconstruction successfully separates the three returns due to the two specular interactions and direct illumination. Transient images help to analyze light transport in scenes. Besides two spatial dimensions, they are resolved in time of flight. Cost-efficient approaches for their capture use amplitude modulated con-tinuous wave lidar systems but typically take more than a minute of capture time. We propose new techniques for measurement and re-construction of transient images, which drastically reduce this cap-ture time. To this end, we pose the problem of reconstruction as a trigonometric moment problem. A vast body of mathematical liter...|$|E

Secondly, the problem of using the zoom air nowadays was brought forward, through testing the compression and rebounding of the zoom air in sport-shoes, the shock absorption and the energy return of it were researched.

The speed had effect on the shock absorption performance and energy return performance. The faster the speed was, the smaller the protection the zoom air could offer and the energy feedback were. Ageing would not make the material of the zoom air produce essential change, but may cause the reduction of the gas in the zoom air. All performances of the zoom air were improved after ageing, which means the zoom air in the market was not optimum at present, all this contributed to the lack of united standard. Finally, the method of testing and the standard of evaluation were put forward, which did some early work for the standard of zoom air in producing and testing...|$|E

40|$|An active {{optical sensor}} probes {{a region of}} free space that is engulfed in bright thermal noise to {{determine}} the presence (or absence) of a weakly reflecting target. The <b>returned</b> <b>light</b> (which is just thermal noise if no target is present, and thermal noise plus a weak reflection of the probe beam if a target is present) is measured and processed by a receiver and a decision is made on whether a target is present. It {{has been shown that}} generating an entangled pair of photons (which is a highly nonclassical state of light), using one photon as the probe beam and storing the other photon for comparison to the <b>returned</b> <b>light,</b> has superior performance to the traditional classical-light (coherent-state) target detection sensors. An entangled-photon transmitter and optimal receiver combination can yield up to a factor of 4 (i. e., 6 dB) gain in the error-probability exponent over a coherent state transmitter and optimal receiver combination, in a highly lossy and noisy scenario (when both sensors have the same number of transmitted photons). However, the receiver that achieves this advantage is not known. One structured receiver can close half of the 6 -dB gap (i. e., a 3 -dB improvement). It is based on phase-conjugating the <b>returned</b> <b>light,</b> then performing dual-balanced difference detection with the stored half of the entangled-photon pair. Active optical sensors are of tremendous value to NASA s missions. Although this work focuses on target detection, it can be extended to imaging (2 D, 3 D, hyperspectral, etc.) scenarios as well, where the image quality can be better than that offered by traditional active sensors. Although the current work is theoretical, NASA s future missions could benefit significantly from developing and demonstrating this capability. This is an optical receiver design whose components are, in principle, all implementable. However, the work is currently entirely theoretical. It is necessary to: 1.
