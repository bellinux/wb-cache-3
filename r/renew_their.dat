5|$|After 1147, {{however, the}} {{relations}} between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> alliance against Roger II of Sicily. Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|Around 1991, Gossard {{was selling}} the Wonderbra lines under {{licenses}} {{that were to}} expire in January 1994. At the time, the plunge style was a good seller in the UK market.

Instead of simply renewing the agreement, Gossard executives decided to negotiate better terms with Sara Lee.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, {{two sons}} of Rædwald's brother Eni, who were both eager to <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> Christian alliances, made {{diplomatic}} marriages during this period: Anna, {{who was to}} become a devout Christian ruler, married a woman of East Saxon connection and his brother Æthelric married a Northumbrian princess, Hereswitha, who was Edwin of Northumbria's grand-niece. This marriage was probably intended to reinforce the conversion of East Anglia to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 2013, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings {{announced}} their intentions not to <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> existing deal with Viacom.

Soviet forces made several other attempts in 1943 to <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> offensive and completely lift the siege, but made only modest gains in each one.

5|$|In 1368, a Han Chinese revolt {{known as}} the Red Turban Rebellion toppled the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China. Zhu Yuanzhang then {{established}} the Ming dynasty, ruling as the Hongwu Emperor (r.1368–1398). It {{is not clear how}} much the early Ming court understood the civil war going on in Tibet between rival religious sects, but the first emperor was anxious to avoid the same trouble that Tibet had caused for the Tang dynasty. Instead of recognizing the Phagmodru ruler, the Hongwu Emperor sided with the Karmapa of the nearer Kham region and southeastern Tibet, sending envoys out in the winter of 1372–1373 to ask the Yuan officeholders to <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> titles for the new Ming court.|$|E

5|$|In the interim, {{between the}} Royal Rumble and WrestleMania, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction {{was brought to}} an {{official}} on-screen conclusion.

5|$|Lesnar had {{previously}} signed a non-compete clause {{in order to}} be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010.

In July 2005, the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> relationship. WWE had offered Lesnar a contract, but on August 2, their official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company.

5|$|On Carpenter's command, several massive volleys of aimed Spencer repeating rifles hit {{the front}} {{waves of the}} mounted Indians.

Nearly all of these warriors died along with their ponies. Only three warriors made it to within fifty yards of the wagons before their demise. The Indians were so traumatized and demoralized by Carpenter's defense {{that they did not}} <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Reds allowed Nashville {{to use a}} {{designated}} hitter (DH) in their lineups. However, this allowance was later revoked, as the Reds {{were a part of}} the National League which did not use a DH. Larry Schmittou issued an ultimatum: if Cincinnati would not let the Sounds use a DH in their lineups, they would not <b>renew</b> <b>their</b> contract and would look for a new major league affiliate. The Reds did not budge on their decision to prohibit the designated hitter, so the Sounds looked for a new affiliate after 1979. Schmittou was then approached by five or six clubs looking to enter the Southern League as a Sounds affiliate.|$|E
