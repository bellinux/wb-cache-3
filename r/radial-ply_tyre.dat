5000|$|The TR4 was {{originally}} fitted with 15x4.5" [...] disc wheels. Optional 48-lace wire wheels could be ordered painted the same colour as the car's bodywork (rare), stove-enamelled (matte silver with chrome spinners, most common) or in matte or polished chrome finishes (originally rare, but now more commonly fitted). The most typical tyres originally fitted were 590-15 bias ply or optional radial tyres. In the US at one point, American Racing alloy (magnesium and aluminium) wheels were offered as an option, in 15x5.5" [...] or 15x6" [...] size. Tyres were {{a problem for}} original owners who opted for 60-spoke wire wheels, as the correct size <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyre</b> for the factory rims was 155-15, an odd-sized tyre at the time only available from Michelin at considerable expense. Some original TR4 sales literature says the original radial size was 165-15. The much more common 185-15 radials were too wide to be fitted safely. As a result, many owners had new and wider rims fitted and their wheels re-laced.|$|E
50|$|A major {{technical}} {{change for}} 1991 was the introduction by Avon of <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres.</b> Compared {{to the previous}} crossply tyres, these could be more consistently manufactured, and made the cars more consistent aerodynamically, but gave the drivers less control at high slip angles.|$|R
50|$|Bar grips were {{replaced}} on light vehicles such as Land Rovers and Jeeps in the 1970s, although they remained on heavy trucks. This {{was due to}} the faster speeds likely for light vehicles and the bar grip's poor tarmac performance. Developments in tyres, particularly the development of <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres,</b> also permitted a multi-purpose tyre that performed well both on and off-road.|$|R
2500|$|The Falcon Sundowner Van, {{based on}} the Falcon 500 Van, was {{introduced}} in 1977. It included options from the Falcon GS Hardtop, such as comprehensive instrumentation, bonnet scoops, slotted sports road wheels, and driving lights, but with bodyside protection mouldings and van side glass deleted. Side and rear decals {{were included in the}} package, as was the [...] "sedan ride" [...] 500-kg (10-cwt) suspension package and ER70 H14 <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Jaguar factory {{claimed that}} fitting {{a set of}} Jaguar XJ12 saloon steel-braced <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres</b> to a V12 E-Type raised the top speed {{by as much as}} 8 mph. The {{production}} car was fitted with textile-braced radial ply tyres. This fact was reported by the editor of The Motor magazine in the long-term test of his E-type edition dated 4 August 1973, who ran a V12 fixed head for a while.|$|R

2500|$|The XC also {{introduced}} the country's first locally produced family sedans with a suspension designed around <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres.</b> Known as [...] "Touring Suspension" [...] (or 'Sports Handling Suspension'), it initially was standard on the Fairmont GXL sedan (optional on other sedans) {{until it was}} made standard equipment on all sedans and hardtops in the 1978 'XC½' facelift. For better handling on station wagons, owners could order the stiffer heavy duty suspension package as a no-cost option.|$|R
5000|$|Criticism of the {{handling}} of early examples in the UK led to the fitting as standard of <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres</b> on the larger-engined version {{in place of the}} more conventional (in the UK at that time) cross-ply tyres with which all versions were shod at the 1966 launch, and the retro-fitting of <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres</b> to early examples addressed the tendency of the rear wheels to slide uncontrollably in wet weather, justifying in the process Ford's investment in a new and relatively sophisticated rear suspension arrangement for the Mark IVs. [...] Even after that a contemporary nevertheless opined that the ride involved a certain amount of 'float', and reported that the nose-heavy handling called for a 'strong driver', a problem which the more expensive Zodiac and Executive versions mitigated through the fitting as a standard feature of power assisted steering. Cost constraints precluded adding power assisted steering for the Zephyr, but during its production run the steering ratio was lowered which reduced the strength needed to change direction by increasing the number of turns between locks from 5.5 to an even higher 6.4. [...] Another production modification for the 4-cylinder Zephyr involved redesigning the valve gear in order to eliminate the need on the early Mk IVs for frequent tappet adjustments.|$|R
25|$|In 1978, {{inspired}} by a dominating 1–2 finish for Falcon hardtops at the 1977 Hardie Ferodo 1000, Ford introduced the limited-edition Cobra, which used the last 400 hardtop coupé bodyshells. Based on the Falcon GS Hardtop model, each Cobra was individually numbered and featured highlights such as Globe 15-in alloy road wheels copied from Ferrari intended to aid brake disc cooling, ER70 H15 <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres,</b> comprehensive instrumentation, bonnet scoops, driving lights, dual exhaust, four-wheel disc brakes, and a distinctive white and blue colour scheme. The 5.8-l engines were installed in cars numbered 002 to 199 and No 351, and the 4.9-litre engines were installed in the rest (001, plus 200 to 400 except for no. 351).|$|R
5000|$|Loading access was by a {{vertical}} top-hinged rear tailgate {{with the bottom}} of the opening level with the floor, making it easy to load without stooping down. Sliding windows gave ventilation and a view out from the rear bench seat. The top part of the back seat squab folded forward forming a useful horizontal loading platform with a ribbed rubber surface, and [...] of capacity. To take the increased load, this was the first Hillman derivative to have <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres.</b> It also had uprated rear shock absorbers and rear springs were fitted along with a strengthened rear suspension. These gave the Husky more sporty handling that the standard Imp, and looked surprising when this tall vehicle went quickly round a corner with very little roll.|$|R
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of sugarcane harvested in the South African sugar industry is hauled by tractorltrailer units on gravel hardened roads. Queries from sugarcane growers prompted an investigation {{to determine whether the}} performance of a haulage unit would be affected if different tractor rear wheel <b>tyres</b> were used. <b>Radial-ply</b> <b>tyres</b> of 34 inches rim diameter, and cross-ply types of 30 inches and 34 inches rim diameter were tested on the same tractor. Road speed, loads, fuel consumption and wheelslip were measured over a 4, 3 km route divided into a series of gradients where the distances for each gradient were known. With the smaller diameter tyres the tractor rear wheels tended to slip more on the steeper gradients. The tests showed that when the three different tyres were used {{there were no significant differences}} in the performance of the haulage unit...|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} [...] {{was increased}} to [...] by engine modification. The crankshaft was changed, the inlet ports were lowered and the exhaust ports raised. The carburettor and ignition settings were modified. A Saab Sport exhaust system was fitted. The suspension was lowered, by removing one 'turn' from each coil spring and Koni shock absorbers and Pirelli Cinturato <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres</b> were fitted. The three-speed gearbox was swapped for a four-speed box (but the original speedometer {{was left in}} situ, with its three-speed markings). A Smith's tachometer was also fitted. The engine modifications were executed by Mike Langton and the blocks were initialled and numbered by him. A Porsche [...] "60" [...] badge was requisitioned for the boot lid motif, in order to denote the car's special status and upgraded power output. An Oleopress fire extinguisher was fitted.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1966 Triumph {{upgraded}} {{the engine}} to 1998 cc, {{in line with the}} new Triumph GT6 coupé, and relaunched the car as the Vitesse 2-Litre. Power was increased to , endowing the new car with a 0-60 mph time of just over 12 s, and lifting top speed to almost 100 mph. (The 2-Litre was advertised by Triumph as [...] "The Two Seater Beater"). The performance increase was welcome, but it highlighted the deficiencies of the rear suspension. Other detail modifications for the 2-litre, included a stronger clutch, all synchromesh gearbox, larger front brakes (still without a servo), and a stronger differential with a slightly higher 3.89:1 ratio. Wider & stronger 4.5-inch wheel rims were fitted, but <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres</b> were still optional, at extra cost. There was a satin silver anodised aluminium-alloy cowling above the new reversing light, and badges {{on the side of the}} bonnet and in the centre of the grille read 2 litre.Inside the car, the seats were greatly improved, with softer (more plush) covering and a better back-rest shape which slightly improved rear-seat knee-room. A new leather-covered three-spoke steering wheel was also added.|$|R
40|$|The Institute for Road Safety Research SWOV {{carried out}} an {{inspection}} of the tyres of approximately 6000 cars in the Netherlands during November 1976 {{in order to measure}} their tread-depths. The sample was taken at the parking lots of roadside restaurants, motels, and modern shopping centres and showed a slight bias in favour of newer cars. By weighting the sample a representative picture was obtained for all cars used on the roads. The weighting was carried out using data from the monthly car survey of the central bureau of statistics in the Netherlands. The percentage of cars with smooth tread tyres was much smaller than obtained by other inspections of select samples. Only 1. 3 per cent of the cars had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1 mm (the legal minimum); a further 4. 9 per cent had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of 1 to 1. 6 mm. These percentages were slightly lower than the results which the SWOV obtained in 1974 during a comparable inspection. There are indications that the situation in 1979 hardly differs from that in 1976. Although the percentage of smooth tread tyres is small, the annual number of fatal and injury accidents in the Netherlands would decline by about 500 if all tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1. 6 mm were to be replaced. The SWOV emphasizes that an insufficient tread-depth is not the only tyre aspect which threatens the safety of car occupants. Other tyre characteristics which can {{have a negative effect on}} road safety are: low tyre pressure, dried-out tyres, holes and tears, irregular wear, and combining diagonal-ply and <b>radial-ply</b> <b>tyres</b> on the same car...|$|R
