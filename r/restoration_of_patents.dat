Moreover, the Court has ordered divestiture of unlawfully acquired property in antitrust cases.

In maintaining long-term patency, improving the number of outflow vessels could be of utmost importance. To compare the efficiency of both thrombolysis and primary surgical revascularization and to study the effect of thrombolysis on the number <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> outflow vessels, a prospective nonrandomized study was performed. Between February 2002 and August 2003, 54 patients with 56 occluded bypasses were included. Thirty bypasses were treated with thrombolysis, 26 primarily with surgery. Thrombolysis was successful in 80 % <b>of</b> cases, with <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> patency of the bypass but also with doubling of the amount <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> outflow vessels; surgery was successful in 85. 71 % of cases. However, in only 60 % of the successfully lysed bypasses no adjunctive major surgery was needed. Amputation-free survival was 87. 5 % 1 year after surgery and 82. 6 % 1 year after thrombolysis.

40|$|Innovation {{has become}} the {{dominant}} economic idea of our time and {{has resulted in a}} proliferation of innovation-oriented rhetoric, and policies. There is a great need to understand and harness innovation, but it has proven to be as difficult to measure as it is to define. At present, the quest to understand innovation hinges on finding reliable ways to identify and measure it, the most promising of which is the analysis <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> information. Patents have been increasingly used by economists to track inventiveness, the transmission of knowledge, and their economic impact. However, it is evident that the maiority <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> have little or no economic potential, and so merely observing the number <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> provides little insight on innovation. It has become important, therefore, to develop reliable methods for measuring the true economic potential <b>of</b> <b>patents.</b> <b>Of</b> all the solutions proposed, the analysis <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> citations is the most promising. This study examines the relationship between patent citations and the private economic value <b>of</b> <b>patents,</b> and makes both theoretical and empirical contributions. (cont.) First, the previous literature is reviewed to further extend and clarify the theory of the economic meaning <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> citations. Second, a typology <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> value is proposed to contextualize the relevance of the theory under different appropriation regimes. Finally, this study tests the economic meaning of citations using a new dataset where the licensing value of a group <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> is observed directly.
