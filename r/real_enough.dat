In January 2013, it was reported that a film crew led by Shane Black would begin location scouting in Hyderabad, India and Bengaluru, India between January 20 and 24. Also in January, Cheadle confirmed that reshooting was taking place in Manhattan Beach. Shooting also took place on the week of January 23, 2013 at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. A major part of the content filmed in the reshoots regarded the Mandarin, with Drew Pearce saying that in early cuts, the character [...] "didn't feel <b>real</b> <b>enough</b> — there wasn't a sense of him being [...] the real world, mostly because he was just looking down a lens and threatening the world."

[...] In the first place Flower was not an aristocrat: his family were Puritan in origin, and {{his father was a}} brewer: they were middle-class. Flower's knighthood was awarded for merit, not inherited as a baronetcy. Secondly, figures of authority in that age tended to be aloof by present-day standards, and were generally autocratic in manner. Of course his wife had a carriage!

50|$|The RSL {{faithful}} were thrilled, {{but from}} that point on, the season was mostly frustration and disappointment.
