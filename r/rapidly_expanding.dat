5|$|Despite being {{extremely}} dense at this time—far denser than {{is usually}} required {{to form a}} black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This {{may be explained by}} considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and do not apply to <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> space such as the Big Bang.|$|E

This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which can last {{for up to two}} centuries. The wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10,000years.|$|E

5|$|The {{boom in the}} oil {{industry}} also helped promote other industries {{in other areas of the}} state. Lumber production thrived as demand climbed for construction of railroads, refineries, and oil derricks, and, in 1907, Texas was the third largest lumber producer in the United States. Growing cities required many new homes and buildings, thus benefiting the construction industry. Agriculture and ranching grew stronger as the <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> population created more demand for their produce.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{experience}} in the militia, service with the 22nd Massachusetts, and chairmanship of the Military Affairs Committee provided him with more practical military knowledge and training than any other Senator. He made use of this experience throughout the war to frame, explain, defend and advocate for legislation on military matters, including enlistment of soldiers and sailors, and organizing and supplying the <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> Union Army and Union Navy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{industry}} was <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E

5|$|During the post-Civil War {{construction}} of the extended Richmond and Danville Railroad System in 1865, railroad stockholders Thomas Garner and Larkin Smith purchased land around the railroad's right-of-way and began developing the city of Buford. The city was named after Algernon Sidney Buford, who {{was president of the}} Atlanta and Richmond Air-Line Railway during the railroad's construction. The town began <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> around the railway after its completion in 1871, and it was incorporated as the Town of Buford on August 24, 1872, and renamed the City of Buford in 1896.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne's growth made it {{necessary}} {{to find a new}} water supply. Before the introduction of piped water the town's inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame. Industrial processes had polluted the river however, and the wells could not sustain a <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> population. From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply. Today, waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.|$|E

5|$|Production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin {{was driven}} by the forethought and {{determination}} of Ernest Hives, who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with Air Ministry and local authority officials. Hives was an advocate of shadow factories, and, sensing the imminent outbreak of war, pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient numbers for the <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> Royal Air Force. Despite the importance of uninterrupted production, several factories were affected by industrial action. By {{the end of its}} production run in 1950, 168,176 Merlin engines had been built; over 112,000 in Britain and more than 55,000 under licence in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The 1850s was {{a period}} of {{transition}} for the ice trade. The industry was already quite large: in 1855 around $6–7 million ($118–138 million in 2010 terms) was invested in the industry in the U.S. and an estimated two million tons (two billion kg) of ice was kept in storage at any one time in warehouses across the nation. Over the coming decade, however, the focus of the growing trade shifted away from relying upon the international export market in favour of supplying first the growing, eastern cities of the US, and then the rest of the <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> country.|$|E
5|$|World wind {{generation}} capacity {{more than}} quadrupled between 2000 and 2006, doubling about every three years.

In 1997 installed capacity in Germany surpassed the U.S. and led until once again overtaken by the U.S. in 2008. China has been <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> its wind installations in the late 2000s and passed the U.S. in 2010 {{to become the world}} leader.

5|$|Academic {{standards}} and enrollment numbers at the Baltimore City College (B.C.C.) after reaching {{a high of}} near 4,000 boys by the mid-1960s went {{through a period of}} decline first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, with the rapid opening of newer additional high schools both in the outreaches of the city along with the <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> suburbs in surrounding Baltimore County. Two in the city system were Northwestern in 1965 and Northern in the following year. Three high schools were completed and opened all at one time in September 1971, with Southwestern, Walbrook and a massive huge complex nearby to City in Clifton Park on the bed of the old reservoir off Harford Road, Lake Clifton. The 'A' and 'B' courses were slowly dying out and unfortunately discontinued by 1973, and a single academic track was offered.|$|E
5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} with Clarke, Billingham {{still could not}} get support for Little Athletics from VAAA; instead, they {{suggested}} he drop the junior competition {{and focus on the}} <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> senior one. One of the delegates, Jack Frewin, encouraged him to push through with his idea, so he published a notice in the Geelong Advertiser announcing that he needed to start a formation of Little Athletics clubs. There was a meeting of interested parents, and Billingham told them that he thought an organisation should be set up based on his experience from the seniors competitions but he need some parents to help him. On 27 November 1965, six clubs were formed. They were run by parents with Billingham as an overall manager. By the end of the 1965/66 season, more than 200 boys and girls were competing regularly across nine clubs, and more than 500 had tried out at least once. The first Geelong championships were held in March 1966 over the long weekend.|$|E

5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral {{for the first three}} years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana was used to test Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use an analog computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, Scotland's <b>rapidly</b> <b>expanding</b> economy and {{population}} resulted in the laying out of numerous new towns and remodelled settlements, resulting in a need for new churches to support the local residents. These included St Andrew's and St George's West Church, George Street, in the New Town of Edinburgh, designed by Andrew Frazer (1782–87), followed in the tradition of Gibbs, with an oval plan, tetrastyle Corinthian portico and a tall steeple. The builder, Alexander Stevens, probably also designed the steeple of St Cuthbert's Church (1789–90). At Fochabers, from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a grid plan, with a central square focused on Bellie Church (1795–97), still following in the tradition of Gibbs, with a tetrastyle portico and steeple.|$|E
