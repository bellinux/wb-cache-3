5|$|Because it {{was used}} as a water supply for agriculture, most of the channel {{remained}} in water, although bridges were lowered. Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working towards its restoration, and two stretches are navigable to small vessels. Full restoration will require a new route where the canal joins the Trent, as <b>road</b> <b>building</b> has effectively severed the original route.|$|E
5|$|Covert operations, however, {{were another}} matter. One {{result of the}} {{increasing}} PAVN <b>road</b> <b>building</b> effort in Cambodia was that the U.S. also upped the ante against the trail system in Laos by launching the first B-52 Stratofortress strike against the logistical system on 12 December 1965. In April 1967 the U.S. headquarters in Saigon finally received authorization to launch Daniel Boone, an intelligence gathering operation that conducted by the highly secret Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group or SOG.|$|E

5|$|The Roads for Prosperity {{white paper}} {{published}} in 1989 detailed a major {{expansion of the}} <b>road</b> <b>building</b> programme and included plans for the M12 Motorway between London and Chelmsford, {{as well as many}} other road schemes. Although Harry Cohen, MP for Leyton and Wanstead suggested in May 1989 that the government should scrap the scheme, a public enquiry was held for the scheme in November.|$|E
5|$|The road {{had been}} {{proposed}} since the 1960s, {{as part of}} the London Ringways, and was an important link between central London and the Docklands to East Anglia. However, road protests elsewhere had become increasingly visible, and urban <b>road</b> <b>building</b> had fallen out of favour with the public. Local Member of Parliament Harry Cohen had been a vocal opponent of this scheme.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was first}} opened around 1760 {{by a local}} farmer to obtain stone for <b>road</b> <b>building.</b> The site was {{excavated}} by John Skinner and Richard Hoare in 1816-17, who gained the entry through the hole which was made previously. The excavation revealed the bones (some burned) of several individuals. The mound was restored in 1858 by Thomas Joliffe.

5|$|Townships {{were given}} {{authority}} to construct roads {{under the supervision}} of county commissioners in 1817. This supervision was difficult since in one case, one county covered all of the Upper Peninsula and several of today's counties in the Lower Peninsula. Direct supervision over construction was granted to the townships in 1827, and federal involvement in <b>road</b> <b>building</b> ended with the 1837 grant of statehood.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, in {{response}} to a major new <b>road</b> <b>building</b> programme and expansion of aviation, a delegation of road protest veterans visited the Department for Transport to warn of renewed direct action {{in response}}, delivering a D-lock {{as a symbol of the}} past protests. One such protestor, Rebecca Lush Blum went on to found Road Block to support road protesters and challenge the government. In 2007, Road Block became a project within the Campaign for Better Transport. The M11 Link road protests inspired the launch of Undercurrents the video activism organisation. Training activists to film the protests they released - a 40minute documentary about the M11 link road campaign.|$|E
5|$|Significant Roman finds include {{parts of}} shops and houses {{that would have}} fronted onto Ermine Street, down which Roman armies marched {{to and from the}} Legionary Fortress at Lincoln. The city of Lincoln was very {{important}} at that time, probably the capital of the late Roman Province of Flavia Caesariensis. Evidence suggests that Navenby was a significant staging point along Ermine Street. The Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village, and a possible Romano-British temple and burial sites have been unearthed in the area. A 2009 archaeological dig uncovering a <b>road,</b> <b>building</b> foundations and Roman graves along with pottery and coins, showed Navenby to be a Roman Service Station.|$|E

5|$|The A1 route was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. Through the inner boroughs of the City, Islington, and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets; {{when it reaches}} {{what is now the}} outer London borough of Barnet, some stretches of purpose-built new roads were built, and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways. In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with wear and tear on the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern <b>road</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
5|$|The AdelaideMannum {{pipeline}} {{crosses the}} park and the Anstey Hill water filtration plant lies on its southern boundary; together they supply 20% of Adelaide's reticulated water. Significant historical uses of the area are preserved as ruins and highlighted with interpretive signs. The ruins of Newman's Nursery are {{all that remains of}} what was once the largest plant nursery in the Southern Hemisphere. Ellis Cottage is one of the earliest homes in the area, and the Rumps Bakery building housed the first bakery in Tea Tree Gully. Quarries supplied stone for significant Victorian buildings in Adelaide and aggregate for <b>road</b> <b>building.</b> Klopper's quarries in the southwest hosted plays for the Festival of the Arts in 1980 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{early works}} of Tevaram by the 7th-century poets Appar and Tirugnanasambandar mention {{the town had}} {{fortified}} walls, busy <b>road</b> <b>building</b> and a busy port. The inscriptions from the Kayarohanswami temple indicate the construction was initiated {{during the reign of}} the Pallava king, Narasimha Pallava II (691–729 CE). A Buddhist pagoda was built under Chinese influence by the Pallava king and the town was frequented by Buddhist travelers. Thirumangai Azhwar, the 9th century vaishnavite saint poet, is believed to have stolen the golden Buddha statue to fund the Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam; the authenticity of the theory is questionable.|$|E

Another critically endangered species is the Okinawa woodpecker from Japan, with a single declining population {{of a few hundred}} birds.

5|$|Evanton has {{a number}} of public {{facilities}} including the Diamond Jubilee Hall, Chapel <b>Road,</b> <b>building</b> work started in December 1897, Major Randle Jackson of Swordale House gave 50% of the building costs and the people of Evanton (Parish of Kiltearn) raised the rest. The hall opened on 5 November 1898 with a grand concert over 500 people from the village attending. Diamond Jubilee Hall transferred from Highland Council to the Community on Thursday 29 September 2011. Evanton Sports Centre (opposite Kiltearn Primary School) is the other public facilies in the village which cateres for various sporting activities badminton, basketball, football and tennis. Evanton also has a good sized park at Teandallon. In recent years a local group of parents and young people has worked with Highland Council and various funding bodies to install a multisport area, a BMX track and a Half-Pipe ramp, a new playpark for toddlers was added in 2007 by EYE. In 2008 Highland Council upgraded the original park which was installed in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the Government of Canada {{enacted the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which {{provided}} {{public works projects}} in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved <b>road</b> <b>building</b> in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included {{construction of a new}} registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.|$|E

5|$|Some {{commercial}} {{traffic on the}} waterways continued despite the railway competition, with 44,034 tons generating £733 of tolls in 1888, which enabled the Commissioners to show a profit of £216. Traffic had fallen slightly to 42,640 tons in 1898, but by 1905 was down to 12,770 tons, and the Commissioners showed a loss of £702 that year. An Alderman giving evidence to the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways in 1905 pointed out {{that one of the}} railway companies had been paying to collect traffic in hay and straw, although this practice ceased when it became public knowledge. The condition of the Nene and the Wisbech Canal declined, which discouraged navigation, but some trade in agricultural produce, coal, bricks and <b>road</b> <b>building</b> materials continued. Coal was delivered by barge from Outwell Depot to around 40 pumping stations.|$|E
5|$|The A1 is {{the most}} recent {{in a series of}} routes north out of London to York and beyond. It was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme, comprising existing roads and streets, mostly historic, and later using stretches of purpose-built new roads in what is now the outer London borough of Barnet. The Archway Road section was built by Thomas Telford using Roman cement and gravel, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern <b>road</b> <b>building.</b> The route closely follows the historic route of the Great North Road, though from 1954 it has diverted round the congested suburbs of Finchley and High Barnet along modern roads constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The A354 road {{connects the}} town to the A35 trunk road in Dorchester, and terminates at Easton on the Isle of Portland.

The B3157 road runs west from Weymouth to the south of Bridport where it terminates and connects to the A35. In the 1980s the town centre was {{bypassed}} by the A354 to Portland, but the government's <b>road</b> <b>building</b> policy changed before a proposed relief road could be completed. Before completion of the relief road, the A354 followed its original route through Upwey and Broadwey, where traffic problems were common at peak tourist times, particularly on event days such as the carnival.|$|E
