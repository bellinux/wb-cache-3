5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970.

He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional.

Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band which affected his confidence.|$|E
