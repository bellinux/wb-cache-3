LNC funerals were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers, with the exception that a railway carriage was used in place of a hearse. On being commissioned to provide a funeral, invitations would be sent out either by the deceased's family or from the LNC offices. These letters specified the waiting room to be used, the time of the train to Brookwood, and the expected <b>return</b> <b>time</b> to London. If the funeral was to be held in London, a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service, and then on to the London railway terminus; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E

25|$|On 6 September 1968, Ralph Ponte, one {{of three}} {{civilian}} pilots to hold a rating for the F-15, was flying a series of routine Phos-Chek drops on a fire raging near Hollister, California. In {{an effort to reduce}} his <b>return</b> <b>time</b> Ponte opted to reload at a small airfield nearer the fire. The runway was shorter than the one in Fresno, and despite Ponte reducing his load, hot air from the nearby fire reduced the surrounding air pressure and rendered the aircraft overweight. Even at full power the Reporter had not rotated after clearing the 3,500ft (1,067m) marker, and Ponte quickly decided to abort his takeoff. He made every effort to control the hurtling craft, but the Reporter careened off the runway and through a vegetable patch, before striking an embankment which tore off the landing gear. The aircraft then slid sideways, broke up, and caught fire. Ponte scrambled through the shattered canopy unhurt, while a firefighting TBM Avenger dropped its load of Phos-Chek on the plane's two engines, possibly saving Ponte's life. The F-15, though intact, was deemed too badly damaged to rebuild, and was soon scrapped, bringing an end to the career of one of Northrop's most successful designs.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike most {{subduction}} zones worldwide, no oceanic trench {{is present}} along the continental margin in Cascadia. Instead, terranes and the accretionary wedge have been lifted up {{to form a}} series of coast ranges and exotic mountains. A high rate of sedimentation from the outflow {{of the three major}} rivers (Fraser River, Columbia River, and Klamath River) which cross the Cascade Range contributes to further obscuring the presence of a trench. However, in common with most other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed, similar to a giant spring. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes such as the magnitude-9 Cascadia earthquake of 1700. Geological evidence indicates that great earthquakes may have occurred at least seven times in the last 3,500 years, suggesting a <b>return</b> <b>time</b> of 400 to 600 years. Also, evidence of accompanying tsunamis with every earthquake is seen, as the prime reason these earthquakes are known is through [...] "scars" [...] the tsunami left on the coast, and through Japanese records (tsunami waves can travel across the Pacific).|$|E

2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously <b>return</b> <b>time</b> and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not".
