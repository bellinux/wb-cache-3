30|$|IgAN, first {{described}} by Berger in 1969 [3], {{is one of}} the most common primary glomerulopathies worldwide [4]. The disease is diagnosed by renal biopsy using histopathologic and immunoflourescence tests. The hallmark of IgAN is macroscopic hematuria that usually occurs with or immediately after an upper airway infection [5]. Other characteristic manifestations are: painless episodic hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and renal impairment. IgA nephropathy was previously thought to be a benign disease with a 10 -year renal survival rate greater than 80 [*]%, but emerging data show a different scenario. Most patients develop a progressive decline in renal function, and about 40 [*]% present end-stage renal failure [6]. Although IgAN is clinically limited to the kidneys in most cases, there are associations with other conditions, particularly with immune and inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, <b>Reiter</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Behcet's disease, celiac disease, alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease, hepatic schistosomiasis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and dermatitis herpetiformis [7].|$|E

Eight cases were associated to gastrointestinal infection, eight cases to previous urethritis, and four cases presented no established preceding infection. HLA-B* 27 alleles were typed by polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA hybridized with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (HLA-B* 2701 to HLA-B* 2721). They were compared to a group of 108 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 40 with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy (uSpA) and 111 healthy controls. Among the 20 patients, 17 were HLA-B* 27 positive (85 %). Two HLA-B* 27 alleles were observed: HLA-B* 2705 (65 %) and HLA-B* 2702 (35 %). In the other spondyloarthropathies, the observed alleles were HLA-B* 2705 (90 % in AS and 92. 5 % in uSpA), HLA-B* 2702 (8 % in AS and 5 % in uSpA), HLA-B* 2704 (1 % in AS and 2. 5 % in uSpA) and HLA-B* 2713 (1 % in AS).

In the past, the SPAs were considered variants of rheumatoid arthritis, but {{it is now clear}} that they differ from the latter disease in terms of the pattern of articular and extra-articular involvement, their lack of association with seropositivity for rheumatoid factor, and their strong association with sacro-iliac joint bacino= pelvis sacro-iliac joint sacro-iliac joint sacro-iliac joint sacro-iliac joint sacro-iliac joint the class I human leukocyte antigen B 27. sacro-iliac joint bacino= pelvis sacro-iliac joint sacro-iliac joint sacro-iliac joint sacro-iliac joint sacro-iliac joint Their general characteristics are axial involvement; enthesitis; peripheral arthritis involving the lower limbs, which is usually asymmetric; dactylitis; extra-articular manifestations involving the skin, eyes, bowel, and genitals.

40|$|Aim. To {{analyze the}} {{efficacy}} of modified pupillary massage technique using cycloplegic agent Appamide Plus {{in the treatment of}} anterior uveitis. Patients and methods. 45 patients (25 men and 20 women) aged 21 ‑ 69 with endogenous uveitis (51 eyes) were enrolled in the study. Etiology of uveitis was identified in 57. 7 % of cases: herpes simplex virus (22. 2 %); systemic disorders — rheumatoid arthritis, <b>Reiter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Bechterew’s disease, psoriasis (17. 7 %); local infection — purulent periodontitis or sinusitis (11 %). Patients were divided into two groups. Group I received basic therapy in combination with traditional pupillary massage. Group II received basic therapy in combination with modified pupillary massage using Appamide Plus (muscarinic receptor antagonist and alpha adrenergic agonist) and plasma exchange with cell mass ozonation. Results. Inflammation of the uveal tract was prevented in all patients. In group I (traditional pupil massage), posterior synechiae persisted in 26 % of cases. In group II (pupil massage using Appamide Plus), anterior chamber humor was transparent, posterior synechiae were broken, normal pupillary response was re-established. Additionally, inflammatory exudate in the anterior chamber and endothelial precipitates resolved by 3. 3 days earlier than in group I (р < 0. 05). Visual outcomes were also better in Appamide Plus group. T cell-mediated immunity study revealed initial CD 3 + cell and T cell subpopulation deficiency. Relative and absolute references of T cells and their subpopulations tended to decrease even when uveitis signs reduced. Conclusions. T cell-mediated immunity depression is probably due to pharmacotherapy. Appamide Plus eye drops are highly effective for therapeutic mydriasis and pupillary massage in the course of anterior uveitis treatment to prevent synechiae formation in enlarged or small pupil. </p...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} dermal and transdermal delivery of doxycycline from vehicles containing Migliol 840 (M 840) and ethanol. Delivery of the drug via the skin would provide a useful alternative to oral delivery, which has many undesirable side-effects, such as oesophageal ulceration and disturbance of the normal gut flora. Potential applications include malaria prophylaxis, and the treatment of acne vulgaris, Lyme disease and <b>Reiter</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Experiments were performed to determine the permeation of doxycycline across excised full-thickness human skin and heat-separated epidermal membranes from saturated solutions in ethanol, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 ethanol/M 840. Unusual burst behaviour was observed using an ethanol vehicle, possibly {{as a result of}} the formation of dimers at saturation. Doxycycline permeated to a higher degree from ethanolic vehicles when M 840 is present, suggesting that M 840 is capable of enhancing the permeation of doxycycline. The flux across full-thickness skin was highest from a 2 : 1 ethanol:M 840 vehicle (2. 41 microg cm(- 2) h(- 1)), sufficient to deliver 282 microg l(- 1) using an area of application of 30 cm(2). The data also produced unexpected results in that permeability across heat separated skin was an order of magnitude greater than across full-thickness skin (28. 75 microg cm(- 2) h(- 1) for the 2 : 1 ethanol:M 840 vehicle). Depth profiling indicated that the drug distributed quite evenly throughout the epidermis. The mean amount of doxycycline recovered from the epidermis at the end of a permeation experiment was 458. 4 microg ml(- 1). This was far higher than the volume of extractable lipid present in the same unit area, approximately 52. 3 microg ml(- 1) and indicated that a large proportion of the drug must have been located within the proteinaceous domain. The data therefore suggest (1) significant amounts of doxycycline can be administered into and across the skin; (2) M 840 is a potentially useful enhancing vehicle; and (3) the transcellular route was of significance...|$|E

The {{ratio of the}} responsiveness of lymphocytes cultured {{in the presence of}} foetal calf serum (FCS), compared to those incubated in the Reiter's synovial fluid, was used as a measure of the depression induced by the Reiter's synovial fluid. The mean ratio for eight normals stimulated with PHA was 0 - 70 (range 0 - 35 - 0 - 96), while for eight patients with <b>Reiter's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> it was 0 - 13 (range 0 - 07 - 0 - 19). Similar studies done with concanavalin A (con A) showed no difference between lymphocytes from normals (0 - 73) or patients with <b>Reiter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (0 - 67). Chromatography of the Reiter's synovial fluid on a Sepharose 4 -B column resulted in the separation of three major fractions, one of which exhibited the inhibitory activity. When this active fraction was absorbed with Reiter's lymphocytes, a loss of the inhibitory activity of the fraction was seen. A similar absorption with normal lymphocytes had no effect.
