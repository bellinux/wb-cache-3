5000|$|... 110 is a cartridge-based film format used {{in still}} photography. It was {{introduced}} by Kodak in 1972. 110 is essentially a miniaturised version of Kodak's earlier 126 film format. Each frame is 13 x 17 mm, with one <b>registration</b> <b>hole.</b> There were 24 photographs per cartridge with occasionally having an extra amount of film for another image due to production variations.|$|E
5000|$|Like the 120 format, {{there is}} a {{continuous}} backing paper, and the frame number is visible through a small window {{at the rear of}} the cartridge. Cameras for this type of film are equipped with a large rectangular window in the back door, through which is visible not only the frame number, but also a portion of the label showing the film type and speed. The cartridge has a captive take-up spool, but no supply spool: the film and backing paper are simply coiled tightly and placed in the supply end of the cartridge. The positioning of the image is fixed by the cartridge. The film is 35 mm wide, but unlike 135 film, it is unperforated, except for one <b>registration</b> <b>hole</b> per image, similar to the earlier 828 film. The camera is equipped with a sensing pin which falls into this hole when the film is fully advanced to the next frame, at which point the winding knob or lever is locked, so as to prevent winding past the pre-exposed frame lines.|$|E

5000|$|When {{an entire}} {{sequence}} has {{been transferred to}} cels, the photography process begins. Each cel involved in a frame of a sequence is laid {{on top of each}} other, with the background {{at the bottom of the}} stack. A piece of glass is lowered onto the artwork in order to flatten any irregularities, and the composite image is then photographed by a special animation camera, also called rostrum camera. The cels are removed, and the process repeats for the next frame until each frame in the sequence has been photographed. Each cel has <b>registration</b> <b>holes,</b> small holes along the top or bottom edge of the cel, which allow the cel to be placed on corresponding peg bars before the camera to ensure that each cel aligns with the one before it; if the cels are not aligned in such a manner, the animation, when played at full speed, will appear [...] "jittery." [...] Sometimes, frames may need to be photographed more than once, in order to implement superimpositions and other camera effects. Pans are created by either moving the cels or backgrounds one step at a time over a succession of frames (the camera does not pan; it only zooms in and out).|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a lock pin. The lock block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in <b>registration</b> with a <b>hole</b> in the free end of the switch handle. A lock tab on the lock block serves to align and register the respective holes on the lock block and switch handle. A lock pin is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the lock block to the switch handle. Once the lock block and the switch handle are connected, {{the position of the}} switch handle is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the lock pin is installed, an apertured-end portion of the lock pin is in <b>registration</b> with another <b>hole</b> on the lock block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the lock pin from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|R
50|$|The Excellon {{format is}} also used to {{transfer}} design information from CAD to CAM. It is not adequate for that task: essential information such as plating and drill span is missing. Furthermore, the Excellon output in CAD systems is often poorly implemented, resulting in poor <b>registration</b> between drill <b>holes</b> and copper layers and other problems. For data exchange between CAD/CAM systems it is more practical to describe the drill data in Gerber format as the quality of the Gerber file output software is usually better and Gerber supports attributes to transfer meta-information such as which are the via holes.|$|R
