50|$|The {{prestige}} of the Eagle Farm Racecourse as the premier racecourse of Queensland attracted a variety of architects to design for the Queensland Turf Club (QTC, Brisbane Racing Club since 2009), and the place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics {{of the work of}} a number of prominent Queensland architects from different decades, including JH Buckeridge, Hunter and Corrie, Hall and Dods, GHM Addison, Chambers and Powell, Atkinson and McLay, Hall and Prentice, Hall and Cook, and Martin Conrad. The buildings designed and extended by the various architects include the well composed Paddock Stand which is characterised by a large galvanised iron vaulted roof with a gabled <b>ridge</b> <b>ventilator.</b> The stand comprises ornate cast iron posts and handrails as well as decorative timber battening. The St Leger Stand, is also a characteristic cast iron and timber building with a galvanised iron gable roof and ornate cast iron handrails.|$|E
5000|$|To {{the west}} of the St Leger Stand are the Totalisator (or Tote) Building and the Paddock Stand. The Tote Building (1913, {{extended}} 1917) [...] has a long, narrow plan running north to south between the stands, with an L-shaped extension on the southern end (1928). An additional part-storey, built for the Hodsdon's tote system in the 1950s, now houses the Julius Totalisator apparatus it replaced. The Paddock Stand is similar in construction to the St Leger Stand; however, it is characterised by a large galvanised iron vaulted roof with a gabled <b>ridge</b> <b>ventilator</b> that extends its entire length. It comprises ornate cast iron posts and handrails as well as decorative timber battening to the eastern end of the vaulted roof. The base of the stand accommodates a range of public and private spaces. This stand was extended to the west in the 1920s and the fabric and form of the addition are clearly discernible from the original structure.|$|E
5|$|The station {{consists}} of a parallel boiler house and turbine hall, which creates a large double-gabled building. It is of steel frame construction with brick cladding. Other features include round-headed openings and <b>ridge</b> <b>ventilators.</b> This building originally housed the station's boilers and turbo generators. Constructed alongside the station was a brick built chimney, to remove gasses from the boilers. The station was first brick built power station in North East England, with corrugated iron being the usual material used prior to this.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} simple and efficient way for the conditioning of greenhouse internal microclimate; it may contribute to decrease levels of energy consumption and CO 2 emission and it may reveal. if adequately managed, as a very useful tool for the control of temperature. relative humidity and CO 2 concentration of inside air. One of its limitations is the spatial distribution of air temperature and humidity, strictly linked to outside conditions, particularly wind speed and direction. In order to contribute to the analysis of conditions for an optimal control of natural ventilation, experimental tests were carried out in a vaulted steel-constructed greenhouse, where soilless Lily flower plants were cultivated, naturally ventilated through two sidewall <b>ventilators</b> and/or two <b>ridge</b> <b>ventilators.</b> The measurements of the airflow inside the greenhouse were carried out by means of a three-dimensional sonic anemometer, detecting both the spatial components of the air velocity and the air temperature in several different internal points inside the greenhouse. For each position three different opening strategies were analysed, i. e. : i) sidewall <b>ventilators</b> only; ii) <b>ridge</b> <b>ventilators</b> only and iii) both sidewall and <b>ridge</b> <b>ventilators</b> opened. Wind direction and velocity, together with outside air temperature, were also measured, and data were collected and analysed in order to calculate the parameters describing the turbulence. Moreover, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied on the set of measured data in order to evaluate the power spectra of the air velocity vector components for the different configurations. From the obtained results it was possible to examine the influence of external wind on the distribution of air velocity components of internal airspace, so contributing to the knowledge of the transient response of the greenhouse to the variation of external wind; moreover, the airflow inside the greenhouse and the turbulence parameters gave indications useful for a more specific implementation in an algorithm suitable for the automated control of the natural ventilation system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{evaluation}} of supplementary natural ventilation in curtain-sided housing using ridge ventilation was conducted. A well-insulated broiler house was constructed and {{divided into two}} halves, one with a continuous 1. 2 -m wide open ridge. Four broiler trials were conducted over three summers. Neither the thermal environment nor the bird performance was affected signifi-cantly by the supplemental ventilation provided by the open ridge. Modern poultry houses with well-insulated roofs result in minimal temperature differentials, thus potentially providing a lower stack ventilation rate.

50|$|The brick {{magazine}} {{was used as}} a hall by the local community between the wars, and a photograph, possibly from this period or post World War II, shows a timber skillion extension to {{the east side of the}} magazine building. At this time the <b>ridge</b> <b>ventilator,</b> lightning rods and copper earthing straps were still in place. The lightening rod assembly reportedly survived on a local farm for some time, and consisted of a copper cylinder about 4 inches in diameter, which had holes for three copper spikes (1/2 inch thick by 2 feet long, or 12.7mm by 609.6mm) to jut out at angles, so that the tips were 2 feet apart. Two 2 inch (50.8mm) copper straps at least ¼ inch (6.35mm) thick led down the sides of the building to be earthed. In the photograph double timber doors are shown in the west end of the magazine, and these may have existed before the building became a hall. These doors are not on the 1887 plans for the magazine. Lead sheeting from under the roofing iron (of either the two timber and iron magazines or the brick magazine) were recycled by locals for stump caps and guttering.|$|E
50|$|Holy Trinity Parish Hall is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its class. It is a substantial school room-cum-hall utilising Gothic stylistic elements popular in ecclesiastical buildings of the period, including the cruciform plan, <b>ridge</b> <b>ventilator</b> {{in the form of}} a small spire, lancet windows and joinery detailing. Holy Trinity parish was at its peak in the late 19th century and the parish hall, in its substantial scale and brick construction, reflects the comparative wealth of the parishioners, while restraint in the interior finishes and modest decorative detailing reflects the building's ecclesiastical function. The building is a good example of the ecclesiastical work of Brisbane Diocesan architect JH Buckeridge and has aesthetic significance generated by its design, materials and garden setting. Holy Trinity Parish Hall makes a significant contribution to the Holy Trinity Precinct in Fortitude Valley. This group {{is important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its class: a substantially intact, cohesive, late 19th century Queensland ecclesiastical precinct. The cohesion is due to the consistency in scale, forms, materials, use of Gothic design elements, quality of architectural design and location within a garden setting (including mature trees and retaining walls). The arrangement and inter-relationship of the buildings on the site {{is important in}} illustrating how the precinct functions.|$|E
50|$|The {{carriage}} shade {{is constructed}} of curved steel roof trusses supported on timber posts, and is sheeted with corrugated iron with a raised central <b>ridge</b> <b>ventilator.</b> The carriage shade has a corrugated iron valance along its southwest side, and a curved corrugated iron valance at either end. The structure currently covers the railway platform and single line of track, but originally a second line of track was also {{covered with a}} third line to the southwest of the structure. Every second post on the southwest side has been removed for access purposes, {{with the exception of}} the centre and end bays which have cross-bracing to stabilise the structure. There were originally highlight windows to the carriage shade, but these have also been removed. The railway platform has a concrete upstand, and originally was finished with hexagonal concrete tiles similar to the verandah, but these are no longer extant. The platform has been trenched in front of the signal box, which is situated on the southwest side of the station building fronting the former ticket and parcels office, creating a pit for control rods which has been covered with timber boarding. The signal box replaced the original free- standing structure which was located on the southwestern side of the carriage shade.|$|E
