The Ercan airport saw an important renovation in the 2010s that greatly increased its passenger traffic, it was used by 1.76 million passengers in the first seven months of 2014 alone. Non-stop flights are only available from multiple points in Turkey {{through a number of}} Turkish carriers. Direct scheduled and charter flights take place from other countries, but with mandatory stopovers in Turkey. 600 charter flights were scheduled for 2013.

25|$|The {{introduction}} of domesticated chicken illustrates the site’s importance for {{trade between the}} Indian Ocean and the southern interior as a possible <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> for the black-feathered variety of chicken resembling those of India. Thus, {{the inhabitants of the}} site made extensive use of their location along the southern Mozambican coast. The poor soil composition and inadequate rainfall only allowed variable agricultural output, causing the inhabitants to procure other means of sustenance. Chibuene inhabitants made use of domesticated animals from southern Africa and successful shark and turtle hunting practices from neighbors from the north in order to adequately exploit the resources of the particular region they inhabited with easy access to the coast and variable land for pasturage in addition to invaluable trade resources procured from the Indian Ocean trade network.|$|E

25|$|The maximal {{worldwide}} frequency for haplogroup T-M184 {{is observed}} among Somalis in the Dire Dawa area and Djibouti, where {{it accounts for}} approximately 82% of the Somali male lineages to 100% of the Somali Dir male lineages, respectively. Luis et al. (2004) suggest {{that the presence of}} T on the African continent may, like R1* representatives, point to an older introduction from Asia. The Levant rather than the Arabian Peninsula appears to have been the main <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> as the Egyptian and Turkish haplotypes are considerably older in age (13,700 BP and 9,000 BP, respectively) than those found in Oman (only 1,600 BP). According to the authors, the spotty modern distribution pattern of haplogroup T-M184 within Africa may therefore represent the traces of a more widespread early local presence of the clade. Later expansions of populations carrying the E1b1b, E1b1a, G and J NRY lineages may have overwhelmed the T-M184 clade-bearers in certain localities.|$|E
2500|$|Historically tenant farmers, as peasants or villeins, {{had been}} {{exploited}} and starting in 1875, successive governments enacted legislation to protect them. [...] This trend {{culminated in the}} Agricultural Holdings Act 1986, [...] which consolidated and built on a century-long trend in the law. [...] This Act was so onerous towards landlords that they were reluctant to let land. [...] It became so hard to obtain a tenancy that the farming industry supported reform, which was enacted in the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995. [...] Nowadays most new tenancies in England and Wales are Farm Business Tenancies under the 1995 Act, but the 1986 Act tenancies that are still in force may allow for succession, and can sometimes be passed down through up to two generations of tenant. [...] The most common <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into farming is to succeed to a holding, whether as owner or tenant, so a person's ability to farm is often determined by their family background rather than their skills or qualifications.|$|E

40|$|Kohl (surma) is a {{traditional}} eye cosmetic used in the Middle East, India, Pakistan, and parts of Africa that often contains high levels of lead (Pb), a developmental neurotoxicant. Many researchers have called for stricter governmental regulations of kohl trade and quality control and improved public education regarding its hazards and some governments have adopted import controls and educational campaigns to alert users to the hazards of using Pb-­-containing kohl. However, users remain unaware of the hazards of kohl usage, and some authorities minimize its potential danger. In this review, we summarize available data from the peer-­-reviewed literature on prevalence and attitudes regarding kohl use, Pb content of kohl samples from many sources, potential <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> Pb into the body from kohl, and epidemiologic evidence that kohl {{is a source of}} Pb exposure in infants and women. Chemical analyses show that kohl has a wide range of formulae, with some containing PbS as the principal ingredient and others based on carbon and often Pb-­-free. Ocular, dermal, or gastrointestinal <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> Pb into the body from kohl had been insufficiently studied to rule any of them out. The preponderance of epidemiologic evidence supports the conclusion that Pb-­-based kohl is associated with increased PbB in women who use kohl and their children...|$|R

30|$|Since {{secondary}} microplastics are generated when larger plastic materials fragment, sources of macroplastics and their <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> {{into the environment}} are considered in this section. It {{has been estimated that}} about 75 – 90  % of the plastic debris in the marine environment originates from land-based and about 10 – 25  % from ocean-based sources [25, 70]. General littering, dumping of plastic waste and loss from inappropriately managed landfill sites and during waste collection are assumed {{to be the most important}} <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> plastic materials into the environment. Windblown litter is also lost from recycling facilities [60, 70 – 72]. In this context, it should be noted that a large percentage of the produced plastics is used for packaging, i.e. for products with a short service life [1]. In industrialised countries, waste that is deposited in landfills is usually covered regularly with soil or a synthetic material, and the landfill is surrounded by a fence to prevent that debris is blown away. However, in developing regions this is often not the case [71 – 73]. In addition, large amounts of plastic debris can enter the marine environment during natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis and strong sea [18, 74, 75].|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: African-Caribbean {{patients}} have less desirable <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into the psychiatric services than {{other ethnic groups}} in Britain but this may {{not apply to the}} first contact with services. METHODS: Patients' pathways to care, type of admission or referral and sectioning details were recorded for all first contact patients presenting to south London psychiatric services over a 2 -year period. We also conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the Camberwell Register, comparing rates of compulsory admission between 'Whites' and 'African-Caribbeans' for first and readmissions, over a 20 -year period. RESULTS: Our first contact sample comprised 38 White, 38 African-Caribbean and 24 Asian patients with CATEGO defined broad schizophrenia. GP referral was found to be the most common mode of contact and {{there were no significant differences}} between the ethnic groups with regard to compulsory admission. Similarly, data from the Camberwell Register showed no significant difference in rates of compulsory admission between first admission White and African-Caribbean patients. However, when all readmissions were examined, African-Caribbeans were more likely to be admitted involuntarily. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that reports <b>of</b> less desirable <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> for African-Caribbean patients into the psychiatric service do not apply to their first admission but are likely to develop over time and repeated contact with the services...|$|R
