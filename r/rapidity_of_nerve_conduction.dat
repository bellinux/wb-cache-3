40|$|Myelin is {{essential}} for the <b>rapidity</b> <b>of</b> saltatory <b>nerve</b> <b>conduction,</b> and also provides trophic support for axons to prevent axonal degeneration. Two critical determinants of myelination are SOX 10 and EGR 2 / KROX 20. SOX 10 is required for specification of Schwann cells from neural crest, and is required at every stage of Schwann cell development. Egr 2 / Krox 20 expression is activated by axonal signals in myelinating Schwann cells, and is required for cell cycle arrest and myelin formation. To elucidate the integrated function of these two transcription factors during peripheral nerve myelination, we performed in vivo ChIP-Seq analysis <b>of</b> myelinating peripheral <b>nerve.</b> Integration <b>of</b> these binding data with loss-of-function array data identified a range of genes regulated by these factors. In addition, although SOX 10 itself regulates Egr 2 /Krox 20 expression, leading to coordinate activation of several major myelin genes by the two factors, there is a large subset of genes that are activated independent of EGR 2. Finally, the results identify a set of SOX 10 -dependent genes that are expressed in early Schwann cell development, but become subsequently repressed by EGR 2 /KROX 20...|$|R

40|$|SLOWING <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>conduction</b> in {{patients}} with the carpal tunnel syndrome was first reported by Simpson in 1956. When the median nerve was stimulated at the wrist and the muscle response recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis, {{it was found that}} the latency of the muscle action potential was significantly increased, the abnormality being reversed by surgical division of the flexor retinaculum. In the same year that Simpson published his investigation of motor latency, Dawson (1956) described a method of recording action potentials from the median and ulnar nerves at the wrist when the sensory fibres in the fingers were stimulated. Small ring electrodes were wrapped round the fingers to stimulate digital nerve fibres, and nerve action potentials were recorded by means of surface electrodes placed over the median or ulnar nerve trunks just above the wrist.

Multifocal motor neuropathy, for example, may clinically present as ALS. Detection of evidence of demyelination (conduction blocks) leads to the correct diagnosis and to proper treatment. <b>Nerve</b> <b>conduction</b> studies provide essential information on (1) the spatial pattern of neuropathy, (2) the pattern of abnormalities distinguishing between primarily axonal and demyelinating pathology, and (3) the severity of neuropathic damage.
