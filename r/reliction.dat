40|$|Test {{equipment}} is described {{that includes a}} system of three quartz indicators whereby three different pressures could be synchronized and simultaneously recorded on a single oscillogram. This equipment {{was used to test}} the <b>reliction</b> of waves at ends of valve spring, the dynamical stress of the valve spring for a single lift of the valve, and measurement of the curve of the cam tested. Other tests included simultaneous recording of the stress {{at both ends of the}} spring, spring oscillation during a single lift as a function of speed, computation of amplitude of oscillation for a single lift by harmonic analysis, effect of cam profile, the setting up of resonance, and forced spring oscillation with damping...|$|E
40|$|SummaryGiant clams {{are among}} the most {{spectacular}} but also the most endangered marine invertebrates. Their large size and easy accessibility has caused overfishing and collapse of the natural stocks in many places and local extinction in some of the species [1, 2]. The diversity of giant clams is extremely low because of <b>reliction</b> in this Tethyan group [3, 4]. The latest additions of living species date back almost two decades [5 – 7], fixing the number of extant Tridacna at seven species [3]. Here, we report the discovery of a new species of giant clam: Tridacna costata sp. nov. features characteristic shells with pronounced vertical folds, is genetically distinct, and shows an earlier and abbreviated reproduction than its Red Sea congeners. This species represents less than 1 % of the present stocks but up to > 80 % of the fossil shells. The decline in proportion and shell size (20 ×) indicates overharvesting [8] dating back to the early human occupation of the Red Sea > 125, 000 years ago [9]. This earliest depletion reported so far of a shallow-water megafaunal invertebrate has important ramifications for human dispersal out of Africa [10]. Its oversight in one of the best-investigated reef provinces [11 – 13] illustrates the dearth of knowledge on marine biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{will examine}} three established, {{or at least}} {{commonly}} claimed, rights of coastal (littoral) property owners in the United States: (1) the right to receive sediments seaward of the mean high-water line deposited by accretions and ownership of new land uncovered by <b>relictions,</b> (2) the right to exclusive use of their dry sand property, and (3) the right to build what they wish on their oceanfront lot. Each of these asserted “rights” at times butts heads with laws designed to preserve and protect the public’s right to enjoy the coast and the ocean, including the public trust doctrine, environmental statutes, and zoning regulations. Taking each of these property claims in turn, {{my goal is to}} see who, if anybody, is winning the battle between property owners and the general public for the use of littoral zones. Does the answer vary with location? What factors are giving the winner the upper hand? When these public and private rights are at odds, can the two be reconciled in a manner that respects the owner’s desires while concomitantly maintaining public utility, or is this a fruitless endeavor because the two are diametrically opposed? In what respects does the law need to be clarified to potentially obviate issues? Starting with “It’s All Mine,” I will explore how the phenomena of accretion, dereliction, and avulsion, both natural and artificial, affect the extent of an owner’s title to his or her coastal lot. I will also extensively discuss a fairly recent United States Supreme Court case, Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Department of Environmental Protection, that has important ramifications for determining the boundary of an owner’s littoral lot. Next, with “Stay Off,” I will examine how different states have found or created public access and use rights over private littoral property and dealt with issues arising from owners’ assertions of exclusivity. Lastly, under “Let Me Do What I Please,” I will look at how zoning ordinances and environmental laws, as well as condemnation, have been used in different states to limit an owner’s ability to build certain structures on their lots—from buildings to sea walls and piers— {{for the benefit of the}} general public. In what cases have the courts found the government went too far in restricting the owner’s use of his or her littoral property, and in what cases have they said the danger to the environment or the public’s entitled use outweighed the owner’s desire to construct what he or she wishes? Each of these disputes has important political, economic, and social implications because it pits a select group of private property owners, who are often wealthy and influential, against the general public, whose desire to be near the ocean is steadily growing. On a grander scale, these legal issues highlight the continuing debate over how to best utilize our natural resources and the corresponding struggle for control...|$|R
