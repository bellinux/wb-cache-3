40|$|Background Alternatives to endotracheal {{intubation}} (ETI) are required when {{access to the}} cranial end of the patient is restricted. In this study, the success rate and time duration of standard intubation techniques were compared with two different supraglottic devices. Two different manikins {{were used for the}} study, and the training effect was studied when the same manikin was repeatedly used. Methods Twenty anaesthesiologists from the Air Ambulance Department used iGEL™, laryngeal tube LTSII™ and Macintosh laryngoscopes in two scenarios with either unrestricted (scenario A) or <b>restricted</b> (scenario B) <b>access</b> to the cranial end of the manikin. Different manikins were used for ETI and placement of the supraglottic devices. The technique selected by the physicians, the success rates and the times to completion were the primary outcomes measured. A secondary outcome of the study was an evaluation of the learning effect of using the same manikin or device several times. Results In scenario A, all anaesthesiologists secured an airway using each device within the maximum time limit of 60 seconds. In scenario B, all physicians secured the airway on the first attempt with the supraglottic devices and 16 (80 %) successfully performed an ETI with either the Macintosh laryngoscope (n = 13, 65 %) or with digital technique (n = 3, 15 %). It took significantly longer to perform ETI (mean time 28. 0 sec +/- 13. 0) than to secure an airway with the supraglottic devices (iGel™: mean 12. 3 sec +/- 3. 6, LTSII™: mean 10. 6 sec +/- 3. 2). When comparing the mean time required for the two scenarios for each supraglottic device, there was a reduction in time for scenario B (significant for LTSII™: 12. 1 versus 10. 6 seconds, p = 0. 014). This may be due to a training effect using same manikin and device several times. Conclusions The amount of time used to secure an airway with supraglottic devices was low for both scenarios, while classic ETI was time consuming and had a low success rate in the simulated <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> <b>condition.</b> This study also demonstrates that there is a substantial training effect when simulating airway management with airway manikins.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> <b>conditions</b> during {{minimally}} invasive surgery (MIS) result in perceptual-motor relationships that are unfamiliar to the novice surgeon and require training to overcome. To aid in MIS skills assessment and training, a novel sensorized instrument has been designed. Strain gauges attached to the instrument measure forces and torques acting at its tip, corresponding to all 5 degrees of freedom (DOFs) available during MIS. A position tracker provides tip motion feedback in 6 DOFs. The instrument is similar in shape, size and weight to traditional laparoscopic instruments, allowing it {{to be used in}} any MIS training environment. Furthermore, replaceable tips and handles make the instruments highly versatile. The results of the experimental evaluation show that there are clear differences in both the force and position profiles of trainees and surgeons with different levels of experience. I...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the broad {{politics of the}} creation and maintenance of two large erotica collections in European national libraries across their histories and in relation to definitions of censorship and obscenity. It also examines the popular and intellectual discourses that have surrounded the Collection de l’Enfer and the Private Case of the British Library, and imbued them with a particular cultural mystique as repositories of secret, hidden and privileged erotic knowledge.   Censorship and repression of sexuality cannot account for the policies of these libraries which have policed public morals through their <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> <b>conditions,</b> even as the works they deemed obscene were published without any legal sanction. By classing their contents into a discreet category, these collections have helped to frame erotic signification as a separate body of meaning. In France {{the notion of the}} Enfer’s place within national patrimony has particularly abetted the discourses of mystique and allure around it. In Britain, the bibliographers who have discussed the Private Case have done so through assumptions of masculine heterosexual privilege and normativity. </p...|$|E

This multiplatform system can operate on both Moderate Resolution Imaging spectroradiometer and Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager data. The new version of the system is now implemented on graphics processing units and its interface is available on the internet under <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> <b>conditions.</b> Combining the estimation of time-varying discharge rates using HOTSAT with the MAGFLOW physics-based model to simulate lava flow paths resulted in the first operational system in which satellite observations drive the modelling of lava flow emplacement. This allows the timely definition of the parameters and maps essential for hazard assessment, including the propagation time of lava flows and the maximum run-out distance. The system was first used in an operational context during the paroxysmal episode at Mt Etna on 12 – 13 January 2011, when we produced real-time predictions of the areas likely to be inundated by lava flows while the eruption was still ongoing. This allowed key at-risk areas to be rapidly and appropriately identified...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{freezing}} point depression (FPD) content is regarded as being relatively stable in cows’ milk during lactation. Since the 30 s, its measurement is a means to determine if water {{has been added to}} the milk. However, results from commercial herds have suggested that changes in milk FPD occurred during the year. The reason of those variations is unclear. However, dairy cow feeding might be an explanation. The objective of this experiment was to compare the characteristics of milk (especially milk FPD measured by MIR spectrometry) based on low input grass-based system compared with corn silage-based system, across 2 breeds of dairy cows (Holstein vs. Normande). Sixty-four dairy cows were observed from calving to drying off. Two feeding systems were compared. The Intensive system was designed to maximize individual performance, with a high energy diet (in winter, corn silage with 30 % concentrate; in spring, summer and autumn periods, pasture with 4 kg/d of concentrate supplemented with corn silage from July). The Grass system was designed to decrease inputs (in winter, conserved grass with no concentrate; in spring, summer and autumn, pasture with no concentrate). The experimental design was a continuous design. Data were analyzed by using SAS mixed procedure. There was no significant effect of breed and feeding system on milk FPD. There was a significant effect of month of sampling and month of lactation. Milk FPD did not change from calving to 7 th month of lactation. After that date, it largely decreased. These effects could be related to the high temperature in summer, specific feeding (grazing), or <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> <b>conditions</b> for watering. There was also a significant effect of rank of lactation. FPD was higher for multiparous cows. This difference could be due to the opening of mammary tight junctions and a different repartition of ions and lactose {{on both sides of the}} epithelial barrier. Surprisingly FPD did not correlate with lactose content the most important osmotic agent in mammary epithelial cells. Some investigations have to be done to explain the mechanisms of FPD and its physiological variations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The National Travel Survey (NTS) {{is a series of}} household surveys designed to provide regular, up-to-date data on personal travel and monitor changes in travel behaviour over time. The first NTS was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport in 1965. Further periodic surveys were carried out in 1972 / 73, 1975 / 76, 1978 / 79 and 1985 / 86 (the UK Data Service holds data from 1972 onwards). Since July 1988 the NTS has been carried out as a continuous survey with field work being carried out in every month of the year, and an annual set sample of over 5, 000 addresses. From 2002, the NTS sample was increased approximately threefold, to approximately 15, 000 per year. The advantage of the continuous study is that users will be able to discern seasonal and cyclical movements as well as trend changes over time. The NTS is carried out primarily for the purposes of government. The most fundamental use of the National Travel Survey within the Department for Transport (DfT) is as core base data for key transport models. These are critical to the assessment and appraisal of transport scheme proposals (national and local), transport policy proposals, and {{contribute to the development of}} our long-term strategy. The NTS data is used to develop consistent sets of transport policies. Because it relates travel to travellers, it makes it possible to relate policies to people and to predict their impact. The survey provides detailed information on different types of travel: where people travel from and to, distance, purpose and mode. The NTS records personal and socio-economic information to distinguish between different types of people, and the differences in the way they travel and how often they do so. The NTS is the only source of national information on subjects such as walking which provide a context for the results of more local studies. Further information may be found on the gov. uk National Travel Survey webpage. End-User Licence, Special Licence and Secure Access NTS data The UK Data Archive holds three versions of the NTS: the End User Licence (EUL) versions (SNs 5340 and 6108) contain a comprehensive range of NTS data at Government Office Region geographic level and should be sufficient for most research needs. EUL data are available to registered users of the UK Data Service (see the Administrative and Access section below for details). The Special Licence versions (SNs 7553 and 7804) contain more detailed travel (including accidents), demographic and socio-economic data, and the geographic level is Local Authority/Unitary Authority. Special Licence data are subject to more <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> <b>conditions.</b> The Secure Access version (SN 7559) contains more detailed information and postcode sector geographies. Secure Access data are subject to further <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> <b>conditions,</b> including the completion of a training course. Full information about the variables contained at each level are available in the NTS Table Structures spreadsheet, available in the documentation. Changes to the methodology in 2002 mean that there are some inconsistencies with data for previous years. Most notably, an under-recording of short walks in 2002 and 2003 affects trends over this period, particularly in terms of the number of trips per person. For the 10 th edition (February 2016), updated versions of the household and LDJ files were deposited, with corrections made to the date and survey year variables. Main Topics : The 2002 - 2014 NTS includes: household variables: address type information, accessibility of public transport, access to amenities, household vehicle access, household composition and household socio-economic information; individual information: age, gender and marital status, social and economic information, frequency of use of various methods of transport, driving licences and type of vehicle driven, employment, occupation and industry details, income, place of work and travel to work, season ticket details, travel difficulties; vehicle information: vehicle type, registration details, parking, fuel type, mileage, engine capacity; trips: day, date and time, main mode, purpose, origin and destination information; stage: mode, number in party, distance, duration, costs; long-distance trips (over 50 miles) : stage: mode, purpose, origin and destination; Please see the Table Structures document available in the table below for the full list of variables. <br...|$|E
