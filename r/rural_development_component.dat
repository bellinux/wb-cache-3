40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, Uganda has {{experienced}} strong economic growth. However, agriculture has not performed {{as well as the}} rest of the economy in recent years, and while the incidence of poverty has declined, it is still substantially higher in rural rather than urban areas. The Ugandan government, within the framework of its Plan for the Modernization of Agriculture (PMA) and the Prosperity for All (PFA) initiative, and in support of the upcoming National Development Plan, is in the process of implementing the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), which provides an integrated framework of development priorities aimed at restoring agricultural growth, rural development and food security. This paper analyzes the agricultural growth and investment options that can support the development of a comprehensive <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>component</b> under Uganda's National Development Plan in alignment with the principles and objectives of the CAADP, which include achievement of six percent agricultural growth and allocation of at least ten percent of budgetary resources to the agricultural sector. Our CGE modeling results indicate that it is possible for Uganda to reach the CAADP target of six percent agricultural growth, but this will require additional growth in a number of crops and sub-sectors. Uganda cannot rely on a few crops or sub-sectors to achieve its growth targets. Broader-based agricultural growth, including increases in fisheries and livestock, will be important if this target is to be achieved. So, too, is meeting the Maputo declaration of spending at least ten percent of the government's total budget on agriculture. In fact, even under a more optimistic and efficient spending scenario, the Government of Uganda will have to increase its spending on agriculture in real value terms by about 25. 3 percent per year between 2006 and 2015, and account for at least 14 percent of its total expenditure by 2015. While Uganda is currently on track to achieve the first Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015, achieving the CAADP growth target should remain a high priority, since it will substantially reduce the number of people living below the poverty line and significantly improve the well-being of both rural and urban households.

40|$|Zambia has {{experienced}} strong economic performance since 1999. However, agriculture has not performed {{as well as}} the rest of the economy, and although the incidence of poverty has declined, it still remains high. The Zambian government, within the framework of the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP), is in the process of implementing the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), which provides an integrated framework of development priorities aimed at restoring agricultural growth, rural development and food security. This paper analyzes the agricultural growth and investment options that can support the development of a comprehensive <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>component</b> under Zambia's FNDP, in alignment with the principles and objectives of the CAADP, which include the achievement of six percent agricultural growth and allocation of at least ten percent of budgetary resources to the sector. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model results indicate that it is possible for Zambia to reach the CAADP target of six percent agricultural growth, but this will require additional growth in all crops and sub-sectors. Zambia cannot rely on only maize or higher-value export crops to achieve this growth target; broader-based agricultural growth, including increases in fisheries and livestock, will be important. So, too, is meeting the Maputo declaration of spending at least ten percent of the government's total budget on agriculture. In order to meet the CAADP target, the Government of Zambia must increase its spending on agriculture in real value terms by about 17 - 27 percent per year between 2006 and 2015, and spend about 8 - 18 percent of its total expenditure on the sector by 2015. Although agriculture has strong linkages to the rest of the economy and its growth will result in substantial overall growth in the economy and the household incomes of rural and urban populations, achieving the CAADP target of six percent agricultural growth will not be sufficient to meet the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG 1) of halving poverty by 2015. To achieve this more ambitious target, both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors would need an average annual growth rate of around ten percent per year. These growth requirements are substantial, as are the associated resource requirements. Thus, while the MDG 1 target appears to be beyond reach for Zambia, achieving the CAADP target should remain a priority, as its more reasonable growth and expenditure scenarios will still substantially reduce the number of poor people living below the poverty line by 2015, and significantly improve the well-being of both rural and urban households.

40|$|The Korup {{rainforest}} of Southwest Cameroon {{is an area}} {{of unique}} biological diversity. However, hunting and trapping by people living within the protected zone of the Korup National Park, and in the areas immediately outside it, are eliminating many animal species, including elephant, giant pangolin and many small mammals. The decline in coffee and cocoa prices has led to an increase in sales and consumption of 'bush' meat as people have sought alternative sources of income and food. If continued unchecked, hunting and trapping would lead to the breakdown of the intricate biological web of species interdependence and the destruction of the forest. For example, the World Resources Institute has identified 71 plant species which have germinated after passing through the gut of elephants. These comprise about 11 % of all vascular plants found at Korup and the destruction of elephants alone would jeopardize and perhaps prevent the dispersal and continued survival of many plants. There are six villages within the Park and 100 villages in the surrounding area with a total population of about 27, 000. It was recognized by me Government of Cameroon and international conservation organizations that it was essential for a project to be set up that would work in harmony with the local population through education, involvement and, most importantly, by providing alternative sources of income. The urgent requirement for a positive, structured approach to rural development in the Korup area to help manage me resources of the forest on a sustainable basis has been met by me Korup National Park Project. This was set up in collaboration with the Government of Cameroon and has been managed by the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). The European Union is the principal funding agency. Other significant donors are UK Overseas Development Administration (ODA) and the German Development Agency (GTZ). Between 1993 and 1996 ODA funding is specifically supporting a <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>component</b> to raise standards of living for both individuals and communities through a variety of rural enterprises and improvements in infrastructure. Activities include projects for rearing small livestock, using improved planting material, developing community farms to multiply improved planting stock, and planting local and exotic fruit trees. EU funding includes financial aid for infrastructural development such as the construction of primary schools, health centres, water supplies and roads. Resettlement of villagers from within to outside the Park is a major concern of the Cameroon authorities. If the Korup forest within the Park is to survive the local people must be assisted and guided to develop a system for exploiting the animals and plants in the zone surrounding the Park on a sustainable basis. If the wildlife within the Park can be adequately protected, preferably with the full cooperation of the local people, breeding populations within the Park will produce an overspill into the surrounding area where hunting and trapping can be carried out under a proper system of controls. Feeder roads will encourage the production of a wider range of cash crops by providing easier access for bringing in inputs, and better transport links to major markets. A more intensive and productive form of agriculture should result in improved food security and thus in better nutrition levels. This in turn should greatly reduce the need for hunting wildlife, and increase household income through the sale of crops. It has been estimated that 80 % of the animals killed are sold and only 20 % are consumed. With poverty endemic in the area it is essential that resource management offers local people more than just the opportunity to substitute crops for animals as a source of income. There should be clear opportunities to gain a higher income as well as better living standards, clean water supply, education and improved communications. The Korup Project is engaged in all these aspects of development. The Korup rainforest of Southwest Cameroon {{is an area of}} unique biological diversity. However, hunting and trapping by people living within the protected zone of the Korup National Park, and in the areas immediately outside it, are eliminating many [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In the 140 -odd {{years after}} the first diamond was found in South Africa in 1866, mining catapulted the country from a {{predominantly}} agrarian society into a modern industrial nation. For the biggest part of this period, mining drove and human development followed. This ‘order of importance’ was largely the result of the huge wealth and influence of the mining houses, the (perceived) importance of the sector {{for the development of the}} country, and the broader skewed power dynamics of colonial and apartheid rule. Over the last decade, national government enacted new legislation by which it attempted to ensure that mining is made more serviceable to the post- 1994 objectives of (1) broad-based societal reconstruction; (2) shared and inclusive growth; and (3) regional and <b>rural</b> <b>development.</b> A key <b>component</b> of this new legislation has been a provision to ensure that mining companies make tangible contributions to regional and <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and human settlement in ‘mining areas’. Recent events, such as widespread strikes, the tragic loss of many lives, and continuing harsh living conditions, have raised, what has been a nagging question since the introduction of the new legislation, i. e. : Has the new legal framework (really) assisted in (1) ensuring that communities in mining areas enjoy a greater of the wealth created by the industry; (2) enhancing regional and <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> in mining areas; and (3) establishing a more symbiotic relationship between mining, regional and <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> planning and human development? In this paper, research in a mining area during the course of 2011 and 2012 is used to explore this question.

In particular, the focus was on the question whether the menu approach of the second pillar enables EU member states and regions to design <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Plans with a tailor-made set of measures which address their specific <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> needs. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the current menu of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> measures is sufficient to suit the wide range of socio-economic, ecological and physical circumstances in the EU regions.

40|$|With the {{socio-economic}} transformation, {{regional development}} factors recombination and followed industrial restructuring {{have changed the}} rural areas in eastern coastal China deeply. The interaction between the material and non-material elements affecting rural production and lifestyles shaped different <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types depending on a carrier, which is composed of different industries. Accordingly, this paper makes the definitions of four <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types, i. e., farming industry dominated <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type (FIT), industry dominated <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type (IDT), <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type focusing on business, tourism and services industries (BTT), and balanced <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type (BDT), and classifies the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types in eastern coastal China. Then, taking the social representation approach and basing on the major factors affecting the long-term <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and the exertion of {{the functions of the}} countryside with regard to society, the assessment indicator system of rurality degree index (RDI) was established to distinguish the rurality degree of different types. The results indicated that. to some extent, the RDI may accurately reflect the status quo of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and the exertion of the functions of the countryside with regard to society, and can also reflect the different stage in what the same <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type in different region stays. The authors argue that the study on the interaction of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> factors in the process of economic and social transformation and the subsequent <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> model is very important to deeply understand the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and to smoothly achieve coordinated and balanced rural-urban development in developing countries, which are experiencing rapid industrialization and urbanization.
