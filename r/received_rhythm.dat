40|$|Knowledge {{of brain}} {{connectivity}} {{is an important}} aspect of modern neuroscience, to understand how the brain realizes its functions. In this work, neural mass models including four groups of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are used to estimate the connectivity among three cortical regions of interests (ROIs) during a foot-movement task. Real data were obtained via high-resolution scalp EEGs on two populations: healthy volunteers and tetraplegic patients. A 3 -shell Boundary Element Model of the head was used to estimate the cortical current density and to derive cortical EEGs in the three ROIs. The model assumes that each ROI can generate an intrinsic rhythm in the beta range, and <b>receives</b> <b>rhythms</b> in the alpha and gamma ranges from other two regions. Connectivity strengths among the ROIs were estimated by means of an original genetic algorithm that tries to minimize several cost functions of the difference between real and model power spectral densities. Results show that the stronger connections are those from the cingulate cortex to the primary and supplementary motor areas, thus emphasizing the pivotal role played by the CMA L during the task. Tetraplegic patients exhibit higher connectivity strength on average, with significant statistical differences in some connections. The results are commented and virtues and limitations of the proposed method discussed...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundLimited French {{data are}} {{available}} for the different clinical types (paroxysmal, persistent and permanent) of atrial fibrillation and their comorbidities (AF). AimsTo provide contemporary insights into the characteristics and management of outpatients {{with a history of}} or current AF in France. MethodsEPHA is a national, observational, cross-sectional, multicentre descriptive study with retrospective data collection relating to the management, treatment and hospitalization of patients with AF. ResultsOne thousand three hundred and thirty-one patients (mean age: 74 ± 11 years [55. 7 %≥ 75 years]; 58. 8 % men) were included into the study between February 2009 and May 2009; their data were collected during the past 12 months. Of these, 38. 2 % had paroxysmal AF, 10. 0 % persistent AF and 51. 8 % permanent AF. Most patients had at least one cardiovascular risk factor (80. 8 %). Almost all patients (96. 6 %) had received an antiarrhythmic drug in the previous year, of which 59. 6 % <b>received</b> a <b>rhythm</b> control strategy (class I, class III) with or without rate control strategy (class II, class IV, digitalis) and 40. 6 % received a rate control strategy exclusively. Almost all (94. 4 %) patients were treated with an antithrombotic: 83. 4 % with a vitamin K antagonist and 21. 9 % with antiplatelet therapy. Almost one-fifth (18. 4 %) of patients had been hospitalized related to AF at least once in the previous year. Patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF were hospitalized more frequently (20. 0 % and 31. 1 %, respectively) than patients with permanent AF (14. 8 %). ConclusionsAbout half of the patients had paroxysmal or persistent AF. Four-fifths of AF patients had at least one cardiovascular risk factor. The use of antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic treatments was very high. The rhythm control strategy was preferred in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of adaptive instruction on the developmental rhythm aptitude and rhythm achievement of preschool students with a hearing impairment. Specifically, this study is designed to determine a) if the addition of body percussion and percussive instruments to music instruction affects the developmental rhythm aptitudes of 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year-old children with a hearing impairment and b) if the addition of body percussion and percussive instruments affects the rhythm achievement scores of 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year-old children with a hearing impairment. The results of this study may have implications for music teachers who teach students in an inclusive classroom setting. Subjects were 5 students from 3 intact preschool classrooms in an urban public elementary school. Audie was used as a pretest and posttest assessment tool. The researcher taught each class two 30 -minute music classes for 6 consecutive weeks. Content was identical for both the treatment group and the control group except that the treatment group received instruction utilizing hand drums and body percussion while the control group received instruction using stimulation from CD player speakers and general body movements such as clapping and tapping. Subjects engaged in activities in which they moved, sang, chanted, and responded to rhythm patterns both in a group and individually. Content for the lessons consisted of age-appropriate songs, rhythmic games, chants and movement activities. The researcher found no statistical difference found between the treatment and control groups for developmental rhythm aptitude scores. A five-point rating scale was used to measure rhythm achievement. Three judges independently rated each child’s video taped final performance.

MethodsWe compared CV outcomes in the AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-Up Investigation of Rhythm Management) trial in subgroups defined by the initial AAD selected with propensity score matched subgroups from the rate arm (Rate). ResultsSeven hundred twenty-nine amiodarone patients, 606 sotalol patients, and 268 Class 1 C patients were matched. The composite outcome of mortality or cardiovascular hospital stays (CVH) showed better outcomes with Rate compared with amiodarone (hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 18, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 03 to 1. 36, p = 0. 02), sotalol (HR: 1. 32, 95 % CI: 1. 13 to 1. 54, p < 0. 001), and Class 1 C (HR: 1. 22, 95 % CI: 0. 97 to 1. 56, p = 0. 10). There was a nonsignificant increase in mortality with amiodarone (HR: 1. 20, 95 % CI: 0. 94 to 1. 53, p = 0. 15) with the risk of non-CV death being significantly higher with amiodarone versus Rate (HR: 1. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 01 to 1. 24, p = 0. 04). First CVH event rates at 3 years were 47 % for amiodarone, 50 % for sotalol, and 44 % for Class 1 C versus 40 %, 40 %, and 36 %, respectively, for Rate (amiodarone HR: 1. 20, 95 % CI: 1. 03 to 1. 40, p = 0. 02, sotalol HR: 1. 364, 95 % CI: 1. 16 to 1. 611, p < 0. 001, Class 1 C HR: 1. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 96 to 1. 60, p = 0. 09). Time to CVH with intensive care unit stay or death was shorter with amiodarone (HR: 1. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 02 to 1. 46, p = 0. 03). ConclusionsIn AFFIRM, composite mortality and CVH outcomes differed for Rate and AADs due to differences in CVH; CVH event rates during follow-up were high for all cohorts, but they were higher for all groups on AADs.

40|$|Verapamil {{is a novel}} {{antiarrhythmic}} agent which appears {{to act as a}} calcium-ion antagonist, blocking calcium transport across the myocardial cell membrane. It was given intravenously, in a dose of 10 mg, to thirty-two patients suffering from paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and sinus rhythm was achieved promptly in all. Identical results were obtained in a further ten patients with supraventricular tachycardias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White or other pre-excitation syndromes. In a separate group of eighteen patients in whom A-V junctional tachycardias were induced during intracardiac electrography, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in fifteen patients, with prolongation of the cycle length in the others. Circus-movement tachycardias were induced in eight patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in seven. The results were less consistent in patients with other supraventricular arrhythmias including ectopic atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter, and, in the single patient with supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia, only the former was controlled. In the single patient with atrial fibrillation complicating the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who <b>received</b> verapamil, sinus <b>rhythm</b> was restored. Side effects were few and mild, with rare exceptions of profound hypotension, bradycardia and asystole; their management is discussed, and reasons are advanced why their occurrence is likely to be related either to the concomitant administration of beta-adrenergic blockers or to the presence of sinoatrial disease. It appears that verapamil is particularly suitable for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias due to a circus movement as calcium antagonism is likely to be most effective in the N region of the atrioventricular node...|$|R

They were laid down in a fully marine saltwater sea {{at the end of the}} Bathonian Age, at a time when the earlier lagoons were once more below sea level over a wide area, so that a wide area, including the largely flat surface of the earlier Cranford <b>rhythm</b> <b>received</b> a deposition that was at times mud and other outwash from the nearby landmass, and at other times accumulations of shells and other marine detritus which also received substantial precipitation of limestone held within the seawater. The beds are named after a village with extensive quarries south of Northampton, where it was studied at the end of the 18th century whilst the Blisworth Tunnel was being built for the Grand Union Canal. The Limestone has been widely used across Northamptonshire for building stone, and takes a wide variety of colours in cream and beige - rather than the dark browns of the ironstones. In form, it is variable, but generally fine grained, and less often Ooidal. The Finedon Gullet rockface shows two beds, the lower, {{known as the}} Sharpi beds, has large accumulations of shell and fossil elements, including oysters and other bivalves, and a brachiopod fossil, Sharpirhynchia sharpi, (formerly called Kallirhynchia sharpi) which in turn is named after Samuel Sharp, a 19th century geologist who published his detailed accounts of local quarries in the 1870s. This bed is placed in the Morrisi Biozone. Above the Sharpi beds, rock beds 4m of limestone is found, the lower half of which has fossils and shells, whilst the upper half is more massive blocks with fewer or no fossils. These layers appear to correlate to the Audley member of the White Limestone Formation further south in Oxfordshire. This would place it in the Retrocostatum Biozone and it is inferred to belong to what are known as the 'Diginoides Beds', although the diagnostic brachiopod fossil Digonella digonoides has not been found at this outcrop. This zoning suggests no deposits from the intervening Bremeri Biozone, implying either no sedimentation or a period of erosion between the Sharpi and Diginoides beds.|$|R
