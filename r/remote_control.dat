Since no sonar equipment was fitted these depth charges were unlikely to actually damage a submarine.|$|E
5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E
5|$|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature {{designed}} to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, set-top box, and DVD player using only the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.|$|E

5|$|HDMI {{implements}} the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define video formats and waveforms, {{transport of}} compressed, uncompressed, and LPCM audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the VESA EDID. CEA-861 signals carried by HDMI are electrically {{compatible with the}} CEA-861 signals used by the digital visual interface (DVI). No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device.|$|E
5|$|It is a one-wire {{bidirectional}} {{serial bus}} {{that is based}} on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E

5|$|Whereas some cruise missiles, such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} loiter and have some sensory and <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> features, their primary mission is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their name implies, are optimized for long-range flight at constant speed both in terms of propulsion systems and wings or lifting body design. They are often unable to loiter at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.|$|E
5|$|A Limited Edition of {{the game}} was {{confirmed}} on February 20, 2008. On July 14, 2008, {{more information about the}} Limited Edition's contents was revealed.

As a bonus item promoted by electronics store Best Buy, customers who preordered the Limited Edition also received a bonus <b>Remote</b> <b>Control</b> Centaur Tank replica, just like the new vehicle introduced in the game, free of charge.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E

5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had {{the tree}} {{moved from the}} Ellipse to the White House grounds, where it {{remained}} until 1954 when it was returned to the Ellipse. In 1946, the lighting ceremony became a televised event, though not with widespread telecast. From 1948 to 1951, President Harry S. Truman signalled the lighting of the tree by <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> from his Independence, Missouri home, but in 1952, he stayed at the White House for the lighting ceremony. In 1953, the ceremony was widely telecast and President Dwight David Eisenhower's address was radio broadcast through the Voice of America in thirty-four languages.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Dugan {{demonstrated}} an automixer card, marketed by Yamaha, to plug into the accessory slot of a Yamaha digital mixer {{such as the}} O1V96, LS9, M7CL or PM5D. This card, the Dugan-MY16, could mix up to 16 channels of microphone inputs, assigned to selected inserts in the mixer's graphic user interface. Like the Model E-1, the automixer could be adjusted through a web browser interface, allowing <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> with an iPad, touchscreen computer or laptop over wireless network. The Dugan algorithm moved inside Yamaha's QL-eeries of mixers in March 2014, as an option on the graphic equalizer processing page. This internal version could mix 8 or 16 microphones.|$|E

5|$|On 12 November 1934, Hessen was {{withdrawn}} from fleet service {{and placed in}} reserve. On 31 March 1935, Hessen was stricken from the reserve list and converted into a target ship. Her armament was removed, the hull was lengthened, and new machinery was installed. The longer hull allowed room for two additional watertight compartments, which brought the number up to 15 from the original 13. The ship's superstructure was cut down nearly entirely; Hessen retained only a single funnel, a tower foremast, and the two armored barbettes for the main battery turrets. The ship had a crew of 80, but could be operated by <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> when {{being used as a}} target.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the 1960s {{setting of}} The Secret Service, Derek Meddings and the {{technicians}} {{of the special}} effects department received few commissions for scale models of vehicles that appeared futuristic. This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead {{ruled out}} an internet-only {{distribution}} {{for fear that}} some fans would not have internet access. In Rainbows was released on CD and vinyl in Japan by BMG on 26 December 2007, in Australia on 29 December 2007 by <b>Remote</b> <b>Control</b> Records, and in the United States and Canada on 1 January 2008 by ATO imprint TBD Records and MapleMusic/Fontana respectively. Elsewhere, the album was released on 31 December 2007 by independent record label XL Recordings. The CD release came in a cardboard package containing the CD, lyric booklet, and several stickers that could {{be placed on the}} blank jewel case to create cover art. In Rainbows was the first Radiohead album available for download in several digital music stores, such as the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3. On 10 June 2016, it was added to the free streaming service Spotify.|$|E
