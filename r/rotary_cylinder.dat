Some types of fins, especially the ones installed on larger ships, are provided with flaps, that increase the fin lift by about 15%. Stabilizer control needs to consider numerous variables that change quickly: wind, waves, ship motion, draft, etc. Fin stabilizers are vastly more efficient at higher velocities and lose effectiveness when the ship is under a minimum speed. Stabilization solutions at anchor or at low speed include actively-controlled fins (such as the stabilisation at rest system developed by Rolls Royce that oscillate to counteract wave motion), and <b>rotary</b> <b>cylinders</b> employing the Magnus effect. The latter two systems are retractable, allowing for a thinner vessel profile when docking, and reducing drag while cruising.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the {{mechanisms}} of solids transportation, heat and mass transfer within rotary dryers were first examined. Some experimental data obtained in pilot-scale and industrial rotary dryers were used to investigate the influences of moisture content of solids and gas temperature on solids transportation, typically on solids mean residence time distribution, and on heat and mass transfer to estimate the volumetric heat and mass transfer coefficients. One pilot-scale rotary dryer with direct contact between the gas and the solids with co-current flow has been designed, constructed and tested in our laboratory. It mainly consists of four parts: an electric fan, an electric heater, a solids feeding system and a <b>rotary</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Numerous experiments were performed to investigate the dynamic characteristics of solids transportation in this pilot-scale rotary dryer.

40|$|A {{model for}} the axial {{transport}} of solids in a horizontal rotating cylinder is obtained. The physical basis of the model is {{a modified version of}} the single particle trajectory model of Saeman, which includes random deviations from the most probable trajectory. According to the model, each particle executes a one-dimensional random walk, and the stochastic evolution equation for the probability density of the axial position of the particle with time is derived. The average axial velocity (upsilon) and the axial dispersion coefficient (D(a)) are obtained in the course of the derivation in terms of the system parameters, and an unknown parameter, delta, which represents the maximum deviation of the trajectory from the model of Saeman. The model predictions are compared with the experimental data of Hehl et al. Reasonable agreement is obtained between theory and experiments for upsilon, and the parameter-delta is back-calculated from experimental values of D(a). The results give a better understanding of the mechanisms of axial transport in <b>rotary</b> <b>cylinders...</b>|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} a new active method for controlling vortex shedding from a circular cylinder {{in a uniform}} flow, using <b>rotary</b> <b>cylinder</b> oscillations controlled by the reference velocity signal in the wake with some phase lag. The effectiveness of this active method is evaluated by measuring the response of mean and fluctuating velocities in the cylinder wake and by visualizing the flow field around the cylinder. It is found that velocity fluctuations are reduced by the control at the optimum phase lag, while they are enhanced at the reverse phase. The maximum reduction of 30 percent in the reference velocity fluctuations is obtained with the optimum control, where the optimum value of phase lag and the feedback coefficient are adopted. The modification of the mean velocity profile and {{the reduction in the}} fluctuating velocities in the wake are measured under the optimum control and the corresponding variations in the visualized flow field are recognized, similar to the change observed under the control with cross-flow cylinder oscillations...|$|E

40|$|A commonly-used {{method to}} cool {{rotating}} cylinders involves spraying {{water on the}} surface to cool its internal particles. This paper conducted a numerical investigation of heat transfer from a <b>rotary</b> <b>cylinder</b> cooled with sprayed water. A 3 -D numerical model was generated, and the distributions of the wall temperatures and liquid films were analyzed. Then, the heat transfer characteristics for different parameters were obtained and compared. The {{results showed that the}} best location for a single spray nozzle was directly above the cylinder, where it had the most uniform liquid film and highest heat exchange efficiency. With increased rotation speeds, the cylinder wall temperature increased and the distribution of wall temperature and liquid film became more uniform, which improved heat transfer. Because of the influence of gravity, the slope of the cylinder had a negative influence on the distribution of the liquid film. When the cylinder material had lower thermal conductivity, the system needed a much longer period of time before it was stable and had lower heat flux. Furthermore, with the same heat source, the system heat flux could not be determined with only the outer surface temperature, but with the temperature difference between inner surface and outer surface.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} asbestos and asbestiform minerals can {{be found}} in metamorphic rocks and in the soil of the alluvial plains. Problem statement: The definition of the "free-asbestos rock" and the limit to consider a rock or a soil safe is still a controversial issue. American and European laws did not present any method to define the hazard of the green stones, instead Italian law, in Ministerial Decree 1996, established a limit value obtaoined by the determination of the Release Index. In order to detect an asbestos concentration in the rocks, a reliable analytic methodology has been necessary. Approach: An abrasion trial, using the mechanism action of a <b>rotary</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and a Phase Contrast Optical Microscopy (PCOM) method to analyze the powder obtained from the mill, had been used. To simplify PCOM analysis, the sample, recovered from the mill, was selected in particle size classes: large, medium and small. Each class was separated by means of sedimentation in fibrous and granular fractions. Results: The separation of asbestos in large and medium classes was quite good and the fibers had been weighed. For the small class the transformation of visible data into numerical data was complex, but the results had been reliable. Conclusion/Recommendations: The suggested method, although semi-quantitative, could be useful to solve the difficult problem of the analysis of the asbestos content in the rocks or soils. The division into granular classes allowed a more representative sample to be analyzed and better quality slides to be prepared.
