2500|$|Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) {{supported}} the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement. Thorndike developed {{the theory of}} instrumental conditioning or the law of effect. [...] The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that learning is done {{a little at a}} time or in increments, learning is an automatic process and all the principles of learning apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with Robert Woodworth on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence your ability to learn another subject if the subjects are similar. This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the classics because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence. Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in cognitive tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability. [...] He contributed word dictionaries that were scientifically based to determine the words and definitions used. The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level. [...] He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions. Thorndike contributed arithmetic books based on learning theory. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general intelligence. He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects. His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a <b>ratio</b> <b>scale.</b> His later work was on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning: ...|$|E

40|$|The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is {{a method}} for {{decision}} making which includes qualitative factors.

40|$|Summary: A {{distinction}} of the Analytic Hierarchy/Network Process is that derived priorities {{are based upon}} <b>ratio</b> <b>scales.</b> The technique has been criticized {{on the grounds that}} <b>ratio</b> <b>scales</b> have a natural or absolute zero that AHP/ANP fails to recognize.

The current study was a single session biomechanical running gait analysis of healthy male and female college aged individuals.

5000|$|A <b>ratio</b> <b>scale</b> is {{constructed}} by determining {{the equality of}} ratios. For example, if, on a balance instrument, object A balances two identical objects B, then one can say that A is twice as heavy as B and can give them appropriate numbers, for example [...] "A weighs 2 grams" [...] and [...] "B weighs 1 gram". A key idea is that such ratios remain the same regardless of the scale units used; for example, the ratio of A to B remains the same whether grams or ounces are used. Length, resistance, and Kelvin temperature are other {{things that can be}} measured on ratio scales. Some psychological properties such as the loudness of a sound can be measured on a <b>ratio</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are two {{features}} of relative error {{that should be}} kept in mind. Firstly, relative error is undefined when the true value is zero as it appears in the denominator (see below). Secondly, relative error only makes sense when measured on a <b>ratio</b> <b>scale,</b> (i.e. a scale which has a true meaningful zero), otherwise it would be sensitive to the measurement units. For example, when an absolute error in a temperature measurement given in Celsius scale is 1 °C, and the true value is 2 °C, the relative error is 0.5, and the percent error is 50%. For this same case, when the temperature is given in Kelvin scale, the same 1 K absolute error with the same true value of 275.15 K gives a relative error of 3.63 and a percent error of only 0.363%. Celsius temperature is measured on an interval scale, whereas the Kelvin scale has a true zero and so is a <b>ratio</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
40|$|Aim: This {{study on}} {{professional}} rugby union players was undertaken to: 1) confirm {{a relationship between}} body mass (BM) and peak force (PF) and peak power (PP); 2) evaluate the effect of <b>ratio</b> and allometric <b>scaling</b> on these relationships; and 3) compare the PF and PP abilities of different positional groups with each approach. Methods: Seventy-nine rugby players were assessed for PF during an isometric mid-thigh pull and/or countermovement jump PP. Athlete performance was normalized for BM using standard <b>ratio</b> and allometric <b>scaling</b> methods. The performance data from inside backs (IB), outside backs (OB), tight forwards (TF) and loose forwards (LF) were compared before and after scaling for BM. Results: Significant relationships were identified between BM and the absolute expression of PF (r= 0. 25) and PP (r= 0. 44). These relationships improved with the application of <b>ratio</b> <b>scaling</b> (r=- 0. 53 to - 0. 57), but were eliminated after allometric scaling with the derived exponents (r= 0. 00 - 0. 02). No positional group differences in absolute and allometrically scaled PF and PP were seen, but <b>ratio</b> <b>scaled</b> performance favoured the lighter IB and OB over the heavier TF and/or LF (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The PF and PP abilities of professional rugby union players were related to individual BM and these relationships were differentially affected by ratio (enhanced) and allometric (removed) <b>scaling.</b> <b>Ratio</b> <b>scaled</b> performance favoured the lighter backs over the heavier forwards, which {{could be explained by}} their specific movement patterns within a game. Comparing positional data in such a manner may help practitioners to better quantify, assess and monitor the position-specific needs of athletes in team sport...|$|R
30|$|No methods {{produced}} {{death rates}} of zero in this study, {{but it is}} worth noting that the Rate <b>Ratio</b> <b>Scaling</b> method is susceptible to producing them. When there are no deaths in one particular period-cohort in a region in the base period the rate ratio will be zero, and the resulting projected death rate will therefore also be zero. The theoretical underlying death rate is unlikely to be zero. Regions with smaller populations, with small numbers of deaths, will be at greater risk of this occurring. The Broad Age Rate <b>Ratio</b> <b>Scaling</b> is much less prone to this issue due to the use of broad age group rate ratios which are less likely to be zero. Similarly, the smoothing of rate ratios in the TOPALS method makes the possibility of a zero death rate less likely.|$|R

5000|$|The {{coefficient}} of variation (CV) {{is defined as the}} ratio of the standard deviation [...] to the mean ::It shows the extent of variability in relation to the mean of the population.The {{coefficient of}} variation should be computed only for data measured on a <b>ratio</b> <b>scale,</b> as these are the measurements that can only take non-negative values. The {{coefficient of variation}} may not have any meaning for data on an interval scale. For example, most temperature scales (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit etc.) are interval scales that can take both positive and negative values, whereas the Kelvin temperature can never be less than zero, which is the complete absence of thermal energy. Hence, the Kelvin scale is a <b>ratio</b> <b>scale.</b> While the standard deviation (SD) can be derived on both the Kelvin and the Celsius scale (with both leading to the same SDs), the CV is only relevant as a measure of relative variability for the Kelvin scale.|$|E
5000|$|The ratio type {{takes its}} name from the fact that {{measurement}} is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A <b>ratio</b> <b>scale</b> possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value. Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and electric charge. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has [...] "twice the length" [...] of another (= is [...] "twice as long"). Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying [...] "how much" [...] of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or [...] "how many" [...] (a count). The Kelvin temperature scale is a <b>ratio</b> <b>scale</b> because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called absolute zero.|$|E

The Analytic Hier-archy Process (AHP) with its dependence assumptions on clusters and elements is a special case of the ANP. The ANP is a new and an essential phase in decision making, neglected so far be-cause of the linear structures used in traditional approaches and their inability to deal with feed-back in order to choose alternatives not simply according to attributes and criteria, but also ac-cording to their consequences both positive and negative – an essential and so far a missing con-sideration in decision making.

This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected ( [...] , [...] ). Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers, [...] formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if y is judged p times x, z is judged q times y, and if y is judged q times x, z is judged p times y, then z should equal z.
