Indeed, it itself attacked the wishes of European chartism, particularly British Chartism, closer to the resolutions of Portuguese Constitution of 1822 than those of the Portuguese Constitutional Charter.|$|R
40|$|International legal {{scholars}} have increasingly {{noted that there}} is a fundamental tension within the international legal order. On one hand, international law represents a utopian idea that advances aspirations towards grand, yet equally hollow, goals of “peace,” “justice,” and “human rights. ” We see these aspirations embodied in a number of international institutions—the United Nations Security Council strives to maintain “international peace and security” under the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human <b>Rights</b> <b>aspires</b> <b>to</b> establish a “common standard” of human rights “for all peoples and all nations. ” The international legal system hence calls on states to work together to advance these shared interests. However, {{to the extent that the}} international legal system is able to make inroads towards these ideals, it equally is frustrated by new tensions arising from the interplay of the system’s inherent and emerging qualities, such as states’ pursuit of their individual interests and the increasingly fragmentized nature of decision-making processes...|$|R

60|$|There is some {{justice in}} this opinion, as there always {{is in such}} as attain general currency. It may often happen on the stage, that an actor, by {{possessing}} in a preeminent degree the external qualities necessary {{to give effect to}} comedy, may be deprived of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>aspire</b> <b>to</b> tragic excellence; and in painting or literary composition, an artist or poet may be master exclusively of modes of thought, and powers of expression, which confine him to a single course of subjects. But much more frequently the same capacity which carries a man to popularity in one department will obtain for him success in another, and that must be more particularly the case in literary composition, than either in acting or painting, because the adventurer in that department is not impeded in his exertions by any peculiarity of features, or conformation of person, proper for particular parts, or, by any peculiar mechanical habits of using the pencil, limited to a particular class of subjects.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the USSR in 1991, it was thought that Russian Federation gave up on plans of territorial expansion or kin-state nationalism, despite some 25 million Russians living in neighboring countries outside Russia. However, in modern times, it has been proposed [...] that the annexation of Crimea in 2014 proves Russia's adherence to irredentism even today. This led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with large parts of Russian far <b>right</b> movement <b>aspiring</b> <b>to</b> annex even more land from Ukraine, including the unrecognized Novorossiya. Vladimir Socor proposed that Vladimir Putin's speech after the annexation of Crimea was a de facto [...] "manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism". Some Russian nationalists seek to annex parts of the [...] "Near abroad", such as the Baltic states, while there are fears of potential escalation due to Russian irredentist aspirations in northern Kazakhstan, as well.|$|R
40|$|Standardization, {{formerly}} one of {{the foremost}} preoccupations of Romanian linguists, should be done by experts, without ignoring the reality of usage itself. The factors and influences acting on standardization (and conventionalization) are more or less formal, and their contribution can, at best, confirm and justify the trends in usage. Academics, linguists and teachers have a professional and spiritual, cultural duty: ensuring the accuracy of both use and adaptations, and pointing out confusion as far as misuse of words and structures is concerned, while fighting abuse. There are several categories of difficulties inherent in standardization, including paronymy. Establishing norms or standards, has, in our opinion, several degrees of applicability of the norm or convention. The authors supply such examples, and revise, while trying to assess, some types of standardization, as illustrated by common normative dictionaries such as DOOM 2. In the face of the unwanted action conducted by the prophets of linguistic standardization, who try to impose ad hoc, inflexible rules, and of etymological fallacy, the Romanian language (“la langue romane la moins fixée”) has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>aspire</b> <b>to</b> “the art of compromise”. If we compare and analyse the achievements of British and American lexicography in the field of standardization and didactics, if school does more in order to improve language standardization and cultivation, new and better practices could appear in this country, by turning to account the comparative-contrastive approach, and also interactive handbooks (in either printed or electronic format), and guides to correct Romanian and English...|$|R

In May 2010 Belarus was subject to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) — an ongoing mechanism of the main UN human rights agency — the UN Human Rights Council, created for the purpose of systematic and comprehensive analysis of the situation in the sphere of human rights in all UN member states. Interactive discussion within the framework of the UPR of Belarus demonstrated high interest in the experience of Belarus in the sphere of the whole complex of human rights. Over 30 states, representing all regions of the world, clearly and unequivocally approved the policy of the Belarusian state on the motivation and protection of human rights. UN member states highly appreciated the success of Belarus in the sphere of providing social and economic rights, including the right to education, health protection, social protection, gender equality, state support of the family, motivation of children’s rights.

40|$|Studies of {{migration}} are usually about movement, {{but what about}} people who <b>aspire</b> <b>to</b> migrate but whose attempts to do so remain largely unsuccessful? The focus of this thesis is not migration per se, but people’s aspirations of transnational mobility. Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2005 and 2007 in Ziguinchor, a crossroads town in the Casamance region of southern Senegal, this thesis examines how men and women imagine and attempt to cross international borders. It {{is important to consider}} the push and pull factors behind their aspirations: why does their current situation make them want to leave Senegal, and equally, why are they attracted to the West? I use four examples to address the importance {{of migration}} in the life-trajectories of Senegalese people. I discuss how some women have turned to online-dating websites in the hope of forming relationships with European men who could lead to a future outside of Senegal. I then consider a group of women for whom sex-work is not just a way of making money but a migration strategy in its own <b>right.</b> Men also <b>aspire</b> <b>to</b> migrate, and using the examples of côtéman (local beach-boys) and clandestine migrants boarding pirogues to the Canary Islands I discuss male strategies for departure. Côtéman claim that ‘making contacts’ with tourists is a means to migrating, whereas unlike the other strategies discussed in this thesis, clandestine migrants do more than just imagine and embark on illegal sea voyages in the hope of arriving in Europe. Whilst there are many similarities between male and female migratory aspirations, we can see very distinct gender differences: women are seeking relationships of dependence on which to base their futures, whereas men only want temporary assistance. These new migration strategies exist within a West African country that has a long and complex history of migrations. Rather than concentrating on the importance of existing migratory networks, however, this thesis discusses very individualised ways of thinking about migration. Some of the choices made by hopeful migrants may appear to be both psychologically and financially irrational, but I show the reasons behind their decisions to invest time and effort into migration strategies that remain largely unsuccessful...|$|R
