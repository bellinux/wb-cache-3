We first discuss the achievable data rates with different <b>relaying</b> <b>methods</b> under specific channel conditions, and then propose an algorithm with polynomial-time complexity that provides a sub-optimal solution to the <b>relaying</b> <b>method</b> selection problem.

40|$|Abstract—Physical-layer network coding (PNC) is a {{promising}} technique {{for improving the}} throughput of wireless networks. To implement PNC in practice, a suitable medium access control (MAC) protocol is needed. Existing works mainly focus on bidirectional PNC, where two nodes exchange their packets with each other. Considering the case where unidirectional flows exist, in this paper, we propose a distributed MAC protocol to support PNC with overhearing. The proposed protocol is compatible with conventional <b>relaying</b> <b>methods,</b> including con-ventional network coding and plain routing. It {{is based on the}} Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism and can be regarded as an extension to the IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can increase the throughput of networks with unidirectional flows, especially when the traffic load is heavy.

By means of a maximum of three relay tests, with additional delay, models with up to five parameters can be built. The proposed procedure does not present any convergence problem and is equivalent to the original one in terms of relative accuracy and duration of tests. The application of the identification procedure to a much wider set than in the original paper shows that the model obtained from the identification presents good accuracy in the high-frequency region, while some discrepancies of different nature may be present in the low frequency. When a suitable tuning method, which exploits this characteristic, is adopted, reasonably good closed-loop performance can be achieved for proportional-integral control in all cases. The low sensitivity to experimental errors and the simple implementation make the method interesting for application in industrial autotuners.

However, the performance of TCP degrades quickly as the number of hops increases. How to improve the performance of TCP over multihop wireless mesh network, especially given the existing 802. 11 MAC, has been an interesting research problem. Application layer <b>relay</b> <b>method,</b> which splits a traditional end-to-end TCP connection into several short hop connections, has been proposed as a solution in the wired world to improve the TCP performance.

With the present of relays, the nodes in wireless networks act more independently and the round trip time is reduced also. However, relays also increase competition within the network. To reduce the competition, we propose a simple scheduling process to coordinate the relay nodes.
