50|$|A <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodule</b> {{is a local}} {{swelling}} or tissue lump, usually rather firm to touch, like an unripe fruit, {{which occurs}} almost exclusively in association with rheumatoid arthritis. Very rarely rheumatoid nodules occur as rheumatoid nodulosis {{in the absence of}} arthritis. They are usually subcutaneous especially over bony prominences such as the olecranon (tip of the elbow) or the interphalangeal joints (finger knuckles). Less commonly they occur in the lining of the lung and other internal organs. The occurrence of nodules in the lung of miners exposed to silica dust was known as Caplan's syndrome. Nodules vary in size from that of a lentil or pea to that of a mandarin orange. Quite often they are associated with synovial pockets or bursae. About 5% of rheumatoid arthritis patients have such nodules within two years of disease onset, and the cumulative prevalence is about 25%. In the great majority of cases nodules are not painful or disabling in any way, being more of an unsightly nuisance, but in some cases they can be painful, especially if the overlying skin breaks down. Rarely, the nodules occur at diverse sites on body (e.g. upper eyelid, distal region of the soles of the feet, vulva and internally in the gallbladder, lung, heart valves, larynx, and spine).|$|E

40|$|Objective : The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the T cell receptor (TCR) family usage in T cell-lines from subcutaneous nodules and synovium from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with specific reference to the duration of symptoms. In vitro adherence characteristics of nodular T cells was studied as well. Methods : Monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the distribution of TCR families in T cell-lines from synovium of patients with early and long-standing RA, from <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> and control tissues. An in vitro binding assay with T cell-lines from 2 <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> was performed. Results : In early RA synovium, a restricted TCR family usage was observed in 5 out of 8 patients, contrary to long-standing disease, peripheral blood ileum and colon. In RA nodules, a similar degree of restriction was noted. Moreover; the same TCR family was overexpressed by T cell-lines from different nodules derived from the same patient. T cell-lines from <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> demonstrated a preferential in vitro adherence to rheumatoid synovium and <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules,</b> while no binding was observed on skin or tonsil. Conclusion : The TCR spectrum among RA synovial cell-fines broadens in relation to the disease duration. The overexpression of the same TCR family in different <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> from the same patients, and the in vitro adherence of T cell-lines from <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> may be indicative for recirculation between the different disease manifestations in RA...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} smoking {{is a risk}} factor for <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> in early <b>rheumatoid</b> arthritis, and if so to {{determine}} the quantitative effect of smoking. Methods: From a cohort (n = 1589) in a structured programme for follow up of newly diagnosed cases of rheumatoid arthritis (symptoms of swollen joints (12 months), 112 individuals with <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> at inclusion were identified. Nodular patients were each compared with two age and sex matched controls without nodules from the same cohort. A detailed self administered tobacco use questionnaire was answered by 210 patients (63 %). Results: Seventy patients were current smokers, 71 former smokers, and 69 had never smoked. Current smoking and former smoking were more common in patients with <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> compared with controls (86 % v 59 %) in both sexes. Positive rheumatoid factor (RF) was found more often among cases with nodules than controls (78 % v 64 %). Using detailed information from the questionnaires with conditional logistic regression analyses, ever having smoked was associated with an increased risk of the presence of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> (odds ratio (OR) = 7. 3 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 3 to 23. 6); p = 0. 001). The risk of having nodules was not obviously dose dependent when smoking duration as well as smoking amount were examined. A stratified analysis showed that only RF positive smokers had an increased risk of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules.</b> Smoking was associated with <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> among both men (p = 0. 006) and women (p = 0. 001). Tobacco use other than smoking (n = 31) was not associated with an increased risk of nodules (OR = 0. 8 (0. 2 to 3. 4); p = 0. 813). Conclusions: There is a strong association between smoking and <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> in early seropositive rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY An {{attempt was}} made to examine the {{pathophysiology}} of the <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodule.</b> Significant amounts of interleukin 1 -like activity and prostaglandin E 2 were detected in the supernatants from in vitro organ cultures of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodule</b> tissue. When fresh (but not old) rheumatoid nodules were minced and cultured in vitro prominent outgrowths of cells were observed. These cells expressed both HLA-DR and CD 14 antigens but lacked conventional differentiation antigens for T cells and B cells, suggesting that they are of monocyte-macrophage origin. These data suggest that interleukin 1 and prostaglandin E 2 may be deeply involved in the formation of rheumatoid nodules. Key words: rheumatoid arthritis, interleukin 1, prostaglandins. Rheumatoid nodules occur in approximately 20 % of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 1 These patients with rheumatoid arthritis tend to have high titres of rheumatoid factor.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> are {{the most}} common extra-articular {{findings}} in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. They occur most commonly at pressure points such as the extensor surfaces of the forearms, fingers, and occiput, but have also been reported to occur in unusual locations including the central nervous system, pericardium, pleura, and sclera. We present the unusual case of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> in the small bowel mesentery masquerading as an intra-abdominal malignancy. Case presentation A 65 -year-old-male with a known history of longstanding erosive, nodular, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis was incidentally found to have a mesenteric mass on computed tomography (CT) exam of the abdomen. This mass had not been present on prior imaging studies and was worrisome for a malignancy. Attempts at noninvasive biopsy were nondiagnostic but consistent with a "spindle" cell neoplasm. Laparotomy revealed extensive thickening and fibrosis of the small bowel mesentery along with large, firm nodules throughout the mesentery. A limited bowel resection including a large, partially obstructing, nodule was performed. Pathology was consistent with an unusual presentation of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> in the mesentery of the small bowel. Conclusion <b>Rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient who presents with an intra-abdominal mass and a history of rheumatoid arthritis. Currently, no tests or imaging modality can discriminate with sufficient accuracy to rule out a malignancy in this difficult diagnostic delimma. Hopefully, this case will serve as impetus for further study and biomarker discovery to allow for improved diagnostic power. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Rheumatoid nodules {{are common}} extra-articular {{findings}} occurring in 20 % of rheumatoid arthritis patients. They develop most commonly subcutaneously in pressure areas (elbows and finger joints) and may occasionally affect internal organs including pleura, lungs, meninges, larynx, {{and in other}} connective tissues elsewhere in the body Case presentation We present {{the case of a}} 62 -year-old male who presented with a midline neck mass. Clinically it moved on swallowing and tongue protrusion-suggesting attachment to the thyrohyoid membrane. Ultrasound examination revealed a cystic lesion in the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy in a non-smoker. The neck was explored and histological examination of the excised lesion which was attached to the thyrohyoid membrane revealed a <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodule.</b> Conclusion A <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodule</b> of the thyrohyoid membrane is very rare. The triple diagnostic scheme of clinical examination supplemented with ultrasound and guided fine needle aspiration for neck lumps remains valid in most cases. If excision is indicated we feel it should be performed in such a manner that the scar tract could easily be encompassed in a neck dissection excision should definitive histological examination be adverse. We suggest that when dealing with patients with established rheumatoid arthritis one should consider a <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodule</b> as a differential diagnosis for any swelling on the patient whether it be subcutaneous or deep. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: <b>Rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules</b> are {{possible}} extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis. These lesions are mainly located in subcutaneous tissues {{but may also}} rarely affect deep organs, exceptionally the meninges. CASE REPORT: We report herein a case of meningeal nodules observed in a 52 -year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent brain MRI to explore an acute visual impairment. Subsequent MRIs showed similar new lesions contrasting with total regression of the initially observed lesions. The final control brain MRI performed {{four years after the}} onset of the ocular symptoms disclosed total involution of all the extra-axial nodular lesions, a course highly suggestive of meningeal <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules.</b> CONCLUSION: During the follow-up period of this case, the patient was treated with methotrexate at doses too low to cross the blood brain barrier. Consequently, it is most likely that the meningeal lesions developed during the natural course of the disease. Despite the non-specific features of the first imaging findings, the radiological changes observed over time were consistent with the final diagnosis of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>nodules...</b>|$|R

We measured the nodules before injection and 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after injection. Possible side effects were recorded. Results: We found that {{the volume of the}} nodules injected with triamcinolon acetonide reduced significantly (p= 0. 011), from 130 to 8 mm 3 (median calculated size) at 12 weeks, compared with baseline. Furthermore, at 12 weeks, the difference between the groups was significant (p= 0. 03). The median size of the placebo nodules diminished as well, from 358 to 237 mm 3, but this was not significant.
