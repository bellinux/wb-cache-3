5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E

5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> choice-making.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald was a {{classical}} liberal in the 19th-century tradition of John Stuart Mill. He believed in individual freedom and <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> {{feared that the}} growth of government bureaucracy would threaten liberty. For him, {{the role of the}} state was to provide basic services. He supported public ownership of utilities like the Nova Scotia Power Commission, but rejected calls for more interventionist policies such as government ownership of key industries or big loans to private companies.|$|E

Curto thought that the employees might not bear sole <b>responsibility,</b> <b>and</b> that the liability of Litoral Gas had to be investigated as well.|$|E

5|$|St. Augustine (354430) {{believed}} that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and <b>responsibility,</b> <b>and</b> God not being the cause of evil, but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived {{at the same moment}} and born at approximately the same time.|$|E
5|$|The 1962 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was a moderately active Pacific {{hurricane season}} that included two hurricane landfalls.

50|$|The {{birth mother}} of the child, even in cases of surrogacy, {{automatically}} acquires parental <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> rights for her child. Only a father {{who is married to}} the mother at the time of conception or subsequently before the birth, automatically acquires parental <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> rights. A non-marital father will not automatically acquire the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> rights even if he is the child's biological father. From 4 May 2006, with the introduction of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006, a father named on the child's birth certificate also automatically obtains <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> rights. It {{is important to note that}} the Act only applies to births from 4 May 2006 and any previous births would have to be re-registered by both parents in order for the father to obtain legal status.|$|R

5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), over the welfare of animals, {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E
5|$|According to our {{surviving}} narratives, {{the three}} kings of Rome during the Etruscan occupation were Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus. During this period the army underwent a reformation into a centurial army based on socio-economic class. This reformation is traditionally attributed to Servius Tullius, {{the second of}} the Etruscan kings. Tullius had earlier carried out the first Roman census of all citizens. Livy tells us that Tullius reformed the army by transplanting onto it the structure derived originally for civil life {{as a result of this}} census. At all levels, military service was, at this time, considered to be a civic <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> a way of advancing one's status within society.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
