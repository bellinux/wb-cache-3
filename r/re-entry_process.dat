40|$|Changing {{down-hole}} conditions {{observed during}} hydrocarbon exploration can be divers. Some desired ones concern oil/gas shows while others may vary from borehole/drilling fluid association and pressure situations. Managing pressure variations and geopressure zones while drilling {{has been an}} issue of concern which has yield generic positive results over the years. However pre-pressure zones (i. e. zones above pressure zones), can display characteristics that are worthy of note {{in view of the}} underlying rock potential. Pore pressure and fracture pressure has been evaluated using Eaton’s equations amongst others on data for some reservoir of Agbada formation in the petroliferous Niger Delta. This is in view of knowing the potential of this pre-pressured zone with effective porosity and water saturation necessitated by production operations and well <b>re-entry</b> <b>processes.</b> These computations adopted various pressure models and have yielded good result presented as plots. It was observed that depth of rock units is the main indicator of rock shrinkage leading to increase in fracture due to increase in production and hydraulic fracturing. Adequate attention must be paid to the integrity (density) of the explored formation as they become sandwiched with under-compacted argillaceous sediments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{proteasome}} is {{the major}} protease for intracellular protein degradation. The influx rate of protein substrates and the exit rate of the fragments/products are regulated {{by the size of}} the axial channels. Opening the channels is known to increase the overall degradation rate and to change the length distribution of fragments. We develop a mathematical model with a flux that depends on the gate size and a phenomenological cleavage mechanism. The model has Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Vmax that is inversely related to the length of the substrate, as observed in the in vitro experiments. We study the distribution of fragment lengths assuming that proteasomal cleavage takes place at a preferred distance from the ends of a protein fragment, and find multipeaked fragment length distributions similar to those found experimentally. Opening the gates in the model increases the degradation rate, increases the average length of the fragments, and increases the peak in the distribution around a length of 8 – 10 amino acids. This behavior is also observed in immunoproteasomes equipped with PA 28. Finally, we study the effect of <b>re-entry</b> of <b>processed</b> fragments in the degradation kinetics and conclude that re-entry is only expected to affect the cleavage dynamics when short fragments enter the proteasome much faster than the original substrate. In summary, the model proposed in this study captures the known characteristics of proteasomal degradation, and can therefore help to quantify MHC class I antigen processing and presentation...|$|R

English Diploma Program, Faculty of Letters and Fine Arts, Sebelas Maret University. This final project {{report is}} written {{based on the}} job {{training}} conducted at the International Office of Sebelas Maret University for three months, started from February to April. The data of the final project report were obtained by observing and having interview with international students of UNS. The observation and interview were conducted during the job training at the International Office of UNS. The objectives of the final project report are to identify the kinds of immigration services provided by the International Office of UNS and to know the effectiveness of immigration service provided by the International Office of UNS. From those objectives, the writer hopes that the International Office of UNS can improve the services, particularly in terms of immigration service. Based on the observation conducted during the job training, the writer found some immigration documents process provided by the International Office of UNS, i. e. visa extension process, converting from visa to ITAS (Limited Stay Permit) process, ITAS extension <b>process,</b> MREP (Multiple <b>Re-entry</b> Permit) <b>process,</b> and EPO (Exit Permit Only) process. The International Office of UNS has done the job as an International Public Relations Officer for UNS well, particularly in providing the immigration service for international students of UNS. It is proven by the height of international students’ satisfaction of the immigration service provided by the International Office of UNS, so the immigration service provided by the International Office of UNS can be considered effective.

40|$|High {{heat flux}} is {{encountered}} in space applications in re-entry flight at the thermal protection system, especially at sharp leading edges such as engine intakes, and in combustion chamber liners. Therefore, {{apart from the}} passive, radiatively cooled heat shield of C/C-SiC, active cooling systems are of special interest for the use in severe thermal environments where the passive systems are inadequate. Active cooling includes film cooling with slit, showerhead, effusion, and transpiration configuration, the latter {{of which will be}} discussed here. Another approach to thermal protection is the ablative heat shield in which the material transfers the energy into chemical degradation. It is used for high speed and high enthalpy <b>re-entries.</b> The degradation <b>process</b> is a complex combination of physical processes and chemical reactions such as evaporation of moisture, swelling, and pyrolysis within the material and recession due to oxidation and nitridation at the material surface and within pores. The material thermal response is governed by heat transfer to and within the component, the reaction kinetics and blowing of the pyrolysis gases.

40|$|The {{procedures}} {{under which}} the coal mining industry based mines rescue organisations for Queensland and New South Wales operate have been developed over many years of challenging training, exercises, rescues, recoveries and, sadly, fatalities. The New South Wales Mines Rescue Service and the Queensland Mines Rescue Service are working together to underpin their operating procedures and guidelines with risk management logic while taking heed of lessons from the past. The initial focus for this undertaking is a crucial aspect of mines rescue operations: the emergency mine entry and <b>re-entry.</b> A three-phase <b>process</b> is being used {{for the development of}} new guidelines for emergency mine entry and re-entry to facilitate integration with operations’ emergency response systems and day-to-day operations. The first phase is the assessment of risks and determination of appropriate controls for Rescue Services effecting a mine entry or re-entry. The second phase is the conversion of the risk assessment into the practical guidelines (2 ̆ 2 Emergency Mine Entry and Re-entry Guidelines 2 ̆ 2), capturing the necessary controls identified in the risk assessment. The third phase is converting the guidelines into systems that mining operations and mines rescue organisations alike, together with other key industry stakeholders (the Inspectorate, Industry Safety and Health Representatives, Industry Check Inspectors etc), can use for effecting mine entry or mine re-entry responses. A particular emphasis in this third phase is the collection and analysis of information in a timely manner and appropriate format to support decision makers, technical support and crews effecting responses. While these efforts focus on the mines rescue organisation provided services and emergency responses, it is clear there are benefits for operations in having systems ready to support the Emergency Mine Entry and Re-entry Guidelines, as there are significant overlaps between information required for most types of emergency responses involving mines rescue organisations and the information operations require in managing their principal hazards...|$|R
40|$|Cultural <b>re-entry</b> – the <b>process</b> of {{returning}} to one’s home culture after an overseas sojourn – is ostensibly {{a return to the}} familiar: familiar places and familiar people. Yet, this simplistic understanding of the phenomenon belies its multi-layered, complex nature. More appropriately framed as a psychological process than one of physical relocation, re-entry is characteristically challenging for sojourners, its impact being felt affectively, behaviourally and cognitively. Despite being a focus of research for half a century, the challenges associated with re-entry remain primarily unexpected, by both sojourners and those at home. The cost –personal, social and financial – of such ignorance is great. As globalization and concomitant increased travel becomes a reality, an increasing number of people world-wide will experience the phenomenon of re-entry. This longitudinal qualitative study sought to explore the experiences and perceptions of six university students during {{the first six months of}} their return to their home culture from an international exchange. Employing a narrative inquiry approach, this study sought openended exploration, the purpose of which was to understand rather than explain the experience. It was motivated by a desire to enhance multiple meanings as opposed to enhancing certainty. In presenting six individual stories this study gave voice to experience, and in doing so, traded generalisation for particularisation. There are a number of provocative findings from this study. First, the study underscored the inherently idiosyncratic nature of each person’s re-entry experience. Second, it reinforced the notion of cultural adjustment as a process, the symbiotic relationship between the overseas experience and re-entry clearly discernible. Third, affective and cognitive processes (internal) – as opposed to behavioural processes (external) – were found to dominate the participants’ re-entry experiences. Finally, relationships emerged as the most significant and powerful variable in the re-entry experience, a finding which positions re-entry as a social rather than a personal phenomenon. While students were the lens through which the phenomenon of re-entry was explored in this study, these findings may be of interest to the myriad groups who undertake sojourns – not only prospective sojourners, but also their families, friends and colleagues, and those responsible for organizing and managing sojourner travel...|$|R

40|$|Acquired {{brain injury}} (ABI) results from trauma that causes {{temporary}} or permanent brain damage. Once critical medical issues are resolved, rehabilitation mainly involves learning and relearning, thus, schools {{play a critical}} role. The primary problem facing educators {{is the lack of}} appropriate school re-entry protocols to facilitate the transition from medical to educational settings. Without proper protocols, appropriate information is omitted, inappropriate decisions are made, and inadequate IEPs are developed (Glang, 2008). This study first looked at identifying any pre-existing school re-entry protocols through a detailed literature review, conducting a review of ABI specific medical and educational legislation, and contacting each Ontario school board 2 ̆ 7 s special education learning consultant to determine whether any protocols existed. Based on these investigations the data revealed that there were no pre-existing protocols. Due to this gap in the literature and practice, the study 2 ̆ 7 s main focus became constructing and evaluating an original school re-entry protocol. The protocol was designed through adherence to policy theory practices and accepted standards of practice found in the literature. To validate the content and structure of the protocol an evaluation was conducted by 13 special education experts using a combination of one-to-one interview(s) and a focus group discussion. Each of these professionals was identified as having prior experience working with children with ABI throughout the school <b>re-entry</b> <b>process.</b> The evaluators were all in agreement regarding the changes and additions made to the protocol post-evaluation and they felt that it would be particularly useful for educators who do not have any experience with the school <b>re-entry</b> <b>process</b> for children with ABI. The designed protocol appears to help bridge the gap between healthcare and education in the school <b>re-entry</b> <b>process.</b> Its application will be able to provide optimal learning environments for children with ABI that are free of barriers that have been documented to occur when protocols are not in place (Glang, 2008).

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{examines}} the petroleum {{effect in the}} Norwegian sectoral composition of labour and the consequential effect for a forthcoming <b>re-entry</b> <b>process</b> to a post-petroleum economy. The objective of the thesis is to suggest an optimal policy-mix based on the Norwegian framework of monetary policy, fiscal policy and income policy to minimize the restructuring {{costs associated with the}} <b>re-entry</b> <b>process.</b> By use of a comparative sector specific employment analysis, the thesis disentangles the petroleum driven sectoral adjustment of labour. This is conducted by comparing historic and present Norwegian sectoral labour composition to the remaining Scandinavia. At first sight, there is few evidence of an intra-sectoral movement of labour from the Norwegian mainland economy towards the Petroleum Sector. However, the intra-sectoral analysis shows evidence of increasing petroleum-related activities in the mainland economy after the millennium. Yet, the properties of the Norwegian Fiscal Rule ensure sustainable intergenerational redistribution of the petroleum wealth. This implies a modest inter-sectoral readjustment of labour towards a new equilibrium rather than a reversal of the effects following decreasing petroleum activities. The government should conduct economic policy to ease the re-entry. Expansionary monetary policy will be the main response. A lower key policy rate will imply increased cost-competitiveness, which will be beneficial for restructuring and ensure readjustment of labour towards exportable technology and capital intensive industries. This will be central due to the current high share of GDP from petroleum. Monetary policy and automatic stabilizers in the Norwegian economy will be important in limiting the repercussions and further deepening of the recession. Fiscal policy is suggested limited due to uncertainties related to the new Norwegian trend development and potential obstruction of the needed structural shift. Further, long-run considerations and the aim to prolong the positive impulses from the petroleum wealth in the Norwegian economy limits fiscal policy-response. nhhma...|$|E
40|$|In {{the space}} {{experiments}} Lithopanspermia, experimental support {{was provided to}} {{the likelihood of the}} lithopanspermia concept that considers a viable transport of microorganisms between the terrestrial planets by means of meteorites. The rock colonising lichens Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, the vagrant lichen Aspicilia fruticulosa, and endolithic and endoevaporitic communities of cyanobacteria and bacteria with their natural rock substrate were exposed to space for 10 days onboard the Biopan facility of the European Space Agency (ESA). Biopan was closed during launch and re-entry. In addition, in the Stone facility, one sample of R. geographicum on its natural granitic substrate was attached at the outer surface of the re-entry capsule close to the stagnation point, only protected by a thin cover of glass textolite. Post-flight analysis, which included determination of the photosynthetic activity, LIVE/DEAD staining, and germination capacity of the ascospores, demonstrated that all three lichen were quite resistant to outer space conditions, which include the full spectrum of solar extraterrestrial electromagnetic radiation or selected wavelength ranges. This high resistance of the lichens to space appears to be due to their symbiotic nature and protection by their upper pigmented layer, the cortex. In contrast, the rock- or halite-inhabiting bacteria were severely damaged by the same exposure. After atmospheric re-entry, the granite of the Stone sample was transformed into a glassy, nearly homogenous material, with several friction striae. None of the lichen cells survived this <b>re-entry</b> <b>process.</b> The data suggest that lichens are suitable candidates for testing the concept of lithopanspermia, because they are extremely resistant to the harsh environment of outer space.

40|$|PURPOSE – Current {{conceptualizations of}} born-globals lack a full {{theoretical}} explanation of strategic re-structuring {{through the use}} of outward and inward-oriented activity and the processes of de-internationalization and re-internationalization. Strategy and internationalization processes are created by entrepreneurial behaviour. If one wants to understand various international behaviours and strategic changes in firms one needs to focus on entrepreneurs – individual managers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to unify the theoretical framework on born-globals by addressing two questions. How do managers move through the de-internationalization (exit) to re-internationalization (<b>re-entry)</b> <b>process?</b> How do they choose their patterns of internationalization? DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – To address these research gaps, this study draws on 26 in-depth interviews with senior managers across nine Australian born-globals.

Upon recognizing that individuals in the study tended to identify themselves as not ready for employment, I sought to understand why they were still expected to begin working using Goffman’s (1963) theory of stigma. I suggest that in many cases, attempting to manage one’s stigmatized status slows individuals’ return to work. As well, I suggest that the stigma associated with time spent incarcerated undermines individual credibility, and for this reason, participants’ assertions that they do not feel ready to begin working are often not accepted...|$|E

In the present study, 401 community members completed an online questionnaire designed to assess the affective, cognitive and behavioral dimensions of attitudes towards sex offenders. Differences in attitudes towards sex offenders based on respondent sex, age, educational attainment, occupation, parental status and familiarity with victims and perpetrators of sexual assault were investigated. Females demonstrated more-negative attitudes on affective and behavioral measures compared with males, and respondents with low levels of educational attainment demonstrated more-negative attitudes than respondents with higher levels of educational attainment on cognitive and behavioral measures; however, all groups demonstrated negative attitudes towards sex offenders to some extent.

40|$|The {{success or}} failure of many {{different}} types of treatment is often measured by one type of outcome. For example, treatment for substance abuse might be judged to have failed if a patient “goes on a bender” some time after completing the programme. The same is true for offender rehabilitation. Treatment {{success or failure}} is usually determined by whether or not an offender is reconvicted of a new offence in a specified follow-up period. We know from the literature that offender rehabilitation can have modest but significant effects on reducing recidivism. Yet we know little about what brings about these reductions (i. e., how the treatment worked). This thesis explores possible mechanisms of change in offender rehabilitation. I propose that although a reduction in recidivism is an important long-term outcome of treatment, {{there are a number of}} additional outcomes that have the potential to explain not only if but how treatment works and why it is unsuccessful in leading to a reduction in reoffending for some offenders. Study 1 is a typical outcome evaluation of New Zealand’s rehabilitation programmes for high-risk male offenders: the High Risk Special Treatment Units (HRSTUs). I compared the recidivism rates of a sample of HRSTU completers with a comparison sample of high-risk offenders who had not completed the programme (a between-subjects design). I found that relative to the comparison group, treatment completers had significantly lower rates of four different indices of recidivism, varying in severity. The remainder of the thesis explored possible mechanisms of change within the HRSTU sample (a within-subjects design). Study 2 examined immediate outcomes of treatment, which I defined as within-treatment change on dynamic risk factors. I found that offenders made significant change on the Violence Risk Scale during treatment, but there was no significant relationship between treatment change and recidivism. Studies 3 and 4 examined intermediate outcomes of treatment, which I defined as barriers (risk factors) and facilitators (protective factors) that influence the process of offender re-entry. Study 3 validated an instrument designed to measure these factors: the Dynamic Risk Assessment for Offender Re-entry (DRAOR). I found that the tool had good convergent validity and reliably predicted recidivism above a static risk estimate. Study 4 used the newly validated DRAOR to test an explanation for the lack of a direct relationship between treatment change and recidivism. I tested whether treatment change had an indirect relationship with recidivism through its influence on the <b>re-entry</b> <b>process.</b> I found that treatment change was related to a number of re-entry outcomes; however, only two models could be tested for mediation because the re-entry outcomes themselves lacked predictive ability. Nevertheless, findings from Study 4 suggest the <b>re-entry</b> <b>process</b> is an area worthy of further investigation. Taken together, the findings from this thesis highlight the importance of considering alternative treatment outcomes in addition to whether or not a programme leads to a reduction in long-term recidivism outcomes. Answering the question of how treatment works requires an exploration into possible mechanisms of change. This thesis was only a preliminary investigation into such mechanisms; however, the findings have both practical and theoretical implications for the way we conceptualise how treatment programmes work. Developing a greater understanding of mechanisms of change in offender rehabilitation has the potential to lead to the design and delivery of more effective programmes...|$|E

Mobile WiMAX IEEE 802. 16 e standard enabled convergence of mobile and ﬁxed broadband networks through a common wide-area radio-access technology and ﬂexible network architecture. It aims to provide seamless support to its users but an inevitable is that the long delay which occurs during the handoff management in every network process. This paper proposes a Dynamic Interval based Processing Algorithm to separate ping-pong users from the pool of users and to process them separately thus reducing the overhead of network <b>re-entry</b> <b>process.</b> Incoming users are divided into three categories like new user, old user and ping pong user. New user should undergo all the phases of network entry process, old user is provided with authentication key which leads to skipping of steps in generation of keys. Proposed algorithm deals with identifying the ping pong users by calculating the inter arrival duration and rate with same base station. When assured authenticated ping-pong users enter the network next time within the allotted time they will be provided with last used Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) thus bypassing key generation phase. It is observed that the proposed work performs the authentication phase and cancels the key generation phase which leads to minimum network entry delay and it saves to the maximum of 80 % processing time. The network model was developed using Network Simulator and the algorithm was implemented in MATLAB GUIDE which gets connected to the database developed in MYSQL. This approach is justified through its timing analysis result which proves the efficient swift in the handoff processes...|$|E
40|$|Background A {{considerable}} number of children are confronted with a chronic or long-term illness in their lives. For these children, absenteeism is problematic, because education {{plays a major role}} in stimulating their cognitive development and in promoting a sense of normalcy and psychosocial well-being. In the literature, a great deal of attention has been paid to school reintegration programmes, which try to counter the barriers that these children may face when they return to school. Another way of surmounting these barriers is through the use of homebound instruction, in which the educational process for the child is continued during the period of absence. Despite the growing awareness of the necessity of education for these children, there is still little empirical research available addressing programmes that facilitate school re-entry. Methods The major goal of this study is to investigate how parents and their children with a chronic or long-term illness perceive school re-entry after a period of homebound instruction, by using a descriptiveâexplorative, multi-informant research design. Participants were 60 children and their parents who filled in a self-constructed questionnaire. Results Both parents and children perceived the period of homebound instruction, as well as their school re-entry, predominantly positively. Most of the children stated that they had been able to keep up with their subjects, and that they had good contact with their peers when they returned to school. According to parents, homebound instruction made a positive contribution to the school re-entry of their child. Conclusions The current study is one of the first to explore the school re-entry of children with a chronic or long-term illness. According to both parents and children, the school <b>re-entry</b> <b>process</b> passed off positively. However, more research is needed with regard to the quality of education and the programmes aimed at facilitating school re-entry. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Interest {{in human}} and social capital 2 ̆ 7 s {{contribution}} to the desistence of crime is increasingly popular amongst criminologists, economists and policy makers. However, {{little attention has been}} drawn to the influence human and social capital indicators contribute towards the relationship between the <b>re-entry</b> <b>process</b> and juvenile crime at the neighborhood level. The current study hypothesizes the existence of a mediating relationship between human and social capital indicators (2000) and the rates of receiving formerly incarcerated persons (1997 - 2002) and juvenile arrest (2006 - 08) in 92 Portland, Oregon neighborhoods. Portland, Oregon receives more formerly incarcerated persons from Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s state correctional facilities than any other city or county in Oregon. Using neighborhood rates of residents with house-hold income above 50 K, high school graduation, and annual income type: retired or government assistance, as proxies for human capital measures and neighborhood rates of residents employed by non-profit organizations, number of churches, and self-employment as proxies for social capital measures, OLS regression and bivariate correlations tested for a mediating effect between human and social capital on rates of re-entry and juvenile arrest rates. Findings indicate neighborhoods with increased rates of returnees have higher rates of juvenile delinquency. In addition, mediating human and social capital indicators affect the direct relationship between re-entry and juvenile crime: neighborhoods with more residents receiving retirement income, higher percent of self-employed residents, non-profit employees, or higher rates of residents earning income above 50 K had lower rates of returnees in their communities. Greater rates of Portland neighborhoods which house residents with high proportions of house-hold incomes above 50 K per year see increases in the rate of juvenile crime. Rates of neighborhood churches showed a positive correlation with on both rates of returnees and juvenile crime; obtaining a high school diploma was also associated with increased returnee rates and juvenile crime. Neighborhoods with more residents who are self-employed or employed by non-profit organizations had reduced rates of returnees and juvenile crime. Future research and recommendations are discussed to examine the impact of these findings on neighborhoods with formerly incarcerated persons, levels of human and social capital and juvenile crime in Portland, Oregon...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of a culture of control {{has led to a}} rapid growth in the use of criminal-record screening in most Western-European societies over the last two decades. In the Netherlands, the number of screenings performed each year skyrocketed to almost one million. It is, therefore, salient that qualitative empirical evidence on the effects of criminal record-based employment restrictions is still largely absent. In the Netherlands, there is no comprehensive vision on how this preventive instrument should function, no evidence on how it actually functions and no account of its impact on the lived realities of those bearing the stigma of a criminal record. This studyaims to fill this gap: it is designed to provide a subjective perspective of how having a criminal record impacts the process of re-entry into society, particularly into the labour market, for young adults. It is based on the lived experiences of 31 young adults having a criminal record, aged between 16 and 30, who were followed during their process of reintegration into the labour market for average periods of six to eighteen months. In addition, interviews with professionals and parents involved in their <b>re-entry</b> <b>process</b> offer in-depth insight in this process. This study thus intends to provide an empirically valid and individualised account of the impact of having a criminal record on the lives – particularly on the labour market position – of young adult offenders and ex-offenders. Although this study’s focus is on how individuals deal with having a criminal record, it also utilises a multilevel approach to create a comprehensive understanding of how criminal records influence ex-offenders’ position in society. The macro-level deals with structures and cultures of society at large, which shape preventive policies such as criminal record screening. The meso-level addresses the decisions and interactions of institutions and professionals involved in ex-offenders’ reintegration process. The micro-level describes individuals’ lived experiences of dealing with the stigma of a criminal record. This provides a thorough understanding of how crime, employment and reintegration are related. By offering vivid, real-life stories of young adults’ strategies of dealing with the stigma of a criminal record, and how this subsequently influences their position in the labour market, this study will make makes it impossible to ignore the adverse effects of increasingly widespread criminal-record screening...|$|E
