5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E

25|$|In 1993 Peřina and {{his wife}} {{returned}} to the Czech Republic following {{the removal of the}} Communist regime. Many citizens, not least those in the newly emerging military, greeted him with a 'hero's welcome'. Peřina commented that he simply wanted to die on home soil and that it was the country that he fought for and stressed <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> he loved the Czech countryside. He was made a General of the Czech Republic Air Forces.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the ideas}} in The Dune Encyclopedia were contradicted in the later Dune prequel series of novels (1999–present) written after Frank Herbert's death by his son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, {{as well as their}} sequel novels Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), which {{complete}} the original series. Brian Herbert and Anderson have stated <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> in writing the sequel and prequel novels, they used Frank Herbert's own notes found after his death.|$|E
25|$|By 2015, {{there has}} been a major {{improvement}} of Lakota language proficiency levels among students of reservation schools. This was due to teacher training available through the Lakota Summer Institute and to the adoption of consistent phonemic orthography introduced in the New Lakota Dictionary (2008) and the Lakota Grammar Handbook (2016). This orthography and the effective teaching methods enabled teachers and students {{for the first time to}} teach and learn correct pronunciation. It has been reported <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> students are increasingly able to have Lakota conversations with elders.|$|E
25|$|A further {{concern is}} whether, {{as a result}} of this {{security}} argument, Israel will in fact allow the Palestinian community to emerge as a viable and sovereign political unit, a viable and contiguous state. There are also various economic and political restrictions placed on Palestinian people, activities, and institutions which have had a detrimental effect on the Palestinian economy and quality of life. Israel has said <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> these restrictions are necessary due to security concerns, and in order to counteract ongoing efforts which promote terrorism which incite opposition to Israel's existence and rights as a country. The key obstacle therefore remains the Israeli demand for security versus Palestinian claims for rights and statehood.|$|E

25|$|Schools on {{the five}} Lakota {{reservation}} started offering Lakota language classes {{beginning in the early}} 1970s, but Lakota language instruction suffered very low quality primarily due to lack of linguistic and methodological background of the teachers. Positions of Lakota language teachers were filled with native Lakota speakers without teaching accreditation under the assumption that a native speaker is logically an effective teacher of the language. But for several decades Lakota instruction did not result in creating proficiency among graduates of reservation schools. Students and observers reported <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> Lakota classes from elementary level all the way to college commonly involved mere route memorization of isolated vocabulary items (usually the terms for colors, number and animals).|$|E
25|$|In the {{scientific}} method, parsimony is an epistemological, metaphysical or heuristic preference, not an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result. As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation {{that is consistent}} with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available. That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.|$|E
25|$|Frazier {{lived in}} Philadelphia where he owned and managed a boxing gym. Frazier put the gym {{up for sale}} in mid-2009. He was {{diagnosed}} with diabetes and high blood pressure. He and his nemesis, Muhammad Ali, alternated over the years between public apologies and public insults. In 1996, when Ali lit the Olympic flame in Atlanta, Frazier told a reporter {{that he would like}} to throw Ali into the fire. Frazier made millions of dollars in the 1970s, but the article cited mismanagement of real-estate holdings as a partial explanation for his economic woes. Frazier stated <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> he no longer had any bitter feelings towards Ali. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has named the Joe Frazier's Gym in its 25th list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in 2012. In 2013, the gym was named to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

25|$|Festivities {{associated}} {{with the opening of}} the temple were wide-ranging through early 1961. The Ugandan government publication Uganda Argus covered the history and description of the temple in the January 1961 issue and interviews and stories ran on the Ugandan Broadcasting service on radio. Events on site began on the 13th with a unity feast with Hands of the Cause Musa Banani, John Robarts, Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir and Chairman of the regional assembly Ali Nakhkajvani and vice-chairman O]oro Epyeru giving talks. The temple was dedicated on 14th led by Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum where there was a viewing of portraits of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. And the public inaugural service was held on the 15th. Over 1500 people attended. Among the Bahá'ís were some 225 African Bahá'ís from Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika, Ruanda Urundi, Ethiopia, Northern Rhodesia, Swaziland, and South Africa; some 90 Persian Baha'is, sixty-two of whom flew from Tehran; the British national assembly, the mother assembly to that of Central and East Africa, sent one believer from each of its regions - England, Scotland and Wales, as well as one from Ireland; the American national assembly sent one of its members, Amos Gibson, himself a pioneer among the American Indian peoples. Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga was unable to attend due to political turmoil in Cameroon Olinga was attempting to help them with. A choir, especially selected from among Kampala's singers and directed by Peter Wingard of Makerere College sang music and readings offered were from the Old and New Testaments and the Qur'an, plus a number of prayers and readings from the Bahá'í writings in Arabic, Persian, Ateso, Swahili, Acholi, Luganda and English. Following the public meeting a reception was held for representatives of the Governor and the Kabaka of Buganda, together with the Mayor of Kampala at which Ruhiyyih Khanum shared a story that Shoghi Effendi had traveled through the region in the early 1920s. Following the dedication Ruhiyyih Khanum and chairman Nakhkajvani embarked on 15 days of visiting Bahá'ís through Uganda and Kenya including staying in their homes, dedicating two schools, ate native food, and were honored with traditional songs and dances. Khanum suggested <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> the Ugandan's own folklore, their traditions and their native songs and music should not be discarded, but that in a society of unity in diversity they were to preserve and develop these as their contribution in enriching the spiritual and material life of human society as well as noting the equality of the sexes and that women should take equal part in administration of the religion.|$|E

[...] There were initially concerns in Rebellion that the feature would lead to unbalanced gameplay; lead programmer Richard May stated he was [...] "worried it might lead to uber-classes and be a balancing nightmare, losing some of the trade-off structure that the old class system provided." [...] Prolific testing of the game eventually assured LucasArts that the system had been implemented appropriately.|$|E
500|$|As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, Innis grew {{increasingly}} {{hostile to the}} United States.

[...] "We are indeed fighting for our lives," [...] he warned, pointing especially to the [...] "pernicious influence of American advertising.... We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises." [...] His anti-Americanism influenced some younger scholars, including Donald Creighton.|$|E

The young man faces death bravely, admitting that he [...] "should {{have gone back}} to the Wall and warned them". Ned himself passes sentence and beheads him. When Bran asks his father about the ranger's talk of White Walkers, Ned dismisses it as a madman's ravings, insisting that the Walkers have been considered extinct for thousands of years.|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} part of his career, Havelock's {{relentless}} pursuit of his unvarying thesis led to a lack of interest in addressing opposing viewpoints. In a review of Havelock's The Greek Concept of Justice, a book that attempts to ascribe the most significant ideas in Greek philosophy to his linguistic research, the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre accuses Havelock of a [...] "brusque refusal to recognize the substance of the case he has to defeat." [...] As a result of this refusal, Havelock seems to have been caught in a conflict of mere contradiction with his opponents, in which without attempt at refutation, he simply asserts <b>repeatedly</b> <b>that</b> philosophy is fundamentally literate in nature, and is countered only with a reminder that, as MacIntyre says, [...] "Socrates wrote no books." ...|$|E
