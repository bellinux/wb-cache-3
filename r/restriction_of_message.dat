40|$|Short URLs {{have become}} ubiquitous. Especially popular within social {{networking}} services, short URLs {{have seen a}} significant increase in their usage over the past years, mostly due to Twitter’s <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> length to 140 characters. In this paper, we provide a first characterization on the usage of short URLs. Specifically, our goal is to examine the content short URLs point to, how they are published, their popularity and activity over time, as well as their potential impact on the performance of the web. Our study is based on traces of short URLs as seen from two different perspectives: i) collected through a large-scale crawl of URL shortening services, and ii) collected by crawling Twitter messages. The former provides a general characterization on the usage of short URLs, while the latter provides a more focused view on how certain communities use shortening services. Our analysi...|$|E

Taking the physical {{constraints on the}} data flow and the network-induced delays into consideration, the decentralized routing control problem is reformulated as a constrained control problem, and the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>message</b> lengths is no longer needed. By defining a general Lyapunov functional and applying a reciprocally convex combination technique {{to deal with the}} network-induced delays, less conservative and less complex designing conditions are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A simulation example is also given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed designing scheme...|$|R

There is one thing that attracts the average listener to his receiver. He wants entertainment. The spot on the dial where he finds the most entertainment is the spot where the dial will stand. So I want Amalgamated to give the listener a maximum of the best entertainment possible with the least possible advertising talk." [...] It was planned to greatly limit commercial messages, in order to [...] "limit the ballyhoo to thirty words—a curtain announcement at the beginning and the end". (The <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> advertising <b>messages</b> to short announcements at the start and close of each program had been the original network radio policy, until NBC and CBS abandoned it as the 1930s progressed.) Moreover, [...] "in the broadcasting station the plan for the whole day's schedule should {{be in the hands of}} the program manager. No prerogatives should be surrendered there to commercial interests." [...] Wynn stressed the need for high quality programming, so that: [...] "The listener will know that by tuning in one of our programs at any time from 8 a. m. until 1 a. m. he will be able to hear a fine program." [...] He also hoped that, with the country mired in the depths of the Great Depression, his network would provide an additional source of employment for the numerous unemployed actors and other entertainers.|$|R
40|$|Social {{media is}} an area where users often {{experience}} censorship through a variety of means such as the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> search terms or active and retroactive deletion <b>of</b> <b>messages.</b> In this paper we examine the feasibility of automatically detecting censorship of microblogs. We use a network growing model to simulate discussion over a microblog follow network and compare two censorship strategies to simu-late varying levels <b>of</b> <b>message</b> deletion. Using topological features extracted from the resulting graphs, a classifier is trained to detect whether or not a given com-munication graph has been censored. The results show that censorship detection is feasible under empirically measured levels <b>of</b> <b>message</b> deletion. The proposed framework can enable automated censorship measurement and tracking, which, when combined with aggregated citizen reports of censorship, can allow users to make informed decisions about online communication habits. ...|$|R

The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is recommended as a candidate for many hard real-time local-area communication systems. The Timed-Token Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol of FDDI is capable of guaranteeing real-time traffic on an FDDI network with the synchronous transmission mode. This study addresses the issues in implementing real-time communications on an FDDI network using synchronous mode transmission, and guaranteeing the apphcation-to-application deadlines <b>of</b> multiple <b>message</b> streams. Extensive research has been done on using FDDI for real-time communication. Most previous research had three limitations. Delays and deadlines were only considered at the MAC level. Also, in order to simplify the analysis, only one message stream per node was considered. Furthermore, the analytical results could not be verified due to the commercial unavailability of FDDI products implementing synchronous mode transmission. This work removes these limitations and shows a systematic way for guaranteeing end-to-end message deadlines at the application level on an FDDI network. The concept of a Synchronous Server is introduced to eliminate the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> one <b>message</b> stream per node. The subsequent problems faced in bandwidth allocation and network access when multiple streams are allowed on one node are addressed. The design and implementation of such a server are discussed, and a methodology is proposed for estimating application-to-application mes sage delays and guaranteeing deadlines when using such a server. Certain constraints are proposed as necessary conditions for guaranteeing deadlines. It is claimed that deadlines can be guaranteed for synchronous message streams once these constraints are satisfied, i. e., these constraints form a set of sufficient conditions for guaranteeing deadlines. The implementation of the synchronous server allocates synchronous bandwidth to applications based on these constraints. Synchronous mode transmission is implemented to be able to verify the analytical results. Experimental results using this server are provided to support the claims made. Obtaining timing information on different machines also brings up the issue of clock synchronization, and this is also addressed...|$|R
40|$|Steganography is {{an ancient}} art <b>of</b> {{conveying}} <b>message</b> in a secret way that only the receiver knows the existence <b>of</b> <b>message.</b> Steganalysis is the art <b>of</b> detecting the <b>message's</b> existence and blockading the covert communication. The least-significant bit (LSB) insertion method, which uses fixed k LSBs in each pixel to embed secret message, {{is the most common}} and easy one to hide message in an image. However, it is easy to reveal a stego-image produced by the LSB insertion method. In this paper, we will first lead a bit-plane steganalysis on such stego-images. Then, an adaptive steganographic model will be proposed to take off the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> fixed embedding size in each pixel. The model will reduce the embedding error and provide higher embedding capacity. Moreover, to detect the message's existence will be very hard for those stegoimages produced using the proposed model...|$|R

40|$|Unlimited asynchronism is {{intolerable}} in real physically distributed computer systems. Such systems, synchronous or not, use clocks and timeouts. Therefore the magnitudes of elapsed {{absolute time}} in the system need to satisfy the axiom of Archimedes. Under this <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> asynchronicity logically time-independent solutions can be derived which are nonetheless better (in number <b>of</b> <b>message</b> passes) than is possible otherwise. The use of clocks by the individual processors, in elections in a ring of asynchronous processors without central control, allows a deterministic solution which requires but a linear number <b>of</b> <b>message</b> passes. To obtain the result {{it has to be}} assumed that the clocks measure finitely proportional absolute time-spans for their time units, that is, the magnitudes of elapsed {{time in the}} ring network satisfy the axiom of Archimedes. As a result, some basic subtilities associated with distributed computations are highlighted. For instance, the known nonlinear lower bound on the required number <b>of</b> <b>message</b> passes is cracked. For the synchronous case, in which the necessary assumptions hold a fortiori, the method is -asymptotically- the most efficient one yet, and of optimal order of magnitude. The deterministic algorithm is of -asymptotically- optimal bit complexity, and, in the synchronous case, also yields an optimal method to determine the ring size. All of these results improve the known ones...|$|R
40|$|A flush channel {{offers the}} implementor of a {{distributed}} application the flexibility <b>of</b> specifying a <b>message</b> delivery order apropos {{of the demands}} of the application. This stands in marked contrast to the rigid FIFO (first-in-first-out) delivery order of communication with a FIFO channel. The more restrictive the delivery order, the less concurrency possible to exploit in message transmissions over a multi-path system. This paper investigates the possible gain in effective network bandwidth when a large amount of information, such as the transmission of image data, is transmitted over a multi-path flush channel as compared to a multi-path FIFO channel. Analytical and simulation results illustrate that the relaxed delivery order <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> the flush channel may reduce the mean message response time by a factor of the number <b>of</b> <b>message</b> fragments. This difference may be critical in meeting real-time requirements of an application...|$|R

3000|$|... [*]The {{overhead}} <b>of</b> <b>message</b> delivered - The {{number of}} the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> reflects the network resource consumption <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> in the transfer process. Firstly, the copy <b>of</b> <b>message</b> needs {{to take up the}} corresponding cache space to consume the storage resource. Secondly, the message needs energy when transferred to consume energy resource. Lastly, the message takes up the corresponding communication channel when transferred to consume the network bandwidth. So, the number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> can reflect the network resource overhead. The cost cannot be estimated directly, but it is usually related to the {{number of the}} copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network. If there are more copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network, the link cost will be higher. Conversely, the link cost is lower. So, the number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> can reflect the link cost <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> in the transfer process.|$|R
30|$|In the {{injection}} {{stage of the}} copies <b>of</b> <b>message,</b> it can have choice of injection according {{to the level of}} the credibility of the node itself. It can improve the later spread speed of the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> by choosing the nodes whose willing forwarding domain has a higher credibility to inject. If the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> are injected to the nodes which have lower credibility, in the later injection stage, the nodes cannot meet with the nodes injected for a long time to make the injected delay of the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> large. The worst case is that the node injects the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> to the node with credibility value 0 to result in the copy <b>of</b> <b>message</b> turning into invalid. This is because the copied message cannot be injected out through the node.To improve the injected efficiency of the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network, we set up an injection threshold R 0 to make the node with copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> inject according to the threshold value. Thus, it only injects the corresponding copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> to the nodes whose credibility exceed the threshold value R 0 in its willing forwarding domain.|$|R
