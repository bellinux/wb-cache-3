5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} {{at some point}} in their lifetimes and is becoming more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013.

Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, <b>race</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%.|$|E

Data from cyclone phase space diagrams indicated Shary had become post-tropical about 530miles (885km) south-southeast of Cape <b>Race,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> NHC discontinued advisories. Later on that day, the extratropical remnants of Hurricane Shary were completely absorbed by the same neighboring system.|$|E
