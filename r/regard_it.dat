5|$|Although The Thrill Book {{has been}} {{described}} as the first American pulp to specialize in fantasy and science fiction, this description is not supported by recent historians of the field, who <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> instead as a stepping stone on the path that ultimately led to Weird Tales and Amazing Stories, the first true specialized magazines in the fields of weird fiction and science fiction respectively.|$|E
5|$|Unbreakable was {{released}} on November 22, 2000. It received positive reviews, with critics praising its aesthetics, the performances and particularly the score by James Newton Howard. The film has subsequently gained a strong cult following. Many <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as one of Shyamalan's best films, and in 2011 Time listed the film {{as one of the}} top ten superhero movies of all time.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war {{came as a surprise}} to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, who had not been informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E

5|$|Ingres' {{portrait}} of Bertin {{was a critical}} and popular success, but the sitter was a private person. Although his family worried about caricature and disapproved, it became widely known and sealed the artist's reputation. It was praised at the Paris Salon of 1833, and has been influential to both academic painters such as Léon Bonnat and later modernists including Pablo Picasso and Félix Vallotton. Today art critics <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre since 1897.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was decided}} that the battalion's key positions, {{including}} its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent. This decision was met with some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions. In this <b>regard,</b> <b>it</b> was decided that the battalion's first commanding officer would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer—later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940—and that his second-in-command would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major. Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.|$|E
5|$|Small {{numbers of}} frill sharks are caught {{incidentally}} by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using trawls, gillnets, and longlines. In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for sea bream and gnomefish, and in midwater trawls {{meant for the}} shrimp Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as a nuisance, as it damages the nets. This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The film grew {{a strong}} following, which {{expanded}} overseas in the 1980s, and has established {{itself as a}} cult classic. Film critics and enthusiasts now <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as an absurdist masterpiece. It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch, John Woo, Chan-wook Park and Quentin Tarantino, and composer John Zorn. Thirty-four years after Branded to Kill, Suzuki filmed Pistol Opera (2001) with Nikkatsu, a loose sequel to the former. The company has also hosted two major retrospectives spotlighting his career.|$|E
5|$|The first iron {{production}} {{started in}} the Middle Bronze Age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700BC. The Hittites established an empire in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. They {{appear to be the}} first to understand the production of iron from its ores and <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> highly in their society. The Hittites began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180BC. The subsequent period is called the Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its quasi-disinterest in pillage and treasure hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues {{with the intent of}} taking a piece separated {{from the rest of the}} statue without <b>regard.</b> <b>It</b> is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments undoubtedly represented an epistemological progress.|$|E

5|$|The {{milk shark}} is {{harmless}} to humans {{because of its}} small size and teeth. Caught using longlines, gillnets, trawls, and hook-and-line, this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal. Its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range. Off northern Australia, it ranks among the most common sharks caught in trawls, and comprises 2% and 6% of the annual gillnet and longline catches, respectively. This species {{is also one of}} the most commercially important sharks caught off Senegal, Mauritania, Oman, and India. Some sport fishers <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as a game fish.|$|E
5|$|Two {{varieties}} {{have been}} described. Chalciporus piperatus var. hypochryseus was originally described as Boletus hypochryseus by Czech mycologist Josef Šutara in 1993, and {{was moved to}} Chalciporus a year later by Regis Courtecuisse. Wolfgang Klofac and Irmgard Krisai-Greilhuber reclassified it as a variety of C.piperatus in 2006, although some sources continue to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as a distinct species. Variety amarellus, first published by Quélet as Boletus amarellus in 1883 and later transferred to Chalciporus by Bataille in 1908, {{was described as a}} variety of C.piperatus in 1974 by Albert Pilát and Aurel Dermek. Authorities disagree {{as to whether or not}} it has independent taxonomic significance.|$|E

5|$|An Indian Mughal {{painting}} rediscovered in St. Petersburg in the 1950s shows a dodo {{along with}} native Indian birds. It depicts a slimmer, brownish bird, and its discoverer A. Iwanow and dodo specialist Julian Hume <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> {{as one of}} the most accurate depictions of the living dodo; the surrounding birds are clearly identifiable and depicted with appropriate colouring. It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to artist Ustad Mansur. The bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, located in Surat, where English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen dodos. In 2014, another Indian illustration of a dodo was reported, but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 German illustration.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{similarities}} between Pithecanthropus erectus (Java Man) and Sinanthropus pekinensis (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both Homo erectus in 1950, placing them {{directly in the}} human evolutionary tree. To distinguish Java Man from other Homo erectus populations, some scientists began to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as a subspecies, Homo erectus erectus, in the 1970s. Other fossils found {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species Homo erectus. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the fossils of Java Man were the oldest hominin fossils ever found. The fossils of Java Man have been housed at the Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for a renewal of the offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested in continuing the offensive on their own as {{they did not want to}} antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E

5|$|French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut and a Thai colleague, Varavudh Suteethorn, {{described a}} partial {{upper and lower}} jaw from the Aptian-Albian Khok Kruat Formation of Thailand in 1992, giving it the name Psittacosaurus sattayaraki. In 2000, Sereno questioned the validity of this species, citing its eroded and fragmentary nature, and noted an absence of features characteristic of the genus Psittacosaurus. However, in 2002 the original authors published new images of the fossil which seem to show teeth in the lower jaw that exhibit the bulbous vertical ridge characteristic of psittacosaurs. Other authors have also defended its validity, while some continue to <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as dubious. Sereno (2010) proposed that the best assignment for the type material may be Ceratopsia incertae sedis.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system {{was a mixture of}} the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars <b>regard</b> <b>it</b> as being a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the traditional family unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E
5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this <b>regard,</b> <b>it</b> is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E
