25|$|An {{illustration}} {{of the burden of}} proof is given in Howard Marine and Dredging Co Ltd v A Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd, where a shipping company told a client that its barge for hire would hold 1600 tonnes. This is what the Lloyd's <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> said. But the ships own documents, accessible to the shipping company, said the barge could only take 1055. The Court of Appeal (Lord Denning MR dissenting) held that in preferring a more convenient source (the Lloyd's Register) over another (the shipping documents), the shipping company had not been reasonable. It was up to the shipping company to positively prove this, and in the circumstances looking to the register was not reasonable. It is likely that a company's own standards and practices will be relevant to what constitutes reasonable grounds for a belief.|$|E
25|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} with a main gun armament of two /35 caliber Mark 3 rapid fire (RF) guns (one each fore and aft) and eight /40 caliber RF guns along the sides. However, /40 caliber Mark 2 RF guns were substituted for the 4-inch guns prior to construction. The class had poor stability as built {{due to the}} armored deck, and only one ship (either Detroit or Montgomery) was actually completed with the 6-inch guns. References vary {{as to how the}} lack of 6-inch guns was compensated for. The <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ships</b> of the US Navy states that Detroit was completed in 1893 with 6-inch guns, which were removed by 1894, and the other ships were completed with only eight 5-inch guns. In 1895-96 Montgomery and Marblehead had a 5-inch gun added on the forward deck, and by 1897 all three ships had 10 5-inch guns, probably due to an additional gun on the aft deck.|$|E
