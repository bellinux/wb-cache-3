40|$|The <b>rail</b> <b>running</b> <b>table</b> imposes to {{the vehicle}} a forced vibration. It is not smooth but instead it {{comprises}} a lot of faults that give to the <b>rail</b> <b>running</b> <b>table</b> a random surface. Furthermore under the primary suspension there are the Unsprung Masses which act without any dumping directly on the track panel. On the contrary the Sprung (Suspended) Masses that are cited above the primary suspension of the vehicle, act {{through a combination of}} springs and dumpers on the track. A part of the track mass is also added to the Unsprung Masses, which participates in their motion. The defects with long wavelength, which play a key role, on the dynamic component of the acting loads on the railway track, are analyzed using the second order differential equation of motion. A parametric investigation is performed for the case of an isolated defect. © 2014 SERSC...|$|E
40|$|The {{motion of}} a railway vehicle on the <b>rail</b> <b>running</b> <b>table</b> is a forced {{oscillation}} with a forcing excitation (force), and damping expressed by a random, non-periodic function. The motion {{is described by}} formulas and it is illustrated through diagrams which have {{the form of a}} "signal". The railway vehicle has the Suspended (Sprung) and the Non Suspended (Unsprung) Masses. The track defects/ faults are the random excitation for the rolling wheels of the vehicle. In the case of the Sprung Masses of the vehicles, the forces resulting from the excitation (track defects) are not large and have small effect on the rolling of the wheel. In the case of the Unsprung Masses the forces resulting from the excitation (track defects) are large and have grate effect on the rolling of the wheel. The track, is simulated (with the observer situated on the wheel) as an elastic means with damping. The general equation that describes the problem is the second order differential equation of motion. In this paper the aforementioned equation is presented for the case of a railway vehicle rolling on a railway track and its solution is presented for the Unsprung (Non-Suspended) Masses of the vehicle that act directly on the track without the presence of any spring or damper...|$|E
40|$|Train {{circulation}} is {{a random}} dynamic phenomenon and, {{according to the}} different frequencies of the loads it imposes, there exists the corresponding response of track superstructure. Random dynamic phenomena are generally approached through the probability of occurrence (for stochastic processes see [1]). The railway track is modeled as a continuous beam on elastic support. At the moment when an axle of a railway vehicle passes from {{the location of a}} support point of a rail, that is a sleeper, a random dynamic load is applied on the sleeper. The theoretical approach for the estimation of the dynamic loading of a sleeper demands the analysis of the total load acting on the sleeper to individual component loads-actions, which, in general, can be divided into: the static component of the load‚ and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the rail (sleeper), the semi-static component of the load, and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the rail (sleeper) and the dynamic component of the load, and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the rail (sleeper). The motion of a railway vehicle on the <b>rail</b> <b>running</b> <b>table</b> –of the railway track– is described by formulas and it is illustrated through diagrams which have the form of a “signal”. It is a random/ stochastic dynamic phenomenon. The general equation that describes the motion is the second order differential equation (of motion). In the present paper the dynamic component of the Load and the relevant Action/ Reaction on each support point of the rail are investigated through a sensitivity analysis by variating parameters of the second order differential equation of motion of the Non Suspended Masses of the Vehicle ([2],[3]) and specifically the transient response of the reaction/ action on each support point (sleeper) of the rail. © 2014, North Atlantic University Union.
