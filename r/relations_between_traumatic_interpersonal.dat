40|$|Reports of {{traumatic}} events {{by individuals who}} engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) are common; yet, evidence for the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> <b>traumatic</b> events and NSSI is inconclusive. This review explores the thesis that trauma symptoms, rather than the expe-rience of a traumatic event per se, underlie this relation, specifically suggesting that trauma symptoms might serve as a mediator. The literature indicates that self-injury plays an important functional role in coping with trauma symptoms such that self-injury can provide an escape from intrusive thoughts and aversive emotional states, as well as end dissociation and periods of numbness through the generation of feelings. Additionally, trauma symptoms {{have been shown to}} mediate the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> the occur-rence {{of traumatic}} events and NSSI. Taken together, trauma symptoms may {{play an important role in}} the development and main-tenance of NSSI. The review concludes with treatment implications and future directions for research...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> <b>traumatic</b> birth and the {{development}} of permanent facial palsy in the newborn. DESIGN: Retrospective case control study of children with 'congenital' facial palsy. SETTING: Two tertiary referral centres for patients with facial palsy. SUBJECTS: 61 children with established facial palsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios of recognised factors for birth injury: maternal primiparity, high birth weight, and the use of obstetric forceps at delivery. RESULTS: 13. 2 % of those studied had forceps assisted delivery compared to 10. 2 % in the normal population (odds ratio 1. 34; 95 % confidence intervals 0. 61 to 2. 97) 39. 6 % were born to primiparae compared to a national rate of 36. 7 % (1. 13; 0. 65 to 1. 96) and only 18. 9 % weighed more than 3500 g at birth (0. 37; 0. 19 to 0. 74). CONCLUSIONS: There is no association between the development of permanent 'congenital' facial palsy and recognised risk factors for birth injury.

40|$|This study {{examines}} associations between childhood trauma {{of domestic violence}} (DV) with the involvement in intimate relationships violence (IRV), both as perpetrators and victims. The research was conducted in two studies focusing {{on the relationship between}} childhood trauma with, 1) aggression of DV perpetrators; and 2) violence experienced by victims of IRV. Study 1 was conducted on 62 male DV perpetrators in Surabaya and Sidoarjo, while the second study on 21 female non-direct DV victims. All samples were measured by using traumatic antecedents questionnaire (TAQ; Van der Kolk, Perry & Herman, 1991) and conflict tactics scales (CTS; Straus et al., 1996). The data is processed by using correlation and regression analyses with SPSS 18. Study 1 provides empirical evidence of long-term negative effects of childhood trauma on male perpetrators. Study 2 did not find a significant <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> <b>traumatic</b> experiences as a victim of DV with violence experienced in their current intimate relationships, but further study should consider this relationship can occur indirectly.

A total of 229 male Gulf War Veterans from the Ft Devens Cohort were categorized {{by a number of}} mTBIs reported. One-way ANOVA and chi-square test of independence were used to test for differences in total reported health symptoms and diagnosis of chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) or Kansas GWI criteria, two of the most common case definitions of GWI. A total of 72 veterans reported no mTBIs (31. 4 %), 26 reported one mTBI (11. 4 %), 25 reported two mTBIs (10. 9 %), and 106 veterans reported sustaining three or more mTBIs (46. 3 %). Veterans reporting two or more mTBIs (p < 0. 01) or three or more mTBIs (p < 0. 001) endorsed significantly higher rates of health symptoms than Veterans reporting no mTBIs. Significantly higher rates of CMI (p = 0. 035) and Kansas GWI criteria (p < 0. 001) were seen in the three or more mTBI group.

Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of osteoclastic activity in the periodontal bone in front of the traumatic dental occlusion in rat molars. Patients and Methods: Traumatic dental occlusion (TO) was induced in twenty rats, which were sacrificed after periods of 2, 5, 7, and 14 days. Transversal histological sections of both jaws were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and hematoxylin and eosin. Mann–Whitney U-test was used for group comparison, and Pearson's correlation test was applied for the number of osteoclasts and bone area (BA). Results: Traumatic dental occlusion caused {{an increase in the number}} of osteoclasts in the bone of the upper and lower right first molar from days 2 – 5 to 2 – 14, respectively. In the TO groups, the number of osteoclasts on the lamina dura and in the center of the alveolar bone septum, respectively, increased almost 4 -fold and 9 -fold in the lower jaw; and 3 -fold and 5 -fold in the upper jaw, during all periods. In the TO groups, the BA of the alveolar bone septum was substantially reduced. There was a negative correlation between the number of osteoclasts and BA in both jaws during all experimental periods. Conclusions: Traumatic dental occlusion increases osteoclast activity in the alveolar lamina dura and in the center of alveolar bone and stimulates a higher degradation in the center of the alveolar bone septum...|$|R
40|$|Post-traumatic sleep-wake {{disturbances}} {{are common}} after acute traumatic brain injury. Increased sleep need per 24 h and {{excessive daytime sleepiness}} {{are among the most}} prevalent post-traumatic sleep disorders and impair quality of life of trauma patients. Nevertheless, the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury and sleep outcome, but also the link between post-traumatic sleep problems and clinical measures in the acute phase after traumatic brain injury has so far not been addressed in a controlled and prospective approach. We therefore performed a prospective controlled clinical study to examine (i) sleep-wake outcome after traumatic brain injury; and (ii) to screen for clinical and laboratory predictors of poor sleep-wake outcome after acute traumatic brain injury. Forty-two of 60 included patients with first-ever traumatic brain injury were available for follow-up examinations. Six months after trauma, the average sleep need per 24 h as assessed by actigraphy was markedly increased in patients as compared to controls (8. 3 ± 1. 1 h versus 7. 1 ± 0. 8 h, P < 0. 0001). Objective daytime sleepiness was found in 57 % of trauma patients and 19 % of healthy subjects, and the average sleep latency in patients was reduced to 8. 7 ± 4. 6 min (12. 1 ± 4. 7 min in controls, P = 0. 0009). Patients, but not controls, markedly underestimated both excessive sleep need and excessive daytime sleepiness when assessed only by subjective means, emphasizing the unreliability of self-assessment of increased sleep propensity in traumatic brain injury patients. At polysomnography, slow wave sleep after traumatic brain injury was more consolidated. The most important risk factor for developing increased sleep need after traumatic brain injury was the presence of an intracranial haemorrhage. In conclusion, we provide controlled and objective evidence for a direct <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> sleep-wake disturbances and traumatic brain injury, and for clinically significant underestimation of post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances by trauma patients...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{psychotic}} disorders {{who experienced}} childhood trauma show more social dysfunction than patients without traumatic experiences. However, {{this may not}} hold for all patients with traumatic experiences. Little {{is known about the}} potential compensating role of Five-Factor Model personality traits within this group, despite their strong predictive value for social functioning and well-being in the general population. Our sample consisted of 195 patients with psychotic disorders (74 % diagnosed with schizophrenia) and 132 controls. Cluster analyses were conducted to identify and validate distinct personality profiles. General linear model analyses were conducted to examine whether patients with different profiles differed in social functioning and quality of life (QoL), while controlling for possible confounders. Mediation models were tested to assess potential causal links. In general, patients with higher levels of self-reported traumatic experiences (PT+) showed lower QoL and more social withdrawal compared with patients with lower traumatic experiences (PT-). Two clusters reflecting personality profiles were identified. PT+ with the first profile (lower neuroticism and higher extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) presented higher levels of QoL and better social functioning in several areas, including less withdrawal, compared with both PT+ and PT- with the second profile. PT+ and PT- with the first personality profile did not differ in QoL and social functioning. Mediation analyses suggested that personality traits mediate the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> <b>traumatic</b> experiences and QoL and social withdrawal. Our findings indicate that personality may "buffer" the impact of childhood traumatic experiences on functional outcome in patients with psychotic disorder...|$|R

Thirty college freshmen were randomly assigned to speak about their thoughts and feelings about their transition to college (cognitive processing) or to talk about trivial topics. Each participant spoke into a tape recorder for 15 minutes for three sessions within a 10 -day period and completed an electronic questionnaire about benefits and adjustment to college one month later. Cognitive processing was not only manipulated but also measured with a linguistic software program (LIWC) that analyzed the content of the talking sessions. It was hypothesized that students instructed to engage in cognitive processing would report more benefits than those instructed to talk about trivial issues because benefit finding is facilitated by cognitive processing. It also was hypothesized that among students in the cognitive processing condition, those who used the most cognitive processing word...|$|R

40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with thoracolumbar burst fractures (type A 3 in {{the classification of}} Magerl et al.) were studied prospectively {{for the evaluation of}} clinical, radiographic and functional results. The patients were submitted to surgical treatment by posterior arthrodesis, posterior fixation and autologous transpedicular graft. The patients were followed up for 2  years after surgery and assessed on the basis of clinical (pain, neurologic deficit, postoperative infection), radiographic (load sharing classification, Farcy´s sagittal index of the fractured segment, <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> <b>traumatic</b> vertebral body height and the adjacent vertebrae (compression percentage), height of the intervertebral disk proximal and distal to the fractured vertebra, rupture or loosening of the implants) and functional (return to work, SF- 36) criteria. Two patients presented a marked loss of correction and required the placement of an anterior support graft. Pain assessment revealed that eight patients (44 %) had no pain; four (22 %) had occasional pain, three (17 %) moderate pain, and three (17 %) severe pain. According to the classification of Frankel et al., 17 patients persisted as Frankel E and one patient presented improvement of one degree, becoming Frankel D. The mean value of Farcy´s sagittal index of the injured vertebral segment was 20. 67 ° ±  6. 15 ° (range 8 °– 32 °) during the preoperative period, 11. 22 ° ±  8. 09 ° (range − 5 ° to 21 °) during the immediate postoperative period, and 14. 22 ° ±  7. 37 ° (range 3 °– 25 °) at late evaluation. There was a statistically significant difference between the immediate postoperative values and the preoperative and late postoperative values. The compression percentage of the fractured vertebral body ranged from 9. 1 to 60 (mean 28. 81  ±  11. 51) during the preoperative period, from 0 to 60 (mean: 15. 59  ±  14. 49) during the immediate postoperative period, and from 8 to 60 (mean: 25. 9  ±  13. 02) at late evaluation. There was a statistically significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative values and between the postoperative and late postoperative values. The height of the proximal intervertebral disk ranged from 6 to 14  mm (mean 8. 44  ±  2. 66) during the preoperative period, from 6 to 15  mm (mean 10  ±  2. 30) during the immediate postoperative period, and from 0 to 11  mm (mean 7. 22  ±  2. 55) during the late postoperative period. A significant difference was observed between the immediate postoperative values and the preoperative and late postoperative values. The height of the intervertebral disk distal to the fractured vertebra ranged from 7 to 16  mm (mean 9. 94  ±  2. 64) during the preoperative period, from 5 to 18  mm (mean 11. 61  ±  3. 29) during the immediate postoperative period, and from 2 to 14  mm (mean 9. 72  ±  3. 17) during the late postoperative period.

Several lines of research point to sensitization as a model to describe the <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> exposure to <b>traumatic</b> events, subsequent SLE, and symptoms of PTSD. Based on previous findings we hypothesized that immune activation, measured as a high in vitro capacity of leukocytes to produce cytokines upon stimulation, underlies stress sensitization. Methods: We assessed mitogen-induced cytokine production at 1 month, SLE at 1 year, and PTSD symptoms from 1 month up to 2 years post-deployment in soldiers returned from deployment to Afghanistan (. N=. 693). Exploratory structural equation modeling as well as latent growth models were applied. Results: The data demonstrated significant three-way interaction effects of combat stress exposure, cytokine production, and post-deployment SLE on linear change in PTSD symptoms over the first 2 years following return from deployment. In soldiers reporting high combat stress exposure, both high mitogen-stimulated T-cell cytokine production and high innate cytokine production were associated with increases in PTSD symptoms in response to post-deployment SLE. In low combat stress exposed soldiers {{as well as those}} with low cytokine production, post-deployment SLE were not associated with increases in PTSD symptoms.

Associations with specific psychopathology need to be studied in order to sensitize caregivers to the specific needs of this population. The present study aimed to assess the relationship <b>between</b> <b>interpersonal</b> <b>traumatic</b> experiences and specific psychopathological symptoms in a high-risk population of girls and boys living in youth welfare institutions in residential care. 370 adolescents living in 64 different Swiss institutions and their professional caregivers filled out questionnaires on traumatic experiences and psychopathology and took part in structured clinical interviews. They were grouped in 3 different subgroups: no interpersonal trauma, single interpersonal trauma and multiple interpersonal trauma, i. e. interpersonal trauma in two or more domains. Furthermore, associations between the identity of the perpetrator (if the perpetrator was known vs. unknown to the victim) and psychopathology were examined. One third of participants reported multiple interpersonal trauma with female adolescents being more often affected. Multiple interpersonal trauma was associated with more internalizing and externalizing symptoms, but this association was only found with self-reported psychopathology. Male adolescents with multiple interpersonal trauma seemed to be more vulnerable to substance use and affective disorders, while female adolescents with multiple interpersonal trauma tended to have disorders of attention, activity and conduct disorders. Interpersonal trauma (compared to no interpersonal trauma) was not associated with higher rates of PTSD. Furthermore, associations between interpersonal trauma and psychopathology were stronger when the perpetrator was known to the victim. Our results suggest that interpersonal trauma, especially multiple interpersonal trauma, seem to be associated with mental health problems beyond the symptoms of PTSD in this high-risk population. Concepts of residential care institutions should contain trauma-sensitive care and include psychiatric liaison services in order {{to take into account the}} specific needs of adolescents in residential care...|$|R
