Integrated in this scope mount rail is the rear part of the emergency iron sight, designed as factory zeroed flip-up sight. Into the above-mentioned locking ring, the bolt locks by rotation; thus, the receiver with locking <b>ring,</b> <b>bolt</b> and barrel form the breech of the rifle. The APR rifle has a traditional manually operated rotary bolt with three radial locking lugs at the front. The bolt requires only a 60° bolt rotation; both features should be appreciated by the shooter during multiple firings that require rapid projectile placement on the target.|$|E

The oscillations of the joint connection are analyzed {{on the basis of}} reference oscillation patterns stored in a reference dataset, where known clamping force prevailing in the joint connection to be tested is associated with each oscillation pattern. Oscillation energy coupled in the joint connection leads to formation of oscillation resonance in the joint connection. USE - Method for determining clamping force on a mechanical joint connection e. g. form-fit connection, frictional connection, bolted connection, locking <b>ring</b> <b>bolt</b> and rivet connection i. e. blind rivet connection (all claimed), for connecting two components i. e. clamping bodies, by coupling sound waves into the joint connection.

40|$|LEGEND (LEO-to-GEO Environment Debris model) is a {{three-dimensional}} orbital debris evolutionary model that {{is capable of}} simulating the historical and future debris populations in the near-Earth environment. The historical component in LEGEND adopts a deterministic approach to mimic the known historical populations. Launched rocket bodies, spacecraft, and mission-related debris (<b>rings,</b> <b>bolts,</b> etc.) are added to the simulated environment. Known historical breakup events are reproduced, and fragments down to 1 mm in size are created. The LEGEND future projection component adopts a Monte Carlo approach and uses an innovative pair-wise collision probability evaluation algorithm to simulate the future breakups and the growth of the debris populations. This algorithm is based on a new "random sampling in time" approach that preserves characteristics of the traditional approach and captures the rapidly changing nature of the orbital debris environment.

50|$|A {{standard}} beadlock {{is designed}} to clamp the tire bead between an outer and an inner ring. The inner ring may be welded onto a standard wheel increasing wheel width by anywhere from 1½ to 2 inches or may be formed {{as part of the}} wheel when the wheel is made in the factory. The outer <b>ring</b> is then <b>bolted</b> onto the inner ring with the bead clamped between them. Anywhere between 16 and 32 bolts at around 10 ft·lbf are used around the circumference of the wheel to keep the clamp tight. The <b>rings</b> and <b>bolts</b> can cause problems with balancing the wheel and tire because all the added weight is on one side. This style is used exclusively for offroad use.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the sale}} of the company Yuma became the home port of the steamers, ships no longer called at Port Isabel, and in 1878 it was abandoned, the {{shipyard}} moved up to Yuma. [...] From 1879, steamboat trade up river was cut as most of the freight once shipped from Yuma to Ehrenburg and Hardyville for shipment to the interior of Arizona Territory, was offloaded instead at places like Gila Bend and Maricopaville and shipped north to settlements and mines in Central and Northern Arizona, and at a lower cost. Ehrenburg, once major city, the gateway to the interior of Arizona became a minor settlement, only a wood-yard for the passing steamboats. The silver mines and mills in Eldorado Canyon were booming, and to serve it better the steamboats had finally passed beyond Callville up Boulder Canyon, after installing <b>ring</b> <b>bolts</b> along it, to reach the mouth of the Virgin River at Rioville in 1879. There they picked up salt from mines near there, for the reduction furnaces down river for the next eight years. For a short time the mining company also used a shallow draft sloop, the Sou'Wester, to bring salt down river in the low water season. To the south in the Trigo Mountains the new the Silver Mining District and the towns of Clip and Nortons Landing opened up in the early 1880s, but with their own mills, they and the Picacho District mines provided little business to the steamboats.|$|R

The magnetic circuit had two auxiliary air gaps between the rotor and its stationary core. The regulator was a conventional automotive type with vibrating points. As it had no slip rings, it was very compact and rugged, but due to the auxiliary air gaps, it had poor efficiency.|$|R
40|$|International audienceL-stubs are {{commonly}} used to model the tensile parts of <b>ring</b> flange <b>bolted</b> connections. Contact between opposite flanges has {{a significant effect on}} the elastic and plastic behaviour of these tensile joints. In the present paper, the effects of contact between flange plates are modelled via a refined beam model which has been previously applied with success to represent the elastic behaviour of non-preloaded L-stubs and T-stubs. Taking into account the behaviour of the flange in the contact area and bolt bending, a model is developed to predict the plastic resistance of L-stub joints. Simplifications are proposed to facilitate the determination of the contact zone and the ultimate resistances corresponding to failure modes involving flange and bolt. The comparison between analytical results with 3 D finite element elasto-plastic analyses and experimental tests indicates that the proposed model provides good capacity predictions. Effects of contact, and therefore of the prying force, are particularly important in the case of relatively thin flanges. © 201...|$|R

After three days of climbing on its sheer face, and having completed {{the most difficult part of}} the route, my partner and I were heading down. A thunderstorm lasting all night and into the morning had soaked our tiny perch and all our worldly possessions. We began rappelling down the vertical wall by sliding to the ends of two 50 meter ropes tied together and looped through a set of fixed <b>rings</b> <b>bolted</b> into the rock. At the end of the ropes was another rappel station consisting of a set of rings, placed by previous climbers for retreating parties, which we used to anchor ourselves to the rock face. We then pulled the ropes down from the rings above, threaded the ones in front of our noses and started down another rope length. Everything we brought up for our five-day climb to the summit we had to bring back down with us: ropes, climbing gear of every sort, sleeping bags, extra clothes, food, water, and other essentials. All this we either stuffed into a haul bag (an oversized reinforced duffel bag) or slung over our shoulders. The retreat was slow and methodical, akin to a train backing down a mountain, giving me ample time to think. My situation made me think about my work, mostly, about all the projects I have managed, or been involved in managing. As a NASA project manager, I have worked on a number of successful projects. I have also been involved in a number of projects I never saw the end of. I thought about all the projects I transferred off of for other opportunities, projects that were in full stride and ran out of funding, and ones put on the shelf because they would not meet a flight date. Oh yes, I have had many success, to be sure, or I would have burned out years ago.
