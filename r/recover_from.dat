5|$|All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to <b>recover</b> <b>from</b> injury and to reproduce asexually. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.|$|E
40|$|Inducible and {{constitutive}} β-galactosidase {{formation and}} radioactive amino acid incorporation were measured in cells <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> various treatments which inhibit protein synthesis in the cell. Undelayed β-galactosidase formation {{was found in}} stringent auxotrophs <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> amino acid starvation, in cells <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> glycerol or potassium starvation, and in bacteria <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> puromycin treatment. Delayed β-galactosidase formation was found in relaxed auxotrophs <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> amino acid starvation and in prototrophs <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> chloramphenicol or from tetracycline treatment. The length of this delay was directly proportional to {{the duration of the}} treatment. All cells <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> the various treatments exhibited a slightly decreased rate of β-galactosidase formation and an increase in radioactive amino acid incorporation...|$|R
50|$|Cadmium {{recovered}} in zinc smelting {{is the only}} commercial source of cadmium. Gallium and germanium are also <b>recovered</b> some <b>from</b> other sulfide ores. Some germanium is also <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> aluminum smelting.

40|$|A fatal case of Trichosporon inkin {{prosthetic}} endocarditis is reported. The isolation {{sites and}} susceptibility profiles of 10 other isolates are also reviewed. Four strains were <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> cutaneous or subcutaneous samples, four were <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> urine, one was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> peritoneal liquid, {{and one was}} <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> bone.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  3, the implied WTP {{to avoid a}} minute of wait ranges between 0.59 and 0.86 Mexican pesos, while for the CV sample, it ranges from 0.33 to 0.48 Mexican pesos. The WTP <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the {{hypothetical}} survey is considerably lower than the one <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> true choices. While we cannot reject {{the hypothesis that the}} WTP <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the field differs significantly <b>from</b> that <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the CV exercise, taking the results from column 2, we can reject the hypotheses that individuals respond similarly to price and announced waiting time in a hypothetical setting and when facing true choices. The results then cast doubt on the validity of WTP measures <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> hypothetical choices.|$|R

40|$|Emergence and {{distribution}} of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria in environments pose a risk to human and animal health. A total of 82 isolates of Escherichia spp. were <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> cloacal swabs of migrating and non-migrating wild birds. All bacterial isolates were identified and characterized morphologically and biochemically. 72 % and 50 % of isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> non-migrating and migrating birds, respectively, showed positive congo red dye binding (a virulence factor). Also, hemolysin production (a virulence factor) was showed in 8 % of isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> non-migrating birds and 75 % of isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> migrating birds. All isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> non-migrating birds were found resistant to Oxacillin while all isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> migrating birds demonstrated resistance to Oxacillin, Chloramphenicol, Oxytetracycline and Lincomycin. Some bacterial isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> non-migrating birds and migrating birds exhibited MDR phenotype. The MDR isolates were further characterized by API 20 E and 16 S rRNA as E. coli and E. vulneris. MDR Escherichia isolates contain ~ 1 - 5 plasmids of high-molecular weights. Accordingly, wild birds could create a potential threat to human and animal health by transmitting MDR bacteria to water streams and other environmental sources through their faecal residues, and to remote regions by migration...|$|R

40|$|An {{isolated}} pterosaurian caudal cervical (~ postcervical) vertebra was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the Upper Cretaceous Lapurr sandstone ofWest Turkana, northwestern Kenya. The vertebral centrum is short, wide, and dorsoventrally compressed. Although {{the specimen}} is lightly built similar to most pterosaurs, {{it is here}} referred to Pterodactyloidea and tentatively to the Azhdarchidae in that it lacks pneumatic features on both the centrum and neural arch. This {{represents one of the}} few pterosaurs <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the entirety of Afro-Arabia, the first pterosaur <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the Cretaceous of East Africa, and, significantly, a specimen that was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> fluvial deposits rather than the near-shore marine setting typical of most pterosaur discoveries...|$|R
