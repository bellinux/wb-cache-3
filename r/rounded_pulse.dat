40|$|Controllers for {{semi-active}} suspensions have {{to account}} for constraints on damper range, tire force and suspension travel. Two approaches to incorporate these constraints {{in the design of}} controllers to minimize peak values in the chassis acceleration are considered. It is assumed that information on the oncoming road elevations (preview) is available. In the soft constraint approach, the constraints on tire force and suspension travel are included in a quadratic performance index. Two clipped optimal control laws, which deal with preview in a different way, are presented. Simulation results with a 2 -DOF vehicle model on some <b>rounded</b> <b>pulses</b> show that these laws do not work satisfactorily with respect to the constraints. Therefore, the control problem is reformulated as a constrained optimization problem with hard constraints on tire force and suspension travel. Simulations with the same model on the same <b>rounded</b> <b>pulses</b> show that the hard constraint approach handles the constraints more properly...|$|R

40|$|The MnBi/Bi {{eutectic}} was {{directionally solidified}} with freezing rate oscillations caused by electric current pulses. The influence of current pulsing on microstructure {{depended on the}} ampoule translation rate V and pulsing conditions. Continuous electric current had a small effect on the microstructure. Current pulsing with the solid positive had a substantial influence, greater than with the solid negative. For V 52 cm/h, current pulsing transformed sections of the ingot from a quasi-regular microstructure to irregular MnBi, broken lamellae or completely void of MnBi. The reverse was true at 1. 1 cm/h. For the quasi-regular portions, the average MnBi rod spacing l decreased almost linearly with the average current. This result contradicts the hypothesis that freezing rate fluctuations {{were responsible for the}} effect of convection on MnBi–Bi microstructure. The decrease of l with current pulsing was less at high V, where the rods were more <b>rounded.</b> Current <b>pulsing</b> also increased the roundness of the MnBi rods.

40|$|Neural {{responses}} to sensory stimuli often differ between sexes, vary seasonally, {{and can be}} regulated by endocrine activity, but the ecological and physiological mechanisms driving such patterns are not well understood. The current study examined how auditory function in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a vocal teleost, co-varied with sex, reproductive condition and female plasma 17 β-estradiol level. Auditory evoked potentials were collected in response to tone pips (100 – 600 Hz) and a natural <b>round</b> goby <b>pulse</b> vocalization. Additionally, saccule hair cell densities were compared across reproductive groups. Auditory threshold was evaluated in terms of pressure and particle acceleration, and response amplitude and onset latency were measured at 10 dB above threshold. Relative to males, females displayed lower auditory thresholds {{in response to the}} natural vocalization and to tones at 300 – 600 Hz, and had a higher density of saccule hair cells. The 17 β-estradiol level was positively associated with amplitude and latency for the pulse stimulus and with both threshold and amplitude for tones at 100 – 200 Hz in females. Relative to non-reproductive males, reproductive males exhibited longer response latencies at 100 – 200 Hz. The results demonstrate sexual dimorphism in auditory function in a teleost fish as well as intra-sexual variation, partially based on hormone levels. The current research further identifies links between auditory function and reproductive behaviors in fishes and provides a finer-scaled analysis of how this behavior is reflected {{at the level of the}} sensory systems facilitating signal reception...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} discussion about distortionless (steady-state) optical pulse propagation. - 3 A related topic {{of interest is}} laser self-pulsing, in which a pulse shuttles {{back and forth in}} a laser cavity, thereby causing an output train of pulses. Self-pulsing refers to the fact that no mode-locking device is used to force this pulsing behav-ior. The purpose of this report is to prove that steady-state self-pulsing is not possible in the rate-equation approximation with a lumped active medium. (The active medium is assumed to be much shorter than the pulses.) We place the medium in a traveling-wave cavity, which insures that the medium will encounter only traveling-wave intensities. Steady-state pulsing can occur only if there is some pulse shape that will undergo only amplification and delay in a single pass through the material. Loss is introduced through mirror transmissivity, the loss at the mirror being the same as the gain in the medium. Thus the medium experiences the same pulse shape and amplitude over many <b>pulse</b> <b>round</b> trips in the cavity. Using the rate-equation approximation, we have n-ndn-aln + n (1) dt T 1 where n = population inversion n = equilibrium inversio...|$|R
40|$|Described is the {{extension}} of an ongoing research project to build a pulsed time-of-flight (TOF) laser radar device for use in measuring moderately close objects. Although laser based range-finders do not represent a new area of research, they provide an excellent opportunity for undergraduates to enter the area of optoelectronic and electronic system design. In this paper we show how such a project can be realized by presenting technical and nontechnical obstacles that are specifically related to design {{in the context of}} an educational experience. This electrical engineering senior design project allows a team of two students to develop useful teamwork skills in addition to providing a rewarding design and research experience. The goals of the project are to design, build and test a pulsed transmitter, optoelectronic receiver, and time to voltage converter (TVC). The final system will be a single standalone device designed for both technical and nontechnical users. We have targeted an observance distance in the 15 to 75 meter range. Our system uses a laser <b>pulse's</b> <b>round</b> trip time of flight to determine the distance a target is away from the observer. The system will be portable and temperature compensated for operation between 50 F and 80 F. This device is designed for application in the recreational bow-hunting area...|$|R
40|$|The Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) mission, {{expected}} to launch {{in the spring}} of 2002, will carry a unique Multi-Beam Laser Altimeter (MBLA) instrument designed to observe vegetative canopy structure for a nominal mission duration of 2 years. The VCL MBLA is a three-beam instrument where each laser is capable of producing returns with 30 -m along-track spacing and 25 -m-diameter footprints. Identifying the precise location of the point on the Earth's surface from which the laser energy reflects is a critical issue in the validation and application of the data. The resultant geolocation accuracy is dependent on the performance of many components of the VCL system including: laser <b>pulse</b> <b>round</b> trip travel time observation to surface, navigation tracking data, attitude determination system data, timing, laser pointing and body orientation stability, knowledge of instrument and navigation tracking point positions, media and geophysical corrections. Additionally, it is critical to calibrate on-orbit instrument parameters including pointing and range corrections. The geolocation and calibration methodology and algorithms will be summarized. A detailed geolocation error analysis identifying the contributions from each system component, along with the resultant expected geolocation accuracy, will be presented. A brief discussion of the operational geolocation process will also be presented. Science and data validation implications from geolocation performance will be summarized...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} impact of laser pulses on animal microvasculature {{as a model for}} laser {{treatment}} of port wine stains. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat mesenteric blood vessels were irradiated with a laser pulse (585 nm, 0. 2 - 0. 6 ms pulse duration, 0. 5 - 30 J/cm(2) radiant exposure). Video microscopy was used to assess vessel dilation, formation of intravascular thrombi, bubble formation, and vessel rupture. Changes in reflection during a laser pulse were measured by simultaneously recording the temporal behavior of the incident and reflected signals. RESULTS: A threshold radiant exposure of approximately 3 J/cm(2) was found for changes in optical properties of blood in vivo, confirming previous in vitro results. Often, laser exposure induced a significant increase in vessel diameter, up to three times the initial diameter for venules and four times for arterioles, within 200 ms after laser exposure. Arterioles were more likely to dilate than venules. Sometimes, immediately after the <b>pulse,</b> <b>round</b> structures, interpreted as being gas bubbles, were seen within the vessel lumen. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of phenomena can occur when blood vessels of sizes comparable to those in port wine stains are irradiated with laser pulses as used in port wine stain treatment. Thrombus formation and vessel rupture have been described before from histological sections of laser-irradiated port wine stains. However, vessel dilation and formation of non-transient gas bubbles as found in this study have not been described befor...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Clean Coal Technology (CCT) {{program is}} to furnish the energy {{marketplace}} {{with a number of}} advanced, more efficient, and environmentally responsible coal utilization technologies through demonstration projects. These projects seek to establish the commercial feasibility of the most promising advanced coal technologies that have developed beyond the proof-of-concept stage. This document serves as a DOE post-project assessment (PPA) of a project selected in CCT <b>Round</b> IV, the <b>Pulse</b> Combustor Design Qualification Test, as described in a Report to Congress (U. S. Department of Energy 1992). Pulse combustion is a method intended to increase the heat-transfer rate in a fired heater. The desire to demonstrate the use of pulse combustion as a source of heat for the gasification of coal, thus avoiding the need for an oxygen plant, prompted ThermoChem, Inc. (TCI), to submit a proposal for this project. In October 1992, TCI entered into a cooperative agreement with DOE to conduct this project. In 1998, the project was restructured and scaled down, and in September 1998, a new cooperative agreement was signed. The site of the revised project was TCI's facilities in Baltimore, Maryland. The original purpose of this CCT project was to demonstrate a unit that would employ ten identical 253 -resonance tube combustors in a coal gasification unit. The objective of the scaled-down project was to test a single 253 -resonance-tube combustor in a fluidized sand bed, with gasification being studied in a process development unit (PDU). DOE provided 50 percent of the total project funding of $ 8. 6 million. The design for the demonstration unit was completed in February 1999, and construction was completed in November 2000.

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of Lyme disease patients can be cured, at least 10 - 20 % of the patients continue to suffer from persisting symptoms such as fatigue, muscular and joint pain, and neurologic impairment after standard 2 - 4 week antibiotic treatment. While the causes for this post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms are unclear, one possibility is due to B. burgdorferi persisters that are not effectively killed by current antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin used to treat Lyme disease. A previous study showed that four <b>rounds</b> of ceftriaxone <b>pulse</b> dosing treatment eradicated B. burgdorferi persisters in vitro using a relatively young late log phase culture (5 day old). In this study, we investigated if ceftriaxone pulse dosing could also eradicate B. burgdorferi persisters in older stationary phase cultures (10 day old) enriched with more resistant microcolony form of persisters. We found that ceftriaxone pulse dosing could only eradicate planktonic log phase B. burgdorferi spirochetal forms and round body forms but not more resistant aggregated biofilm-like microcolony persisters enriched in stationary phase cultures. Moreover, we found that not all drugs are suitable for pulse dosing, with bactericidal drugs ceftriaxone and cefuroxime being more appropriate for pulse dosing than bacteriostatic drug doxycycline and persister drug daptomycin. We also showed that drug combination pulse dosing treatment was more effective than single drug pulse dosing. Importantly, we demonstrate that pulse dosing treatment impaired {{the activity of the}} persister drug daptomycin and its drug combination against B. burgdorferi persisters and that {{the most effective way to}} kill the more resistant biofilm-like microcolonies is the daptomycin/doxycycline/ceftriaxone triple drug combination without pulse dosing. Our findings indicate pulse dosing may not always work as a general principle but rather depends on the specific drugs used, with cidal drugs being more appropriate for pulse dosing than static or persister drugs, and that drug combination approach with persister drugs is more effective at killing the more resistant microcolony form of persisters than pulse dosing. These observations may have implications for more effective treatment of Lyme disease. Future studies are required to validate these findings in animal models of B. burgdorferi persistence...|$|R
