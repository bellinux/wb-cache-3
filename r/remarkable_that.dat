5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was never intended that they last more than five years. It is <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but {{that they are in}} 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the public}} as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them. In 1939, they asked the United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Kabbah was {{evacuated}} to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea {{almost as}} soon as fighting broke out, and the coup-makers established the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) with Johnny Paul Koroma as its chairman. The following day, Penfold invited Koroma and several of his associates, along with representatives of Nigeria, the United States, and the UN, to a meeting at the British high commissioner's residence. He found it <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> they all attended, but believed it epitomised the esteem in which the office of British high commissioner was held in Sierra Leone. At the meeting, Koroma agreed to open the country's main airport temporarily the next day, which allowed Penfold to organise the evacuation of several planeloads of foreign nationals. The men agreed to reconvene the following day and the meetings continued throughout the week, though almost all diplomatic missions—including those of the UN and US—closed {{over the course of the}} week, leaving just the British and Nigerians in Freetown. In that time, Penfold believed he had persuaded the coup-makers to stand down and allow Kabbah to return but, unbeknownst to the diplomats, the AFRC had invited the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)—the main rebel group in the civil war—to form a joint government in Freetown.|$|E
5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{considered}} the above 'fairy lover' tradition {{to be connected}} to another about a lullaby. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in {{the last half of the}} 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby. This song was so <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> {{two of the}} {{pioneering}} studies were on malaria. The classical studies on the Toll receptor in Drosophila fruit fly were rapidly extended to Toll-like receptors in mammals and then to other pattern recognition receptors, which play important roles in innate immunity. However, the early contributions on malaria remain as classical examples of innate resistance, which have {{stood the test of}} time.|$|E

25|$|The Government quickly {{moved to}} cut off the chances for a repeat of the tactic of setting no rate, by {{introducing}} legislation which set a deadline for approving a budget. Professor Malcolm Grant, a leading local government academic, regarded it as <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> they had neglected to block this gap in the Rates Act 1984. The Local Government Act 1986, which in section 1 required councils to set a rate by 1 April each year, received Royal Assent on 26 March 1986.|$|E
25|$|Although Tacitus {{wrote the}} Histories before the Annals, {{the events in}} the Annals precede the Histories; {{together}} they form a continuous narrative from the death of Augustus (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the Annals survived in a single copy of a manuscript from Corvey Abbey, and the second half from a single copy of a manuscript from Monte Cassino, and so it is <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> they survived at all.|$|E
25|$|Tillemont and Le Beau {{regard the}} revolt of Illus {{as an attempt}} to re-establish paganism; but for this view there seems no foundation. We do not know that Illus was a pagan, though Pamprepius was one: {{it is more likely that}} Illus was a man of no fixed {{religious}} principles, and that his revolt originated either in ambition, or in a conviction that his only prospect of safety from the intrigues of his enemies and the suspicions of Zeno was the dethronement of the emperor. It is <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> Edward Gibbon does not mention the name of Illus, and scarcely notices his revolt.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> {{the inner}} {{heartwood}} of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since {{in many cases}} it is hundreds, {{and in a few}} instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.|$|E
25|$|The metrics of Nonnus {{have been}} widely admired by {{scholars}} for the poet's careful handling of dactylic hexameter and innovation. While Homer has 32 varieties of hexameter lines, Nonnus only employs 9 variations, avoids elision, employs mostly weak caesurae, and follows a variety of euphonic and syllabic rules regarding word placement. It is especially <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> Nonnus was so exacting with meter because the quantitative meter of classical poetry was giving way in Nonnus' time to stressed meter. These metrical restraints encouraged {{the creation of new}} compounds, adjectives, and coined words, and Nonnus' work has some of the greatest variety of coinages in any Greek poem.|$|E
25|$|The fast-growing {{broadcasting}} industry {{after the}} Second World War drove {{deeper understanding of}} the crystallography, phase transitions and the chemical and mechanical optimization of the ceramic materials. Through the complex mixture of different basic materials, the electrical properties of ceramic capacitors can be precisely adjusted. To distinguish the electrical properties of ceramic capacitors, standardization defined several different application classes (Class 1, Class 2, Class 3). It is <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the separate development during the War and the time afterwards in the US and the European market had led to different definitions of these classes (EIA vs IEC), and only recently (since 2010) has a worldwide harmonization to the IEC standardization taken place.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{preoccupation with}} the stage, and later with his {{official}} duties, Schubert found time during these years for {{a significant amount of}} composition. He completed the Mass in A-flat major (D. 678) and, in 1822, embarked suddenly on a work which more decisively than almost any other in those years showed his maturing personal vision, the Symphony in B minor Unfinished (D. 759). The reason he left it unfinished—after two movements and sketches some way into a third—remains an enigma, and it is also <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> he did not mention it to any of his friends, even though, as Brian Newbould notes, he must have felt thrilled by what he was achieving. The event has been debated endlessly without resolution.|$|E
25|$|The Housing Development Board set {{up before}} {{independence}} {{continued to be}} largely successful under Lim Kim San. Huge building projects sprang up to provide cheap, affordable public housing to resettle the squatters, hence removing a serious social problem. 25,000 apartments {{were built in the}} first two years. It was <b>remarkable</b> <b>that,</b> within a decade, {{the majority of the population}} had been housed in HDB apartments. Possible explanations for the otherwise seemingly impossible success was the determination of the government, the large budget allocations, and efforts to eliminate red tape and corruption. In 1968, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme was introduced to allow residents to use their CPF savings to purchase HDB flats, which gradually increased home ownership in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the Maya, {{who had no}} metal tools, created many {{objects from}} a very thick and dense material, jade (jadeite), {{particularly}} all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as belt plaques - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king Pakal, covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from mother-of-pearl and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.|$|E

25|$|The {{reaction}} of Dutch industry and agriculture was a defensive realignment in three directions. First, {{there was a}} shift in the product mix to higher value products (for instance more luxury textile products, livestock fattening instead of dairy farming). This was of necessity a self-limiting solution, as it made exporting even more difficult, so this response led to a further contraction of the sectors in question. The second response was investment in labor-saving means of production. However, this required a level of technological innovation that apparently was no longer attainable. (In this respect it is <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the number of patents granted in the Netherlands was remarkably lower in this period than {{in the first half of}} the 17th century.) Besides, this type of reorientation in investment was undercut by a third response: outsourcing of industrial production to areas with a lower wage level, like the Generality Lands, which solved the high-wage problem in a different way, but also contributed to deindustralization in the maritime provinces.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} some correspondences between the ideas about genius and juno, {{especially}} in the imperial age, the relevant documentation is rather late (Tibullus mentions it first). Dumézil also remarks from these passages one could infer every woman has a Venus too. As evidence of the antiquity {{of the concept of}} a juno of women, homologous to the genius of men, is the Arval sacrifice of two sheep to the Juno Deae Diae ("the juno of goddesses named Dea Dia"), in contrast to their sacrifice of two cows sacrificed to Juno (singular). However both G. Wissowa and K. Latte allow that this ritual could have been adapted to fit theology of the Augustan restoration. While the concept of a Juno of goddesses is not attested in the inscriptions of 58 BC from Furfo, that of a Genius of gods is, and even of a Genius of a goddess, Victoria. On this point it looks <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> also in Martianus Capella's division of Heaven a Juno Hospitae Genius is mentioned in region IX, and not a Juno: the sex of this Genius is feminine. See section below for details.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman armies in the Yildirim Army Group {{had been}} {{weakened}} by considerable losses suffered between 31 October and 31 December 1917. The Seventh Army lost 110 officers and 1,886 men killed, 213 officers and 5,488 men wounded, 79 officers and 393 men captured and 183 officers and 4,233 men were missing. This army had also lost 7,305 rifles, 22 light and 73 heavy {{machine guns and}} 29 guns. The Eighth Army reported 2,384 wounded but no rifles, machine guns or artillery guns missing. Total Ottoman casualties for the period were 25,337 killed, wounded, captured or missing while British losses {{for the same period}} amounted to 18,000 men. During the same period the British reported 70 officers and 1,474 men killed, 118 officers and 3,163 men wounded, 95 officers and 5,868 men captured and 97 officers and 4,877 men missing. This was in spite of odds in favour of the British of well over two to one in infantry and eight to one in cavalry as well as a massive artillery, logistical and naval superiority. It is therefore <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> any Ottoman units survived the onslaught and made the Ottoman fighting withdrawal under pressure a great accomplishment.|$|E
