The installation consists {{of one or more}} tanks that can be operated as plug flow or completely mixed reactors. The tanks have a “flow through” system, with raw wastewater (influent) coming in at one end and treated water (effluent) flowing out the other. In systems with multiple tanks, while one tank is in settle/decant mode the other is aerating and filling. In some systems, tanks contain a section known as the bio-selector, which consists of a series of walls or baffles which direct the flow either from side to side of the tank or under and over consecutive baffles.

This is noteworthy given the OECD standard is formulated as a synthetic sewage analogue. A highly significant correlation with the BOD 5 standard method (n = 35, p < 0. 001, R = 0. 952) was observed for a wide diversity of real wastewater samples.

In this study, we assess a two stage alternating aeration (AA) bioreactor equipped with electroflotation (EF) clarifier, for nitrogen removal within a short hydraulic reTENTion time (HRT). The EF under steady solids loading required a minimum unit height and gas:solids ratio of 0. 006 for efficient clarification. The separated sludge blanket was further thickened with retaining stability when the cyclic solids loading was smaller than 1. 0 kg m^(− 2). In the continuous operation of the bioreactor, the <b>returned</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> concentration increased to more than 18, 000 mg L^(− 1), while the effluent suspended solids concentration was lowered below 5 mg L^(− 1).

40|$|The {{production}} of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles has increased {{significantly in the}} past decades, which has generated concern due to their known toxicity in the environment. As {{a result of the}} production, use and disposal of productions containing TiO 2, TiO 2 nanoparticles are often received by wastewater treatment facilities. The adsorption of TiO 2 nanoparticle to heterotrophic biomass has been previously studied; however, past studies did not address the effects of environmental transformations of the nanoparticles’ surface properties. These changes often occur in the environment prior to being received by the wastewater treatment facility. This study uses gold labeled TiO 2 (Au@TiO 2) nanoparticles to observe how exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation modifies the surface properties of TiO 2 nanoparticles, and ultimately affects their adsorption to heterotrophic biomass. Using instrumental neutron activation analysis, the limit of detection and the limit of quantification of Au@TiO 2 nanoparticles in dried <b>return</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> was found to be 5. 49 mg/kg 7. 02 mg/kg, respectively.

Analysis of Au in the supernatant and the settled solids from the batch adsorption tests yielded an incomplete material balance. The Au concentration of the supernatant suggested that exposure to UV irradiation increased biosorption to heterotrophic biomass.

Abiotic factors were scrutinized and the trend towards a difference was found to correlate with too low initial concentrations of NH 4 -N/g VSS.

40|$|Fossil fuels (petroleum, {{natural gas}} and coal) are the main {{resources}} for generating electricity. However, they have been major contributors to environmental problems. One potential alternative to explore {{is the use of}} microbial fuel cells (MFCs), which generate electricity using microorganisms. MFCs uses catalytic reactions activated by microorganisms to convert energy preserved in the chemical bonds between organic molecules into electrical energy. MFC has the ability to generate electricity during the wastewater treatment process while simultaneously treating the pollutants. This study investigated the potential of using different types of mixed cultures (raw sewage, mixed liquor from the aeration tank & <b>return</b> waste <b>activated</b> <b>sludge)</b> from an <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> treatment plant in MFCs for electricity generation and pollutant removals (COD & total kjeldahl nitrogen, TKN). The MFC in this study was designed as a dual-chambered system, in which the chambers were separated by a NafionTM membrane using a mixed culture of wastewater as a biocatalyst. The maximum power density generated using <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> was 9. 053 mW/cm 2, with 26. 8 % COD removal and 40 % TKN removal. It is demonstrated that MFC offers great potential to optimize power generation using mixed cultures of wastewater...|$|R
40|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{treatment}} plant site and the influent sanitary sewer depth govern the need for and location of in-plant pumping facilities. In-plant pump stations are facilities that consist of pumps and service equipment designed to pump flows from lower to higher elevations to allow continuous and cost-effective treatment through unit processes within the plant. The type of pumps most commonly used at wastewater treatment plants include the centrifugal, progressive cavity, and positive displacement. The three types are listed in Table 1 with the different pump applications. Archimedes screw pumps (progressive cavity) are used to pump raw wastewater and <b>return</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> in treatment plants, but only in larger facilities {{because of the high}} purchase cost. These pumps are popular because they are relatively easy to operate. The focus of this section will be on centrifugal pumps for raw wastewater and effluent pumping applications. Key elements of every pump station include: wet well, pumps, piping with associated valves and strainers, motors, power supply system, equipment control and alarm system, odor control system and ventilation system. Pump station equipment and systems are often installed in an enclosed structure. Pump stations can be constructed on site (customdesigned) or pre-fabricated in a factory. Pump station capacities range from 76 lpm (20 gpm) to more than 378, 500 lpm (100, 000 gpm). Prefabricated pump stations generally have capacity of up to 38, 000 lpm (10, 000 gpm). Usually, pum...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the examination of effectiveness of lime dose in order to stabilization of sewage sludge and comparison of lime stabilized sludge reuse with aerobic digested sludge reuse. Lime and aerobic stabilization were carried out in two laboratory reactor with 40 L capacity. The sludge samples were taken from the <b>return</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> line in four times. Lime was used at various ratios and the mixture was stabilized for 30 days. During the lime hydrated stabilization pH values were significantly increased from 7 to 12. 5. Also, aerobic digester was loaded with raw sludge and mixed by sufficient amount of air for 30 days. The results indicate that the lime addition with the dose of 0. 4 g Ca(OH) 2 g - 1 DS could completely inactive a high amount of fecal coliforms within 1 h and in all of the times was lower than 1000 MPN g - 1 DS after 30 days (p< 0. 01). But after 30 days, fecal coliforms density in aerobic digested sludge could not achieve to Class A of USEPA category. In two stabilization methods, density of viable helminths ova could not reduce to 1 ova/ 4 g DS and could not achieve to Class A of USEPA category. Therefore, these methods could be achieved the reduction requirement set by USEPA for class B (p< 0. 01) and the products could be well used as a landfill cover or a soil conditioner. Finally, our study confirmed that lime sludge stabilization has a higher hygienic effect and more cost-effective than aerobic stabilization, specially, when such sludge is used to dung and modify acid soils...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of ultrasound treatment for sludge reduction during the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> process was assessed. Batch and dynamic disintegration studies were completed using an <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> pilot-scale plant fed with settled sewage that {{was comprised of}} two 1. 2 m 3 lanes, operated as a test and control. A 1 kW ultrasound system was integrated into the test lane of the pilot-scale plant to allow continuous in-line ultrasound treatment of the <b>return</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> (RAS). Seven dynamic trials were completed over an 8 -month period, treating from 1. 7 to 12. 5 % of the RAS with energy densities between 42 and 168 kJ L- 1. During the batch disintegration studies, {{it was observed that}} ultrasound treatment at 42 to 186 kJ L- 1 caused floc breakage and sludge solubilisation. Floc size was reduced by 88 % at 42 kJ L- 1 while the degree of soluble COD release increased almost linearly from 11 to 36 % between 42 to 168 kJ L- 1. A change in the biological activity was observed only at 168 kJ L- 1 with an 8. 5 % increase in the specific oxygen consumption of the treated RAS samples in comparison to the untreated ones. During the dynamic studies, a 20 % degree of sludge reduction was observed treating 10 % of the RAS at 42 kJ L- 1. At these operational conditions, {{there was no significant difference}} in the total COD and nitrogen removal between the control and test lanes. However, a 5. 5 -fold increase in the capillary suction time and a 3. 6 -fold increase in the specific resistance to filtration in the RAS from the test lane indicated a detrimental impact on dewaterability. Increasing the energy input, by treating 12. 5 % of the RAS at 84 kJ L- 1, did not result in a significant increase in sludge reduction, which indicates that there might be limits to the degree of reduction achievable with the ultrasound treatment. Results from the dynamic studies suggested that lysis-cryptic growth was the main mechanism behind the observed sludge reduction. Based on modelling, lysis-cryptic growth could justify 98 % of the sludge reduction observed. Cost analysis results indicated that sludge reduction by ultrasound disintegration was not currently economically viable unless the cost for sludge treatment and reuse increased to £ 961 from the reference price of £ 423 per tonne of dry solids.
