50|$|Flynn-Aird {{syndrome}} is a rare, hereditary, neurological disease that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The syndrome involves defects in the nervous, auditory, skeletal, visual, and endocrine systems and encompasses numerous symptoms, bearing striking similarity to other known syndromes of neuroectodermal nature such as: Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome and <b>Refsum</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|Following {{the initial}} inquiry by P. Flynn and Robert B. Air, only two case {{studies have been}} {{published}} in Germany and Japan respectably but are not currently accessible. At this time there are no indication of further scientific investigation of Flynn-Aird syndrome. However, there is research on other, more common syndromes such as Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome and <b>Refsum</b> <b>syndrome</b> that may help better understand Flynn-Aird syndrome.|$|E
50|$|P. Flynn and Robert B. Aird {{observed}} this neuroectodermal syndrome {{after studying}} one family whose members suffered {{a number of}} neurological symptoms that were consistent from generation to generation. A number of the symptoms overlapped with several known neurological diseases such as Werner syndrome, <b>Refsum</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and Cockayne syndrome, which could be indicative of similar causative origins. However, these syndromes are recessively inherited {{as opposed to the}} dominant inheritance seen in the family studied by P. Flynn and Robert B. Aird. About 15% of family members exhibited full-blown symptoms characteristic of the disease while others showed some symptoms that overlapped with the general clinical manifestation of the syndrome.|$|E
40|$|The ocular histopathologic {{abnormalities}} {{are reviewed}} in a 44 -year-old woman with <b>Refsum's</b> <b>syndrome</b> who was blind and deaf and had polyneuritis, cataracts, and retinitis pigmentosa. The most noteworthy abnormality in the ocular tissues was {{the presence of}} sudanophilic material in the sclera, trabecular meshwork, iris muscles, and most especially, a coating of the retinal pigment epithelium with fat. It is suggested that this accumulation of lipid interfered with the normal generation of retinal, resulting in degeneration of the photoreceptors. © 1971.

40|$|Registro de caso de paciente com quadro mórbido relacionável ao da heredopatia atática polineuritiforme (doença de Refsum). O diagnóstico é discutido frente aos aspectos clínicos, laboratoriais e histopatológicos encontrados e sua relação com os achados referidos na {{literatura}} como próprios a essa moléstia. The case of {{a patient}} {{with many of the}} clinical characteristics commonly referred to in Refsum's disease is reported. Ichthyosis was noted in the patient and in other members of the family. Cerebrospinal fluid proteins were normal. Serum copper and caeruloplasmin concentrations were hight, as well as transaminases. Histological findings common to neuritis interstitialis hypaertrophica were found on examination of a peripheric nerve segment obtained by biopsy. Studies on the occurrence of phytanic acid could not be carried out. The relationship between the case reported and <b>Refsum's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{there is}} no cure for {{infantile}} <b>Refsum</b> disease <b>syndrome,</b> nor is there a standard course of treatment. Infections should be guarded against to prevent such complications as pneumonia and respiratory distress. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Patients show variable lifespans with some individuals surviving until adulthood and into old age.|$|R
40|$|Retinal {{degeneration}} {{in children}} occurs in errors of lipid, peroxisomal and mitochondrial (including respiratory chain) metabolism. In this review {{the most frequent}} inborn errors of metabolism with retinal degeneration are discussed including abetalipoproteinaemia, classical Refsum disease, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, hydroxydicarboxylic aciduria, Sjögren-Larsson <b>syndrome,</b> infantile <b>Refsum</b> disease, Kearns-Sayre <b>syndrome</b> and gyrate atrophy. These metabolic disorders must be differentiated from those with retinal degeneration but without known metabolic basis. In patients with such a disorder metabolic investigations should be considered whenever atypical manifestations are encountere...|$|R
