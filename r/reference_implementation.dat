5|$|Enhancement of the {{language}} goes along with development of the CPython <b>reference</b> <b>implementation.</b> The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for discussion about {{the language}}'s development; specific issues {{are discussed in the}} Roundup bug tracker maintained at python.org. Development took place on a self-hosted source code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.|$|E
5|$|Python interpreters are {{available}} for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run {{on a wide variety}} of systems. CPython, the <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Twitter is {{recognized}} for {{having one of}} the most open and powerful developer APIs of any major technology company. Developer interest in Twitter began immediately following its launch, prompting the company to release the first version of its public API in September 2006. The API quickly became iconic as a <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> for public REST APIs and is widely cited in programming tutorials.|$|E

25|$|As of August 4, 2011, {{the current}} version of the Xiph.Org Foundation's <b>reference</b> <b>implementation,</b> is libogg 1.3.0. Another version, libogg2, has been in development, but is {{awaiting}} a rewrite as of 2008. Both software libraries are free software, released under the New BSD License. Ogg <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> was separated from Vorbis on September 2, 2000.|$|E

25|$|Only a {{few other}} {{security}} problems {{have been identified in}} the <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> of the NTP codebase in its 25+ year history, but the ones that have appeared recently are cause for significant concern. The protocol has been undergoing revision and review over its entire history. As of January 2011, there are no security revisions in the NTP specification and no reports at CERT. The current codebase for the <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> has been undergoing security audits from several sources for several years now, and there are no known high-risk vulnerabilities in the current released software.|$|E

25|$|Quicksort gained {{widespread}} adoption, appearing, for example, in Unix as {{the default}} library sort subroutine. Hence, it lent {{its name to}} the C standard library subroutine qsort and in the <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> of Java.|$|E
25|$|The <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> of channel I/O {{is that of}} the IBM System/360 {{family of}} {{mainframes}} and its successors, but similar implementations have been adopted by other mainframe vendors, such as Control Data, Bull (General Electric/Honeywell) and Unisys.|$|E

5000|$|Server Integration Framework - A set of <b>reference</b> server <b>implementations</b> and {{integration}} components. <b>Reference</b> <b>implementations</b> {{were available for}} PHP, Ruby and Python. There were also some prototypes of Java EE and [...]NET integration, but the Ruby version was the only fully implemented server framework.|$|R
25|$|The {{official}} <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> of the PNG {{format is}} the programming library libpng. It is published as free software {{under the terms}} of a permissive free software licence. Therefore, it is usually found as an important system library in free operating systems.|$|E
25|$|The <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> {{assumes that}} TTM {{is given a}} text file {{containing}} some combination of ordinary text and TTM function calls (i.e. invocations). The text is scanned character by character. Any ordinary text is passed to the output unchanged (except for escapes).|$|E
25|$|The X.Org {{implementation}} is {{the canonical}} implementation of X. Owing to liberal licensing, {{a number of}} variations, both free and open source and proprietary, have appeared. Commercial Unix vendors have tended to take the <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> and adapt it for their hardware, usually customizing it and adding proprietary extensions.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{describe}} state-of-the-art high-definition video compression algorithms. The thesis focuses on the differences between algorithms and their functionality. Procedures for video sequences compression based on <b>reference</b> <b>implementations</b> of selected codecs are being proposed and their important parameters are being discussed. Bachelor's thesis deals with comparison of <b>reference</b> <b>implementations</b> based on subjective and objective video quality measurements and time requirements. The graphic interface for selected codecs has been also designed...|$|R

25|$|Currently {{the newest}} {{releases}} of various Scheme implementations, such as Chez Scheme, Racket, Ikarus, Larceny and Ypsilon, support the R6RS standard. There is a portable <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> {{of the proposed}} implicitly phased libraries for R6RS, called psyntax, which loads and bootstraps itself properly on various older Scheme implementations.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the format}} is free, and its <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> {{is not subject}} to {{restrictions}} associated with copyright, Ogg's various codecs have been incorporated into a number of different free and proprietary media players, both commercial and non-commercial, as well as portable media players and GPS receivers from different manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|NTPsec is a {{fork of the}} <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> {{that has}} been {{systematically}} security-hardened. The fork point was in June 2015 and {{was in response to}} a rash of compromises in 2014; as of 2017, the software is in beta testing. Between removal of unsafe features, removal of support for obsolete hardware, and removal of support for obsolete Unix variants, NTPsec has been able to pare away 60% of the original codebase, making the remainder more auditable.|$|E

25|$|Wayland is {{a display}} server {{protocol}} {{intended as a}} replacement for the X11 protocol; , it has not received wider adoption. Unlike X11, Wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes the role of the display server, window manager and compositing manager. Weston is the <b>reference</b> <b>implementation</b> of Wayland, while GNOME's Mutter and KDE's KWin are being ported to Wayland as standalone display servers. Enlightenment has already been successfully ported since version 19.|$|E
25|$|The {{source code}} for Sun's {{implementations}} of Java (i.e. {{the de facto}} <b>reference</b> <b>implementation)</b> has been available for some time, but until recently, the license terms severely restricted {{what could be done}} with it without signing (and generally paying for) a contract with Sun. As such these terms did not satisfy the requirements of either the Open Source Initiative or the Free Software Foundation to be considered open source or free software, and Sun Java was therefore a proprietary platform.|$|E
25|$|A new NTP client, ntimed, {{was started}} by Poul-Henning Kamp in 2014. The new {{implementation}} {{is sponsored by the}} Linux Foundation as a replacement for the <b>reference</b> <b>implementation,</b> as it was determined to be easier to write a new implementation from scratch than to fix the existing issues with the large existing code base. As of June 2015, no official release was done yet, but ntimed can synchronize clocks reliably. ntimed works under Debian and FreeBSD, but remains to be ported to Windows and macOS.|$|E
