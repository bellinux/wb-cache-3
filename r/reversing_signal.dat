Multiple melting peak behaviour was observed for all polymers. SDSC data revealed that PHB and its copolymers undergo melting-recrystallisation-remelting during heating, as evidenced by exothermic peaks in the IsoK baseline (non-reversing signal). An increase in degree of crystallinity due to significant melt-recrystallisation was observed for slow-cooled copolymers.

Apoptosis is mediated by two distinct mechanisms: direct cell contact and a yet-unidentified soluble protein, death factor X. In addition, mTNF acts as a receptor that transduces a "reverse signal" into MO/MPhi when bound to the TNF receptor on EC. <b>Reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> by mTNF confers resistance to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Stimulation of <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> by mTNF blocks the ability of MO/MPhi to produce death factor X and proinflammatory cytokines.

In the CA 3 –CA 1 synapse, ephrinB ligands are localized to the post-synaptic membrane, while their cognate Eph receptors are presumed to be pre-synaptic. Interaction of ephrinB molecules with Eph receptors leads to changes in long-term potentiation (LTP), which {{has been reported to}} be mediated by <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> into the post-synaptic membrane. Here, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of ephrinB 3 and hence <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> is not required for ephrinB dependent learning and memory tasks or for LTP of these synapses. Consistent with previous reports, we find that ephrinB 3 KO null mutant mice exhibit a striking reduction in CA 3 –CA 1 LTP that is associated with defective learning and memory tasks. We find the null mutants also show changes in both pre- and post-synaptic proteins including increased levels of synapsin and synaptobrevin and reduced levels of NMDA receptor subunits. These abnormalities are not observed in ephrinB 3 lacZ <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> mutants that specifically delete the ephrinB 3 intracellular region, supporting a cytoplasmic domain-independent forward signaling role for ephrinB 3 in these processes.

40|$|During {{embryonic}} development the preoptic area (POA) {{gives rise}} to two populations of neurons which are generated at the same time, cortical interneurons and striatal cells. POA-derived cortical interneurons take a superficial path and avoid the developing striatum when they migrate to their target region. We found that EphB 1, which is expressed in the striatal anlage, prevents cortical interneurons from entering the striatum via ephrin-B 3 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling.</b> In contrast, for striatal neurons which also express ephrin-B 3, EphB 1 acts as a stop signal. This dual role of EphB 1 is {{due to differences in}} ephrin-B 3 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> cascades. For striatal neurons, binding of EphB 1 to ephrin-B 3 reduces endogenously high levels of pSrc and pFAK, which then causes the cells to stop migration.

[...] Eph/Ephrin bidirectional signaling is important for axon guidance and target selection; mapping of retinal axons along anterior-posterior axis in the visual system is regulated by Ephrin-A/Eph-A mediated repulsion. In the tectum, the transcription factor Engrailed creates an Ephrin-A concentration gradient along the anterior-posterior axis; this results in different signaling cues to the growth cones which also express graded levels of the receptor.

40|$|AbstractVascular {{development}} {{begins with}} the formation of a primary vascular plexus that is rapidly remodeled by angiogenesis into the interconnected branched patterns characteristic of mature vasculature. Several receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands have been implicated to control early development of the vascular system. These include the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR- 1 and VEGFR- 2) that bind VEGF, the Tie- 1 and Tie- 2 receptors that bind the angiopoietins, and the EphB 4 receptor that binds the membrane-anchored ligand ephrin-B 2. Targeted mutations in the mouse germline have revealed essential functions for these molecules in vascular development. In particular, protein-null mutations that delete either EphB 4 or ephrin-B 2 from the mouse have been shown to result in early embryonic lethality due to failed angiogenic remodeling. The venous expression of EphB 4 and arterial expression of ephrin-B 2 has lead to the speculation that the interaction of these two molecules leads to bidirectional signaling into both the receptor-expressing cell and the ligand-expressing cell, and that both forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>signals</b> are required for proper development of blood vessels in the embryo. Indeed, targeted removal of the ephrin-B 2 carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail by another group was shown to perturb vascular development and result in the same early embryonic lethality as the null mutation, leading the authors to propose that ephrin-B 2 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> directs early angiogenic remodeling of the primary vascular plexus [Cell 104 (2001) 57]. However, we show here that the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ephrin-B 2, and hence <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling,</b> is not required during early vascular development, but it is necessary for neonatal survival and functions later in cardiovascular development in the maturation of cardiac valve leaflets. We further show that ephrin-B 2 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> is required for the pathfinding of axons that form the posterior tract of the anterior commissure. Our results thus indicate that ephrin-B 2 functions in the early embryo as a typical instructive ligand to stimulate EphB 4 receptor forward signaling during angiogenic remodeling and that later in embryonic development ephrin-B 2 functions as a receptor to transduce <b>reverse</b> <b>signals</b> involved in cardiac valve maturation and axon pathfinding...|$|R
40|$|Synapses {{form when}} highly motile {{dendritic}} filopodia establish axonal contacts. When a synaptic contact is stabilized, it {{gives rise to}} the formation of a dendritic spine, which has recently been shown to involve a number of molecules that mostly regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, as known regulators of signaling pathways involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, have been shown to be required for spine development and maintenance. The main characteristic of interactions of the Eph receptor with its membrane associated ephrin ligand is that they can propagate bidirectional signals. Both forward (downstream of Eph receptor) and reverse (downstream of ephrin ligand) signaling have been shown to play a role in mature synapses, where spine morphology changes are associated with synaptic plasticity. Thus, ephrinB <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> might be as important for dendritic spine development as signaling pathways downstream of Eph receptors. Intrigued by this idea, we hypothesized that some of the spine morphology changes during plasticity might be regulated exclusively by ephrin <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways. Analyzing spine formation in cultures of dissociated hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that stimulation of hippocampal neurons with EphB receptor bodies leads to increased spine maturation. Expression of a truncated form of ephrinB ligand, which is still able to activate EphB receptor but is unable to transduce intracellular signals, impairs spine morphology. To find new players of <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> that are important in directing ephrin-mediated spine morphology, we performed a proteomic analysis of the phosphotyrosine dependent ephrin interactor Grb 4 (Nck- 2, Nck beta). We identified the signaling adaptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein (GIT) 1 (Cat 1) as well as the exchange factor for Rac βPIX (β-p 21 -activated protein kinase (PAK) -interacting exchange factor), also called RhoGEF 7 or Cool- 1, as novel Grb 4 binding partners, which have both previously been shown to be required for spine formation. We show that Grb 4 binds and recruits GIT 1 to synapses downstream of activated ephrinB ligand. Interactions of Grb 4 with ephrin or GIT 1 are necessary for proper spine morphogenesis and synapse formation.

40|$|Fas ligand (FasL; CD 178; CD 95 L) {{is a type}} II {{transmembrane protein}} {{belonging}} to the tumour necrosis factor family; its binding to the Fas receptor (CD 95; APO- 1) triggers apoptosis in the receptor-bearing cell. Signalling through this pathway plays a pivotal role during the immune response and in immune system homeostasis. Similar to other TNF family members, the intracellular domain {{has been reported to}} transmit signals {{to the inside of the}} FasL-bearing cell (<b>reverse</b> <b>signalling).</b> Recently, we identified the proteases ADAM 10 and SPPL 2 a as molecules important for the processing of FasL. Protease cleavage releases the intracellular domain, which then is able to translocate to the nucleus and to repress reporter gene activity. To study the physiological importance of FasL <b>reverse</b> <b>signalling</b> in vivo, we established knockout/knockin mice with a FasL deletion mutant that lacks the intracellular portion (FasLDeltaIntra). Co-culture experiments confirmed that the truncated FasL protein is still capable of inducing apoptosis in Fas-sensitive cells. Preliminary immune histochemistry data suggest that, in contrast to published data, the absence of the intracellular FasL domain does not alter the intracellular FasL localization in activated T cells. We are currently investigating signalling and proliferative capacities of T cells derived from homozygous FasLDeltaIntra mice to validate a co-stimulatory role of FasL <b>reverse</b> <b>signalling...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mutations of ephrin B 1 {{in humans}} result in craniofrontonasal syndrome. Because {{little is known}} of the role and {{mechanism}} of action of ephrin B 1 in bone, we examined the function of osteoblast-produced ephrin B 1 in vivo and identified the molecular mechanism by which ephrin B 1 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> regulates bone formation. Targeted deletion of the ephrin B 1 gene in type 1 α 2 collagen-producing cells resulted in severe calvarial defects, decreased bone size, bone mineral density, and trabecular bone volume, caused by impairment in osterix expression and osteoblast differentiation. Coimmunoprecipitation of the TAZ complex with TAZ-specific antibody revealed a protein complex containing ephrin B 1, PTPN 13, NHERF 1, and TAZ in bone marrow stromal (BMS) cells. Activation of ephrin B 1 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> with soluble EphB 2 -Fc led to a time-dependent increase in TAZ dephosphorylation and shuttling from cytoplasm to nucleus. Treatment of BMS cells with exogenous EphB 2 -Fc resulted in a 4 -fold increase in osterix expression as determined by Western blotting. Disruption of TAZ expression using specific lentivirus small hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased TAZ mRNA by 80 % and ephrin B 1 reverse signaling-mediated increases in osterix mRNA by 75 %. Knockdown of NHERF 1 expression reduced basal levels of osterix expression by 90 % and abolished ephrin B 1 -mediated induction of osterix expression. We conclude that locally produced ephrin B 1 mediates its effects on osteoblast differentiation by a novel molecular mechanism in which activation of <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> leads to dephosphorylation of TAZ and subsequent release of TAZ from the ephrin B 1 /NHERF 1 /TAZ complex to translocate to the nucleus to induce expression of the osterix gene and perhaps other osteoblast differentiation genes. Our findings provide strong evidence that ephrin B 1 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> in osteoblasts is critical for BMS cell differentiation and bone formation...|$|R
40|$|Myeloid cells {{express the}} TNF family ligands BAFF/BLyS and APRIL, which exert {{their effects on}} B cells at {{different}} stages of differentiation via the receptors BAFFR, TACI (Transmembrane Activator and CAML-Interactor) and/or BCMA (B Cell Maturation Antigen). BAFF and APRIL are proteins expressed at the cell membrane, with both extracellular and intracellular domains. Therefore, receptor/ligand engagement may also result in signals in ligand-expressing cells via so-called "reverse signalling". In order to understand how TACI-Fc (atacicept) technically may mediate immune stimulation instead of suppression, we investigated its potential to activate <b>reverse</b> <b>signalling</b> through BAFF and APRIL. BAFFR-Fc and TACI-Fc, but not Fn 14 -Fc, reproducibly stimulated the ERK and other signalling pathways in bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages. However, these effects were independent of BAFF or APRIL since the same activation profile was observed with BAFF- or APRIL-deficient cells. Instead, cell activation correlated with the presence of high molecular mass forms of BAFFR-Fc and TACI-Fc and was strongly impaired in macrophages deficient for Fc receptor gamma chain. Moreover, a TACI-Fc defective for Fc receptor binding elicited no detectable signal. Although these results do not formally rule out the existence of BAFF or APRIL <b>reverse</b> <b>signalling</b> (via pathways not tested in this study), they provide no evidence in support of <b>reverse</b> <b>signalling</b> and point to the importance of using appropriate specificity controls when working with Fc receptor-expressing myeloid cells...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} CD 14 + monocytic subpopulation of human PBMC induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cocultured endothelial cells (EC) when stimulated by bacterial endotoxin (LPS). Apoptosis is mediated by two routes, first via transmembrane TNF-alpha (mTNF) expressed on PBMC and, in addition, by TNF-independent soluble factors that trigger apoptosis in EC. Neutralizing anti-TNF mAb completely blocked coculture-mediated apoptosis, {{despite the fact that}} there should have been additional soluble cell death factors. This led to the hypothesis that a <b>reverse</b> <b>signal</b> is transmitted from the TNF receptor on EC to monocytes (MO) via mTNF that prevents the production of soluble apoptotic factors. Here we have tested this hypothesis. The results support the idea of a bidirectional cross-talk between MO and EC. Peripheral blood MO, MO-derived macrophages (MPhi), or the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 were preincubated with human microvascular EC that constitutively express TNF receptor type I (TNF-R 1) and subsequently stimulated with LPS. Cell-free supernatants of these preparations no longer induced EC apoptosis. The preincubation of MO/MPhi with TNF-reactive agents, such as mAb and soluble receptors, also blocked the production of death factors, providing further evidence for <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> via mTNF. Finally, we show that <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> through mTNF mediated LPS resistance in MO/MPhi as indicated by the down-regulation of LPS-induced soluble TNF and IL- 6 as well as IL- 1 and IL- 10...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} Eph-ephrin bidirectional signaling, {{a series}} of mutations were generated in the ephrin-B 3 locus. The absence of both forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> resulted in mice with mirror movements as typified by a hopping locomotion. The corticospinal tract was defective as axons failed to respect the midline boundary of the spinal cord and bilaterally innervated both contralateral and ipsilateral motor neuron populations. A second mutation that expresses a truncated ephrin-B 3 protein lacking its cytoplasmic domain {{did not lead to}} hopping, indicating that <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> is not required for corticospinal innervation. Ephrin-B 3 is concentrated at the spinal cord midline, while one of its receptors, EphA 4, is expressed in postnatal corticospinal neurons as their fibers pathfind down the contralateral spinal cord. Our data indicate ephrin-B 3 functions as a midline-anchored repellent to stimulate forward signaling in EphA 4 -expressing axons...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> of transmembrane TNF (mTNF) {{contributes}} to the versatility of this cytokine superfamily. Previously, we could demonstrate that mTNF acting as receptor confers resistance to bacterial lipopolysaccharide in monocytes and macrophages (MO/MPhi). <b>Reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> can be induced by incubation with the monoclonal anti-TNF antibody 195 F and other TNF antagonists, such as the humanized monoclonal antibody infliximab and the humanized soluble TNF receptor construct etanercept, respectively, all in former or present clinical use. Here, we addressed the question {{whether there are differences}} in modulating the LPS response in MO/MPhi among these three antagonists. Whereas 195 F and infliximab suppress both, the release of an LPS-induced endothelial cell apoptotic factor and proinflammatory cytokines, etanercept only protected against the LPS-triggered apoptosis activity, but left the LPS-induced cytokine release unchanged. These data could have clinical impact with regard to TNF neutralization strategies...|$|R
40|$|Repulsive Eph forward {{signaling}} from limb-derived ephrins guides the axons of lateral motor column (LMC) motor neurons. LMC axons also express ephrinAs, while their EphA receptors {{are expressed in}} the limb mesenchyme. In vitro {{studies have suggested that}} <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> from limb-derived EphA 4 to axonal ephrinAs might result in attraction of LMC axons. However, genetic evidence for this function is lacking. Here we use the Dunn chamber turning assay to show that EphA proteins are chemoattractants and elicit fast turning responses in LMC neurons in vitro. Moreover, ectopic expression of EphA 4 in chick hindlimb changes the limb trajectory of LMC axons. Nervous system-specific deletion of EphA 4 in mice resulted in fewer LMC axon projection errors than the ubiquitous deletion of EphA 4. Additionally, a signaling-incompetent EphA 4 mutant partially rescued guidance errors in the hindlimb, suggesting that limb-derived EphA 4 contributes to the establishment of LMC projections. In summary, we provide evidence for a role of EphA:ephrinA attractive <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> in motor axon guidance and in vivo evidence of in-parallel forward Eph and <b>reverse</b> ephrin <b>signaling</b> function in the same neuronal population...|$|R
40|$|Plasticity in {{the brain}} is {{essential}} for maintaining memory and learning and {{is associated with the}} dynamic membrane trafficking of AMPA receptors. EphrinB proteins, ligands for EphB receptor tyrosine kinases, are transmembrane molecules with signaling capabilities that are required for spine morphogenesis, synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. Here, we describe a molecular mechanism for ephrinB 2 function in controlling synaptic transmission. EphrinB 2 signaling is critical for the stabilization of AMPA receptors at the cellular membrane. Mouse hippocampal neurons from conditional ephrinB 2 knockouts showed enhanced constitutive internalization of AMPA receptors and reduced synaptic transmission. Mechanistically, glutamate receptor interacting proteins bridge ephrinB ligands and AMPA receptors. Moreover, this function involved a regulatory aspect of ephrinB <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> that involves the phosphorylation of a single serine residue in their cytoplasmic tails. In summary, our findings uncover a model of cooperative AMPA receptor and ephrinB <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> at the synapse...|$|R
