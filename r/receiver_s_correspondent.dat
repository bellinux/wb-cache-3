In addition, by using receiver’s public key pk, each sender Si wants to divide a message mi to y shares, and then to distribute a part of y shares to each servers. Furthermore we develop with a variant of the Paillier encryption function which has several properties related to homomorphism [3]. In fact, we construct our scheme by using homomorphic properties of the encryption function and decomposition of (cyclotomic) polynomials.

40|$|In a {{broadcast}} encryption system, {{a broadcast}}er can encrypt {{a message to}} a group of authorized <b>receivers</b> <b>S</b> and each authorized receiver can use his/her own private key to correctly decrypt the broadcast ciphertext, while the users outside S cannot. Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) system is a variant of broadcast encryption system where any string representing the user’s identity (e. g., email address) can be used as his/her public key. IBBE has found many applications in real life, such as pay-TV systems, distribution of copyrighted materials, satellite radio communications. When employing an IBBE system, {{it is very important to}} protect the message’s confidentiality and the users’ anonymity. However, existing IBBE systems cannot satisfy confidentiality and anonymity simultaneously. In this paper, using an anonymous identity-based encryption (IBE) primitive with robust property as a building block, we propose a generic IBBE construction, which can simultaneously ensure the confidentiality and anonymity under chosen-ciphertext attacks. Our generic IBBE construction has a desirable property that the public parameters size, the private key size and the decryption cost are constant and independent of the number of receivers...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to measure the total effective noise power in a GPS receiver, including contributions from the system temperature, the antenna temperature, interference, lossy components, etc. A known level of noise is periodically injected before the preamplifier during normal tracking, with a switch set to a very low duty cycle, {{so that there is}} insignificant signal loss for the GPS signals being tracked. Alternately, a signal of known power may be injected. The coupling port is fed with a switch that can be controlled from the <b>receiver</b> <b>s</b> digital processing section. The switch can connect the coupling port to a noise or signal source at a known power level. The combined system noise is measured, and nearly continuous noise calibrations are made. The effect from injected noise/signals on the performance of the GPS receiver can be less than 0. 01 dB of SNR loss. Minimal additional components are required. The GPS receiver is used to measure the SNRs required to solve for the noise level. Because this measurement is referenced to the preamplifier input, it is insensitive to variations in the receiver gain...|$|R
40|$|The minimum {{mean squared error}} (MMSE) {{receiver}} is {{a linear}} filter which can achieve optimal near-far resistance in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access communications. However, {{one of the main}} problems of this receiver is the required number of filter taps; which is typically large. This is especially true in systems with a large;processing gain in which case the, receiver's computation burden. becomes very high. As a result, methods for reducing the complexity of the MMSE receiver have been of great interest in recent years. In this paper, we propose an efficient partitioned MMSE receiver based on a classification algorithm. It is shown that the computational complexity (in terms of the filter taps) of the proposed receiver can be reduced significantly while good performance is maintained. Based on. the special structure of our proposed receiver, we also propose a release-merge adaptive partition algorithm which can update the partition and the <b>receiver</b> <b>s</b> coefficients simutaneously. In particular, it is demons rat d that the proposed receiver can perform much better than previously proposed reduced-rank, MMSE receivers, such as the partial despreading MMSE receiver and the cyclically shifted filter bank receiver, with even a smaller number of taps...|$|R

The body of manuscripts housed at the National Art Library in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London provides the modern scholar with evidence of the skeletal beginnings of an early fan club. This thesis aims to show how these manuscripts were turned into a saleable commodity by the publisher and entrepreneur Richard Phillips, while under the guiding hand of another, slightly later, literary celebrity, Anna Laetitia Barbauld. In order to restore Richardsonâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s reputation amongst a new nineteenth century audience, Barbauld was required to construct her own idea of him as an eighteenth century celebrity author, and in doing so the insecurities of a self-professed, apparently diffident man, are revealed.
