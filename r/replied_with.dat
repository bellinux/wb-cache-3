5|$|In {{the final}} match, New Zealand batted first and Meckiff played {{a leading role}} in Australia's victory, taking 4/28 from 27.2 overs to help dismiss the hosts for 198. The fast bowler was not {{required}} to bat as the tourists <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> 8/350 declared. He took 2/17 in the second innings as the home team fell for 161 before Craig's men sealed the series with a 10-wicket win. Meckiff ended the tour with 20 first-class wickets at 10.85, placing him top of the tour bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|It {{was played}} between Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona, at the Camp Nou, the latter club's home ground. Barcelona won the match 3–1, {{achieving}} their record 27th {{title in the}} competition. Lionel Messi and Neymar gave Barcelona a 2–0 lead at half time, and although Athletic <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> a goal by Iñaki Williams, Messi scored another goal late on to confirm his team's victory. This was {{the second part of}} Barcelona's treble, with the team going on to win the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final a week later.|$|E

5|$|The final {{match of}} October was against Southampton at Highbury. Henry who missed a penalty early on, scored to put Arsenal in {{front in the}} 67th minute. Southampton <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> two goals from Rory Delap, but Van Persie in {{stoppage}} time equalised for the home team with a curling shot. The draw meant Arsenal stood in first position and had accumulated 26 points. The team were level on points with Chelsea, with a marginally better goal difference.|$|E
5|$|The race slowed for a {{few years}} after a {{boundary}} dispute in the Puna de Atacama region was successfully mediated in 1899 by the American ambassador to Argentina, William Paine Lord, but more ships were ordered by both countries in 1901. The Argentine Navy bought two more armored cruisers from Italy, and the Chilean Navy <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> orders for two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships from British shipyards. The Argentines replied by signing letters of intent with Ansaldo in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships.|$|E
5|$|When {{the teams}} {{took to the}} field for the {{deciding}} Test, Woodfull won the toss and elected to bat. He scored 49 as Australia amassed 701 in the timeless match.

His bowlers then dismissed the hosts for 145 to seal a decisive win by 562 runs, and the series 2–1. On 22 August, {{for the second time in}} four years, Australia had won the Ashes on Woodfull's birthday.|$|E

5|$|Able {{to attack}} the HEIC ships individually, Caroline pulled {{alongside}} Europe at 06:30 and began a heavy fire into the merchant ship, which intermittently <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> her available guns. Within 30 minutes, Europes rigging was tattered, many of her guns dismounted {{and a number of}} her crew wounded or killed. Moving past his now disabled opponent, Féretier next attacked Streatham, which had slowed in an unsuccessful attempt to support Europe. Now alone against the frigate, Streatham came under heavy fire at 07:00 and by 08:00 was badly damaged, with casualties in her crew, her guns all dismounted and her lascars hiding below decks. With further resistance hopeless, Dale hauled down the company flag and surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After his opponents had finalised their players, Bradman named a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Johnston bowled Edrich for 15. He ended with 1/20 as the hosts folded for 177. Johnston made an unbeaten 26 in a partnership of 30 with Lindsay Hassett as Australia <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> 8/489 declared. Time ran out with the Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75 in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} Test, Miller played for Victoria against England {{in his final}} match for his native state before moving to New South Wales. He scored six before being stumped from the medium pace of Bedser and took 4/63 in the first innings, his best bowling since the First Test, as England scored 355 before Victoria <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> 327. His victims {{included}} Gibb, Yardley and Compton for 93, thereby preventing the English batsman from scoring his fifth century in as many innings. The match ended in a draw when England were bowled out for 118 in their second innings; Miller bowled two overs in his final actions for Victoria, conceding two runs without taking a wicket.|$|E

5|$|Both {{countries}} faced {{difficulty in}} financing their own dreadnoughts. Although in Argentina the ruling National Autonomist Party supported the purchases, they initially faced public resistance for such expensive acquisitions. An influx of inflammatory newspaper editorials supporting new dreadnoughts, especially from La Prensa, and renewed border disputes, particularly Brazilian assertions that the Argentines {{were attempting to}} restore the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, swayed the public to support the purchases. The Argentine President, José Figueroa Alcorta, attempted to ease the tensions with a message warning the Brazilians of a naval arms race should they continue on their present course. The Brazilian government <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> reasoning similar to Pena's speech in 1906, in that they believed the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated equipment left by the long-term neglect of the Brazilian Navy, and they repeatedly insisted that the ships were not meant for use against Argentina.|$|E
5|$|England batted {{first and}} their openers {{immediately}} seized the initiative, putting on 234 {{for the first}} wicket in four hours. The tourists made 488 and Booth scored eight as Australia <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> 221 and were forced to follow on. He made 27 in the second innings before being bowled by David Allen as the hosts fell to an innings defeat. It was Australia's biggest defeat at home since the Fourth Test of the 1911–12 Ashes series when they lost by an innings and 225 runs. After the match, England captain Mike Smith told Booth that he expected {{to see him in}} the Fourth Test, but his Australian counterpart prophetically predicted his downfall.|$|E
5|$|England took a 38-run lead after Australia <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> 458. Morris contributed {{only six}} while batting with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, {{who had been}} {{promoted}} from the middle order to open while Barnes was still injured; Bradman had overlooked reserve opener Brown. Morris chipped Bedser {{in the air to}} Ken Cranston at mid-wicket to leave Australia at 1/13. Australia slumped to 3/68 before a middle-order fightback took Australia to 458 early on the fourth morning. England declared at 8/365 early on the fifth morning, leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin and bounce unevenly.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Dixon {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} his ship alongside the Spanish frigate {{and opened a}} heavy fire, to which Gerraro <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> his own broadside. The larger and more powerful British ship was able to rapidly inflict severe damage to the Santa Dorotea, and within minutes the mizenmast had fallen and the mainmast and rudder were severely battered. As Santa Dorotea veered off course, O'Neil passed Lion for a third time, at an even greater distance than before, and once again his broadsides failed {{to have an effect}} and again he came under fire from the British vessel. His last attempt to save Santa Dorotea defeated, O'Neil turned away and his ships raised all sail in the direction of Cartagena at 13:10. Gerraro, his isolated ship trapped by Lion, which was slowly turning back towards the drifting frigate, raised the Union Flag upside down as a sign of surrender.|$|E
5|$|Grace's bad wicket batting {{skills were}} fully {{tested in the}} first innings at The Oval and he scored 40 {{in a total of}} only 76, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley taking five wickets each for the Players. The Players <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> 122 to take a first innings lead of 46. Grace took 2–37 in support of Allan Steel who claimed 6–60. The Gentlemen {{produced}} a much better batting performance on the Friday and scored 202, Grace again top-scoring with 63. He then took 3–30 as the Players were bowled out for 101, the match ending on Friday afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Grace's final {{appearance}} in 1878 {{was for the}} USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played {{for the benefit of}} the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far the best of a drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> 134 and 65–5, so Essex would almost certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted him right to the end of the season and he could only score 10 and 4.|$|E
