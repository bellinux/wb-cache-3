40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo {{principal}} a análise econômica e financeira de um projeto com 100 fornos tipo container industrial e 100 fornos tipo retangular de 40 st. para a produção de carvão vegetal. Para tanto, utilizaram-se como indicadores financeiros a lucratividade, rentabilidade, prazo de retorno do investimento e ponto de equilíbrio. Os indicadores econômicos utilizados para proceder a análise econômica foram o VPL, TIR, B(C) PE e B/C. Concluíram que os fornos são viáveis do ponto de vista econômico e financeiro. Entretanto o forno container por ter maior VPL daria um retorno mais lucrativo quando comparado ao retangular de 40 st. This work {{aimed at}} the economic and financial analysis of a project with 100 units of both industrial container and 40 -st rectangular kilns for charcoal production. The following financial indicators {{were used in the}} analysis: profitability, yield, payback period and break-even point. The economic indicators used in the economic analysis were VPL, TIR, B(C) PE and B/C. In this study, the two kilns are economic and financially viable. However, the container was more lucrative than the 40 -st <b>rectangular</b> <b>kiln...</b>|$|E
30|$|The <b>rectangular</b> <b>kilns</b> are mechanized, have a {{combustion}} chamber for gas burn, {{the possibility of}} tar recovery, steam injectors, a heat exchanger to accelerate the cooling process, etc. To be economically viable, the <b>rectangular</b> <b>kilns</b> should produce at least 5, 000 m 3 of charcoal per month. The cost of installation of each kiln varies from US$ 0.1 to 0.25 million. There are kilns with the capacity to process up to 500 m 3 of wood per cycle of pyrolysis, with a wood conversion yield into charcoal of 30 % to 35 % [20].|$|R
30|$|About 10 % of {{the total}} {{charcoal}} production in Brazil comes from companies that use high-technology <b>rectangular</b> <b>kilns,</b> and 90 % from small and medium owners who use traditional kilns.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The near {{infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) {{has shown a}} rapid and accurate technique for evaluation of materials of biological origin. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the ability of the {{near infrared}} (NIR) spectroscopy associated to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the separation of carbonization processes and identification of the origin of the woods used in the carbonizations. Hence, the charcoal of seven species of Eucalyptus and twenty native species from the Cerrado (savannah) of Minas Gerais, Brazil were investigated. The Eucalyptus wood was carbonized in a laboratory furnace and in a 190 m 3 industrial <b>rectangular</b> <b>kilns</b> while the wood of native vegetation was carbonized only under laboratory conditions. The samples were grinded for NIR spectra acquirement. The NIR spectra were analyzed by PCA but no cluster were identified allowing discrimination between charcoal produced from native and from Eucalyptus wood. However, the cluster formed in the PCA when using the first derivative NIR spectra permitted to distinguish charcoal produced in different processes of carbonization. Two groups of data for charcoal produced in the industrial <b>rectangular</b> <b>kilns</b> were also observed, suggesting heterogeneity in the carbonization process...|$|R

5000|$|The site at Mingachevir (probably Sudagylan), first {{discovered}} in the 1940s by archaeologist G.I. Ione, had [...] "seven <b>rectangular</b> <b>kilns</b> … The fuel chamber was trapezoid. The inner walls and floor were covered with a special coating. These kilns were attributed to the third century B.C. years ago. The number of kilns and the quantity of raw material indicate a trade center." [...] The settlement was probably destroyed by a fire around A.D. 600, but its demise is uncertain. But perhaps most famous of the ancient settlements on the Kura is the [...] "cave town" [...] at Uplistsikhe, Georgia, first settled as early as 3,500 years ago. The city, carved into a cliff {{on the bank of}} the Kura covering an area of 8 ha, contains underground living quarters, communal chambers, places of worship, storerooms, connected by a network of passageways. It reached its peak about 1,100 years ago as the political, religious and cultural center of the region, but in the 13th century, it fell to Mongolian invaders.|$|R
50|$|The {{area around}} Bunzlau {{is rich in}} clays suited to the potter's wheel. Typically, {{utilitarian}} Bunzlauer pottery was turned on a kick wheel, dried leather-hard, dipped in a slip glaze and then burnt in a <b>rectangular,</b> cross-draft <b>kiln.</b> Although fired at temperatures of up to 2,400 F and often classified as stoneware, the clay actually does not vitrify and Bunzlauer pottery is better categorized as high-fired earthenware. In order to make their pottery watertight, Bunzlauer potters applied a coating of liquid clay, or slip. When fired, the slip glaze varied from a chocolate to dark brown. Since the fabric of Bunzlauer ware retains some porosity, the pottery conveniently has been suited for cooking over an open fire or for baking in an oven, {{as well as for}} storage.|$|R
40|$|Scheduling in {{the context}} of {{manufacturing}} systems has become increasingly impor- tant in order for organizations to achieve success in dynamic and competitive scenarios. Scheduling can be described as allocation of available jobs over resources to meet the performance criteria defined in a domain. Our research work fo cuses on scheduling a given set of three-dimensional cylindrical items, each characterized by width wj, height hj, and depth dj, onto parallel non-identical <b>rectangular</b> heat treatment <b>kilns,</b> such that the capacities of the kilns is optimally used. The problem is strongly NP-hard as it generalizes the (one-dimensional) Bin Packing Problem (1 BP), in which a set of n positive values wj has to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the total value in each subset does not exceed the bin capacity W. The problem has been formulated as a variant of the 3 D-BPP by following the MILP approach, and we propose a weight optimization heuristic that produces solutions comparable to that of the LP problem, in addition to reducing the computational complexity. Finally, we also propose a Decomposition Algorithm (DA) and validate the perfor- mance effectiveness of our heuristic. The numerical analyses provides useful insights that influence the shop-floor decision making process...|$|R
