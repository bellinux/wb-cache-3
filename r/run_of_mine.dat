While the operation lasted, six to ten tons of medium- to low-grade coal were extracted each day from the <b>mine's</b> 900 feet <b>of</b> tunnel.

The study comprises to understand the physical and mechanical behavior of five distinguished chemical compositions of green and dried iron ore pellets {{with respect to a}} typical Mini Blast furnace (MBF) burden data and furnace operating parameter. The maximum basicity of pellets was calculated 2. 37 to make slag neutral when blast furnace runs at 100 % high ash coke (avg. ash content= 29 %). The crushing strength and drop number of various green pellets were measured. Green Crushing Strength was decreased with increasing lime fines. The addition of lime fines as a burnt lime, which has acicular structure creates less plasticity and brittle like fracture occurred. Due to formation of hard CaCO 3 layer on the surface, after increasing lime contain crushing strength was increased in the air and oven dry pellets with respect to acid pellet (0 % lime fines addition). &# 13; /* Style Definitions */&# 13; table.
