40|$|Porous ultra low {{constant}} materials (ULK) for isolation {{within the}} interconnect system of integrated circuits are a promising approach to reduce crosstalk and RC-delays due to shrinking feature sizes [1]. Due to their porosity and {{the integration of}} carbon rich species like methyl groups into the Si-O-Si backbone of currently fabricated PECVD SiCOH dielectrics those materials are highly sensible towards plasma processing, e. g. dry etching or <b>resist</b> <b>stripping</b> [2]. Metal hard mask approaches, e. g. using TiN hard masks are widely used to prevent the <b>resist</b> <b>stripping</b> plasma directly attacking the low-k material [3]. To reduce further plasma damage like carbon depletion and formation of polar silanol groups the development of less aggressive etching processes is in the focus {{of research and development}} activities. Nevertheless dry etching will attack the sidewalls and cause a material degradation. That is why repair processes, mainly based on silylation, are considered to follow the patterning step to reintegrate carbon rich species and to recover the dielectric’s properties [3]. Subsequently to dry etching and repairing the dielectric the wet chemical plasma etch residue removal process is performed. Besides material compatibility and effectiveness in residue removal the wetting behavior of the applied cleaning solutions towards the surface which has to be cleaned is crucial, especially looking on wetting issues like the incomplete wetting of very small via holes or pattern collapse.

In particular, <b>resist</b> <b>strip</b> and mask clean processes seriously affect the surface properties of CoG-reticles and therefore increase the chrome-CD-measurement uncertainty. In extreme cases, {{the change of}} chemo-physical properties of the top Chromium oxide layer can have dramatically impact on the electrons emitted by the surface, utilized by the imaging process of CD SEMs. This change leads to a decreased secondary electron yield, and even more dramatic, induces charging near isolated chromium structures. Although the surface changes appear to be reversible with typical charge decay times {{in the order of}} days, the associated charging effect is in severe conflict to the common demand for low cycle times and high measurement accuracy experiments for the CD-measurement processes. In this work, we present fundamental experiments on Chromium oxide layers taking into account the effect of hydrophilicity on the optical {{as well as on the}} electrical behavior. We observe that the dependence of secondary electron yield on primary electron energy turns out to be the main issue effecting charging of electrically floating chromium structures. This charging effect thus can be understood in terms of shifting the so-called “iso-electrical point”, ultimately resulting in contrast reversion. Furthermore, our data are compared to a simple model respecting electron induced charging during mask surface activation. Our model is supported by numerical calculations of the effective surface potentials near isolated chromium structures.

40|$|In the {{processing}} of integrated circuits, the source and drain of a p-type and n-type complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (CMOS) are defined by implantation of donor and acceptor ions respectively. During the ion implantation, a photoresist (PR) {{is used as a}} masking material. The removal of high dose (≥ 1 E 15 at/cm 2) and low energy ion implanted photoresist (II-PR) after implantation of ultra shallow extension and halo regions (ultra shallow junctions (USJ)) is considered {{as one of the most}} challenging front-end-of-line processing steps for 32 nm and beyond technology nodes of logic devices. This is due to the difficulties of removing the modified layer (crust) formed on the top and sidewalls of the PR during the ion implantation in combination with the compatibility towards ultra shallow implanted novel (Si) Ge, III/V substrates, metal gate and high k-materials. Commonly used <b>resist</b> <b>strip</b> processes such as fluorine-based dry plasma ash and hot sulfuric/peroxide mixtures induce unacceptable levels of oxidation and material loss. Alternative cleans need to be developed for removal of II-PR. This thesis concentrates on an in-depth understanding of the physical and chemical processes induced by arsenic ion implantation in 248 nm DUV PR. Based on this, wet approaches using UV irradiation and organic solvents are proposed and evaluated for PR stripping after USJ implantation for sub- 32 nm CMOS technology nodes. In order to gain insight into the physical processes induced by ion implantation in the PR Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) calculations have been used for evaluation the magnitude of the ion stopping mechanisms as a function of the implantation conditions. SRIM cannot predict the main degradation behavior of the PR but it allows evaluating the physical parameters (Linear Energy Transfer (LET) and dose) that modulate the chemical reactions. It has been demonstrated that the variation of the electronic (ionization) and nuclear (vacancy) stopping can be used as a guideline for the degree of chemical modification, and consequently the stripping resistance, of PR as a function of the implant energy, dose, tilt angle and tentatively ion species. In order to build up understanding for the chemical processes induced by arsenic ion implantation in PR various analytical techniques have been combined for PR characterization as a function of the implant energy and dose. A novel knowledge for the PR chemical degradation has been established. A radical mechanism of crust formation has been proposed, which involves cross-linking and chain scission reactions of the resist. The PR cross-linking is the dominant reaction especially for high doses and energies. It is induced by ß-cleavages in the PR which lead to loss of hydrogen and formation of carbon macroradicals that recombine to form C-C cross-linked crust. Moreover, formation of αß-unsaturated ketonic and/or quinonoid structures by cross-linking reactions has been suggested. The dopant atoms can additionally provide rigid points (As-C bonds) in the crust. For higher doses and energies further dehydrogenation occurs leading to formation of triple bonds in the crust. Different π-conjugated structures are formed as a result of cross-linking and dehydrogenation. No experimental evidence for the presence of an amorphous carbon in the crust has been revealed. In addition, presence of substrate atoms in the form of SiO 2 has been found on the II-PR side walls indicating substrate sputtering during ion implantation. Polar organic solvent chemistries have been recognized as the most promising for PR removal after USJ implantation for future CMOS technology nodes. Physical force is needed to break the crusted top and side walls of the PR and enable dissolution of the underlying bulk PR. After a solvent strip with physical force some small amount of crust side wall footing residues remains that cannot be removed by increasing the total physical force applied. The chemical analysis of these residues has revealed that they are carbon rich containing C-C/C-H, C-Si and dopant As-C and As-O bonds. The use of a UV treatment in air or nitrogen ambient before and/or after the solvent strip with physical force has been proposed and evaluated in order to enable a complete removal of the II-PR. The chemical degradation of the II-PR by UV irradiation and oxidizing species has been studied in detail using the same approach as after ion implantation. It has been found that the UV induces scission in the crust resulting in an increase of its solubility in organic solvents. Moreover, oxidizing species present in the ambient during the UV treatment additionally can induce scission and oxidation of the crust. In parallel with the modification of the crust, cross-linking, scission and oxidation of the underlying bulk PR occur. The dominant degradation reaction of the bulk PR is cross-linking induced by the UV which leads to a decrease of its solubility in organic solvents. Thus, the effect of the UV pretreatment on the II-PR removal by organic solvent will depend on the balance between the scission of the crust and cross-linking of the bulk PR. In order to define optimum conditions for the UV pretreatment of the II-PR the effect of the UV parameters on the properties of the II-PR and its removal has been investigated. The scission of the crust and cross-linking of the bulk PR depend on the wavelength and dose of the UV radiation. Short wavelengths (< 200 nm) and low exposure doses have been found to be the most optimum for UV pretreatment since the high photon energy and the high absorption of the crust versus bulk resist favor scission of the top crust and limit the cross-linking of the underlying bulk PR due to limited UV penetration depth. A post-treatment with short UV wavelengths is recommended after the solvent strip for removal of residual organic contamination of bulk resist, solvent or priming layer as well as crust footing residues if still present on the substrate. Finally, the use of oxidizing ambient during the UV treatment facilitates the effect of the UV pre- and post-treatments. nrpages: 172 status: publishe...|$|E

The different process steps include the use of a resist adhesion promoter, resist spinning, UV exposure, and a developer for <b>resist</b> <b>stripping.</b> The first experiment was to perform all the lithographic steps above on a blank wafer without any mask exposure, remove the resist normally, and then, etch the sample by MACE.

The findings of this study are: (1) wearing process of paving mixtures by a studded tire is composed of repetition of three actions, scarifying of asphalt mortar, attrition of coarse aggregates, and stripping out of aggregates from asphalt mortar bed; (2) wear resistance has a linear relation with volume percentage of coarse aggregates, although 5 ～ 2. 5 mm size in coarse aggregates appears to have adverse effects on the wearing resistance; (3) main function of modified asphalt is to <b>resist</b> the <b>stripping</b> out of coarse aggregates and its degree of contribution depends on the toughness and tenacity of asphalt. Based on these findings, an optimum aggregate gradation was proposed for the wear resistant bituminous paving mixture design...|$|R
40|$|Mid-infrared {{spectral}} band from 2 µm - 20 µm {{is ideal for}} label-free biosensing as the fundamental vibrations of many significant biomolecules take place in this region. Mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy using FTIR has been exploited {{for the last few}} decades to provide sensing capabilities for biomedical diagnostics. However, the sensitivity and the detection limit of the sample under test can be tremendously improved by using the evanescent field based integrated planar waveguide devices. In this paper, we present the fabrication and characterization results of chalcogenide waveguides transparent in the mid-infrared region for such applications. GeTe 4 waveguides on ZnSe substrates were fabricated using lift-off technique. Lift-off resist was used to create the patterns on ZnSe substrate using photolithography and GeTe 4 was deposited on these patterned samples using RF sputtering. The lift-off <b>resist</b> was <b>stripped</b> off to obtain the desired channels. The waveguides were characterized in both mid wave (2. 5 µm - 3. 7 µm) and long wave (6. 4 µm - 7. 5 µm) {{spectral band}}s using optical parametric oscillator-based laser source and quantum cascade laser, respectively [1]. Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show the cross-section and top view of the infrared camera images of the output facet of a GeTe 4 channel waveguide showing light guidance at lambda = 3. 5 µm and lambda = 6. 5 µm, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of the flatness of thin, rolled steel strip is presented. The occurrence of edge-wave and centre-buckle is predicted numerically by solving the eigenvalue problem. The form of buckles is calculated using a non-linear load–displacement analysis. Buckling changes from the centre to the edge as the maximum difference in temperature between the edge and centre increases; correspondingly, the amplitude increases and the wavelength decreases. Because uniform applied tension then decreases the compressive stress at the edge and increases the stress in the centre, a centre-buckled strip is flattened by applied tension, but edge-buckling becomes more severe and applied tension may change the type of buckling from the centre to the edge. Crowned <b>strip</b> <b>resists</b> buckling whereas a concave profile tends to promote it. The effects {{of the magnitude of}} the crown or concavity on centre-buckling of the strip are more significant than on edge-buckling...|$|R
40|$|A {{commonly}} used technology sequence in the fabrication of GaN-based HEMTs and MMICs {{is the so-called}} “embedded gate ” process, in which the gate metal is deposited into a trench opening in a dielectric passivation layer usually consisting of silicon nitride (SiNx). Control of the trench etching is of great importance, as the later semiconductor-metal interface at its bottom contributes significantly to the electrical characteristics and {{the reliability of the}} device. Plasma etching of SiNx can be performed with high and low bias levels. High bias processes are more anisotropic, but the semiconductor surface is more prone to damage. Low bias etching creates less surface damage, but isotropic etching causes a widening of the trench. A trapezoidal profile of the trench is highly desirable because it can support a void free metal filling and formed integrated field plates can reduce dc-RF dispersion and parasitic capacitance in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs [1, 2]. In this work we present a novel process for the formation of slanted gate trenches. The critical etching step is subdivided into 2 steps: (1) a high or low bias plasma etching process to partly form the trench, i. e., the SiNx layer will not completely etched down to the semiconductor interface, and (2) a wet chemical etch step with phosphoric acid to remove the remaining SiNx and to generate the desired trapezoidal trench profile. The process sequence is shown in Fig. 1. After nitride deposition covering the full wafer and trench lithography, the nitride is etched partially with a plasma etch process to retain the desired residual SiNx thickness (steps a – c). Then, the <b>resist</b> is <b>stripped</b> (ste...|$|R
