The most common amphibians recognized were frogs (Rana and Hyla). Specific species of reptiles and amphibians prey include: boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata); Canadian toads (Bufo hemiophrys); wood frogs (Rana sylvatica); bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana); green frogs (Rana clamitans); northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile); Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus); <b>rough-skinned</b> <b>newt</b> (Taricha granulosa); and garter snakes (Thamnophis).|$|E
5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution. An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the <b>rough-skinned</b> <b>newt</b> {{and the evolution of}} tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The <b>rough-skinned</b> <b>newt</b> (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 During a 13 -month period {{starting}} in October of 1976, adult male <b>rough-skinned</b> <b>newts</b> (Taricha granulosa) were collected periodically to study seasonal changes in reproductive status. Plasma androgen concentration, measured by radioimmunoassay, is elevated during autumn and spring (about 50 ng/ml). Winter and summer levels are considerably lower (less than 10 ng/ml). Seasonal changes in testis composition indicate one annual cycle of evacuation (October- March) and spermatogenetic recrudescence (March-October). Concomitant with decreasing ambient temperature in autumn are {{the occurrence of}} second metamorphosis, which includes the assumption of nuptial characteristics such as caudal fins, and the onset of spermiation and sex behaviors. To test the hypothesis that temperature influences plasma androgens through its effects on the pituitary-gonadal axis, newts were maintained at 12 ° or 18 °C for 6 weeks in the laboratory. Androgen levels remained unchanged. Caudal fins regressed in 18 °C newts and developed in 12 °C newts, suggesting that prolactin, but not luteinizing hormone, was affected by water temperature. To assess the contribution made by the mature testicular zone to plasma androgen levels, newts were subjected to either bilateral total or bilateral hemicastration. Hemicastration involved extirpation of the mature zone from each lobe of each testis. Each testis consists of several lobes; each lobe is comprised of distinct zones of different maturation stages. The mature zone, containing seminiferous lobules that are already evacuated or still contain sperm, was found to produce {{a significant portion of}} the plasma androgens...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn <b>rough-skinned</b> <b>newts,</b> Taricha granulosa, {{exposure}} to an acute stressor {{results in the}} rapid release of corticosterone (CORT), which suppresses the ability of vasotocin (VT) to enhance clasping behavior. CORT also suppresses VT-induced spontaneous activity and sensory responsiveness of clasp-controlling neurons in the rostromedial reticular formation (Rf). The cellular mechanisms underlying this interaction remain unclear. We hypothesized that CORT blocks VT-enhanced clasping by interfering with V 1 a receptor availability and/or VT-induced endocytosis. We administered a physiologically active fluorescent VT conjugated to Oregon Green (VT–OG) to the fourth ventricle 9 min after an intraperitoneal injection of CORT (0, 10, 40 μg/ 0. 1 mL amphibian Ringers). The brains were collected 30 min post-VT–OG, fixed, and imaged with confocal microscopy. CORT diminished the number of endocytosed vesicles, percent area containing VT–OG, sum intensity of VT–OG, {{and the amount of}} VT-V 1 a within each vesicle; indicating that CORT was interfering with V 1 a receptor availability and VT-V 1 a receptor-mediated endocytosis. CORT actions were brain location-specific and season-dependent {{in a manner that is}} consistent with the natural and context-dependent expression of clasping behavior. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the Rf to CORT was much higher in animals during the breeding season, arguing for ethologically appropriate seasonal variation in CORT's ability to prevent VT-induced endocytosis. Our data are consistent with the time course and interaction effects of CORT and VT on clasping behavior and neurophysiology. CORT interference with VT-induced endocytosis may be a common mechanism employed by hormones across taxa for mediating rapid context- and season-specific behavioral responses...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 To {{determine}} whether a homologous neurohormone, arginine vasotocin (AVT), can elevate the occurrence of clasping behavior in male <b>rough-skinned</b> <b>newts</b> (Taricha granulosa), intact, sexually inactive males were injected with either AVT or saline. The incidence of courtship was elevated {{in the group of}} males injected with AVT, but not in the group injected with saline. When the relative potency of AVT was compared with that of a heterologous but structurally similar neurohormone, arginine vasopressin (AVP), no difference was found in the minimum behaviorally effective dose. Testicular androgens are known to influence the expression of sexual behaviors in male vertebrates. To {{determine whether}} androgens modify the behavioral effect of neurohormones, the effects of AVT on the incidence of clasping behavior was measured in castrated newts and compared to the effects in castrated, androgen-implanted newts. When castrated for only {{a short period of time}} (18 days), AVT increased the incidence of clasping behavior in unimplanted males, but not in androgen-implanted males. In contrast, when males were castrated for longer periods of time (33 and 54 days), AVT elevated the occurrence of clasping behavior in androgen-implanted males, but not in unimplanted newts. The effect of AVT on the incidence of clasping behavior was also measured in hypophysectomized males to determine if the pituitary is required for newts to respond behaviorally to AVT. When injected with AVT, the incidence of courtship was elevated in hypophysectomized males, sham-operated males, and pituitary transplated males. These experiments support the hypothesis that endogenous neurohormones, in addition to androgens, influence the incidence of sexual behaviors in male T. granulosa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. ⎯Reproductive {{success of}} {{amphibians}} {{is influenced by}} choice of oviposition sites, including NorthwesternSalamanders (Ambystoma gracile) whose egg masses are fixed to vegetation. During summers of 1999 - 2002, I surveyed 33 permanent ponds in a 26 ha wetland (935 m elevation) for Northwestern Salamander egg masses, quantified oviposition sitecharacteristics, and tracked embryonic development and survival. The number of egg masses found ranged from 141 - 235 annually, and the active oviposition period was 4 - 8 weeks. An average (+ SE) of 63. 4 ± 3. 7 % of egg masses were attached tostems of Sitka Sedge (Carex sitchensis), 23. 3 ± 3. 4 % to overhanging shrub stems or completely submerged sticks, and 8. 3 ± 4. 9 % were unattached. On average, 62. 0 ± 6. 1 % of egg masses were in deep water, 25. 7 ± 4. 9 % in shallow water, and 12. 3 ± 2. 6 % {{along the edge of}} deep and shallow areas. Egg masses were deposited at an average depth of 24. 4 ± 0. 5 cm. A mean of 53. 1 ± 3. 5 % of egg masses had at least one embryo hatch, which on average took 9. 0 ± 0. 5 weeks. Rough-skinned Newts(Taricha granulosa) were observed feeding on embryos. Regression tree models indicated that use of ponds for oviposition wasnegatively influenced by the relative abundance of <b>Rough-skinned</b> <b>Newts,</b> and positively related to the relative abundance oflarval Northwestern Salamanders. Hatching success was greatest in intermediate sized ponds where the number ofoverhanging shrubs was greatest. These results suggest that Northwestern Salamanders avoided ponds where potentialpredators were most abundant (including Brook Trout, Salvelinus fontinalis) and that the presence of larval conspecifics wasindicative of favorable oviposition and rearing habitats...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 This thesis {{describes}} {{studies that}} investigated 1) {{the effects of}} courtship on the neuroendocrine system of female <b>rough-skinned</b> <b>newts,</b> Taricha granulosa, and 2) whether the observed courtship-induced neuroendocrine changes affected female sexual receptivity. Sexual behaviors of female T. granulosa changed dramatically during courtship. Initially, females exhibited unreceptive behaviors to a courting male. After several hours of courtship, females displayed receptive behaviors, and males responded by attempting to transfer a sperm cap. Once courtship, insemination and post-insemination behaviors were complete, the female no longer became receptive to future courtship. Both telencephalic irLHRH and plasma estradiol concentrations changed as females became receptive. Early in courtship, when females were unreceptive, irLHRH concentrations in the telencephalon were elevated, {{but by the time}} females became receptive irLHRH concentrations were low. The change in telencephalic irLHRH concentration occurred in the nervus terminalis, a little understood cranial nerve that may influence reproduction. Plasma estradiol levels were low at courtship initiation, but were elevated by the time females became receptive. The observations, that irLHRH and estradiol concentrations were associated with changes in female sexual behaviors and that these hormones influence female sexual receptivity in other vertebrates, suggested that courtship by a male activates female sexual behavior by stimulating endogenous changes in LHRH and estradiol. Increasing or decreasing plasma estradiol concentrations or blocking the action of this steroid in the brain were found to have no effect on female receptivity. Also, injecting LHRH or LHRH analogs into brain was found to have no effect on female receptivity. Progesterone implantation inhibited receptivity suggesting that this steroid may be responsible for the post-insemination decrease in female sexual behavior. These results suggest that although courtship induces physiological changes in female T. granulosa, the changes in LHRH and estradiol may not be influencing receptivity...|$|R
