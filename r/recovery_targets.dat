40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to survey the {{relative}} importance of postoperative <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> and perioperative care items, as perceived by a large group of international dedicated professionals. METHODS: A questionnaire with eight postoperative <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> and 13 perioperative care items was mailed to participants of the first international Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) congress and to authors of papers with a clear relevance to ERAS in abdominal surgery. The responders were divided into categories according to profession and region. RESULTS: The <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> 'To be completely free of nausea', 'To be independently mobile' and 'To be able to eat and drink as soon as possible' received the highest score irrespective of the responder's profession or region of origin. Equally, the care items 'Optimizing fluid balance', 'Preoperative counselling' and 'Promoting early and scheduled mobilisation' received the highest score across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Functional recovery, as in tolerance of food without nausea and regained mobility, was considered the most important target of recovery. There was a consistent uniformity in the way international dedicated professionals scored the relative importance of <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> and care items. The relative rating of the perioperative care items was not dependent on the strength of evidence supporting the items...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{extending}} traditional Total Site Integration methodology {{to produce more}} meaningful utility and heat <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> for the process design. The traditional methodology leads to inadequate results due to inaccurate estimation of the overall Total Site heat <b>recovery</b> <b>targets.</b> The new methodology is a further development of a recently extended traditional pinch methodology. The previous extension was on the introduction of using an individual minimum temperature difference (δTmin) for different processes so that the δTmin is more representative of the specific process. Further this paper deals with stream specific δT min inside each process by setting different δT contribution (δTcont) and also using different δTcont between the process streams and the utility systems.

40|$|Data from 4, 713 {{fisheries}} worldwide, representing 78 % {{of global}} reported fish catch, are analyzed {{to estimate the}} status, trends, and benefits of alternative approaches to recovering depleted fisheries. For each fishery, we estimate current biological status and forecast the impacts of contrasting management regimes on catch, profit, and biomass of fish in the sea. We estimate unique <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the year-by-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Current status is highly heterogeneous—the median fishery is in poor health (overfished, with further overfishing occurring), although 32 % of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition. Our business-as-usual scenario projects further divergence and continued collapse {{for many of the}} world's fisheries. Applying sound management reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generate annual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons (MMT) in catch, $ 53 billion in profit, and 619 MMT in biomass relative to business as usual.

40|$|This paper compares Utility Heat Exchanger Network (UEN) design {{between two}} Total Site Heat Integration (TSHI) methods, the Conventional Total Site Targeting method (CTST) and the {{recently}} developed Unified Total Site Targeting (UTST) method. A large Kraft Pulp Mill plant has been chosen {{as a case}} study. Total Site targets have been calculated using a Excel ™ targeting spreadsheet and networks have been designed {{with the help of}} Supertaget ™ for both the CTST and UTST methods. To achieve heat recovery and utility targets, both series and parallel utility heat exchanger matches for non-isothermal utilities are allowed in the CTST method, while series matches are allowed in the UTST method if the heat exchangers in series are from the same process. Series matches based on CTST method may create a dependency on two or more separate processes, which operational and control issues may occur, higher piping costs may be imposed, and utility target temperatures may not be achieved in the consecutive processes if one or more processes were to be out of service. Relaxation of the network can resolve these issues for the CTST method; however, if the relaxation occurs {{on the side of the}} utility loop that constrains heat recovery, the net heat <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> may not be achieved within the Total Site. The UTST method with its modified targeting procedure may offer slightly lower heat <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> but with simpler UEN design compared to CTST method are more realistic and achievable.

40|$|The {{whooping}} crane (Grus americana) winters on the Texas coast primarily in salt marsh habitat. The location of adult {{whooping crane}} winter territories during 9 winters between 1950 and 2006 {{was derived from}} aerial census data digitized onto infrared photos using GIS software. Range expansion, including changes in distribution and size of winter territories, was analyzed over a 57 -year period as flock size increased by 765 %. Crane pairs have opted to establish territories in or close to the traditional winter area rather than moving long distances along the coast. This distribution seems based on the preference of the male crane to establish a territory {{as close as possible}} to its parents. Colonizing occurred to the nearby areas of Matagorda Island in 1958, San Jose Island in 1969, Lamar Peninsula in 1971, and Welder Flats in 1973. Minimum territory sizes were calculated to be 101 ha for Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and West St. Charles Bay, 139 ha for Welder Flats, 204 ha for Matagorda Island and Welder Flats, and 304 ha for San Jose Island. Salt marsh habitat was measured to determine if enough winter area is present to reach <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> and to predict expected use patterns for the near future. Based on an average winter territory size of 172 ha, the current winter range and contiguous areas can support up to 576 whooping cranes. Additional salt marsh habitat was measured in a 111 -km radius from Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. If suitable, this noncontiguous area could support an additional 580 whooping cranes to reach a total flock size of 1, 156.
