5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, <b>roll-off</b> and passband ripple.|$|E
5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of <b>roll-off.</b> These were achieved {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E
5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing <b>roll-off</b> and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E

30|$|The {{corresponding}} dephasing filter-transfer {{functions for}} these three optimized gates {{are shown in}} Figure  3 (c). As expected from Eq. (21), with C_ 2 ^(z) = 0, these approximately satisfy F_z∝(ωτ)^ 4 in the stopband, producing first-order filters with (p- 1) = 1. For comparison we include the dephasing filter-transfer function for a primitive π rotation where F_z∝(ωτ)^ 2, implying (p- 1)= 0. The steeper slopes, or <b>roll-offs,</b> for the optimized WAMF_ 0, 3 ^(1) gates captures this difference.

Various topologies for making add/drop filters using integrated gratings are outlined. Each class of devices is studied in detail and the theoretical tools needed for designing the add/drop are developed. First-order filters using Bragg resonators {{do not meet}} WDM add/drop filter specifications. Consequently, schemes to design higher-order filters are derived. The relative {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the various possiblities are outlined. Preliminary integrated Bragg grating devices, in InP, were designed using the tools developed. The fabricated devices were measured. The measurements revealed low-loss structures with a 40, 000. Measurements on higher-order inline coupled Bragg resonator filters showed flat-top and fast <b>roll-offs.</b> The results of the measurements and comparison with the theory are presented for the various devices.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{question}} that the commercial success of smartphones has substantially increased the volume of products utilizing Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, especially accelerometers, gyroscopes, bandpass filters, and microphones. The Internet of Things (IoT), a more recent driver for small, low power microsystems, seems poised to provide an even bigger market for these and other potential products based on MEMS. Given that the IoT will likely depend heavily on massive sensor networks using nodes for which battery replacement might not be practical, cost and power consumption become even more important. As already known for existing sensor networks, sleep/wake cycles will likely be instrumental to maintaining low sensor node power consumption in the IoT, and if so, then the clocks that must continuously run to synchronize sleep/wake events often become the bottlenecks to ultimate power consumption. On the communications side, narrowband RF channel-selecting front-end filters stand to greatly reduce receive power consumption by relaxing transistor circuit dynamic ranges. Both {{the accuracy of the}} clocks and ability of filters to achieve bandwidths small enough to select individual channels depend heavily on the accuracy and precision to which the frequency-setting devices they rely on are constructed. Inevitably, fabrication tolerances are finite, which means the ability to attain the highest performance relies on trimming or tuning. This dissertation focuses on methods by which voltage-controlled frequency tuning of capacitively-transduced micromechanical resonators make possible 1) an ultra-compact, low-power 32. 768 -kHz micromechanical clock oscillator; and 2) a high-order, small percent bandwidth coupled-resonator filter with minimal passband distortion. Currently, quartz crystal-based oscillators at 32. 768 kHz dominate the market because they offer the best combination of cost and performance. However, the physical dimensions of these oscillators are presently too large for future small form-factor electronic applications, such as ones that fit within credit cards. While there have been attempts to shrink quartz resonating elements, the increasingly difficult fabrication steps required to produce such devices raises manufacturing costs, thereby preventing widespread adoption (so far). In addition, quartz crystal motional resistance values typically increase as resonator dimensions shrink, which in many oscillator configurations raises power consumption. Unlike common quartz resonators, properly designed MEMS resonators benefit greatly from scaling in that reductions in lateral dimensions lead to a rapid decrease in motional resistance by a square law. The work described herein harnesses these scaling advantages to realize an oscillator much smaller than quartz-based oscillators with potential for much less power consumption. Specifically, this work uses aggressive lithography to achieve a capacitive-comb transduced micromechanical resonator occupying only 0. 0154 mm 2 of die area. Wire bonding this resonator to a custom sustaining amplifier and a supply voltage of only 1. 65 V then realizes a 32. 768 -kHz real-time clock oscillator more than 100 × smaller by area than miniaturized quartz crystal implementations and at least 4 × smaller than other MEMS-based approaches. The use of voltage-controlled tuning Oscillations sustains with only 2. 1 μW of power consumption. On the filter front, whether realized using quartz, FBAR, or capacitive-gap transduced MEMS resonator, mechanical filter responses are only as flat as the accuracy of their constituent resonator center frequencies. While narrowband micromechanical filters comprised of up to three mechanically coupled resonators have been demonstrated in the past, there exists a demand for bandpass filters with even sharper <b>roll-offs</b> and larger stopband rejections, and this requires higher order filters utilizing more than three coupled resonators. The work herein demonstrates filters comprised of four coupled resonators with bandwidths narrow enough to select individual channels. Before correction, filter passbands fresh out of the fab look nothing like their intended responses. Application of the automated passband correction protocol of this work, based on voltage-controlled frequency tuning, permits measurement of a 4 -resonator micromechanical filter with a 0. 1 % bandwidth commensurate with the needs of channel-selection (albeit at a low frequency) and an impressive 20 -dB shape factor of 1. 59, all with less than 3 dB of additional passband ripple (beyond the design ripple) ...|$|R
25|$|This {{design is}} simple, {{but a good}} basis for a {{practical}} design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably {{be found in a}} real design that would <b>roll-off</b> the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.|$|E
25|$|DIBL and VT roll off: Because of the short-channel effect, channel {{formation}} {{is not entirely}} done by the gate, but now the drain and source also affect the channel formation. As the channel length decreases, the depletion regions of the source and drain come closer together and make the threshold voltage (VT) {{a function of the}} length of the channel. This is called VT <b>roll-off.</b> VT also becomes function of drain to source voltage VDS. As we increase the VDS, the depletion regions increase in size, and a considerable amount of charge is depleted by the VDS. The gate voltage required to form the channel is then lowered, and thus, the VT decreases with an increase in VDS. This effect is called drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL).|$|E

According to Red Book specifications, the compact disc has a frequency response of 20Hz up to 22,050Hz, and most CD players measure flat within {{a fraction of a}} decibel from at least 20Hz to 20kHz at full output. Turntable rumble obscures the low-end limit of vinyl but the upper end can be, with some cartridges, reasonably flat within a few decibels to 30kHz, with gentle <b>roll-off.</b> Carrier signals of Quad LPs popular in the 1970s were at 30kHz {{to be out of the}} range of human hearing. The average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from 20Hz to a maximum of around 20,000Hz. The upper and lower frequency limits of human hearing vary per person. High frequency sensitivity decreases as a person ages, a process called presbycusis. By contrast, hearing damage from loud noise exposure typically makes it more difficult to hear lower frequencies, such as three kHz through six kHz.|$|E
