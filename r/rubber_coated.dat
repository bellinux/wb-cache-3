40|$|In {{this paper}} {{condition}} assessment of silicon <b>rubber</b> <b>coating</b> applied to high voltage insulators is proposed. Electrical, thermal and chemical measurement methods {{are used to}} evaluate the condition of silicon <b>rubber</b> <b>coating.</b> From an asset management perspective, hydrophobicity is shown to be the key indicator of aging, and this the remnant life, of the coating material. The increase in the content of surface oxygen is an indicator of hydrophobicity deterioration under the power system. In addition, detecting the diffusion of the low-molecular-weight siloxane from the bulk to the surface can be utilized to indicate the relative ability to recover hydrophobicity after aging.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, {{activated}} carbon was prepared from <b>rubber</b> seed <b>coat</b> by physicochemical activation {{for the removal}} of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) dye from aqueous solution. The effects of dye initial concentration, contact time, solution temperature and pH on RBBR adsorption onto <b>rubber</b> seed <b>coat</b> based activated carbon (RSCAC) were investigated. The adsorption uptake was found to increase with increase in initial dye concentration and contact time. Change in temperature and pH also played an important role to RBBR adsorption capability. Study showed that <b>rubber</b> seed <b>coat</b> is suitable to be used as activated carbon precursor...|$|R
5000|$|A Blast Ball (also {{known as}} a [...] "Tear Ball" [...] or [...] "Rubber Ball Grenade") is a ball-shaped, <b>rubber</b> <b>coated,</b> less-lethal hand grenade {{designed}} for police and corrections applications. A Blast Ball {{is similar to a}} traditional [...] "flash-bang" [...] grenade in that, when detonated, it generates a loud noise and bright light. In addition, however, a Blast Ball will also release a chemical irritant, either OC gas or CS gas.|$|E
5000|$|The weight plates, {{typically}} {{referred to}} as [...] "bumper plates" [...] because of their <b>rubber</b> <b>coated</b> design, weigh between 0.5 kg and 25 kg. The bumper plates are coated with rubber to allow the weights to be dropped from various heights—either after a successful lift or during an unsuccessful one. Olympic bumper plates conform to international standards for colouring. That is, 10 kg is green, 15 kg is yellow, 20 kg is blue, and 25 kg is red.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} of {{escalating}} incidents at the anti-barrier protest demonstrations led to the fatal shooting of 10-year-old Ahmed Moussa on 29 July 2008. The incident occurred {{when a group of}} mostly teenage boys had gone to the barrier construction site outside Ni'ilin, where there were no security personnel, the boys began removing razor wire. A preliminary Israeli police probe has found that Israeli border policemen used live ammunition to disperse the group and that one of the bullets likely killed 10 year old Ahmed Moussa. During the demonstration 15 others were injured by <b>rubber</b> <b>coated</b> steel bullets. The funeral of Ahmed Moussa was marred by a distinct up-swing in violence. The permanent stationing of a Border Police force, ordered by OC Central Command Maj.-Gen. Gadi Shamni, {{on the outskirts of the}} village where the daily demonstrations are held, infuriated marchers in the funeral procession. Yousef Ahmed Younis Amera, (18), was declared brain dead in a Ramallah hospital on Wednesday 30 July 2008 after being shot in the head with a <b>rubber</b> <b>coated</b> steel bullet and finally died on Monday 4 August 2008. On the 5 August 2008 Israeli police said that they had detained a border policeman and placed him under house arrest in connection with the death of 10 year old Ahmed Moussa.|$|E
