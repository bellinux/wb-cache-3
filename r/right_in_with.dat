De Greiff who had not been an open communist was nevertheless of leftist tendencies and fit <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the crowd, and after the summit he traveled to, at the invitation of the respective governments, the Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of China, East Germany, Austria, the SFR Yugoslavia, and France. The trip lasted a total of 115 days and it would mark him politically and personally as a friend and ally of the communists.|$|E

500|$|Richmond {{grew up in}} {{a wealthy}} family and lived a {{freewheeling}} lifestyle, earning him the nickname [...] "Hollywood". In describing Richmond's influence in racing, Charlotte Motor Speedway president Humpy Wheeler said, [...] "We've never had a race driver like Tim in stock car racing. He was almost a James Dean-like character." [...] When Richmond was cast for a bit part in the 1983 movie Stroker Ace, [...] "He fell <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the group working on the film," [...] said director Hal Needham. Cole Trickle, the main character in the movie Days of Thunder, played by Tom Cruise, was loosely based on Richmond and his interaction with Harry Hyde and Rick Hendrick.|$|E
500|$|Since Henson's death, Labyrinth {{has been}} re-evaluated by several notable critics. A review from 2000 in Empire {{magazine}} called the film [...] "a fabulous fantasy" [...] and wrote, [...] "David Bowie cuts a spooky enough figure in that fright wig to fit <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> this extraordinary menagerie of Goth Muppets. And Jennifer Connelly, {{still in the}} flush of youth, makes for an appealingly together kind of heroine." [...] Writing for the Chicago Tribune in 2007, Michael Wilmington described Labyrinth as [...] "dazzling", writing that it is [...] "a real masterpiece of puppetry and special effects, an absolutely gorgeous children's fantasy movie". In 2010 Total Film ran a feature called 'Why We Love Labyrinth' which described Labyrinth as a [...] "hyper-real, vibrant daydream, Labyrinth's main strength lies in its fairytale roots, which give the fantastical story a platform from which to launch into some deliriously outlandish scenarios". In their February 2012 issue, Empire featured a four-page spread on Labyrinth {{as part of their}} Muppet Special.|$|E
500|$|VanOrd praised {{both the}} art {{style and the}} rise in {{technical}} finesse for facial movements despite the latter still looking stilted, but noted that problems with enemy AI were carried over from the main game. Parkin negatively noted the [...] "dark, repetitive" [...] environments, while MacDonald praised the improved lighting and found the music serviceable: her major technical criticism was long loading times on the console versions. Its standing as DLC divided opinions. Tan praised its separation from the main game, and called it [...] "a well-produced piece of DLC {{with a level of}} quality that fits <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the main game both in terms of quality and atmosphere". Parkin felt it was too insubstantial to stand on its own despite positively noting it as a means of experimenting with augmentations prior to performing similar upgrades in the main game. MacDonald was more positive, echoing Tan's sentiments of it being a strong piece of DLC despite lacking replay value. Both Frances and Evans-Thirlwell were positive, echoing MacDoland's praise of the DLC's standalone strength.|$|E

500|$|Since {{its initial}} reception, the album has been praised by critics for Charles's style and manner of {{interpreting}} country music into his R musical language. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that the}} [...] "masterful interpretation of several country standards ... opened a lot of pop ears to country music and showed Nashville much about {{the proper use of}} orchestration." [...] Allmusic editor Stephen Cook called the album a [...] "fine store of inimitable interpretations", and stated, [...] "Less modern for its country-R blend and lushly produced C tone than for its place as a high-profile crossover hit, Modern Sounds in Country and Western fit <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> Ray Charles's expansive musical ways while on the Atlantic label in the '50s". Chris Neal of Country Weekly commented that Charles [...] "recast 12 country favorites in big-band and orchestrated settings with a visionary’s easy grace", adding that he [...] "gets to the heart of each [...] in a way that remains thoroughly modern." [...] John Morthland of the Oxford American called it a [...] "landmark LP of transcendent vocals set against kitschy orchestrations that (along with early rock 'n' roll) illuminated black-white roots connections for a popular audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Production of {{the song}} has been cited for drawing {{influence}} from multiple songs including; Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] for its [...] "swagga", Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Love Don't Cost a Thing" [...] for its [...] "attitude", as well as combining [...] "a touch of Lil Wayne's 'Milli. Josh Langhoff from PopMatters, however, felt that the song followed similar suit to that of MIA. Jocelyn Vena, from MTV News, commented that [...] "Sleazy" [...] "fits <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> [...] party-anthem discography". Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote that the song contains [...] "tribal anti-bourgeois bounce". Bill Lamb from About.com noted that Bangladesh's production [...] "pumps up the hard edge and club readiness". [...] "The Sleazy Remix" [...] features rapper André 3000, who raps over the song's [...] "bouncy thump" [...] beat talking about a young child dealing with his deadbeat father, [...] "We start out so cute in our baby pictures/ That mama shot for our daddy so that he wouldn't forget you/ He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember/ If not, he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him." [...] André then transitions into a rap about his friendship with Kesha before she takes over the rest {{of the song}}.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times complimented {{the song}} {{and said that the}} song [...] "tells good things for this winter's blockbuster-to-be. It's not a reimagining or a musical departure, but simply a righting of the ship. The song is big, bold and seems to have a little spot-o-fun". MTV was also positive, stating that [...] "Adele's lush song fits <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> {{classics}} by Shirley Bassey, Paul McCartney and Carly Simon". The Wall Street Journal felt similarly, writing that the song [...] "has sweep and drama, [...] orchestral support [...] gives it a classical timelessness that sets it apart from typical pop songs. Because it is a theme for a Bond film, after all, the song is also shot through with the threat of violence and death". E! Online wrote that Adele's song was [...] "a cross, and a good one at that, between the 1971 Bassey classic and a more-focused version of Garbage's 'The World Is Not Enough'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the song [...] "instantly feels like a Bond theme, with the singer's sultry voice set against a minor chord progression. Done in big, orchestral style, the mood – like the singer – is all 1960s throwback, back when Bond themes like 'Goldfinger' were smooth, seductive and larger than life".|$|E

500|$|Mary's Club {{has been}} called a [...] "downtown institution" [...] and a [...] "Portland nightlife landmark". In 2001, The Portland Mercury called the club [...] "a must-visit for any true strip club connoisseur" [...] for {{offering}} [...] "friendliness and sexiness". A reporter found the interior [...] "cozy", with conversational dancers who seemed to enjoy their interaction with guests. After Keller's death, Willamette Week said that the club [...] "has cemented its place in history far beyond the city limits" [...] for featuring Love and Jorgensen and offering nudity to a loyal customer base. The newspaper's Mary Christmas wrote that Keller had become a [...] "regional celebrity" [...] and could be credited with beginning a local industry. In 2011, a contributor to the Daily Vanguard (Portland State University's student newspaper) included Mary's on his list of the city's top five strip clubs: [...] "If you visit only one dance club in this town it should probably be Mary’s. The inside is stuffy and sleazy, but embodies that red-light district feel that fits <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> [...] rowdy environment." [...] That year, Willamette Week called the club [...] "the undisputed grande dame of West Coast strips" [...] and [...] "a stubbornly degenerate landmark". According to the newspaper's Matthew Korfhage, its entertainment {{came in the form of}} [...] "girls/ladies, friendly also brassy, oddly classy, with sterling taste on the juke, who let you see all of their piercings and tattoos. Also, video poker". In 2013, Portland Monthly made Mary's Club an [...] "editor's pick" [...] for its dancers, its all-female staff, and its [...] "welcoming and relaxed" [...] environment. Thrillist.com included Mary's in its [...] "definitive guide" [...] to Portland's best strip clubs, complimenting its [...] "glorious flashing sign that welcomes you to Downtown" [...] and calling the club [...] "a part of Portland's past we should all cherish". Men's Fitness included Mary's on its list of the [...] "Top 10 Best Strip Clubs in America", calling it a [...] "neon landmark" [...] with blacklight murals and a [...] "relaxed, hole-in-the-wall vibe".|$|E

[...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that I had noticed they were beginning to look for liquor again and that it was not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until near the end of the season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take home with you when your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While they knew it was for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> my proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each pay day half of the money should be put away until the show closed. [...] Further, each man was warned that he must be more careful about drinking.” ...|$|E
