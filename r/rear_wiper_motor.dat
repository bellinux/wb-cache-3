40|$|Abstract. Reliability of {{automotive}} parts {{has been one}} of the most interesting fields in the automotive industry. Especially <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> for automobiles is important part because of improving visual comfort for the driver and the passengers. Therefore, we have dealt with the reliability test procedure of <b>wiper</b> <b>motor.</b> The failures such as wear-out of brush, bearing damage, motor coil burnout are caused by the electrical and mechanical operating for low and high actions of <b>wiper</b> <b>motor.</b> In this research, we have qualitatively selected the efficient test items through the analysis of the life and potential failures of <b>wiper</b> <b>motor.</b> So, <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> itself requires an estimation of life causing failure of brush wear out in order to operate the system safely. We have tested six <b>wiper</b> <b>motors.</b> The result is established by employing the weibull plot. We validated the life of <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> to the experimental result...|$|R

50|$|In {{the years}} after the {{creation}} of the first windshield wiper, Trico was involved in the development of vacuum-powered wiper systems. Trico was involved in a patent dispute with William M. Folberth who, with his brother Fred, invented a vacuum-powered <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> in 1919. The patent was granted in 1922, and Trico later purchased the Folberth company to settle the dispute.

5000|$|After {{giving the}} Lerma the correct {{appearance}} for a luxury car -at {{least for the}} preferences of the Mexican buyer- and correcting the error of the limited trunk space, VAM proceeded {{to solve the problem}} of the price. The company achieved a solution by creating two different trim levels for the model, the lower-priced intermediate [...] "Lerma 610" [...] and the upscale top-of-the-line [...] "Lerma 620". Despite their focus and advertisement, both versions were almost the same, the differences between each were limited to only five different standard accessories. The Lerma 610 was equipped with two-speed electric wipers, round dome light, heater with windshield defroster, plain passenger's side sun visor and a plain rear hatch glass. The Lerma 620 incorporated intermittent wipers, reading dome light, air conditioning, vanity mirror on passenger's side sun visor and <b>rear</b> <b>wiper</b> and washer. All five additional accessories of the 620 models could be ordered separately in the 610 models.
