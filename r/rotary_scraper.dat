50|$|The Euclid Crane and Hoist Co, {{owned by}} George A. Armington and his 5 sons, was a large, {{respected}} and profitable operation, when they introduced the Euclid Automatic <b>Rotary</b> <b>Scraper</b> in 1924 - soon {{followed by the}} Euclid Wheeler (wheeled) scraper. These earthmoving products were conceived by George's eldest son, Arthur, who envisioned a good future in designing earthmoving equipment, and steered the company into the earthmoving field. The two models of scrapers were successful, and a third model, the Euclid Contractors Special, designed to cope with hard ground, was even more successful.|$|E
30|$|The {{outer edge}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>scraper</b> {{is very close to}} inner wall of the barrel. The {{revolving}} scraper can remove the dry layer of material caked on the inner wall of barrel. The dry layer will increase thermal resistance and affect heat transfer efficiency between the barrel wall and the material. At the same time, the revolving scraper has stirring effect on the material in barrel, and could accelerate vapors diffusion after liquids evaporation, and is beneficial to vapors discharge.|$|E
50|$|In late 1930 Davenport was {{licensed}} to assemble and market R G LeTourneau Inc products under the Davenport-LeTourneau brand. The agreement {{is believed to}} have ended in 1935 when LeTourneau’s moved to Peoria, Illinois. Davenport also sold Davenport-Winchell three-wheel roller conversions of industrial wheel tractors, Davenport-Frink snow plows which were built in license from Frink Sno-Plows Inc and Reynolds patented Mov-Mor <b>rotary</b> <b>scrapers.</b>|$|R
30|$|TPH {{residual}} content and moisture {{residual content}} at different stirring {{speed of the}} scraper are shown in Fig.  6. Compared with the static state, low speed of stirring could improve the removal efficiency of liquids. However, the increase of <b>scraper</b> <b>rotary</b> speed (10 – 25  rpm) has a little effect on liquids content change. It can be inferred that low-speed stirring can improve heat transfer condition and liquids removal efficiency, but the changes of <b>scraper</b> <b>rotary</b> speed on TPH and moisture removal rate are not remarkable.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Sludge {{level of}} the {{secondary}} sedimentation tank is an important technique parameter affecting the final result of activated wastewater treatment processes. A sludge level meter is usually fixed on the <b>rotary</b> or shuttlecock <b>scraper,</b> so {{it is difficult to}} transmit the measured data to the main control unit through a wired connection. This paper presents a wireless data communication solution which is based upon Bluetooth technology. The wireless sludge level monitoring system’s topology, hardware and software design are included.
