5|$|Having {{been given}} top {{priority}} by the Air Force, {{the first flight}} test of the Bold Orion missile was conducted on May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched the Bold Orion vehicle {{at the apex of}} a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> of the missile itself, allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E
5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor,</b> which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor,</b> the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
50|$|Specific impulse is {{also used}} to measure {{performance}} in model <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> Following are some of Estes' claimed values for specific impulses for several of their rocket motors: Estes Industries is a large, well-known American seller of model rocket components. The specific impulse for these model <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> is much lower than for many other <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> because the manufacturer uses black powder propellant and emphasizes safety rather than maximum performance. The burn rate and, hence, chamber pressure and maximum thrust of model <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> is also tightly controlled.|$|R
40|$|Medium lift EELVs {{may still}} {{play a role}} in manned space flight. To be {{considered}} for manned flight, medium lift EELVs must address the short comings in their current boost assist motors. Two options exist: redesign and requalify the solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> Replace solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> (SRMs) with hybrid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> Hybrid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> are an attractive alternative. They are safer than SRMs. The TRL's Lockheed Martin Small Launch Vehicle booster development substantially lowers the development risk, cost risk, and the schedule risk for developing hybrid boost assist for EELVs. Hybrid boosters testability offsets SRMs higher inherent reliability. Hybrid booster development and recurring costs are lower than SRMs. Performance gains are readily achieved...|$|R

Minotaur IV combines decommissioned Peacekeeper <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> with proven Orbital avionics and fairings to provide increased lifting capacity for government-sponsored payloads.|$|R
5|$|By early 1938 the Group {{had made}} their static <b>rocket</b> <b>motor,</b> which {{originally}} burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist {{to become involved in}} the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the People's Daily World and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the need to focus on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hope}} of gaining access to the {{state-of-the-art}} resources of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture {{on the work of}} Austrian rocket engineer Eugen Sänger and hypothetical above-stratospheric aircraft by the institute's William Bollay— a PhD student specializing in rocket-powered aircraft—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel <b>rocket</b> <b>motor.</b> Bollay redirected them to another PhD student named Frank Malina, a mathematician and mechanical engineer composing a thesis on rocket propulsion who shared their interests and soon befriended the pair. Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech together; they did not mention that their ultimate objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then relegated such ideas to science fiction. While Caltech's Clark Blanchard Millikan immediately rebuffed them, Malina's doctoral advisor Theodore von Kármán saw more promise in their proposal and agreed to allow them to operate {{under the auspices of the}} university's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they gained access to Caltech's specialist equipment, though the economics of the Great Depression left von Kármán unable to finance them.|$|E

While the ordinary GTR-18A has a simple, model rocket type motor, an improved 'Dual Thrust Smokey Sam' tested in the early 2000s featured a modified <b>rocket</b> <b>motor,</b> providing a 1.5 second boost period, followed by a lower-thrust sustainer burn with burnout occurring at 7.1 seconds after launch.|$|E

25|$|As an experiment, {{the basic}} single-seat Su-6 design was {{converted}} into a mixed-power high-altitude interceptor named Su-7 (the name was reused in 1950s for a supersonic fighter-bomber). The armor was removed and the fuselage was of all-metal construction. Power came from a Shvetsov ASh-82FN piston engine with two TK-3 turbochargers in the nose and a Glushko RD-1-KhZ rocket engine in the tail. The piston engine produced 1,380kW (1,850hp), while the rocket engine utilized kerosene and nitric acid for fuel and generated 2.9kN (600lbf) of thrust for up to 4 minutes. Armament consisted of three 20mm ShVAK cannon with 370 rounds of ammunition. The sole Su-7 was completed in 1944. Test flights demonstrated {{a top speed of}} 510km/h (275kn, 315mph) at 12,000m (39,370ft) without the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor,</b> and 705km/h (380kn, 440mph) with the rocket.
