40|$|International {{audience}} Release studies {{constitute a}} fundamental {{part of the}} nanovector characterization. However, {{it can be difficult}} to correctly assess the release of lipophilic compounds from lipid nanocarriers using conventional assays. Previously, we proposed a method including an extraction with oil to measure the loading stability of lipophilic dyes in lipid nanocapsules (LNCs). The method indicated a rapid release of Nile Red from LNCs, while the loading of lipophilic carbocyanine dyes remained stable. This method, although interesting for a rapid screening of the fluorescence labeling stability of nanocarriers, is far from what happens in vivo, where lipid acceptor phases are nanostructured. Here, lipophilic dye loading stability has been assessed, by monitoring dye transfer from LNCs toward stable colloidal lipid nanocompartments, i. e. non-loaded LNCs, using new methodology based on size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Dye transfer between LNCs and THP- 1 cells (as model for circulating cells) has also been studied by FACS. The assays reveal an almost instantaneous transfer of Nile Red between LNCs, from LNCs to THP- 1 cells, between THP- 1 cells, and a <b>reversal</b> <b>transfer</b> from THP- 1 cells to LNCs. On the contrary, there was no detectable transfer of the lipophilic carbocyanine dyes. Dye release was also analyzed using dialyses, which only revealed a very slow release of Nile Red from LNCs, demonstrating the weakness of membrane based assays for investigations of the lipophilic compound loading stability in lipid nanocarriers. These results highlight the importance of using relevant release assays, and the potential risk of an immediate unloading of lipophilic fluorescent dyes from lipid nanocarriers, in the presence of a lipid acceptor nanocompartment. Some misinterpretations of cellular trafficking and in vivo biodistribution of fluorescent nanoparticles should be avoided. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In time {{reversal}} acoustics experiments, {{a signal}} is emitted from a localized source, recorded at {{an array of}} receivers-transducers, time reversed, and finally re-emitted into the medium. A celebrated feature of time reversal experiments is that the refocusing of the re-emitted signals {{at the location of}} the initial source is improved when the medium is heterogeneous. Contrary to intuition, multiple scattering enhances the spatial resolution of the refocused signal and allows one to beat the diffraction limit obtained in homogeneous media. This paper presents a quantitative explanation of time reversal and other more general refocusing phenomena for general classical waves in heterogeneous media. The theory is based on the asymptotic analysis of the Wigner transform of wave fields in the high frequency limit. Numerical experiments complement the theory. Key words.

Instead of relying on binary lotteries and income distributions, we used ten multiple-outcome lotteries and ten n-dimensional income distributions which corresponded exactly to the lotteries. The lotteries and income distributions were chosen so as to model generalized P-bets (negatively skewed distributions) and generalized $-bets (positively skewed distributions), but we also used other shapes (uniform, symmetrical, and bimodal distributions). Thirdly, we applied material incentives to our subjects which were recruited from students of the Universities of Bari, Italy, and Castellón, Spain.

40|$|The {{tolerance}} towards oxic {{conditions of}} O- 2 -tolerant [NiFe] hydrogenases has {{been attributed to}} an unusual [4 Fe- 3 S] cluster that lies proximal to the [NiFe] active site. Upon exposure to oxygen, this cluster converts to a superoxidised (5 +) state, which is believed to secure the formation of the so-called Ni-B state that is rapidly reactivated under reducing conditions. Here, the reductive reactivation of the membrane-bound [NiFe]-hydrogenase (MBH) from Ralstonia eutropha in a native-like lipid membrane was characterised and compared to a variant that instead carries a typical [4 Fe- 4 S] proximal cluster. Reactivation from the Ni-B state was faster in the [4 Fe- 4 S] variant, suggesting that the reactivation rate in MBH is limited by the reduction of the superoxidised [4 Fe- 3 S] cluster.

Restrictions have been made {{on the characteristics of}} the companion {{as well as on the}} initial orbital parameters in order to avoid the occurrence of <b>reversal</b> mass <b>transfer</b> before carbon is ignited in the core. The system undergoes three mass loss episodes. The first and second ones are a consequence of a case B Roche lobe overflow. During the third mass loss episode stellar winds may play a role comparable to, or even more important than Roche lobe overflow. In this paper, we extend the previously existing calculations of stars of intermediate mass belonging to close binary systems by following carefully the carbon burning phase of the primary component. We also propose different possible outcomes for our scenario and discuss the relevance of our findings. In particular, our main result is that the resulting white dwarf component of mass 1. 1 M_ more likely has a core composed of oxygen and neon, surrounded by a mantle of carbon-oxygen rich material. The average abundances of the oxygen-neon rich core are X(O^ 16) = 0. 55, X(Ne^ 20) = 0. 28, X(Na^ 23) = 0. 06 and X(Mg^ 24) = 0. 05.

We study two extreme cases. In the first one the mass of the secondary is 8 M_s, whereas in the second one the mass was assumed to be 1 M_s. For the first of those cases we have also explored the possible outcomes of both conservative and non-conservative mass-loss episodes. During the first mass transfer episode, several differences arise between the models. The system with the more extreme mass ratio is not able to survive the 1 st. Roche lobe overflow, and spiral-in of the secondary onto the envelope of the primary is most likely. The system formed by two stars of comparable mass undergoes two mass transfer episodes in which the primary is the donor. We have performed two sets of calculations corresponding to this case in order to account for conservative and non-conservative mass transfer during the first mass loss episode. One of our main results is that for the non-conservative case the secondary becomes a Super-AGB. Such a star undergoes a final dredge-up episode, similar to that of a single star of comparable mass. The primary components do not undergo a Super-AGB phase, but instead a carbon-oxygen white dwarf is formed in both cases, before <b>reversal</b> mass <b>transfer</b> occurs.

We show with rigorous micromagnetic simulations and energy portraits that the skyrmion switching proceeds along a different path at very low PMA which results in a significant reduction in the spin current required or time required for reversal.

Experiment 5 also used a reversal task to train cows to select the arm of a T-maze when it was signalled by a yellow sign. However, transfer of learning was not shown when cows were tested in a new setting.

40|$|The Eckert number {{emerges as}} an {{important}} non-dimensional parameter, {{in addition to the}} Reynolds number and the Prandtl number, in problems involving heat transfer in compressible flows. The Eckert number is considered to represent a ratio of the flow kinetic energy at the wall and the specific enthalpy difference between the wall and the fluid, and is important when viscous dissipation is significant. This paper investigates the role played by the Eckert number during rapid decompression of high pressure gas pipelines. During such processes, the gas temperature attains very low values corresponding to sonic flow at the vent location, and it is often assumed that the pipeline material is also cooled to a comparable degree (2 ̆ 2 Low Temperature Excursions 2 ̆ 2). This has often led to over-specification of the properties required of the pipeline material. In this paper, it is shown using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations that the highly complex flow during rapid decompression of high-pressure gas pipelines leads to significant frictional dissipation (heating) adjacent to the pipe wall. This prevents the pipeline from attaining excessively low temperatures. It is shown that frictional heating may sometimes lead to a heat <b>transfer</b> <b>reversal.</b> This finding may help pipeline designers in making appropriate recommendations regarding the properties required of the pipeline materials.

The CD 8 � � CD 4 � subset, a minor population among splenic DCs, was found to mediate both tolerance and bystander suppression against diverse T cell specificities. Aggregated (agg) Ig-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an Ig chimera carrying the MOG 35 – 55 peptide, binds and cross-links Fc�R on APC leading to efficient peptide presentation and interleukin (IL) - 10 production. Furthermore, administration of agg Ig-MOG into diseased mice induces relief from clinical EAE involving multiple epitopes. Such recovery could not occur in Fc�R-deficient mice where both uptake of Ig-MOG and IL- 10 production are compromised. However, reconstitution of these mice with DC populations incorporating the CD 8 � � CD 4 � subset restored Ig-MOG– mediated <b>reversal</b> of EAE. <b>Transfer</b> of CD 8 � � or even CD 8 � � CD 4 � DCs had no effect on the disease. These findings strongly implicate DCs in peripheral tolerance and emphasize their functional potency, as a small population of DCs was able to support effective suppression of autoimmunity. Key words: autoimmunity • antigen delivery • dendritic cells • peripheral T cell tolerance • Fc � receptor...|$|R
5000|$|A {{consumer}} may {{initiate a}} chargeback by contacting their issuing bank and filing a substantiated complaint regarding {{one or more}} debit items on their statement. The threat of forced reversal of funds provides merchants with an incentive to provide quality products, helpful customer service, and timely refunds as appropriate. Chargebacks also provide a means for <b>reversal</b> of unauthorized <b>transfers</b> due to identity theft. Chargebacks can also occur {{as a result of}} friendly fraud, where the transaction was authorized by the consumer but the consumer later attempts to fraudulently reverse the charges. Card association chargeback rules are available online for public inspection and review. They comprise a system for adjudicating transaction disputes between cardholders and merchants, primarily where the issues can be resolved based on documentary evidence incident to the transaction. The rules provide for arbitration of issues by the card association. This may occur where the card issuer generates a second (or [...] "arbitration") chargeback against the merchant, after receiving the merchant's response to the initial chargeback. Normally this would require the cardholder to rebut elements of the merchant's response. The second chargeback results in a second crediting of the cardholder's account for the disputed funds, after having been credited back to the merchant with its response to the initial chargeback. The merchant's only recourse after the second chargeback is to initiate arbitration of the dispute by the card association. The fee for this is on the order of $250, and the arbitration loser is then obligated to pay the costs of the arbitration.|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} compared reversal shift, {{wherein the}} assignment of stimuli to categories changed but the relevant dimension did not change, to extradimensional shift, wherein a different dimension was made relevant after training. Chronic schizophrenics were trained to the same consecutive correct response criterion in a three-choice form or color discrimination and shifted to one of four possible transfer tasks. It was found that (a) extradimensional shift took more trials and errors to criterion than reversal shift and (b) more perseveration as compared to other errors {{were made by the}} total sample. The need for a uniform methodology and an evaluation of 5 selection factors when investigating the performance of schizophrenics is discussed. A number of studies of discrimination learning have been performed in an attempt to determine whether mediational responding occurs in both animals and human beings or whether the strict stimulus-response association principles better account for the results (Slamecka, 1968). These studies have usually compared transfer conditions wherein {{the assignment of}} stimuli to categories changes, but the relevant dimension does not change (postsolution <b>reversal</b> shift), to <b>transfer</b> conditions wherein a different dimension is made relevant (extradimensional shift). A dimension may be defined as a broad class of cues having a common stimulus property (e. g., color or form). Mediation, in this context, refers to S's ability to respond to the dimension as well as the dimensional cues. Forming a dimensional response in training will, it is hypothesized, facilitate the reversal in comparison to the extradimensional shift. From the results of these studies, £s have concluded that interspecies differences exist between man and lower animals in the ability to mediate, and that there are, as well, developmental differences in this ability within the human species (Kendler & Kendler, 1962). However, inconsistent results have obscured the interpretations with lower animals (Kelleher, 1956; 1 This study was completed during the author's employmen...|$|R
