5|$|When animals choose mates, traits such as {{signalling}} {{are subject}} to evolutionary pressure. For example, the male gray tree frog, Hyla versicolor, produces a call to attract females. Once a female chooses a mate, this selects for a specific style of male calling, thus propagating a specific signalling ability. The signal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its <b>repetition</b> <b>rate,</b> and so on. Various hypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation hypothesis proposes that pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution of signal innovation in male senders, {{in a similar way}} to the hidden preference hypothesis which proposes that successful calls are better able to match some 'hidden preference' in the female. Signallers have sometimes evolved multiple sexual ornaments, and receivers have sometimes evolved multiple trait preferences.|$|E

One is the optical clock, where an optical frequency is overlapped {{with a single}} tooth of the comb on a photodiode, and a radio frequency is compared to the beat signal, the <b>repetition</b> <b>rate,</b> and the CEO-frequency. Applications for the frequency-comb technique include optical metrology, frequency-chain generation, optical atomic clocks, high-precision spectroscopy, and more precise GPS technology.|$|E
25|$|The {{overall goals}} of PIP are to {{increase}} the <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> of the Booster beam from 7Hz to 15Hz and replace old hardware to increase reliability of the operation. Before {{the start of the}} PIP project, a replacement of the pre-accelerator injector was underway. The replacement of almost 40-year-old Cockcroft–Walton generators to RFQ started in 2009 and completed in 2012. At the linac stage, the analog beam position monitor (BPM) modules were replaced with digital boards in 2013. A replacement of Linac vacuum pumps and related hardware is expected to be completed in 2015. A study on the replacement of 201-MHz drift tubes is still ongoing. At the boosting stage, a major component of the PIP is to upgrade the Booster ring to 15-Hz operation. The Booster has 19 radio frequency stations. Originally, the Booster stations were operating without solid-state drive system which was acceptable for 7-Hz, but not for 15-Hz operation. A demonstration project in 2004 converted one of the stations to solid state drive prior to the PIP project. As part of the project, the remaining stations were successfully converted to solid state in 2013. Another major part of the PIP project is to refurbish and replace 40-year-old Booster cavities. Many cavities have been refurbished and tested to operate at 15Hz <b>repetition</b> <b>rate.</b> The completion of cavity refurbishment is expected to be completed in 2015 and the <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> can be gradually increased to 15-Hz operation from that point. A longer term upgrade task is to replace the Booster cavities with a new design. The research and development of the new cavities is underway. The completion of the Booster cavity replacement is expected to be in 2018.|$|E

25|$|In general, chopped mode {{is better}} for slower sweeps. It is {{possible}} for the internal chopping rate to be a multiple of the sweep <b>repetition</b> <b>rate,</b> creating blanks in the traces, but in practice this is rarely a problem; the gaps in one trace are overwritten by traces of the following sweep. A few oscilloscopes had a modulated chopping rate to avoid this occasional problem. Alternate mode, however, {{is better for}} faster sweeps.|$|E
25|$|If {{the input}} signal is periodic, the sweep <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> can be {{adjusted}} to display a few cycles of the waveform. Early (tube) oscilloscopes and lowest-cost oscilloscopes have sweep oscillators that run continuously, and are uncalibrated. Such oscilloscopes are very simple, comparatively inexpensive, and were useful in radio servicing and some TV servicing. Measuring voltage or time is possible, but only with extra equipment, and is quite inconvenient. They are primarily qualitative instruments.|$|E
25|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb {{can be generated}} by modulating the amplitude and/or phase of a continuous-wave laser with an external modulator driven by a radio-frequency source. In this manner, the frequency comb is centered around the {{optical frequency}} provided by the continuous-wave laser and the modulation frequency or <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> is given by the external radio-frequency source. The advantage of this method {{is that it can}} reach much higher repetition rates (>10GHz) than with mode-locked lasers and the two degrees of freedom of the comb can be set independently. The number of lines is lower than with a mode-locked laser (typically a few tens), but the bandwidth can be significantly broadened with nonlinear fibers. This type of optical frequency comb is usually called electrooptic frequency comb. The first schemes used a phase modulator inside an integrated Fabry–Perot cavity, but with advances in electro-optic modulators new arrangements are possible.|$|E

25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} is {{only one}} of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputter deposition (RF, magnetron, and ion beam). The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a ruby laser to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of pulsed laser deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of ultrashort pulsed laser sources with pulse durations inthe range {{of up to}} 10 picoseconds enables very precise materials processingwith negligible thermal load for the processed work pieces. While themachining quality is excellent, the comparable small productivity in termsof ablation rate is the main shortcoming that inhibits a widespread industrialapplication in many cases. Subject of this dissertation is the upscaling of USP laser ablation tohigher productivity by using average power of several hundred Watts whileincreasing the pulse <b>repetition</b> <b>rates</b> to several megahertz. Initially, theeffects that are limiting the upscaling process are identified and investigated. When using high <b>repetition</b> <b>rates,</b> these limiting effects are heataccumulation {{on the one hand}} and shielding by plasma or particle plumeson the other hand. Within the presented dissertation a theoretical model isdeveloped, which is capable of describing the impact of these two effects onthe achievable productivity. The high relevance of the two effects for theUSP laser ablation with high <b>repetition</b> <b>rates</b> is confirmed by experimentalresults. Heat accumulation is leading to the generation of melted and veryrough surfaces, which cannot be accepted for most applications. On theother hand, shielding effects lead to a decrease of the achieved productivityof up to 50 %. Therefore, these effects need to be considered when doingan upscaling by using high <b>repetition</b> <b>rates.</b> By comparing experimentalresults and the developed theoretical description, heat accumulation andshielding effects can be attributed to underlying physical quantities.
