50|$|<b>Riehl</b> <b>melanosis</b> {{is a form}} {{of contact}} dermatitis, {{beginning}} with pruritus, erythema, and pigmentation that gradually spreads which, after reaching a certain extent, becomes stationary. The pathogenesis of <b>Riehl</b> <b>melanosis</b> is believed to be sun exposure following the use of some perfumes or creams (a photocontact dermatitis).|$|E

In 1886, with Richard Paltauf, he described tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, and in 1917 described a type of hyperpigmentation known today as <b>Riehl</b> <b>melanosis.</b> At Vienna General Hospital he established a radiation treatment ward.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Facial hypermelanosis is a {{clinical}} feature of {{a diverse group}} of disorders most commonly in middle-aged females who are exposed to sunlight. There is a considerable overlap in clinical features among the clinical entities of facial hypermelanosis. Aetiology in most of facial melanosis is unknown, but some factors like UV radiation in melasma and exposure to allergens in <b>Riehl’s</b> <b>melanosis</b> could be implicated. Histopathology is an accurate diagnostic tool. The benefit of histopathology is not only to confirm diagnosis, but also to exclude related disorders. Among the hyperpigmented conditions, melasma, <b>Riehl’s</b> <b>melanosis,</b> Acanthosis Nigricans (AN) and Lichen Planus Pigmentosus (LPP) are the common causes of facial hypermelanosis - most common being melasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of hundred consenting patients who attended the outpatient wing of Dermatology Department of Government Medical College, Kottayam. They were included only after getting the written informed consent. RESULTS Maximum number of patients were in the 5 th decade. 65...|$|R
40|$|Facial melanoses (FM) are {{a common}} {{presentation}} in Indian patients, causing cosmetic disfigurement with considerable psychological impact. Some of the well defined causes of FM include melasma, <b>Riehl′s</b> <b>melanosis,</b> Lichen planus pigmentosus, erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP), erythrosis, and poikiloderma of Civatte. But there is considerable overlap in features amongst the clinical entities. Etiology {{in most of the}} causes is unknown, but some factors such as UV radiation in melasma, exposure to chemicals in EDP, exposure to allergens in <b>Riehl′s</b> <b>melanosis</b> are implicated. Diagnosis is generally based on clinical features. The treatment of FM includes removal of aggravating factors, vigorous photoprotection, and some form of active pigment reduction either with topical agents or physical modes of treatment. Topical agents include hydroquinone (HQ), which is the most commonly used agent, often in combination with retinoic acid, corticosteroids, azelaic acid, kojic acid, and glycolic acid. Chemical peels are important modalities of physical therapy, other forms include lasers and dermabrasion...|$|R
40|$|Discoid lupus {{erythematosus}} (DLE) {{is characterized by}} atrophic patches with peripheral hyperpigmentation on sun exposed skin areas. It rarely presents with diffuse hyperpigmented patches without erythema, adherent scale and atrophy on face and neck. This presentation is called as melanotic {{lupus erythematosus}} and it is rarely reported in literature. Other diseases that cause facial pigmentation as melasma, <b>Riehl</b> <b>melanosis,</b> lichen planus pigmentosus, drug related pigmentation {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis. We herein report a 66 year old male patient with diffuse blue-brown pigmentations on his face which was diagnosed as melanotic lupus erythematosus with the clinical, histopathological and immunofluoresence findings...|$|E
