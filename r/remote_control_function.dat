Separation of actinides is performed on chromatographic columns as sample preparation step for mass spectrometry measurements.

A semi - Automatic Separation Unit (ASU) was developed by JRC-ITU in collaboration with the IAEA as an alternative to manual separations under the EC support task to the IEA EC A- 1391.

40|$|Narcotic drug {{dependency}} {{rehabilitation programs}} aim {{to break with}} the routines and habits relating to the acquisition and use of illicit drugs. Most narcotic dependency rehabilitation patients have to visit a pharmacy daily to obtain supervised doses of narcotic rehabilitation medication. The aim of rehabilitation programs is often to progress patients to take away doses (TADs). However, there are inherent risks associated with TADs {{due to lack of}} security of the medication and monitoring of its use. This thesis documents the design, development, and testing of a "Remote Medication Dispenser" device which can provide a secure home-based method of medication delivery for these patients, in particular, for those using TADs. Both clinical and functional requirements for the dispenser were considered in the consultation with an expert health professional in this field. To meet the requirements, a secure and hands-free medication intake method was developed in which the device dispenses medication directly to the patient's mouth - under the tongue. The device has a microcontroller to internally control its operation, with external control achieved through a computer-based user interface. The device has an enclosed housing, thus if there is forced access to medication, evidence will be prominent. Medication is loaded into the dispenser only by pharmacists. A "dosing supervisor" controls the dispensing operation through an internet connection; the medication is dispensed one by one and managed by the patient. Two prototypes of the dispenser were proposed and implemented. The first prototype is a multi-dose device which can contain and dispense up to four doses. It was developed to study and investigate the proposed storing and dispensing approach. The second prototype is a single-dose device that contains only one dose of medication. The design was developed based on the first prototype with simplification to make it more mobile and reliable. Moreover, the second prototype has a remote control feature, which allows control via an internet connection. Both devices dispense the same type of medication and apply the same storing and dispensing method. The operation of the dispensers was assessed with lab-based trials. They both operated as expected and met the design's specifications except for unreliability of the multi-dose dispenser, which was related to its complexity. A patient trial was proposed using the second (single-dose) prototype with the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>function.</b> An Ethics Approval was granted in order to carry out the experiment. A questionnaire, which concentrates on the design and its operation, was developed to obtain feedback from patients when they use the device. The trials will be conducted subsequent to the submission of this thesis. In conclusion, the concept of a remote medication dispenser was successful in terms of design and lab based assessment of the developed prototypes. The design has potential to be applied in research and development, and in clinical settings, particularly in narcotic rehabilitation programs...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} study of a wireless remote monitoring and control system utilized for cultural heritage preservation purpose. The system uses wireless sensor networks to remotely monitor and control the indoor climate, i. e., temperature and relative humidity of the cultural buildings. The system mainly consists of three parts, i. e., the wireless sensor network part, the gateway part and the web service part. Wireless sensor networks are deployed in different cultural buildings. The ZigBee protocol is utilized for the wireless sensor network communication. Sensor nodes report the indoor climate periodically. By connecting with radiators and/or dehumidifiers, the wireless control nodes can control the indoor climate according to the remote configuration. A gateway maintains the communication between a wireless sensor network and the web service. In monitoring function, the gateway forwards sensor messages from the wireless sensor network to the web service. In control function, the gateway synchronizes the climate settings from the web service to the wireless sensor network. The gateway also sends control commands to the wireless control nodes in the wireless sensor network. The web service provides a web-based user interface for the system. Different from ordinary cable-connected sensor networks, a wireless sensor network that works for cultural heritage preservation should be a system {{with a large number}} of sensor nodes covering a large area in a building, high reliability in message transmission, low power consumption and low cost. In this study, the performance of the ZigBee wireless network is improved to meet such requirements base on the investigation of the ZigBee protocol limitation. Firstly, a method for enhancing the wireless sensor network communication reliability is developed. The reactive routing protocol defined by the ZigBee standard is improved so that the wireless nodes automatically detect and repair network communication problems. This method minimizes the message lost within the wireless sensor network by always reserving a route from the source node to the destination node. Secondly, a generic low power working method is developed for sensor devices. This method defines the general sensor module behavior which includes sensor data collecting, sensor message forwardingand wireless network rejoining upon communication failure. It allows sensor devices to maintain high message reliability with low power consumption. Especially, these methods are developed as a complementary infrastructure of the ZigBee wireless sensor network in order to increase the transmission reliability with low power consumption. Finally, methods and algorithms are developed to make it possible to power the ZigBee message relays (i. e., routers) with small batteries. In this system, the whole ZigBee network is synchronized. Wireless communications within the ZigBee network are scheduled so that every wireless transmission is collision-free. During the period when no communication is scheduled, the router can go into low power mode. This design improvement removes the original requirement of using mains power for ZigBee message relays. A truly battery-driven and low power consumption wireless sensor network is developed for monitoring cultural heritage buildings without (or with limited) mains power. The <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>function</b> is developed to mainly prevent biological degradation by controlling indoor climate, i. e., temperature and relative humidity. After studying the requirements for heritage preservation, a high flexibility, high reliability and low cost wireless indoor climate control system is developed. Different control algorithms are implemented to achieve different control results. Till today, the remote monitoring and control system presented in this dissertation has been installed in 31 cultural heritage buildings both in Sweden and Norway...|$|E
