5|$|On February 27, 1853, the twice-widower Crittenden {{married his}} third wife, Elizabeth Moss. Moss was twice-widowed, most <b>recently</b> <b>to</b> General William Henry Ashley. Moss was Crittenden's wife until his death. Crittenden served as {{attorney}} general until the expiration of Fillmore's term in 1853. Following his service {{as attorney general}}, he returned to private life. He made {{a substantial amount of}} money establishing mining claims for his clients in the former Mexican territory.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century {{historian}} W. F. Skene {{named the}} clan {{as one of}} the seven clans of Siol Alpinwho according to Skene could all trace their ancestry back to Alpin, father of Cináed mac Ailpín. Popular tradition has been until <b>recently</b> <b>to</b> consider Cináed mac Ailpín the first King of Scots and a Gael; however, recent research has shown he was actually a Pictish king and likely a Pict himself.|$|E
5|$|While {{significant}} {{attempts have}} been made <b>recently</b> <b>to</b> identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.|$|E

5|$|The road {{remains largely}} {{as it was}} on opening day, though the plants in its median {{have given way to}} a steel guard rail, and most <b>recently</b> <b>to</b> {{concrete}} barriers, and it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the original name to the roadway. All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the past}} twenty years, the OCA has {{established}} more than 220 new parishes. It {{was a member of}} the Standing Conference of Orthodox Bishops in America (SCOBA), together with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America (AOCA) and the other member jurisdictions. In 2010, SCOBA was dissolved with the creation of the new Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of North and Central America, which was mandated by Orthodox Patriarchates in 2009 at a meeting in Switzerland. Serious consideration has been given <b>recently</b> <b>to</b> a possible merger between the OCA and the AOCA. Both groups share a significant common history, in that a Syrian priest, Raphael Hawaweeny, was sent by the Moscow Patriarchate in the late 19th century as a missionary to Arabic-speaking Orthodox Christians living in North America. Raphael was ordained a bishop in 1904, and his flock eventually became the AOCA. Bishop Raphael was canonized in March 2000 by the OCA as St. Raphael of Brooklyn.|$|E
