40|$|Train {{circulation}} is {{a random}} dynamic phenomenon and, {{according to the}} different frequencies of the loads it imposes, there exists the corresponding response of track superstructure. Random dynamic phenomena are generally approached through the probability of occurrence (for stochastic processes see [1]). The railway track is modeled as a continuous beam on elastic support. At the moment when an axle of a railway vehicle passes from {{the location of a}} support point of a rail, that is a sleeper, a random dynamic load is applied on the sleeper. The theoretical approach for the estimation of the dynamic loading of a sleeper demands the analysis of the total load acting on the sleeper to individual component loads-actions, which, in general, can be divided into: the static component of the load‚ and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the <b>rail</b> (<b>sleeper),</b> the semi-static component of the load, and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the <b>rail</b> (<b>sleeper)</b> and the dynamic component of the load, and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the <b>rail</b> (<b>sleeper).</b> The motion of a railway vehicle on the rail running table –of the railway track– is described by formulas and it is illustrated through diagrams which have the form of a “signal”. It is a random/ stochastic dynamic phenomenon. The general equation that describes the motion is the second order differential equation (of motion). In the present paper the dynamic component of the Load and the relevant Action/ Reaction on each support point of the rail are investigated through a sensitivity analysis by variating parameters of the second order differential equation of motion of the Non Suspended Masses of the Vehicle ([2],[3]) and specifically the transient response of the reaction/ action on each support point (sleeper) of the rail. © 2014, North Atlantic University Union.

40|$|The {{railway track}} is modeled as a {{continuous}} beam on elastic support. Train circulation is a random dynamic phenomenon and, according to the different frequencies of the loads it im-poses, there exists the corresponding response of track superstructure. At the moment when an axle passes from {{the location of a}} sleeper, a random dynamic load is applied on the sleeper. The theoretical approach for the estimation of the dynamic loading of a sleeper demands the analysis of the total load acting on the sleeper to individual component loadsactions, which, in general, can be divided into: • the static component of the load' and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the <b>rail</b> (<b>sleeper)</b> • the dynamic component of the load, and the relevant to it reaction/action per support point of the <b>rail</b> (<b>sleeper)</b> The dynamic component of the load of the track depends on the mechanical properties (stiffness, damping) of the system "vehicle-track", and on the excitation caused by the vehicle's motion on the track. The response of the track to the aforementioned excitation results in the increase of the static loads on the superstructure. The dynamic load is primarily caused by the motion of the vehicle's Non-Suspended (unsprung) Masses, which are excited by track geometry defects, and, to a smaller degree, by the effect of the Suspended (sprung) Masses. In order to formulate the theoretical equations for the calculation of the dynamic component of the load, the statistical probability of exceeding the calculated load-in real conditions should be considered, so that the corresponding equations refer to the standard deviation (variance) of the load. In the present paper the dynamic component is investigated through the second order differential equation of motion of the Non Suspended Masses of the Vehicle and specifically the transient response of the reaction/ action on each support point (sleeper) of the rail. The case of a deformed or bent joint or welding is analyzed through the second order differential equation of motion and the solution is investigated...|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} for this thesis {{work is the}} need for improving reliability of equipment and quality of service to railway passengers as well as a requirement for cost-effective and efficient condition maintenance management for rail transportation. This thesis work develops a fusion of various machine vision analysis methods to achieve high performance in automation of wooden rail track inspection. The condition monitoring in rail transport is done manually by a human operator where people rely on inference systems and assumptions to develop conclusions. The use of conditional monitoring allows maintenance to be scheduled, or other actions to be taken to avoid the consequences of failure, before the failure occurs. Manual or automated condition monitoring of materials in fields of public transportation like railway, aerial navigation, traffic safety, etc, where safety is of prior importance needs non-destructive testing (NDT). In general, wooden railway sleeper inspection is done manually by a human operator, by moving along the <b>rail</b> <b>sleeper</b> and gathering information by visual and sound analysis for examining the presence of cracks. Human inspectors working on lines visually inspect wooden rails to judge the quality of <b>rail</b> <b>sleeper.</b> In this project work the machine vision system is developed based on the manual visual analysis system, which uses digital cameras and image processing software to perform similar manual inspections. As the manual inspection requires much effort and is expected to be error prone sometimes and also appears difficult to discriminate even for a human operator by the frequent changes in inspected material. The machine vision system developed classifies the condition of material by examining individual pixels of images, processing them and attempting to develop conclusions with the assistance of knowledge bases and features. A pattern recognition approach is developed based on the methodological knowledge from manual procedure. The pattern recognition approach for this thesis work was developed and achieved by a non destructive testing method to identify the flaws in manually done condition monitoring of sleepers. In this method, a test vehicle is designed to capture sleeper images similar to visual inspection by human operator and the raw data for pattern recognition approach is provided from the captured images of the wooden sleepers. The data from the NDT method were further processed and appropriate features were extracted. The collection of data by the NDT method is to achieve high accuracy in reliable classification results. A key idea is to use the non supervised classifier based on the features extracted from the method to discriminate the condition of wooden sleepers in to either good or bad. Self organising map is used as classifier for the wooden sleeper classification. In order to achieve greater integration, the data collected by the machine vision system was made to interface with one another by a strategy called fusion. Data fusion was looked in at two different levels namely sensor-level fusion, feature- level fusion. As the goal was to reduce the accuracy of the human error on the <b>rail</b> <b>sleeper</b> classification as good or bad the results obtained by the feature-level fusion compared to that of the results of actual classification were satisfactory...|$|E
30|$|In all {{the work}} {{mentioned}} above, the track (<b>rail,</b> <b>sleeper,</b> ballast, etc.) is assumed to rest on a rigid foundation, without taking into account of the elasticity of the ground. For track dynamics of high frequency (e.g., higher than 250  Hz), such a simplification is reasonable. However, when load frequency is low, {{as in the case}} of rail traffic-induced ground vibration, interactions between the track and the ground, and/or a tunnel may become significant. The track/tunnel/ground system may be simplified as a structure which is periodic in the track direction. In recent years, the Floquet transform has been employed to analyze the response of track/tunnel/ground systems as a periodic structure to moving harmonic loads [21, 22, 23]. With this transform, only a single segment has to be considered. The segment is modeled in a hybrid manner, i.e., using the 3 D FEM for the track and tunnel structure, and the boundary element method for the surrounding ground.|$|E

The main aim of the model is to determine the optimal replacement strategy, given replacement costs and resultant train operating cost benefits.

The cumulative exposure model is used to model the failure distributions. The operational cost per unit time depends on the maximum number of consecutive failed units. The replacement cost consists of the fixed cost and variable cost proportional to the number of units replaced. A finite horizon is considered and total expected cost is a criterion for comparing the proposed policies.

The quasi-static excitation dominated the sleeper response, and the dominant frequency range {{was found in the}} low-frequency zone corresponding to the fundamental axle passage frequency. For embankment surface, another pronounced dominant frequency zone was observed between 30 and 80 [*]Hz, which was attributed to the dynamic excitation. Moreover, these higher frequency components were more promptly attenuated than low-frequency ones. The reason that vibration levels generated by locomotive were greater than wagon was attributed to the different bogie suspension mode.

30|$|A Fourier transform-based {{method has}} been {{developed}} for calculating the response of a railway track as an infinitely long uniform periodic structure subject to moving or stationary harmonic loads. The track may become a non-uniform periodic structure by, for example, rail dampers which are installed between sleepers to control rolling noise and roughness growth. The period of the structure may become greater than the sleeper spacing. For those new situations, {{the current version of}} the method cannot be directly applied; it must be generalized and this is the aim of this paper. Generalization is performed by applying periodic conditions to each type of support and summarizing contributions from all types of support. Responses of the <b>rail,</b> <b>sleeper,</b> and damper are all formulated as an inverse Fourier transform from wavenumber domain to spatial domain. The generalized method is applied to investigate dynamics of a typical track with rail dampers of particular design. It is found that the rail dampers can significantly suppress the pinned–pinned vibration of the original track, widen the stop bands and increase vibration decay rate along the rail. However, it is also found that a new pinned–pinned mode is created by the dampers and between about 450 and 1, 300  Hz dampers vibrate stronger than the rail, making noise radiation from the dampers a potential issue. These concerns must be fully investigated in the future. The formulae presented in this paper provide a powerful tool to do that.|$|E
30|$|The railway track, {{including}} <b>rail,</b> <b>sleeper,</b> and fastener, is {{the most}} important infrastructure of the railway. Due to the long-term impact of the train and the natural environment on the railway, a variety of defects will be formed on the rail, which will jeopardize the safety of the railway, such as the deformed rail and broken sleeper [1]. These changes {{on the surface of the}} railway are caused by defects and can be directly seen by the worker’s eyes; therefore, the patrol inspection method by sight can be used for first detecting the defects of the railway. At present, the track surface defect detection mainly relies on manual inspection, but this method is labor-intensive, has lower efficiency, and influences results easily; it cannot meet the needs of daily inspection of the modern railway, especially the China High-speed Railway (CRH). As the daily inspecting time of CRH is always scheduled quickly and at night to avoid disrupting the regular operation of the train, there is not enough light and the workers tire easily so that it is hard to get a creditable inspection result from workers’ eyes. Therefore, it is urgent to find faster and more efficient automatic detection equipment to carry out the real-time detection of the track in the operation line [2 – 4]. The research mainly aims at the common rail surface defects, such as cracks, peeling, scratches, folds, broken rails, scars, and other forms [5].|$|E
40|$|Rail joints have {{a shorter}} service life {{than most other}} railway track components. The {{discontinuity}} between rail ends turns the rail joint into a weak spot, and consequently, into a track component demanding more frequent maintenance measures, which result in high maintenance costs. Moreover, difficulties are often found when assessing the damage condition of rail joints since damage conditions like cracks in the rail web or loose bolts cannot be detected by visual inspection. A {{better understanding of the}} damage mechanisms and degradation process of rail joints may help to develop adapted maintenance measures and to improve rail joint design. In this paper, a 3 D Finite Element model is presented as base for rail joint study. The model represents accurately the main components (<b>rail,</b> <b>sleeper,</b> joint bars and wheel) and the interaction between them (contact). The model is validated between 150 and 800 Hz with measured axle box accelerations of resilient wheels. Higher frequencies may be reached with an improved model of the rubber. In the paper, the influence of the bolt tightness is studied. The results showed that contact force, specially its variation, is strongly affected by the bolt tightness; loose bolts cause higher contact forces. The effect of vehicle speed on wheel/rail contact is also significant mainly due to the interaction between rail and sleepers {{in the vicinity of the}} rail joint.

40|$|Large and {{frequent}} cyclic train loading from heavy haul and passenger trains {{often leads to}} progressive track deterioration. The excessive deformation and degradation of ballast and unacceptable differential settlement of track and/or pumping of underlying soft subgrade soils necessitate frequent and costly track maintenance. A proper understanding of load transfer mechanisms and subsequent deformations in track layers is the key element for safe and economical track design and optimum maintenance procedures. Many simplifi ed analytical and empirical design methods {{have been used to}} estimate the settlement and stress-transfer between the track layers. However, these design methods are based on the linear elastic approach, and often only give crude estimates. Given the complexities of the behaviour of the composite track system consisting of <b>rail,</b> <b>sleeper,</b> ballast, sub-ballast and subgrade subject to repeated traffi c loads in a real track environment, the current track design techniques are overly simplifi ed. The track design should also account for the deterioration of ballast due to breakage and subsequent implications on the track deformations. Considering this, an elasto-plastic constitutive model of a composite multi-layer track system is proposed. Constitutive models and material parameters adopted in this numerical model are discussed. A hardening soil model with a non-associative fl ow rule is introduced to accurately simulate the strain-hardening behaviour of ballast. The breakage of ballast observed in large scale triaxial tests is also simulated based on this model. In conjunction, numerical simulations are also performed using a two-dimensional plane-strain fi nite element analysis (PLAXIS) capturing the effects of ballast breakage and track confi ning pressure. The paper also demonstrates the advantages of the proposed elasto-plastic fi nite element simulations when compared to conventional analytical methods used by practitioners that are primarily based on a linear elastic approach...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} laboratory {{experimental results}} of strength, deformation and particle breakage of fresh and recycled ballast under monotonic and cyclic loadings, experimental evaluation of effectiveness of various geosynthetics in stabilising recycled ballast, {{and a new}} stress-strain constitutive model for ballast incorporating particle breakage. Ballast degrades progressively under heavy cyclic rail loadings, leading to deterioration of track substructure, rail alignment and train safety. Severely fouled ballast is often removed from the track and replaced by freshly quarried ballast, causing track maintenance very costly. Discarded ballast can be cleaned, sieved and recycled to track foundation. In this study, the shear strength and stiffness of both fresh and recycled ballast were investigated {{in a series of}} consolidated drained shearing tests using a large-scale triaxial apparatus. The degree of particle breakage was quantified by sieving the ballast specimens before and after each test and recording the changes in ballast gradation. The stress-strain, shear strength, stiffness and particle breakage results of recycled ballast were compared with fresh ballast. The crushing strength characteristics of fresh and recycled ballast grains were investigated in a series of single grain crushing tests on various particle sizes. A small track section comprising <b>rail,</b> <b>sleeper,</b> ballast, capping and subgrade was simulated in a large prismoidal triaxial apparatus in the laboratory. The settlement, lateral deformation and particle breakage behaviour of fresh and recycled ballast under field-simulated loading and boundary conditions were studied in a series of cyclic loading tests using the prismoidal triaxial rig. Three types of geosynthetics (geogrid, woven-geotextile and geocomposite) were used in this study to stabilise recycled ballast. The cyclic test results of recycled ballast stabilised with geosynthetics were compared with the fresh and recycled ballast without geosynthetics. In order to study the effect of saturation, the cyclic tests were conducted in both dry and wet conditions. Currently, {{there is a lack of}} appropriate stress-strain constitutive models for coarse aggregates like ballast, especially under cyclic loading incorporating particle breakage. The new constitutive model developed in this study incorporates the energy consumption due to particle breakage during shearing. A single non-linear function has been formulated to model particle breakage, and incorporated in the plastic flow rule assuming non-associated flow. The model has been developed based on the critical state framework and the concept of bounding surface plasticity. It captures the strainhardening, post-peak strain-softening, dilatancy and cyclic hardening features of ballast behaviour accurately. The model has been examined and verified against the experimental results. Finite element analyses using ABAQUS were also conducted to compare with the analytical model. This study clearly shows that the new constitutive model predicts the stress-strain, volume change and particle breakage of ballast to an acceptable accuracy for both monotonic and cyclic loadings...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three main parts: The first part that uses classic track models {{as a basis for}} further developments, the second part that deals with constitutive behaviour of granular materials and the third part that describes {{the development of a new}} triaxial cell apparatus and the testing of a ballast material using this apparatus. The description of classic track models is focused on the beam-on-elastic-foundation model (abbr. BOEF model), which make use of the Winkler foundation, and a simple beam element model with linear discrete support. The shortcomings of the BOEF model is discussed: It assumes a continuous foundation, a continuously welded track, the weight of the track ladder is not incorporated, linear support which imply prediction of tension in the uplift regions, no shear deformation in the rails is taken into account, it cannot predict stresses and strains within the granular layers. While some of the shortcomings may easily be incorporated others are not: Especially to remove tension in the uplift zones, and to calculate stresses and strains in the granular layers. The latter actually requires a continuum approach. A track model that approximately eliminates the tension in the uplift regions has been developed for a single axle load. As expected, the model shows that the length of the uplift zone and the amount of uplift have higher values than predicted by the BOEF model. The model may be useful when considering contact problems in the track, for instance in a buckling-of-rails analysis. For the BOEF model a tool that makes use of dimensionless sensitivity diagrams has been developed. The method will in an easy way provide the new maximum track reactions when one or more track parameters are changed. It is hoped that this tool will prove very helpful in a design process, at least as a first step. Dimensionless sensitivity diagrams have been worked out for rail deflection, rail moment, rail seat load, tensional rail base stress and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast. The parameters considered are the design wheel load, rail moment of inertia, position of neutral axis in the <b>rail,</b> <b>sleeper</b> spacing, sleeper width and the length of the sleeper that carries the vertical load. The dimensionless sensitivity diagrams for the BOEF model may be used both for a single axle load and for a double axle load. Also for a beam element model with linear discrete support the dimensionless sensitivity diagrams may be used, but only for a single axle load which is located directly above one of the supports, i. e. a sleeper. For the beam element model the diagrams for the rail deflection, rail seat load and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast are almost identical to the ones for the BOEF model, while the diagrams for the rail moment and tensile rail base stress are somewhat different. A beam element model with Euler-Bernoulli beam elements resting on nonlinear discrete supports was developed for a single axle load. The discrete supports, which were located at the sleeper positions, were modelled by a two-parameter power function. The model takes advantage of a measured load-deflection relationship, which is also modelled by a two-parameter power function. These latter parameters are generally found by regression of the measured data, while the two parameters for the discrete supports are found as part of the overall solution to the problem. The present version of the model only takes into account a short track section and further development of the model is therefore needed. The track ladder weight and a no tension option in the uplift region are not incorporated in the present version. The model is useful when the BOEF model cannot be used because of nonlinear track response. Regarding constitutive behaviour it is argued that the plastic strain per load cycle in a well functioning railway track must be very small and normally below 1 / 100 000 of the elastic strain per load cycle. If also the hysteresis of the material during a load cycle is small, then an elastic approximation could be justified when it comes to calculating the stresses. The plastic strains may then be detached from the stress-strain calculation and modelled separately on the basis of laboratory or field measurements. Several elastic constitutive models are described: The Hooke's law generalised to three dimensions, the cross anisotropic elastic model, two versions of the k-model, and two hyperelastic models. The general elasto-plastic framework with isotropic hardening is also described. The basics of repeated loading of a frictional system is described by analogy to a simple model with springs and frictional sliders. This model can be viewed as the basis for the pure kinematic multisurface model by Mróz and Iwan. Through energy considerations in cyclic loading of the frictional system the concept of reclaimed plastic strain is rejected. The concept of initial stresses and strains is discussed. It is argued that initial stresses cannot be large in the upper part of a road or railway embankment. The main reason for this is that granular materials cannot self equilibrate stresses through tension. The development and construction of triaxial equipment for testing railway ballast in its original grading is described. The specimens are 300 mm by 600 mm (diameter by height). A new and direct way of applying the confining load was developed, which allowed faster variation of the confining stress. A new instrumentation concept was invented where instrumentation rings are fastened to material particles instead of being attached to the outer membrane or to plugs embedded in the material. This arrangement measures the horizontal deformation. The vertical deformation has to be measured over the whole specimen length as resilient particle rotations prevented on-sample instrumentation. A test series on Vassfjell railway ballast was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the new apparatus and to characterise the ballast material. The overall performance of the apparatus was found to be good with a reliable repeatability, but some modifications were suggested to improve the loading procedure in the beginning of the load steps. The test series on Vassfjell ballast was rather limited and no advanced modelling of the results was found to be appropriate. Instead an isotropic linear elastic approach was followed. Moisture was added, to the natural retention capacity, to some of the specimens. It was found that the added moisture only slightly affected the mechanical behaviour of the material. A somewhat denser grading was also tested, but the observed effect on the material properties was limited. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The last one ran on 20 December 1980. BR closed the line and quickly removed the <b>rails,</b> <b>sleepers</b> and ballast, making it harder for preservationists to restore the line.|$|R

The <b>rails,</b> <b>sleepers</b> and fastenings again came mostly from South Africa {{where they had}} been first used on the lifted Umzinto-Donnybrook line. The entire four-mile (6 km) tracklaying was completed in under six months.|$|R
