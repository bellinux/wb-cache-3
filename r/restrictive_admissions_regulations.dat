40|$|Background Opiate {{substitution}} treatment (OST) {{is the most}} widely used treatment for opioid dependence in Germany with substantial long-term benefits for the patient and for society. Due to lessened <b>restrictive</b> <b>admission</b> criteria, the number of registered OST patients in Germany has increased continuously in the recent years, whereas the number of physicians providing OST has remained constant. Previous data already indicated a deteriorating situation in the availability or quality of OST delivered and that structural barriers impede physicians in actively providing OST. The present survey among a sample of primary care physicians in Germany aimed to identify and assess potential structural barriers for the provision of health care in the context of OST. Methods An anonymous written questionnaire was sent out to a sample of 2, 332 physicians across Germany providing OST. Physicians contacted were identified through databases of the Federal State Chambers of Physicians and/or of the Federal Associations of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians. Data obtained were analysed descriptively. Results The response rate was 25, 5 % and the majority of 596 physicians sampled viewed substantial problems in terms of the regulatory framework of OST care in the German context. Furthermore, financial remuneration, insufficient qualification, as well as inadequate interdisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of comorbidities of opiate substituted patients were regarded as problematic. The number of physicians providing OST in Germany is expected to substantially decrease in the near future. Conclusion Despite less <b>restrictive</b> <b>admission</b> criteria for OST in Germany, the legal regulation framework for OST is still a limiting factor through raising concerns on the provider and consumer side to be unable to adhere to the strict rules. To avoid future shortages in the provision of OST care on the system level in Germany, revisions to the legal framework seem to be necessary. In regards to adequate care for drug use-related infectious diseases and psychiatric comorbidities commonly found in opiate substituted patients, efforts are required to improve professional qualifications of physicians providing OST as well as respective interdisciplinary collaboration...|$|R

40|$|Legal {{and medical}} experts have noted {{continued}} {{racism in the}} health care system that prevents the equal distribution of quality care. Initially most racism was intentional and expressed through de jure segregation, as evidenced by federal funding of the construction of racial segregated health care facilities. Now most racism, expressed through de facto segregation, is subtly incorporated into the daily practices of institutions causing an adverse disparate impact on African-Americans. This institutional racism establishes separate and independent barriers through the neutral denial of opportunities and equal rights to individuals and groups that results from the normal operations of the institutions in a society. For example, elderly African-Americans are disproportionately placed in substandard nursing homes. The reason for this placement is because most high-quality nursing homes accept a high proportion of private pay patients. These facilities limit the admissions of Medicaid patients, which are customarily elderly African-American patients. The limiting of Medicaid patients is a 2 ̆ 7 separate and independent barrier 2 ̆ 7 that prevents African-Americans from equal access to quality nursing homes. This 2 ̆ 7 neutral 2 ̆ 7 denial of admissions of elderly African-Americans to quality nursing homes based on the normal operations is institutional racism.

30|$|Hence, {{during the}} nineteenth century a {{particular}} institutional and normative order was established to regulate the route to universities, independently from vocational education. That is the main reason that institutions for vocational training have been under pressure to justify establishing a connecting point to higher education without the detour via evening grammar schools (or similar institutions), even up to the present day. This heritage of strict separation strongly shaped the development of access to higher education in the twentieth century, resulting in a very low degree of permeability between vocational training and higher education. Not until the 1970 s was access to higher education opened up a little bit for applicants without an Abitur by the introduction of a second sector beside the universities, the Fachhochschulen, with its own access route via special vocational schools (e.g. the Fachoberschulen). This type of non-university institution—approximately one third of all students are enrolled in this sector—focuses on more vocationally oriented courses in engineering, business administration, social work and other applied sciences. In contrast, university courses and programs are rather discipline- and research-oriented, even in those cases when they refer to a particular profession (e.g. training of lawyers, doctors or teachers). For that reason the separation between vocational training and academic learning is not as strict in the non-university sector {{as it is in the}} university sector, and this is reflected in the <b>admission</b> <b>regulations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: A {{summary of}} main aspects from a Health Technology Assessment report on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in Switzerland {{concerning}} effectiveness and safety is given. Materials and Methods: Literature search was performed through 13 databases, by scanning reference lists of articles and by contacting experts. Assessed were quality of documentation, {{internal and external}} validity. Results: Effectiveness: 43 articles concerning 'gastrointestinal tract and liver' were assessed. The studies covering 7, 436 patients were undertaken in China (35), Japan (3), USA (2) and Australia (3); 33 / 43 being controlled studies. 34 / 40 show significantly better results in the TCM-treated group. A comparison of studies on results of treatment based on a diagnosis according to TCM criteria and studies on results of treatment according to Western diagnosis shows that treatment based on TCM diagnosis improves the result. The comparison of treatment by individual medication and standard medication showed a trend in favor of individual medication. Safety: TCM training and practice for physicians in Switzerland are officially regulated. Side effects occur, but no severe effects have been registered up to now in Switzerland. TCM medicinals are imported; <b>admission</b> <b>regulations</b> are being installed. Problems due to production abroad, Internet trade, self-medication or admixtures are possible. Conclusion: The evaluation of the literature search provides evidence for a basic clinical effectiveness of TCM therapy. Severe side effects were not observed in Switzerland.

40|$|This Article {{offers a}} {{critique}} of, and alternative to, the American Bar Association 2 ̆ 7 s efforts, {{supported by the}} United States government, to promote the requirement of a college education in law as prerequisite for becoming a lawyer in developing countries. Using the examples of China, which currently has a far more open system for becoming a legal services provider, and South Africa, which already has a system consistent {{with the goals of}} the ABA, the Article argues that more stringent education requirements actually undermine democracy, human rights, and rule of law. In China, where the most significant advocates for human rights under law are peasant lawyers without college degrees, the requirement would directly harm human rights efforts. Moreover, the requirement would dramatically decrease the number of legal services providers in a country with few college graduates, thereby minimizing access to justice and public education on rule of law, while increasing authoritarian government control of the legal profession. In South Africa, the existing requirement of a college degree in law extends the harmful legacy of apartheid in the legal system, delaying the entry of non-whites into a legal profession that is overwhelmingly white, in addition to promoting continuing inequality in a system where the college attendance rates of non-whites are still below the rate for whites. Accordingly, the requirement impedes the realization of democracy and equal justice in the South African legal system, while preventing lawyers from serving the important function of educating the public on human rights and rule of law. As an alternative, the Article suggests the model that the United States employed prior to the 1930 s,when entrance into the legal profession was relatively open. As a result of less <b>restrictive</b> <b>admissions</b> standards, lawyers {{played a key role in}} promoting equal rights and justice for, and democratic values among, nineteenth and early twentieth century white Americans - most prominently, communities of immigrants from authoritarian nations, while at the same time laying the foundation for efforts to secure formal legal rights for Women and People of Color. Drawing from these examples, the Article proposes that reform advocates abandon efforts to replicate the modern American model in favor of more inclusive education standards no greater than necessary to ensure a threshold level of competence in legal representation. This approach would instill a greater sense of empowerment throughout the legal system and a stronger sense of respect for the law among all members of society...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{and compares}} current labour migration management of non-EU workers in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. It aims to explain cross-national {{similarities and differences}} from an interpretive policy analysis perspective. The research entails analyses of 33 legal documents and in-depth interviews with 25 high-ranking policy-makers and is anchored in case contexts. In order to gain comparative explanations the analysis maps legal classifications and rights regimes governing incoming migrant workers, explores meanings policy-makers vest in these, and thereby reconstructs the economic, social and political normative references these meanings entail in comparative perspective. By conceptualising migration policy as border-drawing I challenge the main stream migration policy literature, offering an alternative approach which changes the parameters of policy analysis more generally. While most migration policy research concentrates on explaining the control gap between <b>restrictive</b> <b>admission</b> policies and de facto migratory flows, I shift the analytical focus towards states’ power to define legal and illegal positions through policy and allocate rights in a differential way. Empirically, I overcome partial policy accounts by contributing a multidimensional analysis of labour migration policy across its economic, social, and politico-formal dimension, and develop an innovative methodology to explain crossnational variation in the interaction of these aspects. By associating each dimension with a specific borderdrawing site – capitalist coordination system, welfare state regime, and citizenship model – the thesis utilises regime theories to develop benchmarks for the empirical analysis {{while at the same}} time testing the explanatory scope of these theories in the field of labour migration. Migrant workers are selected by skill level and labour scarcity in all three cases in line with widely shared economic values surrounding labour migration agendas. Yet, the analysis also pinpoints considerable divergences when selecting migrants by origin, social cohesion concerns or with annual caps. The variable labour geographies into which migrant workers are admitted – mainly relating to post-colonial relationships, distinct uses of EU free movement, and demographic context – are seized by policy actors to selectively contextualise economic border-drawing. It is this distinct socio-political contextualisation of a shared cultural political economy of labour migration which explains similarities and differences in European labour migration management. The thesis hence contributes an empirically detailed understanding of an integrating EU common market which coexists with persistently diverging labour geographies and societies. Findings bear considerable policy implications in terms of European integration and the unequal distribution of labour mobility rights for migrants in Europe.

40|$|The general problem I am {{addressing}} {{concerns the}} role of the university as an actor for increased equality and democracy. How does this role manifest itself in selecting and recruiting students to the university and how does it influence teaching? The aim of my empirical study is to describe and understand processes and contexts where ethnicity and class are important. The empirical material consists of interviews with students and teachers from the department of law at Uppsala University. To analyze the consequence of ethnical and social diversity I have chosen theories which are founded in a feminist, emancipating and democratic pedagogy with a focus on connected teaching. Connected teaching is the opposite of “banking education”. In banking education the teacher deposits knowledge in the students. To analyse if the student can contribute with different perspectives on perception of knowledge and modes of learning I have studied the acting space and degrees of freedom given the students. My investigation shows that the students thirst for being supplied with the right track to become jurists, and the teachers support this. Social and ethnical background is made invisible, {{at the same time as}} it can become an obstacle. Not every student has a voice in the seminar and most of them have not learnt to extend their space for action, but rather have a desire to be taught or just supplied with knowledge. To strengthen the connection between teaching and the intentions in higher education the students should be encouraged, and the barriers against raising one’s own critical voice must disappear. Furthermore, acting space for participation is needed to influence a democratic educational process. The governments’ means to counter uneven recruitment has mainly consisted in increasing the number of educational seats. With the current <b>admission</b> <b>regulations</b> (autumn 2008) higher education will continue to reflect class society on a structural level.

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of the international community}} currently seems to alternate progressive impulses towards greater protection of human rights and sudden fallout in the traditional concept of territorial sovereignty. In a stage characterized by an increasingly <b>restrictive</b> <b>admission</b> of foreign nationals within the borders of the State and collective expulsions, what is the scope of the secular institution of asylum? Whether, on the one hand, the right of asylum is one of the state powers to freely adjust the entry and stay of aliens on its territory, considered as a corollary of territorial sovereignty, from the viewpoint of the individual it would constitute a means of further guarantee for fundamental rights. From this dilemma between state interest and human rights the present study will move to trace a possible balance between the protection of national security and the protection of human rights in one of the regions most affected by international migrations, like the euro-Mediterranean region. For these reasons, the hypothesis in this dissertation is the existence of a right of individuals to be granted asylum under International Human Rights and Refugee Law. The premise for this research is necessarily the assertion that individuals may be, even though only in part, subjects of International Law, as right holders vis-a-vis States. In conclusion, it is noted that attempts to claim a fundamental right to asylum, where have not engendered ad hoc set of laws, standing in provisions “still confused and often rudimentary”, they have contributed to conceive the right to asylum as a human right of subsidiary nature, likely to complete other inalienable rights, such as the right to life and physical integrity. The research is divided into 2 parts, including 2 chapters respectively. The first chapter develops the traditional theoretical framework under which the work is conducted. It examines the {{evolution of}} asylum through traditional international law and the study comes to identify, in the gradual emergence of a humanitarian nature of asylum, the symptoms of a change in the approach to such legal institution. The second chapter further elaborates on the possible evolution of asylum as a human right, assessing the course of non-refoulement and the jurisprudential contribution of the human rights treaty-monitoring bodies to the acceptance of a right to de facto asylum. The third chapter examines the legal developments in the field of asylum in the European Union, and how this special 'supra-national' legal order relates to the rights of refugees under International Refugee and Human Rights Law. The fourth chapter examines the legal conception of asylum in some other international organizations and legal systems of the Mediterranean and highlights the risks for an effective asylum-seeker protection, hidden in some bilateral readmission agreements...|$|R
