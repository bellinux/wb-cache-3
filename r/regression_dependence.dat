40|$|The {{necessary}} {{level of}} material’s hardness {{is determined by}} the exploitation conditions and presence of technological operations during manufacturing of articles. Mechanical edge cutting machining of wear resistant materials is impeded because of their high hardness. It is recommended to apply annealing in order to decrease hardness and improve machinability. The purpose of the work consisted in obtaining of <b>regression</b> <b>dependences</b> of cast iron’s macrohardness on its chemical content after annealing at 730 °С. With the use of mathematical experimental design the <b>regression</b> <b>dependences</b> of cast iron’s macrohardness and structural components’ microhardness on С, Cr, Mn, Ni content have been established. The minimal hardness of 27, 6 HRC after annealing at 730 °С is obtained in the cast iron containing: 3, 9 % С; 11, 4 % Cr; 0, 6 % Mn; 0, 2 % Ni. The maximal hardness of 70, 4 HRC is obtained when the content is as follows: 1, 1 % С; 25, 6 % Cr; 5, 4 % Mn; 3, 0 % Ni. Annealing at 730 °С decreases the cast irons’ hardness containing the minimal amount of Cr, Mn and Ni. Annealing at 730 °С is recommended for cast irons alloyed by Mn and Ni for increasing of hardness. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} builds {{upon and}} explores an enigmatic set of experiences which theorists in the Object Relations tradition have characterised as <b>regression</b> to <b>dependence,</b> {{a return to}} a primitive, pre-verbal relational process presenting in some clients in psychotherapy. This research is a study of the concept of <b>regression</b> to <b>dependence,</b> its manifestation within the psychotherapy process, and facilitation within the therapeutic relationship. The Psychoanalytic theoretical positions on <b>regression</b> to <b>dependence</b> are explored, together with the Relational/Developmental perspective which recognises regression and its importance within psychotherapy. This exploration seeks to understand the experience of <b>regression</b> to <b>dependence,</b> how <b>regression</b> to <b>dependence</b> can be effectively worked within Integrative Psychotherapy, and makes recommendations for Integrative practitioners and theorists related to effective facilitation of clients, showing how the Relational/Developmental approach can effect repair. The study employs a qualitative methodology. A heuristic study was undertaken in which eleven practicing psychotherapists were interviewed and data was collected via semi-structured interviews. Most participants were interviewed twice, with a view to collecting data on both their personal experience as a client in psychotherapy and also their experiences as practitioners when working with clients who were experiencing <b>regression</b> to <b>dependence.</b> The transcripts from these interviews were analysed for emergent themes. The themes are discussed in the context of and with reference to the Psychoanalytic theoretical position and the Relational/Developmental perspective. An account is offered of how these experiences have come to be understood as recollecting difficulties in early infantile relationships. Reflections are made on the essence and qualities of a therapy that can facilitate <b>regression</b> to <b>dependence</b> in order to promote healing. Recommendations are made for the practice of Integrative Psychotherapy and the training of Integrative Psychotherapists in order to prepare them for this work. These recommendations for therapists include; having sufficient preparation, knowledge and understanding to be able to recognise and work with a regressive process emerging in the client; having an understanding of the need to facilitate this process for some clients; and {{to be aware of the}} need for particular adaptations in the therapeutic stance in some circumstances, and the difficulties which may arise. Recommendations are also offered regarding the support needed for the therapist whilst working with this process, which include the need for ongoing personal therapy, and supervision. The researcher’s personal story is an intrinsic part of the research, and as an integral part of this study is in accordance with the heuristic and autoethnographic styles, and with the practice of Integrative Psychotherapy, where the use of self is seen as a crucial clinical tool in the therapeutic process.

Finally, let r and s denote the reversed hazard rates of Rn and Sn, respectively.

As a further consequence of this fact, X(n) is seen to be more stochastically increasing in X(1) than Y(n) is in Y(1). In other words, the pair (X(1),X(n)) is more dependent than the pair (Y(1),Y(n)) in the monotone <b>regression</b> <b>dependence</b> ordering.
