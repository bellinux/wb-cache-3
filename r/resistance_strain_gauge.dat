30|$|Since the {{equipment}} {{used to measure}} longitudinal force in rails according to the strain method is simple and suitable for long-term monitoring, many researchers have adopted this method to detect and study the longitudinal force in CWRs on bridges [18, 19]. There are mainly two kinds of sensors for detecting longitudinal force in CWRs, <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> and fiber Bragg grating sensors. The <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> are widely used as traditional testing devices. For instance, Feng et al. [20, 21] used <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> in a long-term monitoring of CWR sections from Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail line on the bridges over Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. LB Foster Salient Systems, a company in the U.S., applied the strain method to design a monitoring system [22, 23] for rail thermal expansion and longitudinal force. However, limited by CWRs’ locking, crawling and temperature action mechanisms, and monitoring timeliness, unidirectional strain measurements cannot well monitor the rail temperature force in long-term operation conditions.|$|R

In each beam, electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> were bonded to the reinforcing steel at various locations {{along the length of}} the beam and were bonded to the top concrete surface at midspan of the beams. The deflection at midspan was measured using two LVDTs at each side of the beam. During testing, load was monotonically applied at a stroke-controlled rate of 1.0  mm/min and the formation of the cracks on the sides of the beams were also marked and recorded.

40|$|Abstract: Fiber Bragg grating and <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> {{have been}} used to test the stress change in key parts of {{structure}} of 61 t- 55 m quayside container crane under the same testing conditions. The testing data and stress-time history diagrams obtained by the <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> and fiber Bragg grating have been analyzed. The results verify good real-time property and high reliability of the structural health monitoring system based on fiber Bragg grating system. Quayside container crane is core equipment of harbor and fatigue load of its structure has great effect on service life of the whole crane, making it an important index to assess safe service life of the crane. However, test by <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> commonly used at present cannot satisfy long-term monitoring requirements, and can only assess service life by one test; hence its reliability cannot meet actual demands. Fiber Bragg grating is a fundamental fiber optic device recently developed (since end of last century) in the world and widely used in photo-electronic treatment (e. g. fiber optic sensing).

30|$|The copper {{electroplating}} {{method is}} used to measure cyclic stress that causes metal fatigue [1 – 3]. If copper foil adhered to a machine element is subjected to repeated loads, grain growth occurs in the copper foil. Since the grain growth density {{is controlled by the}} maximum shearing stress and the number of cycles, the maximum shearing stress can be measured based on the grain growth density in the prescribed number of cycles [4]. This method has the advantage of detecting stress in microscopic regions like the stress concentration region. Moreover, this method can be easily applied to rotating machines and machine elements in sealed casings, since it does not need an output line like an electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{technology}} of continuously welded rails (CWRs) {{is important in}} modern railway track structures. To measure rail stress, <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> are preferred due to their good stability, sensitivity, and resistance to external interference. Based on the bi-directional strain method, we present a new method for measuring longitudinal rail stress using <b>resistance</b> <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> and develop a monitoring device for rail stress to realize long-term and multi-point measurement. Also relevant experimental verification and analysis are conducted. Results indicate that under various constraints the rail stress–strain values can be calculated just with the measured total longitudinal strain and total vertical strain. Considering the measurement error caused by sectional feature of sensors, we put forward a correction equation applicable to different stress conditions. Although the temperature values of the four full-bridge stress gauges can offset each other, the measurement error caused by rail flexural strain can also be eliminated {{to a certain extent}} at the same time, the non-uniform distribution of rail cross section temperature and unbalanced flexural strain still affect the measurement error. The experimental results also show that the developed rail-stress-monitoring sensor is suitable for measuring rail stress with reliable working performance.|$|R
