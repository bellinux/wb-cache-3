50|$|A record head, on {{the other}} hand, has a gap {{typically}} six times larger {{than that of the}} <b>replay</b> <b>head,</b> this gives a larger flux to magnetise the tape. The ideal gap size in a cassette deck are; wide record head gap and narrow playback head. The larger gap does not affect frequency response because the 'image' is largely made by the trailing edge of the gap. A combined record/replay head has a compromise size gap typically three times that of a replay only head.|$|E
50|$|An {{erase head}} is {{constructed}} {{in a similar}} manner to a record or <b>replay</b> <b>head,</b> but has a much larger gap, or more frequently, two large gaps. The erase head is powered during recording from a high frequency source (usually the same oscillator that provides the AC bias). In some inexpensive cassette recorder designs, the erase head is a permanent magnet that is mechanically moved into contact with the moving tape only during recording. Permanent magnet erase heads are also sometimes used in machines that are equipped with DC bias.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} was developed at EMI/Abbey Road Studios {{in the late}} 1950s, by EMI engineer Gwynne Stock. It involved delaying the recorded (dry) signal, sending it into the studio's echo chamber using a tape machine. The dry signal (without delay) was also sent to the chamber via the tape machine's <b>replay</b> <b>head.</b> The resulting sound {{was picked up by}} two condenser microphones. These microphones then fed the wet signal back to the recording console. The amount of feedback could be controlled allowing multiple delays to be sent to the reverb chamber, which could lengthen the effect's decay time.|$|E
50|$|Record and <b>replay</b> <b>heads</b> are {{traditionally}} made of soft iron (the softness {{is an essential}} requisite for good record and replay characteristics). This material features extremely good electro-acoustical properties, but wears away fairly rapidly with a consequent deterioration of performance. Some higher end recorders featured heads made from ferrite, which features excellent electro-acoustical properties while being a very hard material which resists wear. Its two main disadvantages are that it is brittle and easily damaged, {{and that it has}} a much higher noise output due to the Barkhausen effect. In more recent years, more exotic materials have appeared, some involving ceramics, which offer the best of both of the traditional materials.|$|R

5000|$|Magnetic striped {{prints were}} {{expensive}} to produce; each print {{cost at least}} twice as much as a print with a standard optical soundtrack only. Furthermore, these striped prints wore out faster than optical prints and caused more problems in use, such as flakes of oxide clogging the <b>replay</b> <b>heads.</b> Due to these problems, and also because many cinemas never installed the necessary playback equipment, magnetic sound prints started to be made in small quantities for [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings only, with the main release using standard mono optical sound prints. As time went by roadshow screenings were increasingly made using 70 mm film, and the use of striped 35 mm prints declined further. Many CinemaScope films from the 1960s and 1970s were never released in stereo at all. Finally the introduction in 1976 of Dolby Stereo, which provided a similar performance to striped magnetic prints but more reliably and at a far lower cost, caused the 4-track magnetic system to become totally obsolete.|$|R
40|$|A {{castellated}} magnetoresistive {{structure has}} been fabricated and evaluated for its application as a multi-track tape <b>replay</b> <b>head.</b> It {{has a higher}} field sensitivity and is less susceptible {{to the effect of}} demagnetizing fields at its edges than a conventional 'straight' element magnetoresistor. The inherently noisy magnetoresitive response attributed to its multi-domain structure has been found to reduce substantially as its film thickness is decreased below 250 Å. The unshielded castellated structure is simple to fabricate and offers an integral tape flux guiding system. Initial simple tape tests show that its replay performance compares favourably with the Philips DCC yoke-type MR <b>replay</b> <b>head.</b> A multi-track single turn thin-film inductive write head has been fabricated and tested. The head is built from a sandwich of two substrates each having an array of thin-film permalloy poles. The lower pole array is constructed with the patterned winding and gap layers, and the upper pole array with the front and rear permalloy yoke layers. The poles are optically aligned and the substrates glued together to complete the write structure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In a move {{to extend}} the storage {{capabilities}} of mag-netic storage systems beyond 1 Tb/in 2, the use of patterned media has often been cited. Here, recorded domains are constrained by the geometry of the magnetic island and not the geometry of the recording head. Conventional two-dimensional readout modeling techniques, using the reciprocity integral, rely {{on the assumption that}} the across-track medium magnetization is uniform under the giant magnetoresistive <b>replay</b> <b>head.</b> However, in the case of a geo-metrically constrained medium this is not the case. This paper in-vestigates the effect that the island geometry has on the characteris-tics of the replay signal in perpendicular patterned magnetic media storage through the extension of the reciprocity integral to three dimensions. The paper describes replay pulses that offer different characteristics from those obtained by conventional two-dimen-sional techniques. The origins of these differences are explained by the variation in medium magnetization across the track. Index Terms—Magnetic recording, patterned media, perpendic-ular magnetization, reciprocity.

40|$|As a {{contribution}} to increasing the areal density of digital data stored on a magnetic recording medium, this thesis provides mathematical analyses of various magnetic recording heads. Each of the heads considered here is {{for use in a}} perpendicular recording system, writing to or reading from a multi-layer medium which includes a high magnetic permeability layer between the data storage layer and the substrate. The exact two-dimensional analysis is performed in each case by one of two methods: either Fourier analysis or conformal mapping. The types of heads analysed include conventional styles but particular emphasis is placed on the effects of the novel idea of potential grading across the pole pieces. Exact head fields are derived for thin film heads with both constant and linearly varying pole potentials, single pole heads with linearly and arbitrarily varying pole potentials and shielded magnetoresistive heads, all {{in the presence of a}} magnetic underlayer. These and other published solutions are used to derive output characteristics for perpendicular <b>replay</b> <b>heads,</b> which are compared with published theoretical and experimental results where possible. The Fourier solutions obtained are in the form of infinite series dependent on at least one set of coefficients which are determined by infinite systems of linear equations. Approximations to the potentials in the head face planes, independent of these coefficients, are derived from the exact Fourier solutions. The accuracy of these approximations is demonstrated when they are used to estimate the vertical field components and the spectral response functions. Heads with graded pole potentials are found to have more localised vertical field components than the corresponding constant potential heads. They are also better suited for use with thin media for 'in contact' recording...|$|R
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 2548 on 27. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) Sensors have been fabricated, which {{are able to}} read the information stored on magnetic tape using the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect. These have major advantages over conventional <b>replay</b> <b>heads</b> in that they are multi-track devices, with very small trackwidths. To overcome the signal limitation imposed by the reduced trackwidth the sensor consists of two long magnetoresistive elements which are folded together. By differentially sensing the magnetoresistive signal in each of the elements second harmonic distortion can be removed. To improve the linearity of the magnetoresistive response, the sensors are arranged {{in such a way that}} the sensor signal current in each of the elements provides the field necessary to correctly bias the head. A theoretical evaluation of the bias field for all configurations of element has been performed, and was found to fit experimental data. Sixteen tracks are provided across the width of a compact cassette tape, and the design specifically allows the finished sensors to be packaged using standard components. Several performance related features have been considered, and various other fabrication aids included on the photomasks used to build the sensors. These photomasks are provided by the S. E. R. C. from an original computer program written in a graphics language, which defines the size and shape of the various elements making up the device. The heads are fabricated using photolithographic methods, from thin films of several materials all of which are R. F. sputtered. To improve the performance of the sensors, various electro-magnetic properties of the magnetoresistive layers have been measured using apparatus built especially for the purpose. These properties have been optimised by varying the bias potential used in the sputtering process. The finished heads have been tested, and have been found to compare well with the theory derived to describe their performance. Magnetic Components Limited, Bridge Wharf, Chertsey, Surrey.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During slow-wave sleep (SWS) {{and rapid}} eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep, hippocampal place cells in the rat show replay of sequences previously observed during waking. We tested the hypothesis from computational modeling that the temporal structure of REM sleep replay could arise from an interplay of place cells with head direction cells in the postsubiculum. Physiological single-unit recording was performed simultaneously from five or more head direction or place by head direction cells in the postsubiculum during running on a circular track allowing sampling of {{a full range of}} head directions, and during sleep periods before and after running on the circular track. Data analysis compared the spiking activity during individual REM periods with waking as in previous analysis procedures for REM sleep. We also used a new procedure comparing groups of similar runs during waking with REM sleep periods. There was no consistent evidence for a statistically significant correlation of the temporal structure of spiking during REM sleep with spiking during waking running periods. Thus, the spiking activity of head direction cells during REM sleep does not show <b>replay</b> of <b>head</b> direction cell activity occurring during a previous waking period of running on the task. In addition, we compared the spiking of postsubiculum neurons during hippocampal sharp wave ripple events. We show that head direction cells are not activated during sharp wave ripples, whereas neurons responsive to place in the postsubiculum show reliable spiking at ripple events.
