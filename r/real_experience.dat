25|$|In May 1974, a month {{into the}} band's first US tour opening for Mott the Hoople, Brian May {{collapsed}} and {{was diagnosed with}} hepatitis, forcing the cancellation of their remaining dates. While recuperating, May was initially absent when the band started work on their third album, but he returned midway through the recording process. Released in 1974, Sheer Heart Attack reached number two in the United Kingdom, sold well throughout Europe, and went gold in the United States. It gave the band their first <b>real</b> <b>experience</b> of international success, and was a hit {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. The album experimented with a variety of musical genres, including British music hall, heavy metal, ballads, ragtime, and Caribbean. At this point, Queen started to move away from the progressive tendencies of their first two releases into a more radio-friendly, song-orientated style. Sheer Heart Attack introduced new sound and melody patterns that would be refined on their next album, A Night at the Opera.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} {{consequence}} of unintended pregnancy, and compare these with <b>real</b> <b>experiences</b> amongst young married women in Nepal. Method: Sample survey of 997 married women and 19 in-depth case histories were studied. Results: The findings suggest that conflicts with spouses and family members, depression, worries or mental tension, loss of education and employment opportunities were the major anticipated socio-psychological consequences of unintended pregnancies. Reduced prenatal and postnatal care, unsafe abortions, postabortion complications, and maternal deaths were the major expected health outcomes of an unintended pregnancy. In general, the perceived opinions on socio-psychological consequences corroborated with <b>real</b> <b>experiences.</b> However, there are some differences between the perceived opinions and <b>real</b> <b>experiences.</b> Conclusions: Programmes that focus to identify couples at risk of unintended pregnancies, to address worries and mental tension, and enable them to make timely decisions and responsible choices are required...|$|R

25|$|However, the Meditator {{realizes that}} he is often {{convinced}} when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things—women and fish, {{in the case of}} a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from <b>real</b> <b>experience.</b> Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry.|$|E

Ahead of the tournament proper, he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006: [...] "I went to Germany as player with no reputation or <b>real</b> <b>experience</b> to speak of. Tactically, I have learned a lot and I'm in much better condition, both physically and psychologically. This is my World Cup, I think I can play a lead role and I want to show I'm a player that can do it in big games." [...] After losing to Ghana in the opening group match, Serbia went on to face Germany. Within two minutes of Miroslav Klose's first-half dismissal, Žigić headed a cross down to Milan Jovanović who scored what proved to be the only goal of the game; Lukas Podolski's second-half penalty was saved, and Antić dedicated the victory to the Serbian people. In a game of missed chances against Australia, Serbia lost 2–1 and finished bottom of the group.|$|E
500|$|Almost all {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that Chamorro could not win. She was depicted as rich with no <b>real</b> <b>experience.</b> There were rumors {{that she received}} millions from the United States via their embassy {{and that she was}} a US lackey; that she was too religious; and that her coalition was too disorganized, had no money, and was plagued by in-fighting. In reality, her humility and provincial roots worked for her; she had run a family, a business and been part of the original Junta; the Sandinistas blocked payment of funds to her from the US while simultaneously claiming she received them; and she had long been vocal about her displeasure of US involvement in Nicaragua. According to Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa; Humberto Belli, an editor of La Prensa and later Minister of Education; and other writers such as Edward Sheehan and Shirley Christian who have written about the country, Nicaragua {{is one of the most}} religious countries in Latin America. Chamorro's faith and support for free expression united those who had felt alienated by the Sandinistas. Her chief appeal though was that she promised peace to a country tired of war. Ortega spent large sums of money, and strutted around like a [...] "macho rooster", as if the election were already won; he even used a fighting rooster as the symbol of his campaign.|$|E
500|$|The {{blending}} {{of the fictional}} and real worlds {{at the end of}} the play represents the inability of individuals to distinguish between fictional and <b>real</b> <b>experience.</b> The final act of the play also serves as Fielding's defence of traditional hierarchical views of literature. He satirises new literary genres with low standards by using personified versions of them during the puppet show. In particular, Fielding mocks how contemporary audiences favoured Italian opera, a dramatic form that he regarded with contempt. Fielding considered it [...] "a foreign intruder that has weaned the public from their native entertainments". The character Signior Opera, the image of the favoured castrato singer within the puppet show, is a parody of the foreigners who performed as singers, along with the audiences that accepted them. Additionally, the character serves as a source of humour that targets 18th-century literary genres; after the character Nonsense chooses the castrato Signior Opera as her husband, Mrs Novel objects, declaring that she gave birth to his child. This act would be physically impossible because Opera is a castrato, and it pokes fun at how the genres and the public treated such individuals. Fielding was not alone in using the castrato image for humour and satire; William Hogarth connects the castrato singer with politics and social problems, and many other contemporary works mock women who favour eunuchs.|$|E
