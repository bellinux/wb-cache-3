5000|$|<b>Retrolistheses</b> {{are caused}} by injury and {{resulting}} instability of the connecting soft tissues especially ligaments, discs, muscles, tendons and fascia. They may also involve muscles through spasm {{as a result of}} nerve malfunction due to pressure caused by the posterior displacement of the vertebra encroaching on the contents of the IVF. The IVF's contents include spinal (sensory and motor) nerves, arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels which cater to the nutritional and waste removal needs of the spinal cord.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>retrolisthesis</b> is a {{posterior}} {{displacement of}} one vertebral body {{with respect to}} the subjacent vertebra to a degree less than a luxation (dislocation).

Retrolistheses are most easily diagnosed on lateral x-ray views of the spine. Views, where care has been taken to expose for a true lateral view without any rotation, offer the best diagnostic quality.|$|E

5000|$|Spondylolisthesis [...] is {{the forward}} or {{anterior}} displacement of one vertebra over another, and commonly involving the fifth lumbar vertebra.

50|$|The bony {{components}} that {{may relate to}} the potential for joint instability can be measured by use of x-rays. Plain film lateral x-rays {{can be used to}} evaluate for translations anteriorly (anterolisthesis) or posteriorly (<b>retrolisthesis).</b> Where plain films indicate the likelihood of these translations being significant, flexion-extension views can be utilized to determine the dynamic range of movement of joints. This allows for a more accurate view of any potential instability issues.|$|E
50|$|Associated {{radiological}} findings {{include a}} vacuum phenomenon (in the nucleus pulposis of the adjacent intervertebral disc), reduction of disc height with corresponding {{loss of the}} disc space, marginal sclerosis of the adjacent vertebral bodies, osteophyte formation and apophyseal joint instability. With a <b>retrolisthesis</b> {{there is always a}} less than ideal positioning of spinal segments. There is also always a reduced anterior to posterior dimension of the spinal canal compared to the way it is supposed to be. The greater the posterior displacement, the more significant it is for producing a dysfunctional spinal cord or even a cauda equina syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{vertebral}} {{body in a}} <b>retrolisthesis</b> moves in a posterior direction, the grading used for spondylolistheses is of little use. It is however useful to divide the anterior to posterior dimension of the intervertebral foramina (IVF) (4) into four equal units. A posterior displacement of up to ¼ of the IVF is graded as Grade 1, ¼ to ½ as Grade 2, ½ to ¾ as Grade 3, ¾ to total occlusion of the IVF as Grade 4. Alternatively, a measurement {{of the amount of}} displacement can also made by measuring the bone displacement in millimetres.|$|E

40|$|Background: Os odontoideum (OO) with C 1 - 2 anterolisthesis and <b>retrolisthesis</b> {{may cause}} cervicomedullary injury both from {{anterior}} and posterior aspects. We analyzed fourteen such patients for biomechanical issues, radiological features {{and management of}} OO with free-floating atlantal arch and review pertinent literature. Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients having nonsyndromic, reducible atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) with orthotopic OO were analyzed. During neck flexion, their C 1 anterior arch-os complex displaced anteriorly relative to remnant odontoid-C 2 body. The posteriorly directed hypoplastic remnant odontoid sliding below the atlas and forward translation of the C 1 posterior arch caused concomitant cervicomedullary compression. During neck extension, there was <b>retrolisthesis</b> of the "free-floating" C 1 arch-os complex into spinal canal. Spinal stenosis and lateral C 1 - 2 facet dislocation; Klippel-Feil anomaly; and posterior circulation infarcts were also present in one patient each, respectively. Posterior C 1 - 2 (n = 10) or occipitocervical fusion (n = 3) was performed in neutral position to stabilize atlantoaxial movements. Results: Follow-up (mean, 3. 9 years) assessment revealed improvement in spasticity and weakness in 13 patients. One patient had neurological deterioration following C 1 - 2 posterior sublaminar fusion, requiring its conversion to occipitocervical contoured rod fusion. One patient with posterior circulation stroke died prior to any operative intervention. Follow-up lateral view radiographs showed a bony union or a stable construct in these 13 patients. Conclusions: OO with free-floating atlantal arch may precipitate cord injury both during neck flexion and extension. This condition may be overlooked unless lateral radiographs of craniovertebral junction are undertaken in neck extension, along with the usual ones in neutral and flexed positions. Etiological factors include C 1 ring-OO unrestrained movements above the hypoplastic odontoid; upward pull on OO by alar and apical ligaments; lax C 1 - 2 facet joint ligaments; and congenital presence of horizontal facet joint surfaces that facilitates C 1 - 2 translation...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of the {{cervical}} spine using x-ray radiography is {{an important}} task when providing emergency room care to trauma patients suspected of a cervical spine injury. In routine clinical practice, a physician will inspect the alignment of the cervical spine vertebrae by mentally tracing three alignment curves along the anterior and posterior sides of the cervical vertebral bodies, {{as well as one}} along the spinolaminar junction. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to semi-automatically delineate the spinolaminar junction curve, given a single reference point and the corners of each vertebral body. From the reference point, our method extracts a region of interest, and performs template matching using normalized cross-correlation to find matching regions along the spinolaminar junction. Matching points are then fit to a third order spline, producing an interpolating curve.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare postmortem {{computed}} tomographic (CT) imaging findings from a case of hanging with the autopsy findings. The CT showed a good match with autopsy findings especially for bone, soft tissue, and spinal injuries. The CT images of the injuries of the neck obtained by CT scan clearly showed the ligature mark, the hemorrhagic suffusion in the soft tissue (thickening of derma) and in the muscles (sternocleidomastoid) of the neck. Furthermore, CT 3 -dimensional reconstruction showed brain edema, fracture of the left posterior horn of the hyoid bone, and a grade 1 <b>retrolisthesis</b> of C 5 on C 6. This last finding was not detected by autopsy because of the anterior approach that is frequently used in necropsy technique. Nevertheless, the CT virtual autopsy did not show vascular findings (like Amussat mark) because a barium mixture was not injected in the body. Copyright © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|E
40|$|In 1854 Kilian first {{described}} as spondylolisthesis the condition {{then known as}} luxation of the lumbo-sacral joint. The terms prespondylolisthesis, pseudospondylolisthesis, <b>retrolisthesis,</b> retrospondylolisthesis, spondyloptosis and spondylolysis have since been introduced {{and much of the}} argument surrounding the subject has been semantic. Confusion has also arisen from the belief that spondylolisthesis must have a single cause. Early writers found a defect in the pars interarticularis of affected vertebrae, whereas Neugebauer (1888) found the arch intact but elongated. The existence of a defect in the pars interarticularis slowly came to be accepted, and disagreement shifted to its cause, some authors believing it a congenital error of development while others held it to be a fracture. Meyerding (193 1, 1938) found evidence of defects of the pars interarticularis in many patients with low back pain and stated that spondylolisthesis was far commoner than had been thought, many cases passing without diagnosis. He also suggested that men were affected more often than women, the reverse of previous reports.

40|$|Cervical spondylotic {{myelopathy}} (CSM) is uncommon at the C 3 - 4 level. Fourteen {{patients with}} C 3 - 4 CSM were treated {{over a period}} of 3 years. The radiological factors contribut-ing to CSM at the C 3 - 4 level were studied. These factors included the assessment of static and dynamic canal diam-eters, <b>retrolisthesis,</b> posterior osteophytes and degenera-tive spinal segmental fusion on plain X-rays; and, the antero-posterior cord compression ratio (APCR) on magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI). The clinical status of the patients was assessed by the modified Japanese orthopedic association scale (mJOAS). The mean difference between the static and dynamic canal diameters was statistically significant at C 3 - 4 (p < 0. 01). The APCR obtained at different levels showed a significant compression at the C 3 - 4 level in comparison to the lower level. There was a correlation between the APCR and the preop mJOAS, r= 0. 6 (p< 0. 05). The mean mJOAS improved from 9. 35 to 14. 35 at follo-up.

40|$|Background: Anterior {{cervical}} corpectomy and fusion with instrumentation is {{a common}} procedure for the surgical treatment of cervical spinal cord and/or nerve root decompression or for deformity correction. However, various postoperative complications {{have been associated with}} such a surgical intervention. Postoperative spondylolisthesis after an anterior cervical corpectomy with instrumentation is a serious complication that has rarely been addressed in the literature, and may potentially be underreported. Case Description: A 44 -year-old woman with degenerative disk disease, loss of cervical lordosis, congenital cervical stenosis at C 5 -C 6, and a left-sided herniated disk at C 6 -C 7 underwent an anterior cervical corpectomy of C 6 with fusion and anterior plate stabilization of C 5 -C 7. Early postoperative evaluation noted complete resolution of the patient's symptoms. At 6 months after surgery, the patient complained of neck pain and intermittent headaches. Radiographic evaluation noted fusion of the corpectomy strut graft with <b>retrolisthesis</b> of C 5 on C 6 and early myelomalacia at C 5 -C 6. A cervical laminectomy with posterior instrumentation from C 5 to C 7 was performed and the patient's symptoms resolved. Conclusions: Postoperatively, a high index of suspicion should be present for the development of spondylolisthesis in patients undergoing an anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion procedure with or without instrumentation, particularly in individuals with persistent or new symptoms even after a "successful" operative procedure. The spine surgeon should address appropriate operative techniques and postoperative management to decrease the risk of spondylolisthesis after such a procedure. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background: To {{examine the}} {{survival}} function and prognostic factors of the adjacent segments {{based on a}} second operation after thoracolumbar spinal fusion. Methods: This retrospective study reviewed 3, 188 patients (3, 193 cases) who underwent a thoracolumbar spinal fusion at the author’s hospital. Survival analysis {{was performed on the}} event of a second operation due to adjacent segment degeneration. The prognostic factors, such as the cause of the disease, surgical procedure, age, gender and number of fusion segments, were examined. Sagittal alignment and the location of the adjacent segment were measured in the second operation cases, and their association with the types of degeneration was investigated. Results: One hundred seven patients, 112 cases (3. 5 %), underwent a second operation due to adjacent segment degeneration. The survival function was 97 % and 94 % at 5 and 10 years after surgery, respectively, showing a 0. 6 % linear reduction per year. The significant prognostic factors were old age, degenerative disease, multiple-level fusion and male. Among the second operation cases, the locations of the adjacent segments were the thoracolumbar junctional area and lumbosacral area in 11. 6 % and 88. 4 % of cases, respectively. Sagittal alignment was negative or neutral, positive and strongly positive in 47. 3 %, 38. 9 %, and 15. 7 %, respectively. Regarding the type of degeneration, spondylolisthesis or kyphosis, <b>retrolisthesis,</b> and neutral balance in the sagittal view was noted in 13. 4 %, 36. 6 %, and 50 % of cases, respectively.

40|$|Background: Posterior decompression, instrumentation, and posterolateral fusion are sur-gical {{procedures}} {{for the treatment of}} degenerative lumbar diseases. Solid fusion usually causes adjacent problems. This study investigated the clinical outcome and radiographic fate of the L 5 -S 1 segment in patients who under-went posterior instrumented surgery for degenerative lumbar diseases. Methods: From January 1999 to December 2000, 181 patients (average age 59. 4 years, range 45 - 79 years) underwent posterior decompression, posterior instrumen-tation, and posterolateral fusion for degenerative lumbar diseases (including degenerative spondylolisthesis and degenerative lumbar scoliosis) with spinal stenosis. Modified Brodsky’s criteria and the Oswestry disability index were used to evaluate patients before surgery and at the final follow-up. Degenerative changes in the L 5 -S 1 intervertebral disc were evaluated with the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) grading scale. Adjacent L 5 -S 1 segmental instability was defined as the appearance of <b>retrolisthesis,</b> anterolisthesis, or lateral listhesis in the static or dynamic radi-ographs at the final follow-up. Results: Only 1 of these 181 patients developed inferior adjacent instability, but there were no symptoms related to this instability. The mean pre-operative L 5 -S 1 disc degenerative score was 1. 73 ± 0. 66 and at the last follow-up, 1. 87 ± 0. 72 (p = 0. 006). There was no symptomatic disc degeneration necessitating further L 5 -S 1 fusion during follow-up. One hundred fifty-six patients (86 %) exhibited satisfactory results (good or excellent). The mean Oswestry score was 21. 8 ± 6. 0 preoperatively, which improved to 9. 6 ± 7. 4 at the last fol-low-up (p = 0. 001). Conclusions:The L 5 -S 1 disc degenerated more after posterolateral lumbar floating fusion.

40|$|Objective. To {{compile a}} {{database}} of disc height, vertebral height and sagittal plane displacement from lateral radiographic views of the lumbar spine, valid {{for male and female}} subjects in the age range 16 – 57 years. The protocols used to measure these parameters compensate for distortion in central projection, off-centre position, axial rotation and lateral tilt of the spine as well as for variation in radiographic magnification and stature. Study design. The study comprised designing and testing of measurement protocols, together with subsequent data collection from archive radiographs. Background. Attempts to quantify primary mechanical damage to lumbar vertebrae and discs have been limited due to imprecision when measuring disc height, vertebral height and sagittal plane displacement. Age-related, normative values for these parameters were not previously available. Consequently, important issues like the effectiveness of past and present guidelines for safe manual handling with respect to prevention of overload injuries could not be resolved and judgement on pathological alterations in the morphology of the individual lumbar spine could only be performed in a qualitative, subjective manner. Methods. Based on the analysis of vertebral contours in the lateral radiographic image of the lumbar spine, new protocols for measuring disc height, vertebral height and sagittal plane displacement were developed. The measured data are virtually independent of distortion, axial rotation and lateral tilt. Furthermore, description of height and displacement using dimensionless parameters guarantees independence of radiographic magnification and stature. Subjective influence in the measurement procedure was minimized by automatic computation of contour-landmarks and derived parameters. Measurement errors were assessed from sets of radiographs of spine specimens and serial flexion-extension radiographs; interobserver and intraobserver errors were assessed from repeated measurements of lateral views. For compilation of a database, measurements were performed of a set of 892 lateral views of the lumbar spine of male and female subjects between 16 and 57 years of age. Data from pathologically deformed vertebrae or discs, or from motion segments exhibiting spondylolisthesis or <b>retrolisthesis</b> were excluded by normal radiological inspection; data from spines showing normal, age-related degenerative changes were included. Results. The new protocols allow height and displacement of lumbar vertebrae as well as height of lumbar discs to be measured for all motion segments on a lateral view, rather than just those vertebrae or discs close to the central beam, to facilitate recognition of localized abnormalities. Since the results are independent of exposure geometry, retrospective investigations are feasible. The relative measurement error in vertebral height amounts to 2. 2...|$|E
40|$|Background: Global fusion is {{recommended}} in sub-axial cervical spine injuries with <b>retrolisthesis,</b> translation rotation injuries associated with end plate or tear drop fractures. We propose {{a modification of}} Stellerman′s algorithm which we have used where in patients are primarily treated via anterior decompression and fixation. Global fusion was done only in cases where post-decompression traction does not achieve reduction in cases with locked facets. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and thirty consecutive patients with sub-axial cervical spine injuries were studied in a prospective trial over a 7 year period. Seven cases with posterior compression alone were not subjected to our protocol. Of the other 223 cases, 191 cases who on radiological evaluation needed surgery were initially approached anteriorly. Decompression was effected through a corpectomy in 14 cases and a single or multiple level disc excisions were performed in the others. Cases with cervical listhesis (n= 36) where on table reduction could not be achieved following decompression were subjected to progressive skeletal traction for 48 h. Posterior facetectomy and global fixation was done for patients in whom reduction could not be achieved despite post-decompression traction (n= 11). Results: Of the 223 cases, 20 cases were managed conservatively, 12 cases expired pre-operatively, and the remaining 191 cases needed surgical intervention. Out of the 154 cases of distraction/rotation/translation injuries on table reduction could be achieved in 118 cases (76. 6 %). Thirty-six patients had locked facets (23 cases were bifacetal, 13 cases unifacetal) and of these 36 cases reduction could be achieved with post-anterior decompression traction in 25 patients (16. 2 %); however, only 11 cases (7. 1 %) - 8 bifacetal and 3 unifacetal dislocations-needed posterior facetectomy and global fusion. One hundred and forty-three patients were followed up for a minimum period of 6 months. One hundred and twenty-six patients showed evidence of complete fusion (88. 1 %) while the remaining 17 (11. 8) showed evidence of partial fusion. There were no signs of instability on clinical and radiological evaluation {{in any of the}} cases. Reduction of graft height was noted in 18 patients (12. 5 %). There were eight cases of immediate postoperative mortality and two cases of delayed mortality in our series of cases. Conclusion: We feel that on table decompression and reduction followed by anterior stabilization can be used as the initial surgical approach to manage most types of cervical injuries. In rotation/translational cases where reduction cannot be achieved, monitored cervical traction on the decompressed spine can safely achieve reduction and hence avoid the need for a posterior facetectomy in a large percentage of cases...|$|E
