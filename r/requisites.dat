Another text, the Ricordi dati da Gregorio XV al cardinale Lodovisio suo nipote ("Memoir addressed by Gregory XV to his Nephew Cardinal Lodovisio") offers advice for how to rise within the Curia.|$|E
5|$|Municipal {{elections}}, {{during which}} mayors are elected, take place every four years; they take place {{one year before}} presidential elections (since 2008) in the last Sunday of October. Candidates must comply a number of <b>requisites</b> in order {{to run for mayor}} of Pichilemu; those include: to have completed secondary education (Enseñanza Media), to be a citizen, literate, to have resided in the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region {{for at least two years}} before the election, and to have their military status regularized. The mayor is usually sworn in on the 6 December following the election. The next election for the mayor will be in 2016. Municipal elections originally elected three mayors, called primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde, and a number of regidores. For example, the results of the first elections in Pichilemu, for the term between 1894 and 1897, showed José María Caro Martínez, Pedro Nolasco de Mira, and Francisco Reyes elected as the first primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde of Pichilemu, respectively. The role of the primer alcalde equals that of the current mayor of Pichilemu. However, voting was not popular: only taxpayers and landowners could vote. According to the Decree #5655 of 4 December 1945, regidores were popularly elected, and they had the faculty to vote for the mayor that would rule for the local government three-year term. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état interrupted Washington Saldías Fuentealba's mayoral term, hence terminating possibilities of new elections. The military regime of Augusto Pinochet appointed seven mayors, who held the office in a period of nineteen years. Following the Chilean transition to democracy, the D'Hondt method of proportional representation was used in the municipal elections of 1992, 1996, and 2000: all candidates run in a single list, the most voted candidate becomes the mayor and other five/six become councilors, according to the aforementioned method. For the municipal elections beginning in 2004, candidates for mayor and councilor run in separate lists, and mayors are elected by simple majority of votes.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{intelligently}} {{bridge the}} gap between religious fundamentalists and the scientific community. The bridge is the existence of nine phenomena that suggest that the universe {{is more than just a}} random accident; that in actuality it was designed by a creator, God. The phenomena are consequences of the necessary preciseness and accuracy required of numerous fundamental constants, forces, and masses for the universe to support the evolution of intelligent life. The phenomena are: 1) Many ―requisite singularities " are required for the evolution of life. 2) Conditions in the universe act like ―poised pendulums ‖ and 3) like ―compelling attractors ‖ that ensure that the <b>requisite</b> singularities will occur. 4) Furthermore, conditions in the universe ensure that each <b>requisite</b> singularity will occur in an ―ample sample. ‖ 5) Each <b>requisite</b> singularity is an ―optimal solution ‖ to design considerations. 6) Thus the <b>requisite</b> singularity will be found by evolution with ―statistical certainty. ‖ 7) Once found, each <b>requisite</b> singularity results in ―narrowing options ‖ for future evolution. 8) This gives rise to an ―essential sequencing " of <b>requisite</b> singularities. Finally, 9) the above often results in an ―intricate simplicity " of <b>requisite</b> singularities...|$|R

40|$|A <b>requisite</b> {{decision}} {{model is}} defined as a model whose form and content are sufficient to solve a particular problem. The model is constructed through an interactive and consultative process between problem owners and specialists (decision analysts). The process of generating the model uses participants' sense of unease about current model results to further development of the model. Sensitivity analyses facilitate the emergence of new intuitions about the problem; when no new intuitions arise, the model is considered <b>requisite.</b> At all stages of development, the model represents the social reality of the shared understanding of the problem by the problem owners. The goal of creating a <b>requisite</b> model is to help construct a new reality, to create a future. Validating a <b>requisite</b> decision model is done with reference to a <b>requisite</b> validation model whose form will be recognizably multi-attributed and whose content may draw on a variety of disciplines both scientific and clinical. A <b>requisite</b> model {{is more likely to be}} adequate if problem owners contributing to its development represent a variety of views, if the adversarial process is used to advantage, and if the specialist can provide a neutral perspective and setting. The role of decision analysis is to provide a framework for the development of a coherent model and to provide structure to thinking. While <b>requisite</b> models may be applicable in other areas of social science, they certainly highlight the need for a psychology of what people can do...|$|R

All these were sustained by a great flowing river, one whose earliest name was spoken in a now lost tongue, and which was called the Rio Grande de Pampanga by the Spanish people later on. The Great Pampanga River nourished wild, fruit-bearing trees, served as home to an abundance of fish and made possible lush, teeming woodlands that sheltered animals. All these combined must have been paradise in whatever language for the land's earliest settlers, {{who were able to}} not only survive but thrive in the surrounding abundance, all within easy reach.|$|E

At his request he was transferred to St. Ladislas' Church, Cleveland, and was succeeded on September 16, 1894, by Father Sigmund Wozny, who had just then come to the diocese. During 1895 Wozny had the church property enclosed by a fence, and replaced the chairs with pews, besides making other necessary improvements. Like his immediate predecessor, he found an unruly element to deal with, which, with the comparatively large parish debt, about $17,000, discouraged him, and hence he asked to be relieved from his unpleasant pastoral charge. His wish was granted, and he left the diocese in February, 1896 and was at once succeeded by Father Francis X. Fremel, who set courageously to work to put men and things to rights. He too met with opposition at the start, but with prudence and firmness he soon succeeded in surmounting the difficulties that beset him. Under his direction, seconded by the generosity of the people, the interior of the church was ornamented quite neatly, and all the <b>requisites</b> for divine service procured. At the same time he did not lose sight of the funded debt, but strained every nerve to have it reduced.|$|E

25|$|Hoveyda's {{desire to}} attend a French {{university}} in 1938 made the young student jump the gun by entering the country of his dreams without completing specific high school prerequisites required for entry. Cited as being the main reason behind Hoveyda's organizational miscalculation was the possibility of military action by an ostensibly belligerent Nazi Germany. Any future occupation of the country would have hindered his chances of attending a French university. Stranded in France, Hoveyda decided to complete the required high school credits in London, England, a city that would come to depress the young man. Aside from completing his educational <b>requisites,</b> Hoveyda was able to sharpen his command of the English language. His ability to communicate in several languages, including Persian, French, English, Italian, German, and Arabic, helped him climb the political ladder later on in life. Hoveyda's return to France in 1939 would be short lived, nevertheless, due to a brewing diplomatic scuffle between the French government and Reza Shah Pahlavi. Having {{no choice but to}} leave France again, Hoveyda enrolled at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium, during the same year. His stay at the university would be markedly ephemeral because {{of the effects of the}} German Blitzkrieg which used Belgian territory as an entry route into France. After being displaced for a short time, Hoveyda was able to return to the Belgian university, obtaining a bachelor's degree in political science in 1941, under the ever-watchful eye of the occupying German administration.|$|E
