5|$|The Moravian {{cultural}} influence {{played a}} significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that <b>religion.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> opinion of Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czechâ€“Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the census}} data, almost 80 percent of Chinese Indonesians are Buddhist or Christian (Catholic and Protestant). Chinese Indonesians {{tend to be}} more Christian than other Chinese ethnic groups of Southeast Asia due to a complex of {{historical}} reasons. Throughout the 20th century Chinese religion and culture was forbidden and persecuted in Indonesia, forcing many Chinese to convert to Christianity. The first wave of conversions occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, and the number of ethnic Chinese Christians during this period quadrupled. The second wave followed after the government withdrew Confucianism's status as a recognized <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s. Suharto endorsed a systematic campaign of eradication of Confucianism. Jakarta is home to largest Chinese Christians, meanwhile Medan is home to the largest Buddhist Chinese in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Bengali, the {{official}} state language, {{is the dominant}} language in Kolkata. English is also used, particularly by the white-collar workforce.

5|$|Christianity {{had been}} the {{official}} imperial religion of the Roman Empire, and the first churches were built in England {{in the second half}} of the 4th century, overseen by a hierarchy of bishops and priests. Many existing pagan shrines were converted to Christian use and few pagan sites still operated by the 5th century. The collapse of the Roman system in the late 5th century, however, brought about the end of formal Christian <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east of England, and the new Germanic immigrants arrived with their own polytheistic gods, including Woden, Thunor and Tiw, still reflected in various English place names. Despite the resurgence of paganism in England, Christian communities still survived in more western areas such as Gloucestershire and Somerset.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{has been}} the largest <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region since the Early Middle Ages; its {{existence}} in Britain {{dates back to the}} late Roman era and the arrival of Celtic Christianity. The Holy Island of Lindisfarne played an essential role in the Christianisation of Northumbria, after Aidan from Connacht founded a monastery there as the first Bishop of Lindisfarne at the request of King Oswald. It is known for the creation of the Lindisfarne Gospels and remains a place of pilgrimage. Saint Cuthbert, a monk of Lindisfarne, was venerated from Nottinghamshire to Cumberland, and is today sometimes named the patron saint of Northern England. Paulinus, as part of the Gregorian mission, became the first Bishop of York. The Synod of Whitby saw Northumbria break from Celtic Christianity and return to the Roman Catholic church, as calculations of Easter and tonsure rules were brought into line with those of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Church {{growth in}} the Northeast was also {{accompanied}} by revivalism. While calmer and more reserved {{than those in the}} South, the revivals of the Second Great Awakening transformed <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northeast, and they were often led by Presbyterians and Congregationalists. The Plan of Union led to the spread of New England theology (also known as the New Divinity and New Haven theology), originally conceived by Congregationalists. The New England theology modified and softened traditional Calvinism, rejecting the doctrine of imputation of Adam's sin, adopting the governmental theory of atonement, and embracing a greater emphasis on free will. It was essentially an attempt to construct a Calvinism conducive to revivalism. While the Synod of Philadelphia condemned the New Divinity as heretical in 1816, the General Assembly disagreed, concluding that New England theology did not conflict with the Westminster Confession.|$|E
