Once cured, the optical transparent replica has a Young’s modulus of 650 MPa (according to manufacturer’s processing guidelines [micro <b>resist</b> <b>technology</b> GmbH]), and its surface can be modified with the same organic chemistry (PFOTS) as silicon to decrease its surface free energy. We demonstrate a successful approach to use OrmoStamp®; working stamps to reliably transfer print at the same time both micrometer- and nanometer-sized metal structures onto silicon target substrates. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of different process parameters on the achievable transfer yield.|$|E

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry has already entered the sub- 10 nm region, {{which has led}} to the development of cutting-edge fabrication tools. However, there are other factors that hinder the best outcome of these tools, such as the substrate and resist materials, pre- and postfabrication processes, etc. Among the lithography techniques, electron beam lithography (EBL) is the prime choice when a job requires dimensions lower than 10 – 20 nm, since it can easily achieve such critical dimensions in reasonable time and effort. When obtaining pattern features in single nanometer regime, the resist material properties play an important role in determining the size. With this agenda in mind, many resists have been developed over the years suitable for attaining required resolution in lesser EBL writing time.

However, a few {{problems associated with}} conventional leadrubber bearings have been identified after historical strong earthquakes, e. g., excessive permanent deformations of bearings and potential unseating of bridge decks. Recently the applications of shape memory alloys (SMA) have received growing interest {{in the area of}} seismic response mitigation. As a result, a variety of SMA-based base isolators have been developed. These novel isolators often lead to minimal permanent deformations due to the self-centering feature of SMA materials. However, a rational design approach is still missing {{because of the fact that}} conventional design method cannot be directly applied to these novel devices. In light of this limitation, a displacement-based design approach for highway bridges with SMA isolators is proposed in this paper. Nonlinear response spectra, derived from typical hysteretic models for SMA, are employed in the design procedure. SMA isolators and bridge piers are designed according to the prescribed performance objectives. A prototype reinforced concrete (RC) highway bridge is designed using the proposed design approach. Nonlinear dynamic analyses for different seismic intensity levels are carried out using a computer program called “OpenSees”. The efficacy of the displacement-based design approach is validated by numerical simulations. Results indicate that a properly designed RC highway bridge with novel SMA isolators may achieve minor damage and minimal residual deformations under frequent and rare earthquakes. Nonlinear static analysis is also carried out to investigate the failure mechanism and the self-centering ability of the designed highway bridge.

40|$|Dominant discourses on {{telecare}} technologies often {{celebrate the}} erasure of distance and place. This paper provides a critical intervention into these discourses by investigating how spaces still matter, despite {{the move from}} physical to virtual encounters between healthcare professionals and patients. I argue that science and technology studies (STS) research on telecare, {{as well as other}} technologies, can be enriched by including a focus on place to understand the dynamic interactions between people and things. Adopting insights of human geographers, I show how places in which technologies are used affect how technologies enable or constrain human actions and identities. Whereas some spaces may facilitate the incorporation of <b>technologies,</b> others may <b>resist</b> <b>technologies.</b> A focus on how places matter is important for understanding how telecare technologies reorder and redefine healthcare. Although other healthcare technologies are also important actors in transforming healthcare, telecare technologies do this in a very specific way: they redefine the spatial dimensions of healthcare. To capture and further explore this changing spatial configuration of healthcare, I introduce the notion of technogeography of care. This concept provides a useful heuristic to study how places matter in healthcare. Although telecare technologies introduce virtual encounters between healthcare providers and patients, the use of telecare devices still largely depends on locally grounded, situated care acts. Based on interviews with users of several cardiac telecare applications, including healthcare professionals and patients in Germany and the Netherlands, the paper shows how patients’ homes and public spaces are important for shaping the implementation and use of telecare technologies, and vice versa. Last, but not least, telecare devices are implicated as well.
