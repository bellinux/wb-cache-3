40|$|<b>Radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> are {{arising from}} nuclear {{applications}} such as nuclear medicine and nuclear power plants. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> should be managed in a safe manner to protect human beings and the environment {{now and in the}} future. The management strategy depends on collection, segregation, treatment, immobilization, and disposal. The treatment process is a very important step in which the hazardous materials were converted to a more concentrated, less volume and less movable materials. Electrochemistry is the branch of chemistry in which the passage of electric current was producing a chemical change. Electrochemical treatment of <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> is widely used all over the world. It has a number of advantages and hence benefits. Electrochemistry can lead to remote, automatic control and increasing safety. The present work is focusing on the role of electrochemistry in the treatment of <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> worldwide. It contains the fundamentals of electrochemistry, the brief story of <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes,</b> and the modern trends in the electrochemical treatment of <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes.</b> An overview of electrochemical decomposition of organic wastes, electrochemical reduction of nitrates, electro- precipitation, electro- ion exchange, and electrochemical remediation of soil are outlined.

5|$|Switzerland {{has five}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 43% of its electricity around 2007 (34% in 2015). Some Swiss {{spent nuclear fuel}} has been sent for reprocessing in France and the United Kingdom; most fuel is being stored without reprocessing. An industry-owned organization, ZWILAG, built and operates a central interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and high-level <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste,</b> and for conditioning low-level <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> and for incinerating wastes. Other interim storage facilities predating ZWILAG continue to operate in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided {{to select a}} site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2000, a Specified <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Waste</b> Final Disposal Act {{called for}} {{creation}} of a new organization to manage high level <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste,</b> and later that year the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO) was established {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. NUMO is responsible for selecting a permanent deep geological repository site, construction, operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040. Site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities, but by 2006, no local government had volunteered to host the facility. Kōchi Prefecture showed interest in 2007, but its mayor resigned due to local opposition. In December 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities.|$|E

5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E

30|$|Liquid <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> (LRWs) {{are known}} as {{by-products}} of nuclear activities around the world including; nuclear power plants (NPPs) developments and activities, applications of nuclear fission or nuclear technology, nuclear weapon testing, and other world threatening researches. The entrance and existence of these <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> into the environment always has recognized as a serious threat for human being and other alive creatures. Radioactive contamination is seriously hazardous and if it comes about to an area, it can cause a real disaster {{not only for the}} main area but also for the other parts around its district depending on the amount of leaked or released <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes.</b> Despite the other sorts of pollutants which can be removed or handled entirely in a certain period of time, the <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> cannot be handled in the same way. Because these <b>radioactive</b> <b>wastes</b> can spread widely in any possible way (air, soil, water, alive tissues) and large number of radioactive elements have years and years of half-life which means {{they are not going to}} be neutralized in easy way. Standing still and disintegration for years will go on till complete neutralization comes about. However, due to the wide spread of nuclear power plants and public raised concerns over nuclear safety, the new methods and regulations for monitoring and protection against these wastes are developing by researchers and governments.|$|R
5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> management.
