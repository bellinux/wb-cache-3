25|$|The affective {{reactivity}} model {{states that}} {{the strength of a}} person's reactions to affect-relevant events are caused by people's differences in affect. This model is based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory by Jeffrey Alan Gray, which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system (BAS) are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the personality trait of extraversion, while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to personality trait of neuroticism and introversion. Therefore, extraverts are seen as having a temperamental predisposition to positive affect since positive mood induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts, thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects. For example, Gable, Reis, and Elliot (2000). found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive BIS <b>reported</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> average negative affect, while people with more sensitive BAS <b>reported</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> positive affect. Also Zelenski and Larsen (1999) found that people with more sensitive BAS reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction, while people with more sensitive BIS reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction.|$|E

In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people. Other studies were unable to find harm. The United States National Research Council (NRC) surveyed Love Canal health studies in 1991. The NRC noted the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking water; the groundwater [...] "seeped into basements" [...] and then led to exposure through air and soil noted several studies <b>reported</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> low-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed residents with some evidence the effect subsided after the exposure was eliminated.

Voles in the area were found to have significantly increased mortality compared to controls (mean life expectancy in exposed animals [...] "23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days" [...] for control animals).

The research targeting this group of individuals, however, is sparse and tempered by significant limitations. The current study aimed to address methodological limitations in the current literature by including instruments to formally diagnosis ADHD and comorbid disorders, utilizing psychometrically sound instruments and comparing functioning of college students with ADHD across gender and subtype. It was hypothesized that participants with ADHD would <b>report</b> lower GPAs, <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> emotional distress and negative relationship characteristics than participants without ADHD.

40|$|The present thesis {{provides}} a theoretical overview, including a neurobiological perspective, of well-being (WB), eudaimonic well-being (EWB), optimism, pessimism {{and cultural differences}} between Western and Eastern societies.  In addition, an empirical study investigated these concepts in Japanese and Swedish participants. Definitional problems and scarce neurobiological findings are two current problems to date within research on WB, EWB and cultural differences especially when looking at comparisons between Europe and East Asia. Interpretations and conclusions are therefore hard and tentative to make as more research is yet needed. This thesis empirical part therefore investigated the association between these concepts. In {{the best of the}} authors knowledge have this type of explorative study never been done before. 142 Swedish participants and 68 Japanese participants between the ages of 20 to 40 answered the self-reporting questionnaires; revised life orientation test (LOT-R), psychological well-being scale (SPWB) and the minimalist well-being scale (MWBS). The findings demonstrate that Swedish people <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> optimism compared with Japanese people whom in turn <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pessimism when measured with LOT-R.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{relationship}} between employee telework and work attitudes, including job satisfaction, organizational commitment, perceived organizational support, and perceived co-worker support. A web-based questionnaire was distributed to employees at five organizations. Surveys were completed by 1, 350 employees. A positive relationship was predicted between telework and overall job satisfaction, as mediated by perceived autonomy. Further, moderating effects <b>of</b> job <b>level</b> were predicted for the above relationships. A negative relationship was predicted between telework and perceived co-worker support, moderated by task interdependence. It was also predicted that teleworkers would <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> affective commitment, and that this relationship would be mediated by perceived organizational support. Finally, {{it was predicted that}} teleworkers would <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> continuance and normative organizational commitment than non-teleworkers, and that the telework-normative commitment relationship would be moderated by employee exchange ideology. The predicted relationships received mixed support. Time spent teleworking was found to be related to overall job satisfaction, and this relationship was mediated by perceived autonomy. Employee job level had no moderating effects. Time spent teleworking was also found to be related to perceived co-worker support, although the direction of the relationship was opposite what was predicted and no moderating effect of task interdependence was found. Teleworkers did <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> perceived organizational support than non-teleworkers, as predicted, although teleworkers did not <b>report</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> affective commitment. Similarly, teleworkers did not differ from non-teleworkers on normative commitment, and exchange ideology did not moderate the relationship. Finally, teleworkers reported lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> continuance commitment than non-teleworkers, contrary to what was predicted.
