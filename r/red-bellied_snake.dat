50|$|Another {{possible}} negative {{outcome of}} introducing species {{as a control}} method for the brown tree snake population is predation on juvenile cane toads and <b>red-bellied</b> <b>snakes</b> by brown tree snakes themselves, because they are opportunistic and generalist feeders. This investigation determined that the environmental and ecological risk associated {{with the introduction of}} these predators was too high to implement. Lastly, <b>red-bellied</b> <b>snakes</b> could pose a threat to the health of humans. The cost of introduction of such predatory species outweighs the benefits and is not practical.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Red-bellied</b> <b>Snake</b> (Storeria occipitomaculata occipitomaculata) is {{very small}} brown or gray snake with faint stripes down its back. The belly is red, pink, or orange. Adult length is 8 to 16 inches. Red-bellied Snakes inhabit both fields and woods, but are most often found under boards and other objects {{at the edges of}} lumber piles or trash dumps. They feed on worms, slugs, and snails. In Wyoming, the sub-species S. o. pahasapae is found near water under flat rocks, logs, and other surface objects in moist {{woodland}} communities.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife is both {{diverse and}} plentiful. Black Hills creeks {{are known for}} their trout, while the forests and grasslands offer good habitat for American bison, white-tailed and mule deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, {{mountain}} lions, and a variety of smaller animals, like prairie dogs, American martens, American red squirrels, Northern flying squirrels, yellow-bellied marmots, and fox squirrels. Biologically, the Black Hills is a meeting and mixing place, with species common to regions to the east, west, north, and south. The Hills do, however, support some endemic taxa, the most famous of which is probably white-winged junco (Junco hyemalis aikeni). Some other endemics are Cooper's Rocky Mountain snail, Black Hills subspecies of <b>red-bellied</b> <b>snake,</b> and a Black Hills subspecies of southern red-backed vole. Some birds that are only in the Black Hills and not the rest of South Dakota are pinyon jay, gray jay, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, American dipper, ruffed grouse, and others.|$|E
50|$|H. striatula is a small, harmless, secretive, fairly slender snake, 7-10 inches (18-25 cm) {{in total}} length (including tail). It has a round pupil, weakly keeled dorsal scales, and usually a divided anal plate. Dorsally, it is brown, gray, or reddish, and {{essentially}} has no pattern. Females {{are a little}} longer and heavier than males, with relatively shorter tails. Young individuals often have a light band on the neck, which is normally lost as they mature. The belly is tan to whitish and is not sharply defined in color from the back, unlike in the wormsnake (Carphophis amoenus) or the <b>red-bellied</b> <b>snake</b> (Storeria occipitomaculata). Keeled scales differentiate the rough earth snake from the similar smooth earth snake (Virginia valeriae), {{as well as from}} the wormsnake. H. striatula is most likely to be confused with De Kay's brown snake (Storeria dekayi), which is a little larger and is light brown with dark markings on the back and neck. Unlike the rough earth snake, De Kay's brown snake retains these markings into adulthood. Also, S. dekayi has a rounder snout than H. striatula.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Red-bellied</b> <b>Snake</b> (Storeria occipitomaculata) {{primarily}} inhabits moist woodlands {{of eastern}} North America, with two disjunct populations {{occurring in the}} Great Plains, {{one of which is}} in south-central Nebraska. This species is listed as at-risk in Nebraska, in part, due to being uncommon with limited information available about the ecology and natural history of this isolated population. We amassed 48 observations of Red-bellied Snakes in Nebraska from museum specimens and published accounts, including our observations and others reported to us published herein. The previous earliest documented date of spring emergence was 6 April from a specimen collected in 1999. On 12 March 2016, we observed an adult <b>Red-bellied</b> <b>Snake</b> along the Platte River in Buffalo County, Nebraska, which predates the previous earliest documented emergence date by almost a month. It is unclear whether our observation represents an unusual behavior related to an unseasonably warm winter or a normal occurrence that has remained undocumented for this secretive, uncommon snake. Our summary of observations in Nebraska demonstrates Red-bellied Snakes are active March through October, with peaks in observations in April/May and September. This disjunct population occurs within the Big Bend Reach of the Platte River in south-central Nebraska, which is a major spring stopover site for migratory Sandhill Cranes (Antigone canadensis). Emergence in March by these snakes greatly increases predation risks by opportunistically foraging cranes. Additional ecological information is warranted for this disjunct population, as use of the Platte River flood plains by Sandhill Cranes has increased during the last half century, and removal of riparian forests has been a common habitat management practice for Sandhill Cranes and endangered Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) ...|$|E
50|$|Wildcat Mountain State Park has a {{woodland}} ecosystem. The Kickapoo River Valley and {{the park}} provide a habitat for many animals typically found in the woods of the Upper Midwest. Common birds include tundra swans, Canada geese, great blue herons, sandpipers, wild turkeys, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles and turkey vultures. Reptiles are {{also found in the}} park including, five-lined skinks, <b>red-bellied</b> <b>snakes</b> and eastern hog-nosed snakes.

5000|$|The <b>red-bellied</b> black <b>snake</b> is {{native to}} {{the east coast of}} Australia. It {{can be found in the}} urban forest, woodland, plains and bushland areas of the Blue Mountains, Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Cairns and Adelaide.|$|R
40|$|Envenoming by the Australian <b>red-bellied</b> black <b>snake</b> (Pseudechis porphyriacus) causes {{non-specific}} systemic symptoms, anticoagulant coagulopathy, myotoxicity {{and local}} effects. Current management for systemic envenoming includes administration of one vial of tiger snake antivenom within 6 h of the bite to prevent myotoxicity. We present {{a case of}} severe rhabdomyolysis in a 16 year old male which developed despite early administration of one vial of tiger snake antivenom. Free venom was detected after the administration of antivenom concurrent with rapidly decreasing antivenom concentrations. The case suggests that insufficient antivenom was administered {{and the use of}} larger doses of antivenom need to be explored for <b>red-bellied</b> black <b>snake</b> envenoming...|$|R

50|$|The {{arrival of}} cane toads has also exerted {{selection}} {{pressures on the}} feeding behaviour and toxin tolerance of <b>snakes.</b> <b>Red-bellied</b> black <b>snakes</b> from regions where cane toads are well-established, have developed increased resistance to toad toxins. Furthermore, the presence of cane toads has induced genetically based behavioural adaptations in this snake species. Individuals from toad-exposed regions show an innate disfavour for cane toad as prey. These adaptive responses {{are likely to have}} occurred in less than 23 black snake generations demonstrating the strong selection pressures cane toad.|$|R

50|$|The venom of <b>red-bellied</b> black <b>snake</b> {{consists}} of neurotoxins, mycotoxins, coagulants {{and also has}} haemolytic properties. Bites from <b>red-bellied</b> black <b>snake</b> are rarely life-threatening, but need of immediate medical attention. Symptoms of systemic envenomation—including nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea or diaphoresis—were thought to be rare, but a 2010 review found they occurred in most bite victims. Most people also go on to develop an anticoagulant coagulopathy in a few hours. This is characterised by a raised aPTT, and subsides over 24 hours. It resolves quickly with antivenom. A few people go on to develop a myotoxicity and associated generalised muscle pain and occasionally weakness, which may last for up to 7 days.|$|R
5000|$|C. amoenus can be {{distinguished}} from the western worm snake (Carphophis vermis), by its less vibrant dorsal and ventral coloration and lack of ventral pigmentation on the third body scale row. Other small, unpatterned brownish snakes which may be confused with C. amoenus, such as earth snakes (genus Virginia) and <b>red-bellied</b> <b>snakes</b> (Storeria occipitomaculata), have keeled dorsal scales and lack the spine-tipped tail. [...] The southeastern crowned snake (Tantilla coronata) has 15 midbody scale rows, a dark head, and a dark collar. the worm snake diet is mostly carnivorous feeding on in some areas strictly earthworms and in others opportunist eating slugs and other creatures that they can fit into their mouth.|$|R

5000|$|The genus Pseudechis {{contains}} {{the group of}} elapids {{commonly referred to as}} the black snakes. These snakes are found in every Australian state with the exception of Tasmania and some species are found in Papua New Guinea. They inhabit a variety of habitat types, from arid areas to swampland. All species are dangerous (Pseudechis signifying [...] "like a viper", Greek echis) and can inflict a potentially lethal bite. Most snakes in this genus reach about 2 metres and vary in colour. Some species are brown, where others are black. The most recognisable and widespread species in the genus are the <b>red-bellied</b> black <b>snake</b> (Pseudechis porphyriacus) and the Mulga snake (king brown) (Pseudechis australis). These snakes feed on lizards, frogs, birds, small mammals and even other snakes. All species lay eggs, except the <b>red-bellied</b> black <b>snake.</b> The genus Pailsus is a synonym of Pseudechis, and more work is needed to understand species limits among the smaller species of the group.|$|R
