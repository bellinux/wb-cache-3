5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>data</b> and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Windows Push Notification Service {{is similar to that}} of its predecessor, in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate, maintain, store, and authenticate unique identifiers (called Channel URI Identifiers) for all devices that register to use the service. When a device enrolls to <b>receive</b> <b>data</b> and notification information using the WNS, it first sends a device registration request to WNS network. The WNS network acknowledges the request, and responds with the device's unique Channel URI Identifier. Typically, the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications. When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device, it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network. The network will acknowledge and authenticate the request. If the authentication succeeds, the data to be transmitted is enqueued and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier.|$|E

30|$|For blind channel {{estimation}} methods, earlier works require either {{higher order}} statistics (HOS) of the <b>received</b> <b>data</b> [18] or over-sampling at the receiver [19]. By exploiting linear redundant precoding, only second-order statistics (SOS) of the <b>received</b> <b>data</b> is required and these methods are robust to channel order overestimation [20, 21]. Another popular blind algorithm {{is the so-called}} subspace-based algorithm which was originally developed in [19]. The subspace method has simple structure and achieves good performance. In [22], a blind channel identification method by exploiting virtual carriers (VC) is derived. In [23], a generalization in cyclic prefix (CP) systems is proposed. By arranging the <b>received</b> <b>data</b> appropriately, [23] generates a rank-deduction matrix, and thus, subspace method can work. In [24], the authors propose another simpler arrangement of the <b>received</b> <b>data.</b> Pan and Phoong [25] and [26] utilize the repetition method {{to reduce the number}} of required <b>received</b> <b>data</b> and consider the existence of VCs.|$|R

25|$|A triple-blind {{study is}} an {{extension}} of the double-blind design; the monitoring committee response variables is not told the identity of the groups. The committee is simply given data for groups A and B. A triple-blind study has the theoretical advantage of allowing the monitoring committee to evaluate the response variable results more objectively. This assumes that appraisal of efficacy and harm, as well as requests for special analyses, may be biased if group identity is known. However, in a trial where the monitoring committee has an ethical responsibility to ensure participant safety, such a design may be counterproductive since in this case monitoring is often guided by the constellation of trends and their directions. In addition, by the time many monitoring committees <b>receive</b> <b>data,</b> often any emergency situation has long passed.|$|E

25|$|The larval {{life history}} of E. junaluska {{is still not}} very well known. Studies have found the {{breeding}} season is spread from fall to early spring. The larval period reportedly lasts around two to three years, and metamorphosis occurs during the summer months. Eggs are laid in the streams and are attached under media such as large rocks. The depth of the eggs laid range from 6–20cm. The adult salamanders stay around where the eggs are laid to protect the egg clutch. Clutch sizes range from 30 to 50 eggs. The larvae are completely aquatic until they metamorphose into adults. The larvae can easily be distinguished as other Eurycea species, so {{it is important to}} distinguish them correctly. A successful method of discovering the larvae is by using leaf mats placed in the streams underneath or near rocks. This allowed surveyors to <b>receive</b> <b>data</b> on the egg clutches and adult salamanders.|$|E
