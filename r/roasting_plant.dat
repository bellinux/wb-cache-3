25|$|Viennese cafés have an {{extremely}} long and distinguished history {{that dates back}} centuries, and the caffeine addictions of some famous historical patrons of the oldest are something of a local legend. These coffee houses are unique to Vienna and many cities have unsuccessfully sought to copy them. Some people consider cafés as their extended living room where nobody will be bothered if they spend hours reading a newspaper while enjoying their coffee. Traditionally, the coffee comes {{with a glass of}} water. Viennese cafés claim to have invented the process of filtering coffee from booty captured after the second Turkish siege in 1683. Viennese cafés claim that when the invading Turks left Vienna, they abandoned hundreds of sacks of coffee beans. The Polish King John III Sobieski, the commander of the anti-Turkish coalition of Poles, Germans, and Austrians, gave Franz George Kolschitzky (Polish – Franciszek Jerzy Kulczycki) some of this coffee as a reward for providing information that allowed him to defeat the Turks. Kolschitzky then opened Vienna's first coffee shop. Julius Meinl set up a modern <b>roasting</b> <b>plant</b> in the same premises where the coffee sacks were found, in 1891.|$|E

2500|$|Starbucks' chief {{financial}} officer (CFO) appeared before the Public Accounts Committee in November 2012 and admitted that the Dutch government granted a special tax rate to their European headquarters, which the UK business pays royalties to. Dutch law permits companies to transfer royalties collected from other countries to tax havens without incurring taxes, unlike {{in the rest of}} the EU. The CFO denied that they chose the Netherlands as their European headquarters to avoid tax, explaining that the company's Dutch coffee <b>roasting</b> <b>plant</b> was the reason for the decision. Until 2009, the royalty rate was 6% of UK sales, but after being challenged by UK tax authorities it was reduced to 4.7%. The CFO told the committee this reflected costs such as designing new stores and products, but admitted that there was no detailed analysis by which the rate is decided. The coffee they serve in the UK is purchased from the Swiss subsidiary, which charges a 20% markup on the wholesale price and pays 12% corporation tax on profits. Coffee is not transported to Switzerland but the 30 people who work in the subsidiary assess coffee quality. Regarding Starbucks' frequent reports of loss in the UK, the CFO told the committee that Starbucks are [...] "not at all pleased" [...] about their financial performance in the UK. MPs replied that it [...] "just doesn't ring true" [...] that the business made a loss, pointing out that the head of the business had been promoted to a new post in the US and they consistently told shareholders that the business was profitable.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with regular}} coffee, the green coffee bean itself is first roasted {{to bring out}} flavour and aroma. Rotating {{cylinders}} containing the green beans and hot combustion gases are used in most <b>roasting</b> <b>plants.</b> When the bean temperature reaches [...] the roasting begins.

50|$|Roasting coffee using hot air is a {{commonly}} used method by most <b>roasting</b> <b>plants,</b> {{but it takes}} away the original flavor of the coffee. Doutor Coffee explored other ways to roast the coffee, but in a more effective way that retains the flavor in the coffee. Doutor Coffee utilizes the flame roasting approach which is laborious and time-extensive, but it allows richly flavored coffee beans. Since flame roasting is used more for small shops {{due to the fact}} that it can only roast 5 kg to 20 kg of beans at a time, Doutor Coffee is trying to create an industrialized flame roasting technique.|$|R

40|$|The coffee {{silverskin}} (CS) remains adherent to {{the green}} bean and is removed only during the roasting process, so easily found in the <b>roasting</b> <b>plants.</b> Currently it is used as fuel or fertilizer, but {{recent studies have shown}} the potential application in the food industry and food product formulation as functional ingredient, because of its low amount of fat and carbohydrates, high in dietary fiber and marked antioxidant activity. Aim of this study was the evaluation of the effects on the quality properties of bakery products added with coffee silverskin (CS). A model sponge cake formulation was used and products with 5 % of CS (% on the flour weight) or without CS (reference) were prepared. In order to increase the nutritional value, CS was subjected to a alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment. Chemical, physical and physico-chemical analyses (before and after the pre-treatment of the film) of CS were performed. Texture, image analysis and sensory tests of the CS-added and reference sponge cake were carried out. Results of the analyses evidenced that the addition of CS was an interesting ingredient. No main differences were determined on the chemical properties. Dynamometric measurements showed slight differences due to CS addition on texture while colour was mainly affected as the coffee silver skin led to a yellow-brown colour of the cake. Sensory properties resulted affected by the addition of the CS ingredient with differences in both appearance and perception of taste and smell but the overall acceptability of both products resulted high. This preliminary study confirm the high potential of this by-product of the coffee processing as food ingredient in bakery products by contributiung to improve its nutritional and health properties with a high soluble fiber and low caloric value...|$|R
6000|$|Accordingly, as the {{sun went}} down, the little party came to a halt, made a large fire, spitted their buffalo meat on wooden sticks, and, when {{sufficiently}} <b>roasted,</b> <b>planted</b> the savory viands before them; cutting off huge slices with their hunting knives, and supping with a hunter's appetite. The light of their fire would not fail, as they knew, {{to attract the attention}} of any Indian horde in the neighborhood; but they trusted to be off and away, before any prowlers could reach the place. While they were supping thus hastily, however, one of their party suddenly started up and shouted [...] "Indians!" [...] All were instantly on their feet, with their rifles in their hands; but could see no enemy. The man, however, declared that he had seen an Indian advancing, cautiously, along the trail which they had made in coming to the encampment; who, the moment he was perceived, had thrown himself on the ground, and disappeared. He urged Captain Bonneville instantly to decamp. The captain, however, took the matter more coolly. The single fact, that the Indian had endeavored to hide himself, convinced him that he was not one of a party, on the advance to make an attack. He was, probably, some scout, who had followed up their trail, until he came in sight of their fire. He would, in such case, return, and report what he had seen to his companions. These, supposing the white men had encamped for the night, would keep aloof until very late, when all should be asleep. They would, then, according to Indian tactics, make their stealthy approaches, and place themselves in ambush around, preparatory to their attack, at the usual hour of daylight.|$|R

Survey questions were specific to processes and interventions being applied, and the use and familiarity with Industry Best Practices documents for beef processing. Returned completed surveys. A total of 469 beef processing operations responded and of survey respondents, 119 establishments were called and asked additional questions. Critical Control Points (CCPs) and testing for E. coli O 157 :H 7 were common discussion point during phone calls. Plant visits were made to confirm the answers that were provided in the written survey. Plants that further processed beef were found to need to reassess their HACCP plan based on their response to the question, "Is E. coli O 157 :H 7 a reasonably likely to occur food safety hazard?" E. coli O 157 :H 7 is considered an adulterant in the products that they produced if they answered yes to this question.

40|$|Italian law {{concerning}} the remediation of polluted areas forces the responsible {{party of the}} contamination to provide the complete characterization of the site, the project and the operative tasks for cleaning up soils and waters. In this context, determining the origin of pollution is mandatory for a correct approach to the whole remediation process. Our research group has been studying for two years the problem of Arsenic pollution {{in the area of}} an industrial plant for the production of sulphuric acid (SA) from pyrite <b>roasting.</b> The <b>plant</b> is located in a former wetland, in Scarlino, southwest of Tuscany. Horizontal distribution shows an almost regular decrease in the As concentration going, far from the plant, but with the presence of "hot spots" ([As]> 600 ppm) at large distance. Other irregularities in the vertical distribution of As concentration in the clay-rich soil, were found. Several evidences identified the SA plant wastes as largely responsible for the high Arsenic levels of the soil, but other theories were suggested. One of the prominent explanations concerned the natural Arsenic anomaly of the area; this was proposed to explain the wide distribution of the element and its irregular trend. This hypothesis was supported {{by the fact that the}} site under study is relatively close (about 15 km south-west) to the "Colline Metallifere" mine field, from which pyrite and blended sulfides were extracted. In fact, As enriched sediments could be transported from the river and stream beds which originate in that area. In order to verify the basis of these theories and the mechanism of As diffusion in the environment, we started an extensive sampling of the stream sediments of several rivers which originate in the mining field area. Comparing all the data for Arsenic and other elements we were able to demonstrate that: i) the natural Arsenic levels were significantly lower than the values recorded in the site under study; ii) other wetlands with similar geo-mineralogical origin as the former Scarlino wetland did not present Arsenic and other metal anomalies; iii) all the high Arsenic values found in the stream sediments of the stream beds studied and in the soil were correlated with the presence of ancient mining sites or iron smelter. The results obtained are in favour of an anthropogenic source of the high Arsenic level in the site under study...|$|R
