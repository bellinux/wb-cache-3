5|$|This is {{repeated}} until (2:32), when the drumbeat gradually fades out, {{leaving only the}} ride cymbal keeping the beat, and the guitars, which <b>repeat</b> <b>a</b> melody based around the chord of A major, using harmonics. At (3:11), the bass guitar joins in, followed by the drum kit, building to a gradual crescendo, eventually climaxing at (3:42) into a distortion-laden chord progression, using the chords F♯ minor, D major, and A major. At (3:46), a guitar solo is played over these chords. This continues until (5:09), after all instruments have faded out except for the tremolo-laden feedback of the guitar.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 {{they could}} not <b>repeat</b> <b>a</b> {{play-off}} performance, they did finish fifth and maintain an unbeaten record at Carisbrook for the second season in a row. In 2002 the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was introduced to be contested with the Blues, and the Highlanders won the trophy with a 2013 win at Eden Park. They did this {{on their way to}} finishing fourth, before again losing to the Crusaders in their semi-final. In 2003 they lost their first match at Carisbrook since the 1999 Super 12 final when the Crusaders defeated them 1716. Coach Laurie Mains resigned {{at the end of that}} season after a dispute with some of the senior players, including Anton Oliver. In 2004, their first season with coach Greg Cooper, they finished ninth despite scoring more tries then in 2003. This was mainly due to their defence as they conceded 12 more tries then in 2003. Despite winning six consecutive games in 2005, they eventually finished eighth due to losing their last three matches.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to <b>repeat</b> <b>a</b> previous motor behavior.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the polymorphic tetranucleotide repeat (TTTA) n {{located in the}} fourth intron of the CYP 19 gene in two Brazilian populations. The frequencies of the five common alleles (A) in Euro- and Afro-Brazilians were, respectively: seven <b>repeats</b> (<b>A</b> 5), 0. 586 and 0. 80; eight <b>repeats</b> (<b>A</b> 4), 0. 092 and 0. 06; nine <b>repeats</b> (<b>A</b> 3), 0. 014 and 0. 01; eleven <b>repeats</b> (<b>A</b> 2), 0. 284 and 0. 09; twelve <b>repeats</b> (<b>A</b> 1), 0. 021 and 0. 04. In addition, one Euro-Brazilian individual had a rare allele with 13 repeats. The allelic frequencies in Euro- and Afro-Brazilians differed statistically (p < 10 - 3). The two samples {{were found to be}} in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0, 828 and p = 0, 995) ...|$|R
5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to <b>repeat</b> <b>a</b> programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|When {{a patient}} {{unexpectedly}} dies in his care, Oliver breaks down. He confesses to Penny that he cheated {{in medical school}} by swapping one of their exam papers, so he passed on her merit while {{she was forced to}} <b>repeat</b> <b>a</b> year. Furious, Penny tells Oliver that he must confess to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry). He writes a letter of resignation, but deletes it after a positive day working alongside Frieda, who encourages him to repeat his F2 year. After giving Oliver a final chance to confess, Penny is called away to the site of a train crash. Oliver is left alone on AAU, where he successfully performs a difficult procedure. Hopeful that Penny will forgive him, Oliver is devastated to learn that she has been killed in an accident at the crash site. Unable to cope in the aftermath of her death, Oliver turns to drugs and alcohol. He sends Hanssen a letter of resignation, which includes a full confession. His father Tony (Simon Shepherd) offers him money to choose a new career, and claims that Oliver always had more potential than Penny. This angers Oliver, who endangers his own life to save a patient and feels reinvigorated. Hanssen is impressed by Oliver's patient treatment, and overlooks his cheating to allow him a fresh start.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} causes for this disorder. One such possibility is an underlying personality disorder. Individuals with FD {{may be trying}} to <b>repeat</b> <b>a</b> satisfying childhood relationship with a doctor. Perhaps also an individual has a desire to deceive or test authority figures. The underlying desire to resume the role of a patient and be cared for can also be considered an underlying personality disorder. Abuse, neglect, or abandonment during childhood are also probable causes.|$|E
30|$|The {{advantage}} {{of this approach is}} that after the second occurrence, each repeated advertisement will be added into the <b>Repeated</b> <b>Ad</b> Database and its recurrence will be quickly detected by the detection process. Every time a repetition of ads is found, we can shorten the length of the Buffer window that remains to be searched by the discovery process. As long as the <b>Repeated</b> <b>Ad</b> Database is smaller than the buffer, our approach improves search speed. In addition, the <b>Repeated</b> <b>Ad</b> Database of found ads can be sorted by the frequency of repetition, so that most common ads are checked first.|$|R

25|$|Most {{common is}} STRs (short tandem <b>repeat).</b> <b>A</b> certain section of DNA is {{examined}} for {{a pattern that}} repeats (e.g. ATCG).
