5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant impact have produced <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original Earth mass. Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E

40|$|A {{paradox is}} called a {{statement}} which is true and false in the same time. Therefore, if we suppose <b>that</b> statement <b>is</b> true, it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false; and reciprocally, if we suppose <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false, it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true. 2. But there <b>are</b> statements <b>that</b> do not completely obey this definition. We call a Semi-Paradox a statement such that either supposing <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false (but not reciprocally), or supposing <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true (but not reciprocally). So, the statement has a degree of 0. 50 (50 %) of a paradox, and 0. 50 of a non-paradox. 3. Three-Quarters Paradox. 3. 1. Definition. There are cases when a statement can be between a paradox and a semi-paradox. For example: a) If we suppose <b>that</b> the statement <b>is</b> true, it <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> false, but reciprocally if we suppose <b>that</b> the statement <b>is</b> false, it may <b>be</b> possible <b>resulting</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true. Therefore, the second implication (conditional) does not always occur...|$|R

25|$|Controversy over {{significance}} testing, and {{its effects}} on publication bias in particular, has produced several results. The American Psychological Association has strengthened its statistical reporting requirements after review, medical journal publishers have recognized the obligation to publish some <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not statistically significant to combat publication bias and a journal (Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis) has been created to publish such results exclusively. Textbooks have added some cautions and increased coverage of the tools necessary to estimate the size of the sample required to produce significant results. Major organizations have not abandoned use of significance tests although some have discussed doing so.|$|E
25|$|According to polls, most {{computer}} {{scientists believe that}} P≠NP. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems {{no one has been}} able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3000 important known NP-complete problems (see List of NP-complete problems). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P = NP would imply many other startling <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> currently believed to be false, such as NP = co-NP and P = PH.|$|E

25|$|Scientist have {{discovered}} {{it is possible}} to determine, to some extent, the presence of these compounds in the grape before harvest. One way is to measured with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers. Another method is through analysis of the glycosyl-glucose assay. Through this method glycosides from the grape juice are isolated and then hydrolysized to yield glucose. The amount of glucose produced is then quantified and tabulated in <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> expressed as amount of glycosides in micromoles per liter or per grape berry. The relationship between the presence of glycosides in wine grapes and the potential for quality in the resulting wine is not exact science but this remains an area of continuing research and development.|$|E
25|$|Some {{changes made}} to Internet search engines {{included}} that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google {{began to run}} a new system where the Google search became personalized. The item that is searched and the <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual. Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to feel like the search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using online advertising. A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests relevancy that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of location. Search engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.|$|E
25|$|The variable-opt {{method is}} related to, and a {{generalization}} of the k-opt method. Whereas the k-opt methods remove a fixed number (k) of edges {{from the original}} tour, the variable-opt methods do not fix {{the size of the}} edge set to remove. Instead they grow the set as the search process continues. The best known method in this family is the Lin–Kernighan method (mentioned above as a misnomer for 2-opt). Shen Lin and Brian Kernighan first published their method in 1972, and it was the most reliable heuristic for solving travelling salesman problems for nearly two decades. More advanced variable-opt methods were developed at Bell Labs in the late 1980s by David Johnson and his research team. These methods (sometimes called Lin–Kernighan–Johnson) build on the Lin–Kernighan method, adding ideas from tabu search and evolutionary computing. The basic Lin–Kernighan technique gives <b>results</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> guaranteed to be at least 3-opt. The Lin–Kernighan–Johnson methods compute a Lin–Kernighan tour, and then perturb the tour by what {{has been described as a}} mutation that removes at least four edges and reconnecting the tour in a different way, then V-opting the new tour. The mutation is often enough to move the tour from the local minimum identified by Lin–Kernighan. V-opt methods are widely considered the most powerful heuristics for the problem, and are able to address special cases, such as the Hamilton Cycle Problem and other non-metric TSPs that other heuristics fail on. For many years Lin–Kernighan–Johnson had identified optimal solutions for all TSPs where an optimal solution was known and had identified the best known solutions for all other TSPs on which the method had been tried.|$|E
