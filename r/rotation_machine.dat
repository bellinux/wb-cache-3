40|$|The {{behavioural}} diagnostics of bearings play {{an essential}} role in the management of several <b>rotation</b> <b>machine</b> systems. However, current diagnostic methods do not deliver satisfactory results with respect to failures in variable speed rotational phenomena. In this paper, we consider the Shannon entropy as an important fault signature pattern. To compute the entropy, we propose combining stationary wavelet transform and singular value decomposition. The resulting feature extraction method, that we call stationary wavelet singular entropy (SWSE), aims to improve the accuracy of the diagnostics of bearing failure by finding a small number of high-quality fault signature patterns. The features extracted by the SWSE are then passed on to a kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) classifier. The proposed SWSE-KELM algorithm is evaluated using two bearing vibration signal databases obtained from Case Western Reserve University. We compare our SWSE feature extraction method to other well-known methods in the literature such as stationary wavelet packet singular entropy (SWPSE) and decimated wavelet packet singular entropy (DWPSE). The experimental results show that the SWSE-KELM consistently outperforms both the SWPSE-KELM and DWPSE-KELM methods.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{extrusion}} of aluminium is under development, {{which has been}} termed Screw Extrusion of ALuminium (SEAL). In this process, a screw {{is used as a}} pressuregenerating device, which is a fundamentally different principle than that of a conventional forward extrusion process. The starting point of this work was a technology whose status was at the proof-of-concept level that was only capable of producing simple profiles of substandard quality. The overall goal of the SEAL project was therefore to prepare the technology for later industrialization and commercialization, thus putting strict requests on the cost, quality and robustness. The aim of this work has been to create a fundamental knowledge of the process of screw extrusion of aluminium, more specifically, to determine how aluminium behaves under the wide range of thermo-mechanical conditions encountered in the screw extruder. Understanding the fundamental principles of frictional conditions, material flow and the extrusion pressure-generating mechanism was deemed as the most important for achieving this aim. This thesis presents a compression and rotation (CR) machine capable of reproducing the thermo-mechanical conditions in the screw extruder in a more controllable environment. By using a novel contrast material technique, the thermo-mechanical limit curve for sticking friction between an aluminium alloy AA 6060 and a tool steel was found and the material flow within the samples visualized. The use of contrast material was also employed in fullscale experiments using the screw extruder to evaluate the material flow and frictional conditions, and displacement rates were successfully detected for different regions of the extruder, revealing the main material flow paths and the dead metal zones. Furthermore, the use of various contrast material feed schemes led {{to an understanding of the}} interaction between newly fed and pre-exiting material inside the extruder. An explanatory model for the extrusion pressure-generating mechanism was created based on measurements of the extrusion velocity and observations made of the material behaviour. The study has created new knowledge of the most important fundamental phenomena ongoing in screw extrusion of aluminium. New techniques using contrast material have been presented, and their use has been demonstrated on the compression and <b>rotation</b> <b>machine,</b> as well as the screw extruder. The results obtained herein will be useful in the future design of components and process strategies, basing engineering decisions on knowledge rather than trial-and-error.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityTrochoidal-type machines belong to the category of planetary <b>rotation</b> <b>machines</b> and include pumps, blowers, compressors and engines. In general a trochoidal-type machine is simpler, quieter, lighter and smaller than a comparable reciprocating machine. This thesis focuses on two major aspects of trochoidal-type machines with conjugate envelopes: (i) the geometry and the characteristics {{of different types of}} trochoids and different types of conjugate envelopes; and (ii) methods to determine the contact forces and the contact stresses between the rotor and the chamber. The two types of trochoid are the peritrochoid and the hypotrochoid. For each type of trochoid, there are nine types of conjugate envelope. Conjugate envelopes provide, in general, the best geometry for sealing, high compression ratio and low contact forces and stresses. However, to date only two out of the nine types of conjugate envelope have been studied in any detail. General parametric equations of a conjugate envelope, in continuous form, are not available in the literature. In this thesis, unified and compact equations for the geometry and the geometric properties of trochoids are obtained. An additional type of conjugate envelope is discovered for each trochoid. Closed-form parametric equations for all nine types of conjugate envelopes, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for having a closed type 1 conjugate envelope are derived. A computer-aided design program, incorporating the equations, is developed. The characteristics and relationships of different types of trochoid and conjugate envelope are presented. Reducing the contact stresses in the trochoidal-type machine is very important because the machine can not be adjusted for wear. The main difficulty in calculating the contact forces and stresses is to determine the forces that are transmitted through each contact point. Since there are many contact points, the problem may be considered quasi-statically indeterminate. No satisfactory method of analyzing the contact forces and stresses in a trochoidal-type machine has been developed to date. Two methods to determine contact forces are developed in this thesis. One method is based on a versatile finite element model under quasi-static conditions. This model includes more detail such as the effects of contact friction and deformation, and provides contact forces and stresses everywhere. However, results need careful verification and interpretation. The other method is based on a simplified analytical model under the same conditions. This model provides physical insights to the problem and results to check the finite element model from different approaches. However, the accuracy and availability of the results is limited by additional assumptions. When the effects of contact friction and deformation are ignored, the results from both models are in good agreement. It is hoped that this thesis will prove valuable to the designer of all planetary <b>rotation</b> <b>machines,</b> especially for trochoidal-type machines with conjugate envelopes...|$|R

40|$|Partial Discharge is the {{physical}} phenomenon where localized electric discharges are seen within insulation system. They {{are confined to}} specific areas like voids and cavities of insulation material and thus they only bridge the electrodes partially. Partial discharge {{is a symptom of}} large number of problems in insulation of different electrical equipment caused by electrical, thermal, mechanical and chemical stresses. These may occur at the time of fabrication or as a result of aging. They can also be associated to surface discharges, which occur on the boundary of different insulation material. They can also be related to corona discharges in gaseous dielectrics. Partial discharges can be seen in all the electrical equipment such as rotating machines, transformers, cables, switchgear, bus bars etc.; in low, medium and high voltage conditions. But this paper entirely deals with insulation material of windings in rotating machines. The voltage difference between the two major components of rotating machines, stator and rotor, can be thousands of volts. Hence insulation is used to separate them. Although insulation is necessary for isolation, it has no functional purpose in the generation of electricity. And insulation, though inherently reliable, is the weakest material and ages very quickly. Partial discharge is likely the main reason for deterioration of insulation. As the partial discharge is known problem for a long time there are a different methods to detect it. When a partial discharge occurs it exhibits some physical features such as release of light, electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves and chemical reactions. The earlier detections included listening and observing the arc. But they are highly unreliable. At present there are many detection techniques such as online, offline, periodic, continuous etc.; and equipment ranges from handheld devices to large setups. The online technique which uses coupled capacitors is unique and needs assessment and analysis.

This comparison is made for data collected from a rotating machine subjected to bearing faults and the applications are demonstrated. 1 Introduction The condition monitoring of rotating machinery often involves the use of signal processing algorithms on measured vibrations. As most systems will have to work in noisy industrial environments, some form of statist [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} {{changes in}} the crystallographic textures of a diamond turned aluminium single crystal have been investigated. The X-ray pole figures were collected at various locations on the surfaces turned at high speed. In {{the central part of}} the turned surfaces, the pole figures revealed the presence of a thin deformed layer. Four sets of slip systems were found to operate to a very similar extent. However, as the distance from the centre increased, the operation of these four sets of slip systems varied and the textural changes were found to be increasingly affected by the cutting velocity. In a separate grooving experiment, electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns were collected at various locations along the bottom part of the groove. These patterns revealed a lattice <b>rotation</b> on the <b>machined</b> surface which was induced by shearing along the cutting direction. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A {{review on}} reutilization of heat waste from a diesel machine is {{absolutely}} important. This {{is because the}} exhaust gas potential of a Diesel machine keeps increasing and not much has been utilized by the industry. One of the techniques of reutilizing the heat waste in industry is by using a heat exchanger. The technique is also very useful for the environment because it can reduce air pollution caused by the exhaust gas of the diesel machine. The main purpose of the research {{is to find out}} the capability of shell and multi-tube helical coil HE as an air heater by utilizing the exhaust gas of the Diesel machine. The heat exchanger of shell and multi-tube helical coil utilizes the exhaust thermal gas of the Diesel machine as the air heater already made. The apparatus has the following dimension: the shell length of 1. 05 m, diameter 0. 1524 m, tube length of 3. 25 m with 20 coils, tube diameter of 0. 011 m, coil diameter of 0. 0508 m with 4 helical coils. The type of Diesel machine to use in the testing is 4 FB 1 Isuzu Diesel engine. The machine has the maximum <b>machine</b> power and <b>rotation</b> of 54 kW and 3, 600 rpm. The performance testing of heat exchanger has been conducted in some variations of Diesel <b>machine</b> <b>rotations</b> of 1, 500 rpm, 1, 750 rpm, 2, 000 rpm, 2, 250 rpm and 2, 500 rpm. The testing result shows a maximum effectiveness to happen at the <b>machine</b> <b>rotation</b> of 1, 500 rpm. The maximum effectiveness to get is 67. 8 % and then it goes down drastically in accordance with the increase of air mass flow rate. The hot air temperature created is from 47. 1 °C to 52. 3 °C {{so that it can be}} used for the purpose of drying up the unhulled rice...|$|R
