5000|$|A {{controlled}} experiment often compares {{the results obtained}} from experimental samples against control samples, which are practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect whose effect is being tested (the independent variable). A good example would be a drug trial. The sample or group receiving the drug would be the experimental group (treatment group); and the one receiving the placebo or regular treatment would be the control one. In many laboratory experiments it is good practice to have several <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> for the test being performed and have both a positive control and a negative control. The results from <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> can often be averaged, or {{if one of the}} replicates is obviously inconsistent with the results from the other samples, it can be discarded as being the result of an experimental error (some step of the test procedure may have been mistakenly omitted for that sample). Most often, tests are done in duplicate or triplicate. A positive control is a procedure similar to the actual experimental test but is known from previous experience to give a positive result. A negative control is known to give a negative result. The positive control confirms that the basic conditions of the experiment were able to produce a positive result, even if none of the actual experimental samples produce a positive result. The negative control demonstrates the base-line result obtained when a test does not produce a measurable positive result. Most often the value of the negative control is treated as a [...] "background" [...] value to subtract from the test sample results. Sometimes the positive control takes the quadrant of a standard curve.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{because of the}} accidental observation that a sample of 60 + beads was obtained by the instrument from a completely dry, unused well in a 96 well plate. Others have observed unexplained outliers in replicated wells. The problem was first observed on an older instrument, and replicated on a new instrument. Methods and results Data is presented from two instruments using a multiple blank following well experiment that shows a surprising amount of carryover that has an unexpected nature. When it occurs, {{it does not necessarily}} decline from one well to the next. There appears to be two types of carryover, one that is small, predictable and declines consistently, and another which is potentially very large, unpredictable, and does not decline. The former can be compensated for or ignored. The latter cannot be addressed without using multiple <b>replicated</b> <b>samples</b> or an intraplex method. Conclusion This problem has significance for analysis of results obtained with suspended microarray instruments. A special notation is made that biostatisticians need to be made aware of these results before experiments are undertaken and data generated for them to analyze. The problem can be handled by enough <b>replicated</b> <b>samples,</b> or an intraplex method. The applicability of these results to oligonucleotide based assays is unknown. </p...|$|R
40|$|Occupancy models using {{incidence}} {{data collected}} repeatedly at sites across {{the range of}} a population are increasingly employed to infer patterns and processes influencing population distribution and dynamics. While such work is common in terrestrial systems, fewer examples exist in marine applications. This disparity likely exists because the <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> required by these models to account for imperfect detection are often impractical to obtain when surveying aquatic organisms, particularly fishes. We employ simultaneous sampling using fish traps and novel underwater camera observations to generate the requisite <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> for occupancy models of red snapper, a reef fish species. Since the <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> are collected simultaneously by multiple sampling devices, many typical problems encountered when obtaining replicate observations are avoided. Our results suggest that augmenting traditional fish trap sampling with camera observations not only doubled the probability of detecting red snapper in reef habitats off the Southeast coast of the United States, but supplied the necessary observations to infer factors influencing population distribution and abundance while accounting for imperfect detection. We found that detection probabilities tended to be higher for camera traps than traditional fish traps. Furthermore, camera trap detections were influenced by the current direction and turbidity of the water, indicating that collecting data on these variables is important for future monitoring. These models indicate that the distribution and abundance of this species is more heavily influenced by latitude and depth than by micro-scal...|$|E

40|$|The discriminatory {{power of}} post-genotyping analyses, such as kinship or {{clustering}} analysis, {{is dependent on}} the amount of genetic information obtained from the DNA fragment/genotyping analysis. The number of microsatellite loci amplified in one multiplex is limited by the number of dyes and overlapping loci boundaries; requiring researchers to amplify <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> with 2 or more multiplexes in order to obtain a genotype for 12 – 15 loci. AFLP is another method that is limited by the number of dyes, often requiring multiple amplifications of <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> to obtain more complete results. Traditionally, researchers export the genotyping results into a spread sheet, manually combine the results for each individual and then import into a third software package for post-genotyping analysis. GeneMarker is highly accurate, user-friendly genotyping software that allows all of these steps to be done in one software package, avoiding potential errors from data transfer to different programs and decreasing the amount of time needed to process the results. The Merge Project tool automatically combines the results from <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> processed with different primer sets. Replicate animal (diploid) DNA samples were amplified with three different multiplexes, each multiplex provided information on 4 – 6 loci. The kinship analysis using the merged results provided a 1017 increase in statistical power with a range of 108 when 5 loci were used versus 1025 when 15 loci were used to determine potential relationship levels with identity by descent calculations. These same sample sets were used in clustering analysis to diagram dendrograms. The dendrogram based on a single multiplex resulted in three branches at a given Euclidian distance.

40|$|The EU-funded STAR-project {{provided}} an opportunity to analyse 1418 macroinvertebrate samples from 310 sampling sites throughout Europe. At most of the sites, samples were taken in two seasons using both national protocols and the project’s STAR-AQEM protocol. At a subset of sites (86), two <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> were taken by each method {{in each of the}} two seasons. The resulting taxalists were analysed in terms of community similarity using the Bray–Curtis Index, Jaccard, and Renkonen Indices. A new concept of sample ‘coherence’ is used to measure the relative strength of within-site, within-season and within-method similarity and to determine their importance on variability in community composition. Site-coherence (i. e., highest similarity to another sample from the same site) was much higher where <b>replicate</b> <b>samples</b> were available. Season-coherence of samples was nearly 100 % even if different methods were compared. Season appeared {{to be one of the}} major determinants of in-stream fauna. The STAR-AQEM method is most comparable to the Nordic, Portuguese and Czech (PERLA) national methods and less comparable to the Italian (IBE) and Latvian methods. Samples collected by these latter methods had higher similarities to other sites sampled with the same methods than to samples of the same site using the STAR-AQEM method, thus there was low site-coherence. In three stream types from Italy, Latvia and Greece 28 – 38 % of the samples were most similar to a sample from a different site than to a replicate sample from the same site. This fact could have serious consequences for follow up bioassessments or impact assessments by cluster analysis based on similarity measures. <b>Replicate</b> <b>samples</b> are less coherent within site, season or method if the taxonomic resolution is family rather than specie...|$|E

We then compared the protein expression level of three <b>replicated</b> <b>samples</b> of 2 – 3 specimens for each treatment. Within each population, variation between <b>replicated</b> <b>samples</b> of the same treatment was always lower than variation between treatments, except for some control samples that retained a wider range of expression levels.
