40|$|DOT, DOE and NRC Type A and Type B {{radioactive}} material (RAM) transport packages routinely use industrial or military specification drums with conventional <b>clamp</b> <b>ring</b> closures as an overpack. Considerable testing has been performed on these type packages {{over the past}} 30 years. Observations from test data have resulted in various design changes and recommendations to the standard drum specification and use, enhancing {{the reliability of the}} overpack. Recently, performance capability of the 9975 conventional <b>clamp</b> <b>ring</b> closure design was questioned by the Regulatory Authority. This paper highlights the observations of recent 9974 and 9975 package testing that led to redesign of the 9975, replacing the standard <b>clamp</b> <b>ring</b> closure with a bolted ring closure. In the course of this review and redesign effort, 18 package designs and approximately 100 Hypothetical Accident Condition (HAC) drops of various size and weight drum packages were evaluated.

50|$|Tubal {{ligation}} (incorrectly {{referred to}} as tubectomy) is considered major surgery, typically requiring the patient to undergo local, general, or spinal anesthesia. It is advised that women should not undergo this surgery if they currently have or {{had a history of}} bladder cancer. After the anesthesia takes effect, a surgeon will make a small incision at each side of, but just below the navel in order to gain access to each of the two fallopian tubes. With traditional tubal ligation, the surgeon severs the tubes, and then ties (ligates) them off thereby preventing the travel of eggs to the uterus. Other methods include using clips or <b>rings</b> to <b>clamp</b> them shut, or severing and cauterizing them. Tubal ligation is usually done in a hospital operating-room setting.|$|R
