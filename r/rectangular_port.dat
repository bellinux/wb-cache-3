40|$|Abstract. In recent years, R&D for pulse {{compression}} and power distribution {{systems for the}} Next Linear Collider {{has led to the}} invention of many novel rf components, some of which must handle up to 600 MW of pulsed power at X-band. These include passive waveguide components, active switch designs, and non-reciprocal devices. Among the former is a class of multi-moded, highly efficient rf components based on planar geometries with overmoded <b>rectangular</b> <b>ports.</b> Multi-moding allows us, by means of input phasing, to direct power to different locations through the same waveguide. Planar symmetry allows the height to be increased to improve power handling capacity. Features that invite breakdown, such as coupling slots, irises and H-plane septa, are avoided. This class includes hybrids, directional couplers, an eight-port superhybrid/dual-mode launcher, a mode-selective extractor, mode–preserving bends, a rectangular mode converter, and mode-mixers. We are able to utilize such rectangular waveguide components in systems incorporating low-loss, circular waveguide delay lines by means of specially designed tapers that efficiently transform multiple rectangular waveguide modes into their corresponding circular waveguide modes, specifically TE 10 and TE 20 into circular TE 11 and TE 01. These extremely compact tapers can replace well-known mode converters such as the Marié type. Another component, a reflective TE 01 -TE 02 mode converter in circular waveguide, allows us to double the delay in reflective or resonant delay lines. Ideas for multi-megawatt active components, such as switches, have also been pursued. Power-handling capacity for these is increased by making them also highly overmoded. We present a design methodology for active rf magnetic components which are suitable for {{pulse compression}} systems of future X-band linear colliders. We also present an active switch based on a PIN diode array. This component comprises an array of active elements arranged so that the electric fields are reduced and the power handling capability is increased. Novel designs allow these components to operate in the low-loss circular waveguide TE 01 mode. We describe the switching elements and circuits. I...|$|R

40|$|Fueling {{the core}} airflow of a {{circular}} or elliptical scramjet combustor cross-section often requires intrusive geometries. Intrusive geometries can distribute the fuel evenly across the combustor cross-section {{and act as}} a flameholder for the fu-el/air mixture. Compared to conventional transverse or angled wall injection, intru-sive geometries allow easier penetration into the core combustor airflow and reduced fuel injection pressures. The design and testing of an intrusive pylon geometry for scramjet combustor fueling {{is the subject of}} this research. Three pylon configurations are compared: a basic pylon, a ramp pylon, and an alternating wedge pylon. All three pylon configurations exhibit the same frontal area and inject fuel parallel to the combustor airflow with long, thin <b>rectangular</b> injection <b>ports</b> (thin film fueling). However, the three pylon configurations incorporate different aft shapes to facilitate fuel/air mixing.

40|$|Knowledge of release-etch {{kinetics}} {{is essential}} for designing manufacturing processes for large surface micromachined structures such as sealed cavities and flow channels. For large, closed structures, the use of numerous etch access holes is not feasible, although alternative release-etch approaches may be possible [1]. Because the etching of large structures from their edges rapidly becomes diffusion limited, long etch times are required to release these structures. Furthermore, for mechanical/sacrificial layer systems with non-ideal etch selectivities, degradation of the mechanical layer is a concern. For these reasons, understanding the etch rate behavior for a given geometry can be crucial to the successful fabrication of a micromachined part. Although simple geometries can be modeled analytically, modeling the etching of complex geometries can be difficult. However, by joining the solutions of release-etch kinetics of simple parts, the etching of complex structures can be modeled with less effort. For oxide-based sacrificial layers and aqueous HF release-etch chemistries, the etch kinetics have been determined for the simple geometry of the <b>rectangular</b> etch <b>port</b> (Figure 1 a) [2, 3, 4]. Other useful basic geometries can be identified, such as concentric circles and bubbles (Figure lb and 1 c).

2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side intake and exhaust ports. A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side exhaust port Wankel engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and exhaust port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a <b>rectangular</b> shaped intake <b>port.</b> [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 In {{this thesis}} a {{numerical}} technique to model general microstrip asymmetric and multiple step discontinuities is presented. The method {{is based on}} a magnetic wall waveguide model that is assumed to be valid for describing the electromagnetic fields associated with the microstrip line and in the vicinity of microstrip discontinuities. The fields are expanded in the uniform regions and the mode-matching method is applied at the discontinuities to analyze for the frequency dependent transmission properties of the multi ports. The generalized scattering matrix technique is used to model cascaded interacting discontinuities and is used to compute the properties of double-step and multi port structures. The generalized scattering matrix formulation takes into account the scattering phenomena of the dominant and all of the higher-order modes including evanescent ones. The validity of this model has been discussed extensively, and it is shown that the model can be used to describe the microstrip discontinuities with acceptable accuracy. The technique is applied (1) to study the transmission characteristics of asymmetric step discontinuities; (2) to design a filter for a desired frequency range using interacting asymmetric double step micros trip line; and (3) to design a new nominal 3 db power devider of large bandwidth consisting of a three <b>port</b> <b>rectangular</b> patch.

40|$|Planar {{electromagnetic}} lenses {{like the}} Rotman lens are attractive candidates for beambeam forming networks forming networks {{because of their}} high bandwidth of operation and their capability to form multiple beams at lower cost as comparable electronic phase shifting networks. The principles of Rotman lenses have been studied for several decades and examples have been successfully built using different technologies, including parallel plate cavities fed by rectangular waveguides or microstrip lines on dielectric substrate. Due to the true time delay nature of Rotman lenses they theoretically exhibit extremely large bandwidth. However, lenses with <b>rectangular</b> waveguides as <b>ports</b> suffer from propagation of higher order modes inside the waveguide which limits the bandwidth to less than one octave in practical applications. Higher order waveguides, e. g. single or double ridged waveguides, allow for the propagation of a transversal electromagnetic (EM) mode and thus incorporate a larger bandwidth. But the symmetric nature of the TEM mode {{and the presence of}} the ridge complicate integration in the lens. The proposed paper outlines the design of a novel feed network based on higher order waveguides suited for multi- octave operation in Radar or Electronic Support Measures (ESM) applications.

40|$|The figure shows a {{prototype}} radial power-combining waveguide structure, capable of operation at frequencies from 31 to 36 GHz, that features {{an unusually large}} number (N = 24) of combining (input) ports. The combination of wide-band operation and large N is achieved by incorporating several enhancements over a basic radial power-combiner design. In addition, the structure can be operated as a power divider by reversing {{the roles of the}} input and output ports. In this structure, full-height waveguides at the combining ports are matched in impedance to reduced-height radial waveguides inside the combiner base. This match is effected by impedance-transforming stepped waveguide sections. This matching scheme is essential to achievement of large N because N is limited by the height of the waveguides in the base. Power is coupled from the 24 reduced- height radial waveguides into the TE 01 mode of a circular waveguide in the base {{with the help of a}} matching post at the bottom of the base. (TE signifies transverse electric, the first subscript is the azimuthal mode number, and the second subscript is the radial mode number.) More specifically, the matching post matches the reflections from the walls of the 24 reduced-height waveguides and enables the base design to exceed the bandwidth requirement. After propagating along the circular waveguide, the combined power is coupled, via a mode transducer, to a <b>rectangular</b> waveguide output <b>port.</b> The mode transducer is divided into three sections, each sized and shaped as part of an overall design to satisfy the mode-conversion and output-coupling requirements while enabling the circular waveguide to be wide enough for combining the 24 inputs over the frequency range of 31 to 36 GHz. During the design process, it was found that two different rectangular waveguide outputs could be accommodated through modification of only the first section of the mode converter, thereby enabling operation in multiple frequency ranges...|$|R

This MSc. thesis {{presents a}} novel developed methodology for harbor agitation analysis in real-time. Reduced Order Models are applied for computing a sufficiently accurate generalized {{solution of the}} linear elliptic mild-slope equation for any frequency and incoming direction given a modeled harbor. Consequently, a highly efficient process is achieved for evaluating the solution of each incoming wave field (any frequency and any direction) in real-time. To do this, generalized solutions {{are based on the}} computation of a reduced basis for the given problem by using the Proper Generalized Decomposition approach. Once computed the reduced basis for a given harbor, the developed methodology proposes the real- time simulation of all possible incident wave fields concerning an incident sea waves spectrum. Two kind of analysis are proposed: the monochromatic and the multi-frequency/multi-directional one. In the first, worst incident directions and frequencies are identiffied, while in the second a combined image of incident waves spectrum is computed and analyzed from a functional point of view. Furthermore, it is valuated the economic impact of the operation conditions regarding the probability of occurrence of the simulated sea climes. At the end of this document two illustrative examples (<b>rectangular</b> harbor and <b>Port</b> Forum harbor) are developed by following the analysis approaches proposed in the previous chapters. As depicted by their results, reduced order models application and the subsequent reduction of computational time is crucial when a lot of solutions are needed. Full range evaluation of different monochromatic incoming waves gives more precise information about harbor response and minimizes signiffcantly the risk of disregarding possible dangerous scenarios. The computation of a unique combined image of a single incident wave spectrum provides a realist way for evaluating real incident sea climes and presents useful outputs for harbor exploitation and optimization. On the whole, the developed approach provides to the harbor management engineers a practical way to optimize and simulate the operative conditions in real harbors, increasing its exploitation profitability and its functional design...|$|R
