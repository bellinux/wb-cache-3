5|$|Under Maeser's administration, {{the school}} was divided into {{different}} departments based {{on the ability of}} students. The lower divisions included the Primary, Preparatory, Intermediate, and Kindergarten departments. Primary students were ages 6 to 8 and had never attended school before. The Primary classes were replaced by the Preparatory Department in 1888. This department consisted of classes beginning with a fourth-grade <b>reading</b> <b>level.</b> The Intermediate Department was for students ages eight to eleven and accepted students graduating from the Primary Department. The higher divisions of the Academy included the Academic Department and the Norman School. The Academic Department offered a wide variety of classes and allowed a student to specialize in one field, and the Norman School trained teachers. Maeser personally oversaw the Norman School. In addition, Maeser established a daily routine. Opening exercises began at 9 a.m. and classes began at 9:30a.m. Students were allowed 30 minutes for lunch. The school day ended at either 4 or 5 p.m. Over 3,000 different students enrolled at the Academy while Maeser was its principal.|$|E

The researcher designed a correlational study to answer the following question: How do the Fountas and Pinnell guided <b>reading</b> <b>levels</b> among third grade students who were instructed in guided reading correlate with the reading comprehension and Lexile scores which were generated by the CRCT? The purpose was also to determine whether guided <b>reading</b> <b>levels,</b> gender, and ethnicity had a correlation to reading comprehension and Lexile scores on the CRCT. The participants in the study consisted of 546 third grade students who were instructed in guided reading for eight months during the 2007 - 2008 school year. The Pearson r and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze the data. The findings from the study showed that there was a positive linear relationship between guided <b>reading</b> <b>levels</b> and <b>reading</b> comprehension and Lexile scores on the CRCT. The findings also indicated that there was a positive linear relationship between gender, guided <b>reading</b> <b>levels,</b> and <b>reading</b> comprehension and Lexile scores.

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} is a mother's {{ability to}} perceive and infer the meaning behind her infant's behavioural signals, {{and to respond}} to them promptly and appropriately. Maternal sensitivity affects child development at all stages through life, from infancy, {{all the way to}} adulthood. In general, more sensitive mothers have healthier, more socially and cognitively developed children than those who are not as sensitive. Also, maternal sensitivity has been found to affect the person psychologically even as an adult. Adults who experienced high maternal sensitivity during their childhood were found to be more secure than those who experienced less sensitive mothers. Once the adult becomes a parent themselves, their own understanding of maternal sensitivity will affect their own children's development. Some research suggests that adult mothers display more maternal sensitivity than adolescent mothers who may in turn have children with a lower IQ and <b>reading</b> <b>level</b> than children of adult mothers.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, only 15% of white, 6% of Hispanic, and 5% of African-American deaf {{high school}} {{graduates}} in the United States read above the sixth-grade level. In 1986, the median <b>reading</b> <b>level</b> of deaf American {{high school graduates}} was fourth grade. These concerning numbers are generally the result of varying levels of early language exposure. Most deaf children are born to hearing parents, which usually leaves a deficiency in their language exposure and development compared to children and parents who use the same modality to communicate. This group of children acquire {{a wide range of}} proficiency in a first language, which then impacts their ability to become proficient in a second (though sometimes possibly a first) language in the written modality. Children exposed to Manually Coded English (MCE) as their primary form of communication show lower literary levels than their ASL signing peers. However in countries such as Sweden which have adopted a bilingual–bicultural policy in their schools for the deaf, one sees a higher literacy rate compared to school systems favoring an oral tradition.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Statement of the Problem This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine whether or not}} the use of multilevel materials would influence to a statistically significant degree posttest scores on a comprehensive objective test. The high school basic business multilevel materials on business organizational structure were compared with materials having a <b>reading</b> grade <b>level</b> of 11. 5. This was also the grade level placement of the general business classes in which the unit was taught. In addition, information concerning the range of students' <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> and <b>reading</b> rates was collected. Description of Procedures After the development of the multilevel materials and the comprehensive pretest and posttest, the students were equated into matched pairs based upon four matching factors. These factors were <b>reading</b> grade <b>level,</b> intelligence, social class, and pretest scores. Those students in the experimental groups were given materials with a <b>reading</b> grade <b>level</b> which was closely correlated to their individual <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> as determined by the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Form A, while those students in the control groups were given materials with a <b>reading</b> grade <b>level</b> equal to the grade level placement of the classes [...] 11. 5. Each teacher involved in the experiment taught the unit as he thought it could best be taught. A comprehensive unit posttest was administered to all students. The results of the experimental and control groups were computed, and various statistical tests were calculated. Data concerning the <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> and <b>reading</b> rates were tabulated. Conclusions The following conclusions were made based upon this study: 1. High school basic business students make greater gains in learning when they use reading materials which are closely correlated to their individual <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> rather than <b>reading</b> materials with an arbitrarily chosen 11. 5 <b>reading</b> grade <b>level,</b> which was also the grade level placement of the general business classes in which the unit was taught. The gain was statistically significant at the. 05 <b>level</b> when the <b>reading</b> grade <b>level</b> was 8. 5 or less. 2. As <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> increase, the accompanying gain from the use of multilevel materials which are closely correlated with the individuals' <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> tends to decrease and yet to remain positive. 3. Reading grade levels of students within a high school basic business class vary considerably. A range of approximately eight <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> appears to be an accurate estimate of the dispersion of <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> within a class. 4. Approximately 20 percent of high school basic business students read within plus or minus one <b>reading</b> grade <b>level</b> of the middle eleventh-grade placement of the unit. About 35 percent of the students read one or more <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> below the grade level placement of the unit. Approximately 45 percent of the students read one or more <b>reading</b> grade <b>levels</b> above the grade level placement of the unit. 5. The typical high school basic business student has a <b>reading</b> grade <b>level</b> of approximately eleventh grade, fifth month, if he is selected from tenth-, eleventh-, and twelfth-grade students. 6. Reading rates of high school basic business students vary considerably. A range of approximately 525 words per minute appears to be an accurate estimate of the dispersion of reading rates within a class. 7. Approximately 4 percent of high school basic business students have reading rates of 100 words per minute or less. About 21 percent of the students have reading rates of 101 - 200 words per minute, while 35 percent of the students have reading rates of 201 - 300 words per minute. Approximately 25 percent of the students have reading rates of 301 - 400 words per minute. About 10 percent of the students have reading rates of 401 - 500 words per minute, while 5 percent of the students have reading rates of 501 - 600 words per minute. 8.
