40|$|Analytical {{relationships}} between the investment performance criteria (net present value (NPV), levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), {{internal rate of return}} (IRR), discounted payback period (TPB), and discounted costs (Z)) and basic engineering-economic parameters of nuclear reactors (capital costs K, annual operating costs Y, annual revenue R, NPP construction TC and operation TE periods), characterizing the NPP profitability and competitiveness at the microeconomic level, are defined for the first time. The power function of discounted cash flows was used in calculations. It is shown that the joint analysis of the entire set of investment efficiency criteria (not only LCOE as it is often done) can help avoid contradictions in assessing the NPP project profitability and formulate optimal requirements on the reactor engineering and economic parameters. The obtained analytical expressions provide solutions not only of the traditional «direct problem» (assessing efficiency criteria according to the forecasted capital and operating costs and profit stream) but, which is of equal importance, the solution of the «inverse problem»: assessing restrictions on capital and operating costs, i. e. identifying «investment corridors», based on the desired values of efficiency criteria. The investment risk assessment results obtained by Monte-Carlo method are presented in order to account for the inherent uncertainties in the forecasts of long-term cash flow during the NPP construction and operation required for assessing the efficiency of investments. The calculation results of probability distributions of the investment efficiency (profitability) criteria are presented for the specified ranges of uncertainties the forecasted cash flow. It is shown that the risk of project unprofitability can be quite high. In order to reduce investment risks, it is necessary to justify the changes in basic reactor parameters (decrease in K, Y, TC <b>and</b> increase in <b>R</b> <b>and</b> TE) <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> ranges in the initial data...|$|R

40|$|Cytosine DNA {{methylation}} (CDM) is {{a highly}} abundant, heritable but reversible chemical modification to the genome. Herein, a machine learning approach was applied to analyze the accumulation of epigenetic marks in methylomes of 152 ecotypes and 85 silencing mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. In an information-thermodynamics framework, two measurements were used: (1) {{the amount of information}} gained/lost with the CDM changes I <b>R</b> <b>and</b> (2) the <b>uncertainty</b> of not observing a SNP L C R. We hypothesize that epigenetic marks are chromosomal footprints accounting for different ontogenetic and phylogenetic histories of individual populations. A machine learning approach is proposed to verify this hypothesis. Results support the hypothesis by the existence of discriminatory information (DI) patterns of CDM able to discriminate between individuals and between individual subpopulations. The statistical analyses revealed a strong association between the topologies of the structured population of Arabidopsis ecotypes based on I <b>R</b> <b>and</b> on LCR, respectively. A statistical-physical relationship between I <b>R</b> <b>and</b> L C <b>R</b> was also found.

We measured their bar pattern speed using the Tremaine-Weinberg method, and derived the ratio, R, of the corotation radius {{to the length of}} the bar semi-major axis. For all the galaxies, R is consistent with being in the range from 1. 0 and 1. 4, i. e. that they host fast bars. This represents the largest sample of galaxies for which R has been measured this way. Taking into account the measured distribution of <b>R</b> <b>and</b> our measurement <b>uncertainties,</b> we argue that this is probably the true distribution of R. If this is the case, then the Tremaine-Weinberg method finds a distribution of R which is in agreement with that obtained by hydrodynamical simulations.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} an intra-laboratory study {{in order to}} {{estimate}} repeatability (<b>r),</b> reproducibility (<b>R),</b> <b>and</b> measurement <b>uncertainty</b> (U) associated with three media for Campylobacter enumeration, named, modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA); Karmali agar; and CampyFood ID agar (CFA) a medium by Biomérieux SA. The study was performed at three levels: (1) pure bacterial cultures, using three Campylobacter strains; (2) artificially contaminated samples from three chicken meat matrixes (total n= 30), whereby samples were spiked using two contamination levels; ca. 10 (3) cfuCampylobacter/g, and ca. 10 (4) cfuCampylobacter/g; and (3) pilot testing in naturally contaminated chicken meat samples (n= 20). Results from pure culture experiment revealed that enumeration of Campylobacter colonies on Karmali and CFA media was more convenient in comparison with mCCDA using spread and spiral plating techniques. Based on artificially contaminated samples testing, values of repeatability (r) were comparable between the three media, and estimated as 0. 15 log(10) cfu/g for mCCDA, 0. 14 log(10) cfu/g for Karmali, and 0. 18 log(10) cfu/g for CFA. As well, reproducibility performance of the three plating media was comparable. General R values {{which can be used}} when testing chicken meat samples are; 0. 28 log(10), 0. 32 log(10), and 0. 25 log(10) for plating on mCCDA, Karmali agar, and CFA, respectively. Measurement uncertainty associated with mCCDA, Karmali agar, and CFA using spread plating, for combination of all meat matrixes, were +/- 0. 24 log(10) cfu/g, +/- 0. 28 log(10) cfu/g, and +/- 0. 22 log(10) cfu/g, respectively. Higher uncertainty was associated with Karmali agar for Campylobacter enumeration in artificially inoculated minced meat (+/- 0. 48 log(10) cfu/g). The general performance of CFA medium was comparable with mCCDA performance at the level of artificially contaminated samples. However, when tested at naturally contaminated samples, non-Campylobacter colonies gave similar deep red colour as that given by the typical Campylobacter growth on CFA. Such colonies were not easily distinguishable by naked eye. In general, the overall reproducibility, repeatability, <b>and</b> measurement <b>uncertainty</b> estimated by our study indicate that there are no major problems with the precision of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10272 - 2 : 2006 protocol for Campylobacter enumeration using mCCDA medium...|$|R

It explores the assumption that risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are unusually high in development cooperation. Perceptions of risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are cultural constructs. Several authors have identified perceptions of uncertainty {{as one of the most}} important dimensions in organizational cultures. An analysis of evaluation reports shows that risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> often emerge as a consequence of operational factors.

Furthermore, there are a number of management techniques of handling risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> that could be used on development projects.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} study {{of relationships between}} patent races and market structure. The outcome of a patent race {{can be an important}} determinant of market structure. For example, whether or not a new firm enters a market may depend upon its winning a patent race against an incumbent firm already in that market. Moreover, market structure can be a major influence upon competition in a patent race. In the example, the asymmetry between incumbent and potential entrant has an effect upon their respective incentives in the patent race. Chapter I discusses models of <b>R</b> <b>and</b> D with <b>uncertainty.</b> We show that, as the degree of correlation between the uncertainties facing rival firms increases, <b>R</b> <b>and</b> D efforts increase under some, but not all, conditions, and the number of active competitors falls. Chapter II discusses the approach of representing patent races as bidding games. We examine a model in which several incumbent firms compete with a number of potential entrants in a patent race, and ask whether the incumbents have an incentive to form a joint venture to deter entry. They do so if and only if the patent does not offer a major cost improvement. In Chapter III we examine the strategic interactions between competitors {{during the course of a}} race, in an attempt to clarify (for different types of race) the idea that a race degenerates when one player becomes 'far enough ahead' of his rivals, in a sense made precise. In Chapter IV we examine the evolution of market structure in a duopoly model when there is a sequence of patent races. The nature of competition in the product market is shown to determine whether one firm becomes increasingly dominant as industry leader, or whether there is 'action - reaction' between firms. </p...|$|R
