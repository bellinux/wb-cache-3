40|$|This paper {{studies and}} evaluates the UV-curing of pigment prints on textile fabric using a {{prototype}} UV scanner. A printing paste comprising synthetic thickener, emulgator, binder, pigment dispersion and photoinitiator was applied using a flat screen printing technique onto the cotton fabric, then dried and exposed to heat or UV-radiation under a mercury vapour lamp (200 W cm- 2). The characteristics of cured prints such as paste add-on, colour properties, colour fastness to washing and dryžwet rubbing were evaluated, together with fabric stiffness. The effects of UV-curing {{were evaluated by}} Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The properties of the UV-cured pigment prints were {{compared with those of}} the thermal cured prints. Analyses of the obtained results helped to define the optimum composition of the photo <b>reactive</b> <b>pigment</b> paste, and the UV-curing conditions under which satisfactory results were obtained, comparable with those from the thermal curing method...|$|E
40|$|Cr-doped CaTiSiO 5 was {{synthesized}} by {{spray drying}} and conventional ceramic method {{in order to}} assess its potential as ceramic pigment. The evolution of the phase composition with thermal treatment was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and thermal analyses (DTA-TGA-EGA). Powder morphology and particle size distribution were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser diffraction, respectively. The color efficiency of pigments was evaluated by optical spectroscopy (UV–vis–NIR) and colorimetric analysis (CIE Lab). Results proved that spray drying is an efficient procedure to prepare highly <b>reactive</b> <b>pigment</b> precursors. The spray-dried powders consist of hollow spherical particles with aggregate size in the 1 – 10 μm range, developing a brown coloration. Optical spectra reveal the occurrence of Cr(III) and Cr(IV), both responsible for the brown color of this pigment. The former occupies the octahedral site of titanite, in substitution of Ti(IV), while the latter is located at the tetrahedral site, where replaces Si(IV) ...|$|E
40|$|Digital textile {{printing}} is over-taking the printing industry with eco-friendly processes {{and ability to}} produce short runs. With its rapid growth, {{there is a constant}} need to reproduce consistent colors throughout different print runs and crucial for these colors to perform well and up hold under certain conditions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to research the colorfastness digitally printed <b>reactive</b> and <b>pigment</b> inks printed on cotton fabrics. Fabric swatches printed using the <b>reactive</b> and <b>pigment</b> inks were tested according to the AATCC standards for laundering, crocking, light, and perspiration. The digital {{textile printing}} industry has slowly started transitioning from printing with reactive inks to primarily pigment inks. Printing with pigment inks is more cost effective and cheaper than reactive inks and has had a large impact on the printing industry. While reactive inks are printed on natural fibers, such as cotton and silk pigment inks, have the ability to be printed on natural and synthetic fibers. To test the textiles, a Mimaki TX 2 1600 digital textile printer was used to print the reactive ink samples while an outside printing company was used to print the pigment ink samples. One hundred and twenty-eight test samples sizes 2 ”x 6 ”printed with a red, blue, and green geometric pattern were tested. Both the <b>pigment</b> and <b>reactive</b> samples were testing according to the AATCC standards for colorfastness to laundering, crocking, light, and perspiration. Using a spectrophotometer, the samples were tested and the CIELAB color and ΔE* color change were obtained. The samples were also tested using the AATCC gray scale and 9 -step chromatic transference scale. Using the Wilcoxin rank sum test the <b>pigment</b> and <b>reactive</b> samples were compared to record any statistical significance in color change. The results revealed that the colors printed using pigment inks perform better than <b>reactive</b> inks. <b>Pigment</b> inks experienced much less color loss than the reactive inks in laundering, crocking, and perspiration. Light had little to no impact on the color of both the <b>reactive</b> and <b>pigment</b> samples. Evaluating the <b>reactive</b> and <b>pigments</b> ink types and their colorfastness benefits academia and the industry. This research provides recommendations of how these ink types may be best suited for certain types of apparel and products...|$|R

5000|$|Jute has {{the ability}} to be blended with other fibers, both {{synthetic}} and natural, and accepts cellulosic dye classes such as natural, basic, vat, sulfur, <b>reactive,</b> and <b>pigment</b> dyes. As the demand for natural comfort fibers increases, the demand for jute and other natural fibers that can be blended with cotton will increase. To meet this demand, some manufactures in the natural fiber industry plan to modernize processing with the Rieter's Elitex system. The resulting jute/cotton yarns will produce fabrics with a reduced cost of wet processing treatments. Jute can also be blended with wool. By treating jute with caustic soda, crimp, softness, pliability, and appearance is improved, aiding in its ability to be spun with wool. Liquid ammonia has a similar effect on jute, as well as the added characteristic of improving flame resistance when treated with flameproofing agents.|$|R
25|$|Vermilion, a toxic mercury {{compound}} favored for its deep red-orange color by old master painters such as Titian, {{has been replaced}} in painters' palettes by various modern pigments, including cadmium reds. Although genuine Vermilion paint can still be purchased for fine arts and art conservation applications, few manufacturers make it, because of legal liability issues. Few artists buy it, {{because it has been}} superseded by modern pigments that are both less expensive and less toxic, as well as less <b>reactive</b> with other <b>pigments.</b> As a result, genuine Vermilion is almost unavailable. Modern vermilion colors are properly designated as Vermilion Hue to distinguish them from genuine Vermilion.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{synthesis}} {{method of}} acrylated urethane based on polyethylene glycol and toluene di-isocyanate as {{a mixture of}} two isomers (2, 4 and 2, 6) has been investigated by application of IR spectra and GPC technique. In this method, reaction schemes were controlled by surveying the-NCO- and-OH absorption peak elimination and-NH- absorption peak formation in IR spectra during the reaction. The mixture of the two isomers leads acrylated urethane resins to contain three oligomers (II, 111 and IV) in the final product. The study of physical and mechanical properties of y-cured resin showed that hardness and impact resistance vary with increase in dose; meanwhile these quantities indicate a little variation after 60 kGy. This {{could be due to}} increasing of cross-link density. Also, addition of reactive monomers to the resin showed that increase in double bonds density in the resin system at a given dose, caused an increase in hardness and a decrease in impact resistance. By addition of a rutile type titanium dioxide as pigment, the hardness of film increases, but the variation of hardness-dose curve in both unpigmented and pigmented film is the same.

40|$|Membranes of Halobacterium halobium contain two photochemically <b>reactive</b> retinal <b>pigments</b> in {{addition}} to the proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. One, halorhodopsin, is also an electrogenic ion pump with a fast (on a scale of milliseconds) photoreaction cycle. The other, s-rhodopsin, is active in the same spectral region, but has a much slower photoreaction cycle (on a scale of seconds). S-rhodopsin is not an electrogenic ion pump and its properties suggest it functions as the receptor pigment for phototaxis. All three pigments have very similar absorption spectra. The recent isolation of mutants deficient in both bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin and in retinal synthesis has allowed us to resolve the absorption spectra of s-rhodopsin and halorhodopsin. At neutral pH s-rhodopsin has an absorption maximum at 587 +/- 2 nm and halorhodopsin at 578 +/- 2 nm. At pH 10. 8, lambda max for s-rhodopsin is shifted to 552 nm and extinction decreases slightly (15 %) while halorhodopsin loses all extinction above 500 nm. Both effects are fully reversible and allow determination of the amounts of s-rhodopsin and halorhodopsin in membrane preparations containing both pigments. Both pigments were present in earlier studies of H. halobium membranes, and in view of these findings, several observations must be reinterpreted...|$|R
40|$|This {{study reveals}} an exergetic {{analysis}} of the <b>reactive</b> and <b>pigment</b> printing processes. Exergy models of the printing processes were formed and each step examined in terms of exergetic parameters. In the printing machine, the reactive printing process led to a higher specific exergy use due to the penetration requirement of the printing paste. The exergy efficiency in the subsequent drying after printing {{was found to be}} independent of the print-ing method, but affected by the fabric structure, which was calculated to be between 3. 8 % and 4. 8 %. In the fixation step, pigment printing provided the highest exergy efficiency, calculated to be 2. 15 %, due to the direct heating of the fixation air. It was observed for the fixation step that the boiler unit of the steaming process and the burner of the hot air fixa-tion process led to the highest exergy destruction rates. The total exergy destruction rate in pigment printing was found to be higher than in the washing and final drying stages of reac-tive printing alone; thus, it was shown that the exergetic improvement of the post-washing and drying of reactive printing is of great importance.

30|$|Prodigiosins has an {{affinity}} towards the lipids bilayer of the plasmatic membrane because C-pyrrole ring of prodigiosin is lipophilic {{due to the}} presence of pentyl chain. Prodigiosin had been reported to generate lipid peroxidation in the presence of Cu (II) and damage cytoplasmic membrane in its cytotoxicity(Subramanian et al. 2007). We propose that lipid peroxidation corresponds to the ultimate disintegration of membrane integrity. The prodigiosin, linked to the bacterial plasma membrane, could captivate visible light and generate <b>reactive</b> oxygen. The <b>pigment</b> and the cellular membrane were attacked by reactive oxygen. Subsequent lipid peroxidation damaged the integrity of the cellular membrane (Wang et al. 2013)that could be clearly observed in the SEM (Fig.  4 a, b). The same results were reflected in the analysis of depletion of lipopolysaccharide layer.|$|R
50|$|The ‘textile market’ {{comprises}} {{many different}} applications and requirements. The intended {{use of the}} fabric {{is the most important}} starting point to identify exactly what’s needed to produce a specific end-product. A ‘textile’ product may vary from natural yarns for garments, through to synthetic fibres for flags and banners. A ‘textile product’ can be a wall mounted banner, a stand-alone pop-up banner, a beach flag, country flag or company flag. It can be a carpet, back-lit frame, curtain, room divider, building wrap, bed cover, a garment and much more. The predominant textile media used in visual communication is a polyester based fabric. In the USA, nylon is often used for flags. In northern Europe, polyspun material has been the choice of fabric for traditional flag printing. In today’s market, a woven or knitted polyester is the de facto standard. This differs from the predominant coated vinyl or pvc media used in the sign and display industry.The production process needs to fit requirements for the type of ink: high energy sublimation (also known as disperse direct), low energy sublimation (dye-sub), acid, <b>reactive</b> and <b>pigment.</b> In turn, the type of ink chemistry needs to fit requirements for the media (such as polyester, nylon, cotton, silk). Based on the media and ink combination, the choice comes for infra-red fixation, heat-press sublimation or steaming. The structure of the fabric also needs attention, for example whether it is woven, non-woven or knitted.|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} the current work {{is to examine the}} effects of {{different}} kinds of finishing treatments on the hand properties of the woven fabrics produced with compact spun yarns. Plain, twill and satin fabrics were produced with 100 % cotton compact yarns in two yarn counts of 20 tex and 12 tex. All the fabrics were divided into two groups and mercerization process was applied to the one of the groups. The mercerized fabrics were dyed and printed with reactive dyestuffs. The other non mercerized groups of fabrics were divided into three such as reactive dyed, <b>reactive</b> printed and <b>pigment</b> printed. As a result, 30 different fabrics were obtained. In order to measure the handle properties of the fabrics objectively, Shirley stiffness tester, circular bending rigidity tester and thickness tester were used. It was determined that yarn count, fabric weave and finishing treatment have a statistically significant effect on handle properties of the fabrics woven with compact spun yarns...|$|R
40|$|A {{strain of}} Pseudomonas fluorescens {{was capable of}} co-metabolizing 3 -chlorobenzoic acid with the {{production}} of a chlorinated catechol black pigment. A peroxidase and another enzymatic activity referred to as a polyphenol oxidase were found {{to be involved in the}} oxidation of 4 -chlorocatechol to 4 -chloro- 1, 2 -benzoquinone, i. e. in the production of highly <b>reactive</b> substrates for <b>pigment</b> formation. Therefore, P. fluorescens cells were seen to take an active part not only in 3 -chlorobenzoate mineralization but also in overall pigment production. pH was found to be a key parameter in the regulation of the activity of P. fluorescens oxidoreductive enzymes. Ultrastructural investigations showed that electron dense granules of pigment were distributed throughout the cytoplasm of Pseudomonas fluorescens cells grown in presence of 3 -chlorobenzoate, as confirmed also by Thiéry cytochemical investigations. In these cells, an extensive contraction of the cytoplasm as well as a significant damage to the cell wall after two days of incubation, suggested that pigment production caused a premature death of the cells accompanied by the leakage of the cell content. Pigment production seemed to occur mostly in the cytoplasmic context where the electron dense material accumulates until it is released in the medium after the cell lysis...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the rapid}} {{development}} of surveillance and acquisition devices it became imperative to develop camouflage textiles that could protect the objects from detection by various sensors {{in the wide}} spectral range. And, as the sensor systems continue to be refined, {{it is necessary that}} the performance of camouflage materials would be continually updated. In this research the samples of woven printed camouflage fabrics, which can conceal the object both in the visible (380 nm – 780 nm) and near infrared – NIR, (780 nm – 1200 nm) radiation spectral range, were developed and investigated. Three different printing technologies (using <b>pigments,</b> <b>reactive</b> dyes and vat dyes) were used to achieve these characteristics. Colour fastness to various influences, spectral characteristics of surface colour in visible and NIR spectral range and influence of different pretreatments (washing, abrasion, repeated flexing and exposure to light) on colour change were determined and analyzed. Some advantages and disadvantages of the applied printing technologies were set. The results showed that even noticeable changes of colour intensity after some pretreatments in the visual spectral range, in many cases does not have significant influence on the spectral reflectance in the NIR range and it remains in the required level. These studies would pave the way for development and optimization of textile materials with respect to better stability of concealing properties in the visible and NIR all wearing period...|$|R
40|$|This study {{discuss the}} {{problems}} of displaying artworks containing yellow chrome <b>pigments,</b> <b>reactive</b> to the wavelengths in LED lights, often used in modern exhibitions. In the late 19 th century there where a variety of chrome pigments manufactured, such as lead chromate (PbCrO 4) and lead chromate mixed with lead sulphate (PbCrO 4 · PbSO 4). Studies have found that lead chromates with high content of sulphate and/or a certain crystal structure, tends to darken when exposed to light with short wavelengths. The main purpose has been to analyze two yellow paint samples from Vincent van Gogh’s Olive groove, Saint-Rémy - 1889, in Gothenburg art museum’s collection. Analysis with Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) confirmed {{the presence of a}} lead chromate, probably mixed with zinc white (ZnO). No complete characterization of potential sulphate content in the pigment could be made. The lack of sulphur in parts of the samples {{and the fact that the}} paint after 134 years in various lighting conditions still remain bright yellow, may indicate that it is not one of the most reactive type of lead chromates. As a supplement a series of oil colours containing yellow chrome pigments was made and artificially aged for 8 400 000 lx h, with a halogen spotlight and a “warm white” LED spotlight. The experiment simulated c. 19 / 25 years of exposure with 200 / 150 lux, with respect to the museums annual open hours. The lead chromates change in colour while a zinc chromate din not. The LED light caused no more darkening of this sulphur containing lead chromate, than the halogen light. As this experiment simulated exposure for a relatively short period of time with only one sulphur containing lead chromate, the reports on the potential danger of LED lights should not be neglected.
