The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

They presented 437 items of evidence, and concluded that the evidence pointed away from the Ramseys. However, they were unable to successfully challenge the police department's steadfast belief that the Ramseys were guilty. The District Attorney's office sought {{to take control of the}} investigation. Due to the animosity between the police department and the DA's office and the pressure to obtain a conviction, <b>Roy</b> <b>Romer,</b> the governor of Colorado, interceded and named Michael Kane as special prosecutor to initiate a grand jury. Two of the lead investigators in the case who had opposing views, Lou Smit and Steve Thomas, resigned. Smit, who had worked for the DA's office, resigned because he believed that the investigation had incompetently overlooked the intruder hypothesis. Thomas, a police detective who later wrote a book about the case, initially cited health concerns when resigning, but later said he had done so because the DA's office had interfered with and failed to support the police investigation of the case.|$|E
