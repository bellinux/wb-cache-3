5|$|The {{capture of}} the JNA barracks in Bjelovar also {{affected}} the ceasefire agreement reached between the JNA and Croatia in Igalo, specifically a provision regarding {{the lifting of the}} blockade of the JNA barracks there. Initially there was a dispute between Tuđman and JNA General Veljko Kadijević as to whether it meant achieving normal living conditions in the barracks or complete freedom of movement for the JNA in Croatia. A compromise interpretation was negotiated, only to be dropped by Kadijević specifically because of the events in Bjelovar. On 1 October, Kadijević issued an ultimatum to Croatia threatening destruction of one civilian facility vital to the Croatian population for each military post captured by the ZNG. The ultimatum demonstrated that the JNA considered Croatia enemy territory, rather than part of the country it had a <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect.</b>|$|E

40|$|Good {{international}} {{citizenship is}} generally seen, either implicitly or explicitly, {{as being a}} matter of fulfilling general duties {{in the realm of}} foreign policy. In this article, I challenge this prevailing view, by arguing that good international citizenship frequently involves discharging special <b>responsibilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect,</b> which in turn involves grants of asylum to refugees. While arguing that asylum should be seen as an important element of good international citizenship as a matter of course, it assumes an even more central role in this citizenship in two scenarios. The first is where humanitarian intervention is either imprudent or politically impossible without violating the procedural norms of international society. The second is when intervention – whether pursued for humanitarian or other reasons – creates refugees, and intervening states may thereby acquire special <b>responsibilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> those refugees...|$|R

Sharrer claimed to have purchased 363,034 acres in the area, and had attempted to induce chiefs to give up all their rights to their land. He may have intended to form his own Chartered company, or as Harry Johnston who was appointed as British consul in 1891 suspected, to acquire a form of sovereignty over the Shire Highlands and sell his rights either to Britain or Germany. Johnston rejected the suggestion that any treaties made before the British Central Africa Protectorate was established in 1891 could transfer sovereignty to Sharrer, but he accepted that these treaties were evidence of sales of land to him.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} {{on whether}} an uprising is an insurgency or a belligerency {{has not been}} as clearly codified as many other areas covered by the internationally accepted laws of war for two reasons. The first is that international law traditionally does not encroach on matters that are solely the internal affairs of a sovereign state, but recent developments such as the <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect,</b> are starting to undermine the traditional approach. The second is that at the Hague Conference of 1899, there was disagreement between the Great Powers who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture, and smaller states, which maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants. The dispute resulted in a compromise wording being included in the Hague Conventions known as the Martens Clause from the diplomat who drafted the clause.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{waters and}} wetland acreage {{likely to be}} removed from the section 404 {{permitting}} program {{as a result of the}} SWANCC decision are very difficult to assess, in part because of questions about Corps and EPA interpretation of the ruling, but the decision may affect up to 79% of wetland acreage. One likely result is that case-by-case evaluations will then be required to determine if regulatory jurisdiction exists, the length of time to obtain section 404 permits will be longer than in the past. If federal jurisdiction is diminished, the <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> affected wetlands falls on states and local governments. A comprehensive picture of their ability to protect wetlands, under various possible state and local authorities, is difficult to draw together. Whether states will act to fill in the gap left by removal of some federal jurisdiction by new laws or programs raises difficult political and resource questions.|$|E

25|$|As noted previously, {{prior to}} SWANCC, {{virtually}} all US wetlands were, at least theoretically, subject to regulation under section 404. As federal jurisdiction is diminished, the <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> affected wetlands falls on states primarily and local governments, which also regulate some wetlands. State and local wetlands regulatory programs focus primarily upon navigable waters, tributaries, and adjacent wetlands. They supplement {{but do not}} substitute for federal jurisdiction. According to the Association of State Wetland Managers (ASWM), 14 states {{have some form of}} regulatory program for freshwater wetlands, but they are quite variable. Differences exist in part because freshwater wetland types vary greatly across the nation and because of differing state preferences. Some of the state programs are very comprehensive, but regulations in many of the 14 states are limited by wetland size, mapping requirements, and exemptions for specified activities. According to ASWM, state regulations do not generally apply to federal lands. Some of the states with the largest isolated wetland acreages provide little or no state protection, including Alaska, Louisiana, Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Nebraska, Kansas, and Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|In {{part the}} Treaty {{was an attempt}} to {{establish}} a system of property rights for land with the Crown controlling and overseeing land sale to prevent abuse and initially this worked well and the Governor had the sole right to buy and sell land from the Māori. Māori were eager to sell land, and settlers eager to buy. The Crown was supposed to mediate the process to ensure that the true owners were properly identified (difficult for tribally owned land) and fairly compensated, {{by the standards of the}} time. In particular, the Governor had the <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> Māori interests. Governor Grey set out to buy large tracts of Māori land in advance of settlement at low prices, later selling it to settlers at higher prices and using the difference to develop land access (roads and bridges). Donald McLean acted as Grey's intermediary and negotiator, and as early as 1840 was aware that Māori had no concept of the sale of land in British sense. Soon Māori became disillusioned and less willing to sell, while the Crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy. Consequently, government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases, agreements were sometimes negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased from the wrong people altogether. Eventually this led to the New Zealand Wars which culminated in the confiscation of a large part of the Waikato and Taranaki.|$|E
