(4) Nevertheless, some domestic abuse cases can be filed as an assault without the intent to kill that is punishable by 10 years in prison of death results, 7 years for permanent disability, or 1 year for temporary injury. (4) Rape in the UAE is not tolerated and is punishable by immediate death. However, many women do not report being raped because they could be accused of adultery which results in flogging or death by stoning and brings shame to the family. (7) Divorce is rare in the UAE due to the stipulations that derive from it. Article 110 of the Personal Status Code states, women can request to be divorced with the exception that she surrenders all of her finances; otherwise known as the [...] "khul" [...] divorce procedure. (7) If the divorce is processed, the custody of the children is determined. Women are considered to be physical guardians and only have the right to custody up to the age of 13 for girls and 10 for boys.

5|$|First-wave {{feminism}} was {{a period}} of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK <b>Custody</b> <b>of</b> Infants Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement and gave woman the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> their children for the first time. Other legislation such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar legislation in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed legislation in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{concerns the}} legal {{position of the}} child in the determination <b>of</b> <b>custody,</b> i. e. the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> parents to decide the child's life-situation; in applications for enforcement, i. e. the manner in which a decision <b>of</b> court concerning <b>custody</b> and access is enforced; and in cases of intervention, i. e. when society intervenes {{for the protection of the}} child against parents who fail in their task to such an extent that there is a danger to the health or social development of the child. These three areas of the law have as their centre the fact that a parent has the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> the child, i. e. to have the child with him or her. The investigation is based on a survey of about 3000 cases. This includes matters dealt with by JO, which mainly concern actions taken by non-judicial authorities. These matters throw light on the way the social welfare boards operate, and defects in their mode of operation. The direction of oresent investigation has to a large extent been determined by the cases. It becomes evident from our investigation that there is hardly any possibility for the child to influence hos own life-situation. Children above the age of 15 are guaranteed a hearing and - within the social welfare system - have also a right to bring complaints, but for younger children there is no provision that they be heard in cases concerning them, nor that their wishes should be taken into account. The children are entirely dependent on the assessment done by adults in their environment. digitalisering@um...|$|R

40|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of children are abducted across international borders, often by one of their parents. The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Convention) and its implementing legislation, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), provide recourse to the non-abducting parent. However, recent cases in the U. S.

40|$|The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Convention) protects {{parents with}} primary custody rights from parental {{abduction}} or retention {{of their children}} in another country. However, as more couples in the United States forgo marriage but continue having children, these couples-who often prefer informal parenting arrangements-do not often obtain court orders that identify their custody or visitation rights. Yet if an unmarried parent relocated to another country without the other parent 2 ̆ 7 s consent, the parties would {{have to rely on}} the state 2 ̆ 7 s default custody rules to determine where the custody battle should ensue. For example, Mexican jurisdictions follow a Roman civil law tradition, patria potestas (parental authority). From birth or voluntary acknowledgement of paternity, parental authority gives both parents the right to care and control their children and their children 2 ̆ 7 s property. However, in most United States jurisdictions, custody rights do not arise automatically simply because a child was born to unmarried parents. Instead, voluntary acknowledgment of paternity serves as a basis from which a parent can seek the court 2 ̆ 7 s determination of custody in the child 2 ̆ 7 s best interests. These differences in approaches to child custody appeared in two recent Convention cases in the Seventh Circuit. In both Garcia v. Pinelo and Martinez v. Cahue, the unmarried fathers voluntarily acknowledged paternity of their children. In Garcia, the Seventh Circuit found that the unmarried father, who resided in Mexico, had a right of custody under the Convention pursuant to the Mexican laws of parental authority. In contrast, in Martinez, the Seventh Circuit found that Illinois law presumes, {{in the absence of a}} court order, an unmarried mother has sole custody of her child. Therefore, the unmarried father in Martinez, who did not obtain a custody order before the mother moved to Mexico, did not have any <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> under the Convention, despite having acknowledged paternity. In light of demographic trends towards fewer marriages and more informal parenting arrangements, should jurisdictions like Illinois adopt child custody rules that endow <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> to both parents at birth or upon acknowledgement of the child? In order to protect children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests and to preserve the status quo before an alleged wrongful retention or abduction, Illinois should not adopt a rule like parental authority laws. While as a society we may want parents to share significant decision-making and to cooperate regarding their children 2 ̆ 7 s upbringing, default rules regarding children should protect children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests rather than parental rights. Illinois 2 ̆ 7 s presumption requires a court to consider the children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests before awarding custody and visitation rights while parental authority laws automatically confer decision-making authority to parents. Children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests are better served when a court protects stability and the status quo in children 2 ̆ 7 s lives rather than enabling a parent to assert parental rights for the first time under a Hague Convention petition...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to give an {{overview}} on the rules of private international law existing at national and at international level and concerning relationships between parents and children, regardless of other conditions. In fact the thesis deals with jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of judgements {{in the field of}} parental authority, parental responsibility and child protection. Whereas the relevant legislation on parents – children relationships does not consider this topic as an unicuum, but takes into account differently the abovementioned categories, the thesis focuses on each of them separately. As a consequence, the first topic to be addressed is the relationship between the different relevant legislations, with reference to their material scope. The legislations taken into account are hereafter listed: - Council Regulation (EC) No 2201 / 2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347 / 2000; - Hague Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of infants; - Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and co-operation in respect of parental responsibility and measures {{for the protection of the}} child, that is expected to repeal the 1961 Hague Convention; - Articles 36, 37 and 42 of Italian Private International Law, n. 218 / 1995. After explaining the relationship among the abovementioned legislations, the thesis deals with jurisdiction, focusing on the fundamental principle ruling jurisdiction - the best interest of the child - and on the general criterion for determining jurisdiction: the habitual residence of the child, which is increasingly used in international acts. On the other hand, nationality is relevant under the 1961 Hague Convention and under Art. 36 of the Italian private international law, as a connecting factor for determining the applicable law. As far as connecting factors in the field of parents - children relationships, the research focuses on several topics, such as the problems arising from the discrimination based on nationality, and on multiple nationalities. Finally, the research explores the recognition as well as the enforcement of judgments: procedures differ from each other on the basis of where decisions are held, whether in a Member State or not. Also the object of the decision could lead to a different proceeding: for example, a judgment concerning access rights is directly recognized and enforceable in another Member State provided it is accompanied by a certificate, which shall be issued by the judge of origin who stated the judgment. The certificate guarantees that some procedural safeguards have been respected during the procedure in the State where the decision has been adopted. Finally, some recent aspects about public order exception are described. Parental responsibility is considered by Art. 2 of the Council Regulation (EC) No 2201 / 2003, and by Art. 1 of the 1996 Hague Convention, which both widely define the concept: in fact “parental responsibility” covers all rights and duties of a parent, guardian or legal representative, relating to the person or the property of the child. This encompasses not only <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> and rights of access, but also matters such as the guardianship and the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional care and child protection. It is worth underlining that: i) the list of matters qualified as “parental responsibility” pursuant to the Regulation in Art. 2 is not exhaustive, but merely illustrative; ii) it includes also measures for the protection of the child; iii) the concept of parental responsibility pursuant to the 1996 Hague Convention includes parental authority. As a consequence, parental responsibility may be considered the only relevant category in the field of parents – children relations. This hypothesis may lead to a uniform private international law regulations on family relations...|$|E

5000|$|On 28 February 1872, Schuffenecker {{joined the}} broker Bertin, {{where he met}} Paul Gauguin; they became close friends. Both used to study the Old Masters at the Louvre, and worked at the Académie Colarossi. In 1880, Schuffenecker married a cousin, Louise Lançon (1860-); their {{daughter}} Jeanne was born in 1882, their son Paul in 1884. In these years, however, the economic situation decreased. By 1880 both Schuffenecker and Gauguin evidently had gained enough money to leave Bertin - just in time before the French Panama canal project began {{to turn into a}} disaster - and to try to stand on their own feet: Both opted for a career in the arts, and probably for additional income at the stock exchange. Then, in January 1882, the Paris Bourse crashed, and while Gauguin chose to remain independent, Schuffenecker decided to apply for the diploma to teach. Two years later, he was appointed to teach drawing at the Lycée Michelet in Vanves, with the painter Louis Roy as a collegial friend.Much has been said about Gauguin's portrait of [...] "le bon Schuff" [...] and his family, painted early in 1889 in Schuffenecker's studio, soon after Gauguin's return from Arles: judging from Gauguin's portrait, the personal relations of the couple are widely considered to have been precarious. Since Gauguin's return from Denmark, in 1885, he had been welcome to stay at Schuffenecker's, but soon after his return from Brittany in 1890, Gauguin was asked to find a place elsewhere. Rumours (most probably initiated by Émile Bernard) spread that Schuffenecker had been betrayed by his wife, and for years, he separated himself from his family, until in 1899, his wife demanded a divorce and won the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> over their children.|$|R
