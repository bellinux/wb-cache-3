25|$|The SEM {{produces}} images by {{probing the}} specimen with a focused electron beam that is scanned across a rectangular {{area of the}} specimen (<b>raster</b> <b>scanning).</b> When the electron beam interacts with the specimen, it loses energy {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. The lost energy is converted into alternative forms such as heat, emission of low-energy secondary electrons and high-energy backscattered electrons, light emission (cathodoluminescence) or X-ray emission, all of which provide signals carrying information about the properties of the specimen surface, such as its topography and composition. The image displayed by an SEM maps the varying intensity of any of these signals into the image in a position corresponding to the position of the beam on the specimen when the signal was generated. In the SEM image of an ant shown below and to the right, the image was constructed from signals produced by a secondary electron detector, the normal or conventional imaging mode in most SEMs.|$|E
2500|$|A modern display {{technology}} using {{a variation of}} cathode ray tube is often used in videocassette recorders, DVD players and recorders, microwave oven control panels, [...] and automotive dashboards. Rather than <b>raster</b> <b>scanning,</b> these vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD) switch control grids and anode voltages on and off, for instance, to display discrete characters. The VFD uses phosphor-coated anodes as in other display cathode ray tubes. Because the filaments are in view, they must be operated at temperatures where the filament does not glow visibly. This is possible using more recent cathode technology, and these tubes also operate with quite low anode voltages (often less than 50 volts) unlike cathode ray tubes. Their high brightness allows reading the display in bright daylight. VFD tubes are flat and rectangular, as well as relatively thin. Typical VFD phosphors emit {{a broad spectrum of}} greenish-white light, permitting use of color filters, though different phosphors can give other colors even within the same display. The design of these tubes provides a bright glow despite the low energy of the incident electrons. This is because the distance between the cathode and anode is relatively small. (This technology is distinct from fluorescent lighting, which uses a discharge tube.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The use of <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> in {{television}} was proposed in 1880 by French engineer Maurice Leblanc. The concept of <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> was {{inherent in the}} original mechanical disc-scanning television patent of Paul Nipkow in 1884. The term raster was used for a halftone printing screen pattern as early as 1894. Similar terminology was used in German at least from 1897; Eder writes of [...] "die Herstellung von Rasternegativen für Zwecke der Autotypie" [...] (the production of raster negatives for halftones). Max Dieckmann and Gustav Glage {{were the first to}} produce actual raster images on a cathode-ray tube (CRT); they patented their techniques in Germany in 1906. [...] It has not been determined whether they used the word raster in their patent or other writings.|$|E

These recorded values are displayed as a heat map to produce the final STM images, usually using a black and white or an orange color scale.|$|R
50|$|<b>Raster</b> <b>scan</b> on CRTs {{produces}} {{both the}} impression of a steady image from a single scanning point (only one point is being drawn at a time) through several technical and psychological processes. These images then produce {{the impression of}} motion in largely the same way as film - a high enough frame rate of still images yields the impression of motion - though <b>raster</b> <b>scans</b> differ in a few respects, particularly interlacing.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{the mirrors}} {{can lead to}} a {{periodic}} motion - like the rotating mirror polygons in a barcode scanner or so-called resonant galvanometer scanners - or to a freely addressable motion, as in servo-controlled galvanometer scanners.

50|$|<b>Raster</b> <b>scanning</b> is the {{rectangular}} pattern of image capture and reconstruction. Using this scanning on EZW transform is to perform scanning the coefficients in such way that no child node is scanned before its parent node.

50|$|When analog {{television}} was developed, no affordable technology for storing any video signals existed; the luminance signal {{has to be}} generated and transmitted {{at the same time}} at which it is displayed on the CRT. It is therefore essential to keep the <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> in the camera (or other device for producing the signal) in exact synchronization with the scanning in the television.|$|E
40|$|A {{design is}} {{presented}} that proposes {{the use of}} digital image processing techniques to interface existing geocoded data sets and information management systems with thematic maps and remote sensed imagery. The basic premise is that geocoded data sets can be referenced to a <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> that is equivalent to a grid cell data set, and that images taken of thematic maps or from remote sensing platforms {{can be converted to}} a <b>raster</b> <b>scan.</b> A major advantage of the raster format is that x, y coordinates are implicitly recognized by their position in the scan, and z values can be treated as Boolean layers in a three-dimensional data space. Such a system permits the rapid incorporation of data sets, rapid comparison of data sets, and adaptation to variable scales by resampling the <b>raster</b> <b>scans...</b>|$|R

Three types of <b>scanning</b> are con-sidered: <b>raster</b> <b>scan,</b> Hilbert scan, and binary scan. Hilbert and binary scan are found to outperform <b>raster</b> <b>scan.</b> The methods considered for compression are integer wavelet transforms, a piecewise approximation with triggers (PAT) procedure introduced by Walach and Kamin [6], and a mod-ified PAT algorithm (MPAT). Wavelets outperform MPAT in compression, and MPAT in turn outperforms PAT, how-ever, MPAT and PAT are computationally far simpler than wavelet transforms. 1...|$|R

The surface topography is commonly displayed as a pseudocolor plot.|$|E

In projection-mode the MEMS laser beam scanning display method can be compared to <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> in a cathode ray tube (CRT) display.Product applications include mobile projection, virtual retinal display, head-mounted display, automotive head-up display, and 3D depth sensing (LiDAR).

5000|$|Computer {{printers}} {{create their}} images basically by <b>raster</b> <b>scanning.</b> Laser printers use a spinning polygonal mirror (or an optical equivalent) to scan across the photosensitive drum, and paper movement provides the other scan axis.

Inkjet printers have multiple nozzles in their printheads, so many (dozens to hundreds) of [...] "scan lines" [...] are written together, and paper advance prepares {{for the next}} batch of scan lines.

40|$|A key hurdle in {{achieving}} high scan speeds in {{atomic force microscopes}} is that the probe is required to be scanned over the sample in a zig-zag raster pattern.

Consequently, fast <b>raster</b> <b>scans</b> generate distortions in the resulting image.

A number of these also understood the color codes from the Tektronix 4105 <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> terminal, which added color to the original 4010 command set.

50|$|Many {{applications}} {{requires that}} a surface is addressed instead {{of only a}} single line. For double resonant operation, which results in sinusoidal scan motion, a Lissajous pattern is written. Mechanical deflection angles of such micro scanning devices reach up to ±30°. With translational (piston type) microscanners a mechanical stroke of up to approx. ±500 µm can be attained. This configuration is energy efficient, but requires complicated control electronics. For high end display applications the common choice is <b>raster</b> <b>scanning,</b> where a resonant scanner (for the longer display dimension) is paired with quasi-static scanner (for the shorter dimension).|$|E

5000|$|Horizontal {{blanking}} interval {{refers to a}} {{part of the process of}} displaying images on a computer monitor or television screen via <b>raster</b> <b>scanning.</b> CRT screens display images by moving beams of electrons very quickly across the screen. Once the beam of the monitor has reached the edge of the screen, the beam is switched off, and the deflection circuit voltages (or currents) are returned to the values they had for the other edge of the screen; this would have the effect of retracing the screen in the opposite direction, so the beam is turned off during this time. This part of the line display process is the Horizontal Blank.|$|E

Bitmap raster graphics requires much more memory than vector graphics. XGA-level 1024x768 black/white resolution requires 96 kilobytes of video refresh memory, 12 times more than a basic PDS-1.
