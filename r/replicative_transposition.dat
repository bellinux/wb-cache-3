5000|$|<b>Replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> is a {{mechanism}} of transposition in molecular biology, proposed by James A.

40|$|Under several circumstances, the {{frequency}} with which Mud prophages form lysogens is apparently reduced in rec strains of Salmonella typhimurium. Lysogen formation by a MudI genome (37 kb) injected by a Mu virion is unaffected by a host rec mutation. However when the same MudI phage is injected by a phage P 22 virion, lysogeny is reduced in a recA or recB mutant host. A host rec mutation reduces the lysogenization of mini-Mu phages injected by either Mu or P 22 virions. When lysogen frequency is reduced by a host rec mutation, the surviving lysogens show an increased probability of carrying a deletion adjacent to the Mud insertion site. We propose that the rec effects seen are due to a failure of conservative Mu <b>transposition.</b> <b>Replicative</b> Mud <b>transposition</b> from a linear fragment causes a break in the host chromosome with a Mu prophage at both broken ends. These breaks are lethal unless repaired; repair can be achieved by Rec functions acting on the repeated Mu sequences or by secondary transposition events. In a normal Mu infection, the initial transposition from the injected fragment is conservative and does not break the chromosome. To account for the conditions under which rec effects are seen, we propose that conservative transposition of Mu depends on a protein that must be injected with the DNA. This protein can be injected by Mu but not by P 22 virions. Injection or function of the protein may depend on its association with a particular Mu DNA sequence that is present and properly positioned in Mu capsids containing full-sized Mu or MudI genomes; this sequence may be lacking or abnormally positioned in the mini-Mud phages tested...|$|R
30|$|Repetitive {{sequences}} play significant {{roles in}} the evolution of genome architecture, gene expression, and speciation. The largest fraction of repetitive sequences in most plant genomes is composed of transposable elements [11] that are classified into two main major categories: class 1 RNA elements and class 2 or DNA elements, based on the kind of molecules used as intermediates in the <b>replicative</b> mechanism of <b>transposition</b> [7]. Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, (LTR-RTs), a particular group of class 1 elements, are ubiquitous in plants [12, 18, 45, 53]. The biology of retrotransposition, whereby identical LTRs are found at the ends of retrotransposons after transposition, makes long terminal repeat sequences ideal molecular signatures for understanding the timing of LTR-RT insertion, for understanding the mechanisms of LTR-RT elimination, and for the determining the phylogenetic relationships of LTR-RT families.|$|R

Evidence is presented {{to show that the}} Tn 10 double-strand cut is made by an ordered, sequential cleavage of the two strands. The transferred strand is cut first, and then the nontransferred strand is cleaved. The single-strand nicked intermediate is seen to accumulate when Mn 2 + is substituted for Mg 2 + in the reaction or when certain mutant transposases are used.

50|$|The retrotransposons' <b>replicative</b> mode of <b>transposition</b> {{by means}} of an RNA {{intermediate}} rapidly increases the copy numbers of elements and thereby can increase genome size. Like DNA transposable elements (class II transposons), retrotransposons can induce mutations by inserting near or within genes. Furthermore, retrotransposon-induced mutations are relatively stable, because the sequence at the insertion site is retained as they transpose via the replication mechanism. Retrotransposons copy themselves to RNA and then back to DNA that may integrate back to the genome. The second step of forming DNA may be carried out by a reverse transcriptase, which the retrotransposon encodes. Transposition and survival of retrotransposons within the host genome are possibly regulated both by retrotransposon- and host-encoded factors, to avoid deleterious effects on host and retrotransposon as well. The understanding of how retrotransposons and their hosts' genomes have co-evolved mechanisms to regulate transposition, insertion specificities, and mutational outcomes in order to optimize each other's survival is still in its infancy.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} role of transposable elements (TEs) {{is still}} highly controversial. Two key parameters, the transposition rate (u and w, for <b>replicative</b> and non-replicative <b>transposition)</b> and the excision rate (e) are fundamental to understanding their evolution and maintenance in populations. We have estimated u, w and e for six families of TEs (including eight members: IS 1, IS 2, IS 3, IS 4, IS 5, IS 30, IS 150 and IS 186) in Escherichia coli, using a mutation accumulation (MA) experiment. In this experiment, mutations accumulate essentially {{at the rate}} at which they appear, during a period of 80 500 (1610 generations × 50 lines) generations, and spontaneous transposition events can be detected. This differs from other experiments in which insertions accumulated under strong selective pressure or over a limited genomic target. We therefore provide new estimates for the spontaneous rates of transposition and excision in E. coli. We observed 25 transposition and three excision events in 50 MA lines, leading to overall rate estimates of u ∼ 1. 15 × 10 (- 5), w ∼ 4 × 10 (- 8) and e ∼ 1. 08 × 10 (- 6) (per element, per generation). Furthermore, extensive variation between elements was found, consistent with previous knowledge of the mechanisms and regulation of transposition for the different elements.

5000|$|Transposase is {{an enzyme}} that binds {{to the end}} of a {{transposon}} and catalyzes the movement of the transposon to another part of the genome by a cut and paste mechanism or a <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> mechanism. The word [...] "transposase" [...] was first coined by the individuals who cloned the enzyme required for transposition of the Tn3 transposon. The existence of transposons was postulated in the late 1940s by Barbara McClintock, who was studying the inheritance of maize, but the actual molecular basis for transposition was described by later groups. McClintock discovered that pieces of the chromosomes changed their position, jumping from one chromosome to another. The repositioning of these transposons (which coded for color) allowed other genes for pigment to be expressed. Transposition in maize causes changes in color; however, in other organisms, such as bacteria, it can cause antibiotic resistance. Transposition is also important in creating genetic diversity within species and adaptability to changing living conditions. During the course of human evolution, as much as 40% of the human genome has moved around via methods such as transposition of transposons.|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} {{insertion sequence}} IS 903 has the unusual ability to transpose both replicatively and non-replicatively.

In order to define the critical steps that determine the outcome of IS 903 transposition, we have isolated mutants that specifically increase the rate of <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition.</b> Here we show that the nucleotide immediately flanking the transposon influences both overall transposition frequency and co-integrate formation.

40|$|Transposons are mobile genetic {{elements}} that move by transposition from one location to another within genomes. The present work {{is focused on}} the characterization of the activities mediated by the transposase protein (TnpA) of the bacterial transposon Tn 4430 belonging to the Tn 3 family. TnpA catalyzes <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> of Tn 4430 and target immunity that prevents multiple insertions of the transposon into the same DNA molecule. Very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that control the transposition and target immunity reactions catalyzed by TnpA of the Tn 3 family. In this study, we have achieved decisive steps toward the understanding of the <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> mechanism by developing in vitro reactions with TnpA reproducing specific steps of the transposition process. Additional observations have also revealed an unexpected link between the mechanism of DNA targeting by Tn 4430 and DNA replication, suggesting a mechanism for recruiting replication machinery during the <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition.</b> This work also provides important findings toward the understanding of target immunity. We first showed that formation of a specific complex between TnpA and the immunizing transposon is necessary to generate immunity. In addition, the biochemical assays revealed that TnpA mutants affected in their immunity function had promiscuous activities when compared to wild type TnpA, suggesting that the activity of the protein is normally tightly regulated. Finally, we were interested in the biological significance of target immunity. We tested the involvement of this process in avoiding intra-molecular <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> leading to deleterious events within the DNA molecule.

Biochemical and structural comparisons together with evolutionary considerations suggest that the Mu transposition machinery might share functional similarities with machineries of the systems that are known to employ a hairpin intermediate during the catalytic steps of transposition. Model transposon end DNA hairpin substrates were used in a minimal-component in vitro system to study their proficiency to promote Mu transpososome assembly and subsequent MuA-catalyzed chemical reactions leading to the strand transfer product. MuA indeed was able to assemble hairpin substrates into a catalytically competent transpososome, open the hairpin ends and accurately join the opened ends to the target DNA. The hairpin opening and transposon end cleavage reactions had identical metal ion preferences, indicating similar conformations within the catalytic center for these reactions. Hairpin length influenced transpososome assembly as well as catalysis: longer loops were more efficient in these respects. In general, MuA's proficiency to utilize different types of hairpin substrates indicates {{a certain degree of}} flexibility within the transposition machinery core.

40|$|ABSTRACT Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), {{which are}} {{resistant}} to most or all known antibiotics, consti-tute a global threat to public health. Transposable elements are often associated with antibiotic resistance determinants, suggest-ing {{a role in the}} emergence of resistance. One insertion sequence, IS 26, is frequently associated with resistance determinants, but its role remains unclear. We have analyzed the genomic contexts of 70 IS 26 copies in several clinical and surveillance CPE iso-lates from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. We used target site duplications and their patterns as guides and found that a large fraction of plasmid reorganizations result from IS 26 replicative transpositions, including replicon fusions, DNA inversions, and deletions. <b>Replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> could also be inferred for transposon Tn 4401, which harbors the car-bapenemase blaKPC gene. Thus, <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition</b> is important in the ongoing reorganization of plasmids carrying multidrug-resistant determinants, an observation that carries substantial clinical and epidemiological implications for under-standing how such extreme drug resistance phenotypes evolve. IMPORTANCE Although IS 26 is frequently reported to reside in resistance plasmids of clinical isolates, the characteristic hall-mark of transposition, target site duplication (TSD), is generally not observed, raising questions about the mode of transposition for IS 26.

To aid us in studying the process of Mu DNA <b>replicative</b> <b>transposition,</b> we developed a technique for synchronizing the first round of replication following induction of a lysogen. Synchronization was achieved by inducing a lysogen in the absence of DNA replication for a time sufficient to develop the potential for Mu DNA replication in all cells in the population; upon release of the inhibition of replication, a synchronized round of Mu DNA replication was observed. Development of the potential for Mu DNA replication in the entire population took approximately 12 min. Protein synthesis was required for development of the potential, but the requirement for protein synthesis was satisfied by approximately 9 min suggesting that other, as yet unspecified, reactions occupied the last 3 min.
