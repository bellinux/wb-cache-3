40|$|Abstract. Through {{the study}} of a linear problem, this paper {{introduces}} some of the ingredients that are {{needed in order to}} conduct efficient nonlinear calculations on composite pipes under thermomechanical loading in the presence of defects. Based on the observation that the main degradation scenarios take place at the extremity of a pipe, a refined model is used to describe this end zone {{while the rest of the}} pipe is described using a beam model. This study focuses on the efficient resolution of the <b>refined</b> <b>end</b> zone. For that, a dedicated Fourier expansion is used. The initial 3 D problem is then transformed in a set of coupled 2 D ones. The questions of the expansion truncation and the resolution of the coupled problem are then tackled. The use of a preconditioned conjugate gradient method allows to treat quasi-industrial problems in a prototype code in Matlab. 1 E. Baranger, O. Allix and L. Blanchard...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} reasons why online {{self-management}} education is attractive to both patients and providers. AsthmaWise, an online self-management program, was developed using a Moodle platform, to enable older adults to learn asthma self-management skills. This study aimed to improve AsthmaWise through conducting: usability testing {{with a sample of}} end users; a cognitive walk-through undertaken by an independent health researcher; and assessment of content readability. A Perceived Health Web Site Usability Questionnaire score of 67 % was achieved, indicating that there were usability issues that needed to be addressed. The cognitive walk-through and readability assessment identified unique issues that were not identified through usability testing with end users. The testing process allowed issues to be identified and rectified before piloting AsthmaWise, creating a more accessible and <b>refined</b> <b>end</b> product.

40|$|As NASA {{looks forward}} to sending humans farther away from Earth, {{we will have to}} develop a {{transportation}} architecture that is highly reliable and that can sustain life for long durations without the benefit of Earth s proximity for continuous resupply or even operational guidance. NASA has consistently been challenged with performing great feats of innovation, but particularly in this time of economic stress, we are challenged to go farther with less. The Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) projects were implemented to address both of these needs by not only developing innovative technologies, but by incorporating innovative management styles and processes that foster the needed technical innovation given a small amount of resources. This presentation explains how the AES Water Recovery Project is exhibiting innovation on both fronts; technical and process. The AES Water Recovery Project (WRP) is actively engineering innovative technologies in order to maximize the efficiency of water recovery. The development of reliable, energy-efficient, and low-mass spacecraft systems to provide environmental control and life support (ECLS) is critical to enable long-duration human missions outside of low-Earth orbit. Recycling of life support consumables is necessary to reduce resupply mass and provide for vehicle autonomy. To address this, the WRP is working on a rotary distiller that has shown enhanced performance over the state-of-the-art (SOA). Additionally, the WRP is looking at innovative ways to address issues present in the state-of-the-art (SOA) systems pertaining to toxicity and calcium scale buildup. As an AES project, the WRP has a more streamlined Skunk Works like approach to technology development intended to reduce overhead but achieve a more <b>refined</b> <b>end</b> product. The project has incorporated key partnerships between NASA centers as well as between NASA and industry. A minimal project management style has been implemented such that risks are managed and milestones tracked without overburdening the team with reporting demands that take them away from their work. A lean Systems Engineering (SE) approach has been implemented where project objectives are defined and vetted early without overprescribing the process or limiting the ability to innovate. Finally, we are working with existing flight hardware support organizations like operations, safety, materials and others to impact the system design at the breadboard level. This type of early input is a key to ensuring that the technologies are developed on the right track to becoming space flight worthy...|$|R

40|$|A new side {{information}} refinement method for transform domain distributed video coding (DVC) is proposed. In DVC, {{side information}} is the frame constructed from key frames which are intra coded.

50|$|The {{instrument}} obtains {{voltage waveform}} and timing information by monitoring {{the interaction of}} laser light with {{the changes in the}} electric field across a p-n junction. As the laser reaches the silicon surface, a certain amount of that light is reflected back. The amount of reflected laser light from the junction is sampled at various points in time. The changing electromagnetic field at the junction affects the amount of laser light that is reflected back. By plotting the variations in reflected laser light versus time, it is possible to construct a timing waveform of the signal at the junction. As the test pattern continues to loop, additional measurements are acquired and averaged into the previous measurements. Over a period of time, this averaging of measurements produces a more <b>refined</b> waveform. The <b>end</b> result is a waveform that is representative of the electrical signal present at the junction.|$|R

40|$|Joint Applied ProjectThe {{purpose of}} this Joint Applied Project is to develop and field a Contracting Officer/Team Leader Handbook. Multiple factors have led to an {{environment}} that is less than optimal for the accomplishment of the acquisition mission. There has been a significant loss of corporate knowledge in the Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (CE LCMC) workforce combined with acceleration in promotions to the GS- 13 level. The experience level of current Contracting Officers is limited due to rapid promotions. In the past few years the organizational culture focused more on cycle time reductions, versus the quality of the work product in order to satisfy the needs of the customer. In addition, since the supervisory role was raised to the GS- 14 level, and GS- 13 's were relieved of supervisory responsibility, there has been increased confusion as {{to the role of the}} team leader. Initial research suggests that Contracting Officers/Team Leaders need another resource to support them in the accomplishment of their varied duties. The C-E LCMC Acquisition Center's strategic plan for the next 12 -month period sets forth a vision of a new business culture - one that defines competency at three different levels. The first level is "Do" a complex task (being able to repeat this task consistently), followed by level two, which is "Understand Why" (being able to take learned knowledge and apply that to solving the next problem and doing the next task; being able to improve execution each time and <b>refine),</b> and <b>ending</b> with level three "Explain the Why" (mastering knowledge and skill so that one can do it again and show someone how to do it and why), which leads others to competency. The plan is to enhance the workforce skill sets, ensure contracting is done right, and focus on leadership development. The objective of this project is to align with this plan and provide a guide that supports Contracting Officers/Team Leaders in three key areas: technical competence, leadership, and customer relations.

Dissertation, UMIST, Manchester, UK, 2002) as the basis to derive the optimum network design. The analytical optimisation method comprises of three steps. Market integration {{is the first step}} that fully exploits the available market opportunities for selling and purchasing streams based on individual marginal contributions from productions and processing of streams. Market integration is an easy and straightforward way of achieving quick benefits. The second step deals with optimisation of network flowsheet/connections. The economic margins of various paths of network are used to determine the weaker paths and the stronger paths where the loads of weaker paths can be shifted. This load shifting among paths leads up to the overall benefits of a system, Finally, the non-profitable or less profitable process units are optimised to improve their individual marginal contributions. Analytical optimisation turns the traditional back box approach into a clear and transparent procedure and is simple to understand and easy to use. The application of analytical optimisation is demonstrated with industrial cases from <b>refining.</b> In the <b>end,</b> a generalised methodology has been illustrated on how to design the optimum flowsheet of a petrochemical complex in a changing market price scenario. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract—The {{dependability}} {{properties of}} a software system are usually assessed and <b>refined</b> towards the <b>end</b> {{of the software}} development lifecycle. Problems pertaining to software dependability may necessitate costly system redesign. Hence, early insights into the potential for error propagation within a software system would be beneficial. Further, the refinement of the dependability properties of software involves the design and location of dependability components called detectors and correctors. Recently, a metric, called spatial impact, has been proposed to capture the extent of error propagation in a software system, providing insights into the location of detectors and correctors. However, the metric only provides insights {{towards the end of}} the software development life cycle. In this paper, our objective is to investigate whether spatial impact can enable the early identification of locations for detectors. To achieve this we first hypothesise that spatial impact is correlated with module coupling, a metric that can be evaluated early in the software development life cycle, and show this relationship to hold. We then evaluate module coupling for the modules of a complex software system, identifying modules with high coupling values as potential locations for detectors. We then enhanced these modules with detectors and perform fault-injection analysis to determine the suitability of these locations. The results presented demonstrate that our approach can permit the early identification of possible detector locations...|$|R
30|$|Sugar {{industry}} is basically seasonal {{in nature and}} operates only for 150 – 210  days in a year (November to May) (Kolhe et al. 2009). A significantly large volume of waste is generated during the manufacture of sugar and contains a high amount of pollution load, particularly in terms of suspended solids, organic matter, and press mud, bagasse and air pollutants. Several chemicals are used in sugar industries mainly for coagulation of impurities and <b>refining</b> of <b>end</b> products. Ca (OH) 2 is used to clarify and to increase pH of juices. A small quantity of H 3 PO 4 is added prior to liming to improve clarification (Kushwaha 2013). CO 2 gas is bubbled through the defected juice to lower pH, which result in the improvement of precipitation of impurities. Polyelectrolytes, which are polymer-based chemical, are also used for coagulation impurities during defection and carbonation process. SO 2 is bubbled through the defected raw sugar to remove colour. Dilute solution of NaOH or Na 2 CO 3 {{is used for the}} periodic descaling of heater followed by neutralizing it with dilute HCl. Lead subacetate is used for the analysis of sugar content. These entire chemicals, one-way or another, are contributing towards increasing the organic strength, dissolved solid and suspended matter (Jadhav et al. 2013). Industrialization is considered the cornerstone of development strategies due to its significant contribution to the economic growth and human welfare. It has become a yardstick for placing countries in the League of Nations and an index of its political stature. Industrialization, like other human activities that impact on the environment, often results in pollution and degradation. Industries turn out wastes which are peculiar in terms of type, volume and frequency {{depending on the type of}} industry and population that uses the product (Adekunle and Eniola 2008).

40|$|The {{difficulty}} of explaining non-local correlations in a fixed causal structure sheds {{new light on}} the old debate on whether space and time are to be seen as fundamental. Refraining from assuming space-time as given a priori has a number of consequences. First, the usual definitions of randomness depend on a causal structure and turn meaningless. So motivated, we propose an intrinsic, physically motivated measure for the randomness of a string of bits: its length minus its normalized work value, a quantity we closely relate to its Kolmogorov complexity (the length of the shortest program making a universal Turing machine output this string). We test this alternative concept of randomness for the example of non-local correlations, and we end up with a reasoning that leads to similar conclusions as in, but is conceptually more direct than, the probabilistic view since only the outcomes of measurements that can actually all be carried out together are put into relation to each other. In the same context-free spirit, we connect the logical reversibility of an evolution to the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time. <b>Refining</b> this, we <b>end</b> up with a speculation on the emergence of a space-time structure on bit strings in terms of data-compressibility relations. Finally, we show that logical consistency, by which we replace the abandoned causality, it strictly weaker a constraint than the latter in the multi-party case.

40|$|Two direct coal liquids were {{evaluated}} by linear programming analysis to determine their value as petroleum refinery feedstock. The first liquid, DL 1, was produced from bitiuminous coal using the Hydrocarbon Technologies, Inc. (HTI) two-stage hydrogenation process in Proof of Concept Run No. 1, POC- 1. The second liquid, DL 2,was produced from sub-bituminous coal using a three-stage HTI process in Proof of Concept Run No. 2, POC- 2; the third stage being a severe hydrogenation process. A linear programming (LP) model was developed which simulates a generic 150, 000 barrel per day refinery in the Midwest U. S. Data from upgrading tests conducted on the coal liquids and related petroleum fractions in the pilot plant testing phase of the <b>Refining</b> and <b>End</b> Use Study was inputed into the model. The coal liquids were compared against a generic petroleum crude feedstock. under two scenarios. In the first scenario, {{it was assumed that}} the refinery capacity and product slate/volumes were fixed. The coal liquids would be used to replace a portion of the generic crude. The LP results showed that the DL 1 material had essentially the same value as the generic crude. Due to its higher quality, the DL 2 material had a value of approximately 0. 60 $/barrel higher than the petroleum crude. In the second scenario, it was assumed that a market opportunity exists to increase production by one-third. This requires a refinery expansion. The feedstock for this scenario could be either 100 % petroleum crude or a combination of petroleum crude and the direct coal liquids. Linear programming analysis showed that the capital cost of the refinery expansion was significantly less when coal liquids are utilized. In addition, the pilot plant testing showed that both of the direct coal liquids demonstrated superior catalytic cracking and naphtha reforming yields. Depending on the coal liquid flow rate, the value of the DL 1 material was 2. 5 - 4. 0 $/barrel greater than the base petroleum crude, while the DL 2 material was 3. 0 - 4. 0 /barrel higher than the crude. Co-processing the coal liquids with lower quality, less expensive petroleum crudes that have higher sulfur, resid and metals contents was also examined.

40|$|We outline a {{strategy}} to select faint (i< 24. 5) type 1 AGN candidates down to the Seyfert/QSO boundary for spectroscopic targeting in the COSMOS field, picking candidates by their nonstellar colors in broadband ground-based photometry and morphological properties extracted from HST-ACS. AGN optical color selection has not been applied to such faint magnitudes in such a large continuous part of the sky. Hot stars {{are known to be}} the dominant contaminant for bright AGN candidate selection at z< 2, but we anticipate the highest color contamination at all redshifts to be from faint starburst and compact galaxies. Morphological selection via the Gini Coefficient separates most potential AGN from these faint blue galaxies. Recent models of the quasar luminosity function are used to estimate quasar surface densities, and studies of stellar populations in the COSMOS field infer stellar contamination. We use 292 spectroscopically confirmed type 1 AGN and quasar templates to predict AGN colors with redshift, and contrast those predictions with the colors of known contaminating populations. The motivation of this study and subsequent spectroscopic follow-up is to populate and <b>refine</b> the faint <b>end</b> of the QLF where the population of type 1 AGN is presently not well known. The anticipated AGN observations will add to the ~ 300 already known AGN in the COSMOS field, making COSMOS a densely packed field of quasars to be used to understand supermassive black holes and probe the structure of the intergalactic medium in the intervening volume.

40|$|This Article {{takes the}} {{opportunity}} of the fortieth anniversary of Katz v. U. S. to assess whether the revolutionary case 2 ̆ 7 s potential to provide broad and flexible privacy protection to individuals has been realized. Answering this question in a circumspect way, the Article pinpoints the language in Katz that was its eventual undoing and demonstrates how the Katz test {{has been plagued by}} two principle problems that have often rendered it more harmful to than protective of privacy. The manipulation problem describes the tendency of conservative courts to define reasonable expectations of privacy as lower than the expectations society actually entertains. The normativity problem captures the idea that the Katz test allows reasonable expectations to be set by those who engage in normatively disfavored privacy defeating conduct. The Article then concentrates on two specific doctrines exemplary of these problems, the third party doctrine and the contraband exception, and discusses their ruinous effects on privacy in a technological era. The third party doctrine, which roughly holds that third party exposure defeats privacy interests, has severely hampered the ability of the Katz test to afford Fourth Amendment protection to intimate online communications. Likewise, the contraband exception, which holds that there is no legitimate expectation of privacy in illegal items, proves exceedingly dangerous to privacy as crime detection technology becomes increasingly <b>refined.</b> In the <b>end,</b> however, this Article does not advocate trashing the Katz test, but rather suggests methods of interpretation that remedy the manipulation and normativity problems...|$|R
40|$|A multivariate {{statistical}} analysis of paper strength and production process data from the SCA Munksund paper mill is presented. The analysis is divided into five parts: (i) paper quality variables, (ii) process variables from the paper machine, (iii) process variables from digester and refiner, (iv) {{a combination of all}} process variables, and (v) a further analysis of the z-strength. Analysing the correlations between the paper strength variables, two groups of variables could be discerned: one group comprising the variables tensile strength in MD, tensile stiffness in MD, elongation in CD, and bursting strength, and another group containing the variables SCT in CD, tensile strength in CD, and tensile stiffness in CD. The strongest correlations between paper machine process variables and paper strength variables were found for the strength variables in the first of the above mentioned groups. The same strength variables were negatively correlated with the wet end process variables conductivity, base line paper machine flow, and the amount of return fibre, while they were positively correlated with the concentration at the base line <b>refiner.</b> Combining wet <b>end</b> and paper machine process variables in a regression analysis for the paper strength variables yields a limited increase in the amount of variance explained, compared with the case where only wet end process variables are used as predictors, due to the correlations between the process variables. A more detailed study of the time series of z-strength measurements showed that this was non-stationary, which makes it hard to fit a single over-all linear regression model which will give good predictions over the whole year -or even from one production run to another...|$|R

Since academic libraries are now competing for the end users attention and interest, the current dispute faced is to deliver prompt, instant, seamless right of entry to resources and information to stay on relevant in the fast growing information technology era. Web OPAC demonstrate as a remote retrieval and function as question-answering, richly interactive information discovery and retrieval system to support decision making, that has no fundamental boundaries on the type and formats of data and information it can find, access, recover, exhibit, and distribute. There are numerous studies conducted to measure Web OPAC end user satisfaction, however the measurement criteria is unstructured and varies depending on the scholars interest. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop Web OPAC end user satisfaction criteria. In order to achieve the objective, this study has explored the criteria used in Library Science and Information System end user satisfaction as recommended by previous researchers. Web OPAC end user satisfaction criteria has been <b>refined</b> which integrated <b>End</b> User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) criteria with Library Science end user satisfaction criteria. The criteria are evaluated by using survey and instrument verification which involved experience end users, senior management and system owner of UTM Library. This study could assist the Information Technology managers, system owners and the library management in determining the satisfactory level of an information system in an academic library. An academic library will be able to identify which criteria to address in order to have an ideal system that could satisfy the end user...|$|R
