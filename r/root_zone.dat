Opuntia ficus-indica is similar to CAM species which are not salt-tolerant in their <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> where growth may cease under high salt concentration. O. ficus-indica grows usually in regions where relative humidity is above 60% and saturation deficit occurs. O. ficus-indica is absent in regions where there is less than 40% humidity {{for more than a}} month. Mean daily temperature required to develop is at least 1.5-2°C. At -10 to -12°C, prickly pear growth is inhibited even if it is exposed to these temperatures only for a few minutes. The maximum temperature limit of prickly pear is above 50°C.|$|E

40|$|Many of the world's {{northern}} peatlands are underlain by rapidly thawing permafrost. Because {{plant production}} in these peatlands is often nitrogen (N) -limited, {{a release of}} N stored in permafrost may stimulate net primary production or change species composition if it is plant-available. In this study, we aimed to quantify plant-available N in thawing permafrost soils of subarctic peatlands. We compared plant-available N-pools and -fluxes in near-surface permafrost (0 - 10 cm below the thawfront) to those taken from a current <b>rooting</b> <b>zone</b> layer (5 - 15 cm depth) across five representative peatlands in subarctic Sweden. A range of complementary methods was used: extractions of inorganic and organic N, inorganic and organic N-release measurements at 0. 5 and 11 °C (over 120 days, relevant to different thaw-development scenarios) and a bioassay with Poa alpina test plants. All extraction methods, across all peatlands, consistently showed up to seven times more plant-available N in near-surface permafrost soil compared to the current <b>rooting</b> <b>zone</b> layer. These results were supported by the bioassay experiment, with an eightfold larger plant N-uptake from permafrost soil than from other N-sources such as current <b>rooting</b> <b>zone</b> soil or fresh litter substrates. Moreover, net mineralization rates were much higher in permafrost soils compared to soils from the current <b>rooting</b> <b>zone</b> layer (273 mg N...|$|R

40|$|Assessing the {{timescales}} of recovery, {{by the use}} {{of dynamic}} models, will be used as input to the policy process to abate acidification. In this study the multilayer dynamic soil chemistry model SAFE was applied to 16 forest sites in Sweden, covering a sulfur deposition gradient of 1. 2 - 11 kg S/ha/yr. Soil samples were collected at all sites and the pH and sulfate concentration dependent isotherm, used for modeling sulfate adsorption in SAFE, was parameterized for every site. A new way of implementing the nutrient uptake distribution in SAFE was developed, which allows the uptake distribution between layers in the <b>rooting</b> <b>zone</b> to vary with time, depending on the availability of base cations in the individual layers. Model output was compared to measurements of base cation concentration, total inorganic Al, pH and Bc/Al both site-by-site and cumulatively for all sites, and the usefulness of these comparisons is discussed from a policy viewpoint. Future projections of recovery show that the overall recovery, expressed as minimum Bc/Al ratio > 1 in the <b>rooting</b> <b>zone,</b> is slow. Assuming full implementation of the UNECE LRTAP Gothenburg Protocol and no further emission reductions thereafter, 44 % of the modeled sites still have a Bc/Al ratio below 1 in 2100 in some soil layer within the <b>rooting</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|R

2500|$|By {{cutting the}} turf the {{regenerative}} {{capacity of the}} soils was exhausted. The regular removal of {{the top layer of}} soil contributed to the spreading of heathland. As heather decomposes, the pH value of the soil falls drastically, as far as the iron buffer-region at pH 3, which initiates the process of podsolisation. Soil life is severely damaged, which results in a hard layer of earth underneath the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> on the heath at a depth of about [...] The iron and humus particles released by the topsoil precipitate onto this impervious hardpan. The subsoil thus separates itself from the topsoil.

2500|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{irrigation}} is necessary to grow any crop at all, in other areas it permits more profitable crops to be grown or enhances crop yield. [...] Various irrigation methods involve different trade-offs between crop yield, water consumption and capital cost of equipment and structures. Irrigation methods such as furrow and overhead sprinkler irrigation are usually less expensive but are also typically less efficient, because much of the water evaporates, runs off or drains below the <b>root</b> <b>zone.</b> [...] Other irrigation methods considered to be more efficient include drip or trickle irrigation, surge irrigation, and some types of sprinkler systems where the sprinklers are operated near ground level. [...] These types of systems, while more expensive, usually offer greater potential to minimize runoff, drainage and evaporation. [...] Any system that is improperly managed can be wasteful, all methods have the potential for high efficiencies under suitable conditions, appropriate irrigation timing and management.
