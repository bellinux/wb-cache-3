40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the fiscally neutral {{transferability}} of profits from land sales according to Â§ 6 b EStG and its possible effect on the price for agricultural land. From {{the point of view}} of the single farm this tax norm has an excellent effect. Nevertheless, from {{the point of view of}} the whole agricultural sector the advantage of this tax norm is rather questionable both with regard to agriculture in special as well as the national economy in general. The rising prices for land due to Â§ 6 b EStG can have a negative effect on highly efficient farming businesses which are willing to expand, but have to finance the expansion soleley with the business earnings. Still, further disadvantages may result from Â§ 6 b EStG. Therefore this paper suggests an alternative way of using the margin of Â§ 6 b EStG, i. e. the introduction of a moderate flat rate taxation to mitigate the negative effects of Â§ 6 b EStG without limiting the positive ones. farmland prices, <b>reserve</b> <b>for</b> <b>reinvestment,</b> analysis of payment willingness, flat tax, Farm Management, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

40|$|Background. Disruption of the {{automaticity}} {{of movement}} execution is commonly experienced {{by people with}} stroke and may result from the person consciously attempting to control the mechanics {{of his or her}} movements. This act of turning one’s attention in toward the mechanics of an action is referred to as “reinvestment. ” Objectives. This study aimed to explore the hypothesis that people with stroke have a greater propensity <b>for</b> <b>reinvestment</b> than the nondisabled population and {{to examine the relationship between}} reinvestment, functional impairment from stroke, and aspects of rehabilitation. Methods. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was used. A total of 148 people with stroke and 148 nondisabled adults completed the Movement Specific Reinvestment Scale. Correlational and multiple regression analyses were con-ducted to examine the relationship between functional impairment and various potential predictors. Results. Compared with controls, people with stroke had a greater propensity <b>for</b> <b>reinvestment.</b> Conscious motor processing and time spent in rehabilitation were significant predictors of functional impairment following stroke. Conclusions. The association between functional impairment, propensity <b>for</b> <b>reinvestment,</b> and time spent in rehabilitation indicates that exclusive reliance on conscious motor processing strategies in the rehabilitation setting may be an impediment to regaining functional independence. There is a need to develop motor learning strategies for rehabilitation that restrain the propensity <b>for</b> <b>reinvestment...</b>|$|R

The assessment method was created to give long-term estimations of the amount overhead lines that could be substituted with underground cables and how to prioritize between different areas. The regulation of power grid companies was reviewed to highlight important factors <b>for</b> profitable <b>reinvestments.</b> The assessment method was implemented for overhead lines in Ellevio´s distribution grid using the database program FME and validated against real reinvestment decisions in a case study area called Sinntorp. The resulting reinvestment proposals mainly consist of replacing older grid sections and sections where expensive maintenance is planned in the future. The script show similar results as real reinvestment decisions but small differences are noticed related to the script’s hard focus on older grid sections. The script has potential to be used on Ellevio´s entire overhead line network but this requires work to complete essential data. Further validation on new areas are also desired to see if results are reasonable and if the script can be developed to consider more reinvestment factors...|$|R
