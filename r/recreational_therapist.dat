5000|$|The film {{is based}} on Alan Aylward's work with {{physically}} disabled children as a <b>recreational</b> <b>therapist</b> at a residential chronic care centre in Toronto from 1974 to 1980. The original script suggested Nick Nolte as Blake (played by Mike Ironside) and John Hurt as Johnnie (played by Brad Dourif). Hurt (who Aylward had worked with on his Documentary Series - The Disability Myth, {{was interested in the}} role of Johnnie) Nolte's agent wanted a few million dollars for a retainer which Aylward couldn't muster in his life. Thus the next choice - Ironside. The film only got made because of Mike Ironside. He was on set with Nick Nolte and Powers Boothe in New Mexico making a film called Extreme Prejudice. Aylward gave the script to Lori Rotenberg, Mike's Toronto agent, who sent it to Ironside to read for the role of Blake. Ironside just finished the script (a prison story) when Nolte emerged from his trailer to announce that he had just secured the rights to produce Weeds, based on the book by the same name, and also [...] "a prison story". Ironside thought it was pure serendipity. If Nolte's gutsy enough to make a prison film, why not Ironside? Mike optioned the script from Aylward in 1987/88 and despite the odds, got it produced in Vancouver and released within two years. A few years later, the British Columbia Corrections Ministry started a program between prisoners and institutionalized handicapped patients based on the fictitious rehabilitation program in Chaindance.|$|E

40|$|Swallowing {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex neuromuscular {{interactions}} in the human body. Swallowing problems (dysphagia) may be classified as oropharyngeal or esophageal. Oropharyngeal dysphagia refers to difficulty in the passage of foods and liquids from the mouth to the esophagus. In esophageal dysphagia, there is a disordered passage of food or liquids through the esophagus. The exact incidence of dysphagia is unknown; however, in some epidemiological studies the prevalence is as high as 22 % in the population over age 50 and as high as 41 % of individuals admitted to the acute rehabilitation setting. The speech-language pathologist is the interdisciplinary team member responsible for the assessment of dysphagia and the development of the treatment plan. Interventions include diet modification, compensatory strategies and multiple-modality treatments. Often, when a patient is identified as aspirating “thin” or “regular” liquids, they are subjected to a modified oral diet which includes the use of thickened liquids to compensate for the physiologic deficits resulting in dysphagia. The compliance rate with use of these thickened liquids is often poor. For these patients, dehydration and non-compliance are concerns realized by the entire interdisciplinary team. The Free Water Program is an evidence-based initiative that was developed via collaboration of the Clinical Nurse Specialist, Nurse Practitioner, Medical Director, Speech-Language Pathologists, Staff Nurses, and Physical and Occupational Therapists on the Comprehensive Acute Rehabilitation Unit at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. This poster will focus on the challenges associated with restricting a patient’s oral diet and how, using an evidence-based program, the interdisciplinary team can collaborate to determine the readiness and safety of an individual to participate in the program. Specific aspects of the program will be highlighted: rationale for allowing “free water,” criteria for patient participation, need for supervision vs. independence, role of each interdisciplinary team member in successful execution of the components of the program including the following team members: physician, nurse practitioner, nursing, nursing assistants, speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, <b>recreational</b> <b>therapist,</b> etc. Learning Objectives: At the end of this session, participants will: 1. Discuss the rationale for allowing patients with dysphagia, and possible known aspiration risk with “thin” or “regular” liquids, access to free water. 2. Discuss the evidence base available to support use of a free water program with dysphagic patients. 3. Identify the criteria for patients being assigned to a Supervised vs. Independent Free Water Program as established on the Comprehensive Acute Rehabilitation Unit atThomasJeffersonUniversityHospital. 4.

Scores for these six therapist groups were examined on three variables generally considered {{to be associated with the}} development of expertise — motivation, openness to experience (as defined by the critical-thinking dispositions of truth-seeking, open-mindedness, and cognitive maturity), and features of their clinical caseload experience (i. e. breadth of experience as measured by number of different client age groups worked with, the complexity of clients 2 ̆ 7 needs, and experience in delivering services to adolescents, school-age children, preschoolers, and infants). Results: Low-experience experts (2 ̆ 7 young stars 2 ̆ 7) had the highest motivation, truth-seeking, and open-mindedness scores of all groups, the highest percentage of clients with complex service needs, and were more likely to work with adolescents. Conclusions: The major differences between therapists who attain expertise quickly versus those who remain novices after many years of experience appear to be motivation and complexity of work experiences.
