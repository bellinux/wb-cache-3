25|$|An {{example of}} a control system is a car's cruise control, which is a device {{designed}} to maintain vehicle speed at a constant desired or <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> provided by the driver. The controller is the cruise control, the plant is the car, and the system is {{the car and the}} cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's throttle position which determines how much power the engine delivers.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{closed-loop}} control system, {{data from a}} sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, {{the difference between the}} input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed. [...] The central idea of these control systems is the feedback loop, the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>speed</b> <b>reference</b> as {{percentage}} of actual speed {{is set in}} this mode. As the generator is loaded from no load to full load, the actual speed of the prime mover tends to decrease. In order to increase the power output in this mode, the prime mover <b>speed</b> <b>reference</b> is increased. Because the actual prime mover speed is fixed by the grid, this difference in <b>speed</b> <b>reference</b> and actual <b>speed</b> of the prime mover is used to increase the flow of working fluid (fuel, steam, etc.) to the prime mover, and hence power output is increased. The reverse will be true for decreasing power output. The prime mover <b>speed</b> <b>reference</b> is always greater than actual speed of the prime mover.

5000|$|The {{reason for}} abandoning the {{approach}} is unknown. Since the meteorological conditions were close to the minimum permitted for an IFR approach, the aircraft would need to approach close to the ECHO 1 approach trajectory. On the aircraft's improper approach, the investigation noted {{that there was a}} low probability that the aircraft could have stabilized its approach in order to land safely. With a wet runway and if the aircraft crossed the threshold at the <b>reference</b> <b>speed,</b> the aircraft would have a 385 m safety margin to land on the wet runway. There was a 2 kn tailwind {{at the time of the}} attempted landing. Additionally, a non-directional radio beacon (NDB) just before the runway (RR NBD) was non-functional on the day of the accident. Because the aircraft did not follow the ECHO 1 approach, it did not pass the only NBD available for determining the missed approach point, which was SAT NBD. The report concluded that [...] "the fact that the crew did not follow the profile of the ECHO 1 approach, along with their difficulty stabilizing the aircraft on a final approach, and the tail wind component condition may have contributed to their decision to discontinue the approach." ...|$|E

At 07:36, following a descent to 12,000 feet, the flight crew contacted Casper approach control and advised that the flight was about 12 {{miles south of the}} Evansville Intersection. At that time, the controller cleared the flight to use the localizer back course approach for runway 25, to circle to runway 3, or to land straight in. The weather reported to the crew indicated poor visibility with light snow falling and wind 040deg at 9 knots. One minute later, the approach controller advised that [...] "runway 7/25 has been plowed. There's about a 1/4-inch of powder snow on it. Braking action reported, Convair 580, as poor.

The tower controller cleared the flight to land on runway 25 and gave the wind as 030deg at 8 knots. The flight was also advised by the controller that a disabled snow blower was [...] "just west of the intersection runway 21, left side runway 25, on the edge ...."

30|$|This paper {{addresses}} a <b>reference</b> gait <b>speed</b> generator for limit-cycle-based bipedal gait of humanoid robots {{in order to}} achieve secure and efficient acceleration and deceleration without falling down at respective gait <b>speeds.</b> The <b>reference</b> gait <b>speed</b> generator is hard to be developed by analytical approaches due to the necessity of barren work for identifying the respective basins of attraction. We challenge this issue by designing virtual dynamics among a robot, a virtual leader point, and a goal, and adapting it according to a falling risk of the robot. The virtual dynamics, which has settling and acceleration times as design parameters, gives the <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> derived from states of the robot and the leader point to a gait speeds controller. In the dynamics, the robot’s mass is optimized virtually to maximize efficiency while ensuring stability stochastically by using a selection algorithm for locomotion. Even when there were obstacles or an up slope in traveling courses of simulations, the robot achieved the autonomous traveling from the start to the goal securely. Specific resistance was also kept small in comparison with local-stability-based walking. The proposed method makes the limit-cycle-based bipedal gait more practical and contributes toward replacing the major method that ensures stability of every step.|$|R
