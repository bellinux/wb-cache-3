30|$|The {{effect of}} varying the {{distance}} between the active emitting region and metallic NPs on the overall device efficiency enhancement also reveals that the larger local field plays an important <b>role.</b> <b>Coupling</b> and enhancing vanish as the distance is increased above a certain threshold, and the distance cannot be too small or too large. If it is too small, the non-radiative quenching process dominates and most of the energy is dissipated accordingly. On the contrary, if the distance is too large, the coupling effect vanishes since only the electron/hole pairs near the metallic NPs can effectively couple to increase the IQE. Fujiki et al. [34] have introduced a copper phthalocyanine hole transport layer in their LED structure as a spacer to avoid non-radiative quenching. In order to retain the effect, a 20 -nm-thick film is used and smaller enhancement is observed if the thickness is larger. The experiment provides direct evidence of the role played by the higher local electric field in the IQE enhancement effect.|$|E
40|$|Over the years, {{there has}} been much {{interest}} in modelling processes. Processes include those associated with the development of software and those business processes that make use of software systems. Recent research in Systems Engineering for Business Process Change 1 highlights the importance of modelling business processes in order to evolve and maintain the legacy systems that support those processes. Business processes are typically described with static (diagrammatic) models. This paper illustrates how quantitative techniques can facilitate analysis of such models. This is illustrated with reference to the process modelling notation Role Activity Diagrams (RADs). An example process, taken from an investigation of the bidding process of a large telecommunications systems supplier, is used to show how a quantitative approach can be used to highlight features in RADs that are useful to the process modeller. We show how simple measures reveal high levels of <b>role</b> <b>coupling</b> and discrepancies between different perspectives. Since the models are non-trivial — there are 101 roles and almost 300 activities — we argue that quantitative analysis can be a useful adjunct for the modeller...|$|E
40|$|Integrin {{regulation}} of neutrophils {{is essential for}} appropriate adhesion and transmigration into tissues. Vav proteins are Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factors that become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to adhesion. Using Vav 1 /Vav 3 -deficient neutrophils (Vav 1 / 3 ko), we show that Vav proteins are required for multiple β 2 integrin-dependent functions, including sustained adhesion, spreading, and complement-mediated phagocytosis. These defects are not attributable {{to a lack of}} initial β 2 activation as Vav 1 / 3 ko neutrophils undergo chemoattractant-induced arrest on intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 under flow. Accordingly, in vivo, Vav 1 / 3 ko leukocytes arrest on venular endothelium yet are unable to sustain adherence. Thus, Vav proteins are specifically required for stable adhesion. β 2 -induced activation of Cdc 42, Rac 1, and RhoA is defective in Vav 1 / 3 ko neutrophils, and phosphorylation of Pyk 2, paxillin, and Akt is also significantly reduced. In contrast, Vav proteins are largely dispensable for G protein-coupled receptor–induced signaling events and chemotaxis. Thus, Vav proteins play an essential <b>role</b> <b>coupling</b> β 2 to Rho GTPases and regulating multiple integrin-induced events important in leukocyte adhesion and phagocytosis...|$|E

40|$|Resonant Raman {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} tool for providing information about excitons and exciton–phonon coupling in two-dimensional materials. We present here resonant Raman experiments of single-layered WS 2 and WSe 2 using more than 25 laser lines. The Raman excitation profiles of both materials show unexpected differences. All Raman features of WS 2 monolayers are enhanced by the first-optical excitations (with an asymmetric response for the spin–orbit related XA and XB excitons), whereas Raman bands of WSe 2 are not enhanced at XA/B energies. Such an intriguing phenomenon is addressed by DFT calculations and by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. These two materials are very similar. They prefer the same crystal arrangement, and their electronic structure is akin, with comparable spin–orbit coupling. However, we reveal that WS 2 and WSe 2 exhibit quite different exciton–phonon interactions. In this sense, we demonstrate that the interaction between XC and XA excitons with phonons explains the different Raman responses of WS 2 and WSe 2, and the absence of Raman enhancement for the WSe 2 modes at XA/B energies. These results reveal unusual exciton–phonon interactions and open new avenues for understanding the two-dimensional materials physics, where weak interactions play a key <b>role</b> <b>coupling</b> different degrees of freedom (spin, optic, and electronic) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{realization}} of long and aligned molecular wires {{is a great}} challenge and different approaches have been proposed. Interestingly, hexapentyloxytriphenylene (HAT 5) discotic liquid crystal molecules, model system of molecules with flat and aromatic cores, can spontaneously form well aligned, micrometer long yet only tens of nanometers thick nanowires on solid surfaces. We have investigated the formation mechanism of these wires by using different solvents with selected characteristics like chemical structure, boiling point, vapor pressure and surface tension. When casting from toluene and benzene solutions, atomic force microscopy reveals that the discotics spontaneously form very long and thin wires, self-aligning along a common orientation. If instead dodecane or heptane are used, different and in general thicker structures are obtained. The chemical structure of the solvent {{appears to have a}} key <b>role,</b> <b>coupling</b> to the liquid crystal self-assembly by allowing solvent molecules to enter in the ordered structure if their design matches the core of HAT 5 molecules, thereby guiding the assembly. However, also other aspects are relevant in the assembly, like the nature of the substrate or the rate of solvent evaporation, and these can favor or interfere with the self-assembly into long structures. The use of solvents with aromatic structure is advantageous not only because it affects the geometry of the assembly, promoting long wire formation, but it is also compatible with good quality of the intermolecular order, as suggested by a high anisotropy of the Raman spectra of the nanowires formed from these solvents. Finally, the electrical properties of ordered systems show a clearly higher electrical conductivity compared to the disorganized aggregates...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{coupling}} via gap junctions is {{an abundant}} {{phenomenon in the}} mammalian retina and occurs in all major cell types. Gap junction channels are assembled from different connexin subunits, and the connexin composition of the channel confers specific properties to the electrical synapse. In the mouse retina, gap junctions were demonstrated between intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells but the underlying connexin remained undetermined. In the primary rod pathway, gap junctions play a crucial <b>role,</b> <b>coupling</b> AII amacrine cells among {{each other and to}} ON cone bipolar cells. Although it has long been known that connexin 36 and connexin 45 are necessary for the proper functioning of this most sensitive rod pathway, differences between homocellular AII/AII gap junctions and AII/ON bipolar cell gap junctions suggested the presence of an additional connexin in AII amacrine cells. Here, we used a connexin 30. 2 -lacZ mouse line to study the expression of connexin 30. 2 in the retina. We show that connexin 30. 2 is expressed in intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells and AII amacrine cells. Moreover, we tested whether connexin 30. 2 and connexin 36 – both expressed in AII amacrine cells – are able to interact with each other and are deposited in the same gap junctional plaques. Using newly generated anti-connexin 30. 2 antibodies, we show in HeLa cells that both connexins are indeed able to interact and may form heteromeric channels: both connexins were co-immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected HeLa cells and connexin 30. 2 gap junction plaques became significantly larger when co-expressed with connexin 36. These data suggest that connexin 36 is able to form heteromeric gap junctions with another connexin. We hypothesize that co-expression of connexin 30. 2 and connexin 36 may endow AII amacrine cells with the means to differentially regulate its electrical coupling to different synaptic partners...|$|E
