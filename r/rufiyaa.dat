The issuance of {{the currency}} {{is controlled by the}} Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA). The most commonly used symbols for the <b>rufiyaa</b> are MRF and Rf. The ISO 4217 code for Maldivian <b>rufiyaa</b> is MVR. The <b>rufiyaa</b> is subdivided into 100 laari.|$|E
50|$|The current {{series of}} {{banknotes}} was issued in 1983 in denominations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 <b>rufiyaa.</b> 500 <b>rufiyaa</b> notes were added in 1990, with the 2 <b>rufiyaa</b> {{replaced by a}} coin in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "rufiyaa" [...] {{is derived}} from the Sanskrit rupya (wrought silver). The {{midpoint}} of exchange rate is 12.85 <b>rufiyaa</b> per US dollar and the rate is permitted to fluctuate within a ±20% band, i.e. between 10.28 <b>rufiyaa</b> and 15.42 <b>rufiyaa</b> as of 10 April 2011.|$|E
5000|$|The newly {{established}} central bank, the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), introduced the 1 <b>rufiyaa</b> coin on 22 January 1983. The coin {{was made from}} steel clad copper nickel [...] and was minted in West Germany. In 1984, {{a new series of}} coins was introduced which did not include the 2 laari denomination. In 1995, 2 <b>rufiyaa</b> coins were introduced. Coins currently in circulation are 1 laari, 2 laari, 5 laari, 10 laari, 25 laari, 50 laari, 1 <b>rufiyaa,</b> 2 <b>rufiyaa.</b>|$|E
50|$|The laari is a coin {{denomination}} {{issued by}} the Maldives as the subdenomination of the Maldivian <b>rufiyaa</b> since 1960. One <b>rufiyaa</b> is equal to 100 laari. It was issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50.|$|E
50|$|The first coin to {{be issued}} after {{the return of the}} Maldive Islands' return to the Commonwealth was the 1 <b>rufiyaa</b> coin dated 1402 AH (1982). This coin has the Coat-of-Arms on the obverse with the dates. The reverse of the coin is inscribed 'REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES 1 RUFIYAA'. A series of minor coins {{denominated}} from 1 laari to 50 laari was released into circulation in 1404 AH (1984). Since then, a number of commemorative coins have been struck, including a series of 250 <b>rufiyaa</b> medal-coins (listed in the 2005 edition of Krause Unusual World Coins catalogue). In 1416 AH, the 2 <b>rufiyaa</b> coin was released into circulation to replace the 2 <b>rufiyaa</b> banknote.|$|E
5000|$|In 1945, the People's Majlis (Parliament) passed bill number 2/66 on the [...] "Maldivian Bank Note". Under this law, {{notes for}} , 1, 2, 5 and 10 <b>rufiyaa</b> were printed {{and put into}} {{circulation}} on 5 September 1948. In 1951, 50 and 100 <b>rufiyaa</b> notes were introduced.|$|E
5000|$|The Maldives Authority Monetary {{introduced}} a new family of banknotes printed on De La Rue's [...] "Safeguard" [...] polymer substrate. A commemorative 5,000 <b>Rufiyaa</b> banknote was issued in July 2015, and followed by the 10-, 20-, 50-, 100-, 500 and a new denomination, 1,000 <b>Rufiyaa</b> in October 2015.|$|E
50|$|In October 2015, the Maldives Monetary Authority {{issued a}} 5,000 <b>rufiyaa</b> {{banknote}} in polymer {{to commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of independence, and issued a new family of notes in polymer that included a new denomination of 1,000 <b>rufiyaa.</b> A 5 <b>rufiyaa</b> banknote printed in polymer was revealed in May 2017 and will be issued in July 2017. It was originally planned that this denomination was {{to be replaced by}} a coin of the same denomination, but public input convinced the Maldives Monetary Authority to go for the note.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the end of}} coin {{production}} {{specifically for}} the Maldives, the Sultanate came to use the Ceylonese rupee. This was supplemented in 1947 by issues of banknotes denominated in <b>rufiyaa,</b> equal in value to the rupee. In 1960, coins denominated in laari, now worth one hundredth of the <b>rufiyaa,</b> were introduced.|$|E
50|$|The coins of the Maldivian <b>rufiyaa</b> are {{documented}} since {{it became a}} British protectorate in 1304 AH (1887).|$|E
50|$|For {{purchasing}} power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 12.85 <b>rufiyaa</b> only. Mean wages were $4.15 per man-hour in 2009.|$|E

50|$|The Maldivian unit of {{currency}} is the <b>rufiyaa</b> (ISO 4217 code MVR, symbol Rf.), introduced in 1947. The <b>rufiyaa</b> {{is divided into}} 100 laari. On 1 February 2009, the exchange rate with the US dollar was USD1.00 = MVR12.80. On 10 April 2011, the Government announced a limited float of the currency within a band of 20% from the previous exchange rate of 12.80. Due to short supply of US Dollars, the official rate quoted by all banks as on 10 May stands as follows: Buy Rate USD 1.00 = MVR 14.42; Sell Rate USD 1.00 = MVR 15.42.|$|E
50|$|The first coins to {{be issued}} by the Maldive Islands in the period outside the Commonwealth (1965-82) was the issue of 1389 AH (1970). In this period, the first coins {{denominated}} in <b>rufiyaa</b> were struck. Only in the late 1970s do the dates on Maldivian coins begin to correspond exactly (e.g. the 1399 AH (1979) and 1400 AH (1980) silver 100 <b>rufiyaa</b> commemorative coins.). The 1389 AH coins are of the same design as the 1960 coins, but all references to the Sultanate were replaced with references to the Republic. Only in the late 1970s did English first appear on Maldivian coins.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} of President Mohamed Nasheed faced many challenges, including the huge debt {{left by the}} previous government, the economic downturn following the 2004 tsunami, overspending (by means of overprinting of local currency <b>rufiyaa)</b> during his regime, unemployment, corruption, and increasing drug use.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, the Nasheed {{administration}} appointed IFC to run {{a bidding}} process for the privatisation of the airport. The bid was won by a consortium between GMR Group and Malaysia Airports who provided <b>Rufiyaa</b> 1 Billion as upfront fee to {{the government for the}} expansion and modernisation of the airport by 2014, and its operation for 25 years.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the exposed}} {{nature of the}} archaeological site, {{and the fact that}} the {{structures}} were of coral stone, the site soon started showing signs of weathering and erosion. And on the 6th of October 2008, US ambassador Robert O. Blake Jr. handed over the a grant of 370,000 <b>Rufiyaa</b> ($28,950) under the Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation, with the aim of helping the conservation efforts.|$|E
50|$|In May 1964 the {{government}} and the people of Malé worked together to construct a new asphalt runway. The four districts of Malé competed for the prize money of 1,000 <b>rufiyaa,</b> awarded to the fastest district. On the first day 108 volunteers were enlisted for the project and 1,563.08 rufiya was donated. The new runway was opened on 12 April 1966 at 16:00 by President Ibrahim Nasir.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{the first}} {{leader of the}} party, former {{president}} Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom removed himself from the party amid contentious conflicts of interest within the party and political competitiveness. He formed a new political party called Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM). It was a point where DRP had a huge debt following the defeat in the 2008 Presidential Elections with Ahmed Thasmeen Ali as the running mate of Gayyoom. Once Gayyoom left, the party was led by Ahmed Thasmeen Ali who {{had to face the}} inherited debt of 32 Million <b>Rufiyaa.</b> This was the biggest challenge for him {{as the leader of the}} party. Following the defeat in the first round of Presidential Elections 2013, Thasmeen Ali being the running mate of former president Dr Waheed, DRP decided to support MDP in the second round of the elections, disappointing a lot of members of the party. MDP was defeated in the second round by PPM. Ahmed Thasmeen Ali then decided to join MDP, leaving DRP in the hands of the current leader Mohamed Nasheed (Colonel), who courageously took up the place of duty, when two leaders on two occasions, had left the party to perish. Taking up the leadership, Mohamed Nasheed promised reform and recovery in many aspects of the party. He had stated that the party was in ICU at the moment, as audited and unaudited debt of the party would round up to a figure as big as 10 Million <b>Rufiyaa.</b>|$|E
50|$|Today Thilafushi has a landmass of {{more than}} 4.6 million ft2 (0.43 km²). The speedy {{terrestrial}} growth of Thilafushi was observed by the Government, and in November 1997, {{it was decided that}} land was to be leased to entrepreneurs interested in acquiring land for industrial purposes. Initially there were just 22 lease holders. Within the past 10 years, this number has doubled to 54 resulting in more than 1.2 million square feet (0.11 km² or 27.5 acres) of land being used currently, which generates an excess of 14 million <b>Rufiyaa</b> (about USD1,000,000.00) per annum. Soon after, an area of 0.2 km² (known as Thilafushi-2) was reclaimed using white sand as the filling material to provide terra firma for the more heavy industries.|$|E
50|$|During {{the later}} part of Gayoom's rule, {{independent}} political movements emerged in Maldives, which challenged the then-ruling Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (Maldivian People's Party, MPP) and demanded democratic reform. The dissident journalist and activist Mohamed Nasheed founded the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) in 2003 and pressured Gayoom into allowing gradual political reforms. In 2008 {{a new constitution}} was approved and the first direct presidential elections occurred, which were won by Mohamed Nasheed in the second round. His administration faced many challenges, including the huge debt left by the previous government, the economic downturn following the 2004 tsunami, overspending (by means of overprinting of local currency <b>rufiyaa),</b> unemployment, corruption, and increasing drug use. Taxation on goods was imposed {{for the first time}} in the country, and import duties were reduced in many goods and services. Social welfare benefits were given to those aged 65 years or older, single parents, and those with special needs.|$|E
50|$|Among his {{achievement}} as a Parliamentarian, Mahloof counts {{his efforts}} to conclude {{the construction of the}} Al-Furqan Mosque in his neighborhood. Throughout four successive presidencies, Mahloof lobbied both in the media and through consultations at the highest levels to speedily conclude the new Mosque, which the residents of Galolhu count as a major priority. He repeatedly raised the issue at parliamentary question times for Cabinet Ministers, and two of his five questions were answered by the then Minister of Islamic Affairs, Dr. Abdul Majeed Abdul Bari. He also lobbied for the mosque project at successive budgetary debates in the Majlis.The very first Decree passed by the 17th Session of the People's Majlis was that on the welfare of residents in public flats Sinamalé and Malé Hiyaa, both of which fall into Mahloof's constituency. He proposed the Decree.Mahloof is also credited with lobbying for an urgent solution to a health concern in his constituency in 2012. The garbage disposal site in Galolhu was situated in close proximity to a primary school, and Mahloof repeatedly met with and impressed upon senior officials of the President Dr. Waheed administration to clear the site and relocate elsewhere.Mahloof also joined debates in the Majlis on resolving the concern of youth gang violence and other criminal matters.A highlight of Mahloof's first term in the Majlis was his decision to forego a controversial Maldivian <b>rufiyaa</b> 20,000 Committee Allowance package remuneration for Parliamentarians. He proposed two decrees on the matter. Both attempts failed. He was then obliged to unilaterally refuse the payment. He was also noted for being among the MPs who did not vote in favour for additional privileges for Parliamentarians.Mahloof's leadership roles in peaceful protests on pertinent issues of concern led him being arrested no less than 17 times.|$|E

40|$|The Maldives has {{maintained}} an {{exchange rate policy}} since 1994 that pegs the Maldivian currency, the <b>rufiyaa,</b> to the United States (US) dollar. In small and open economies like the Maldives, the role of exchange rate is even more crucial as changes in exchange rates have a quick and {{a direct impact on}} the economic activities and the cost of living in the country. Yet no empirical studies exist on the exchange rate regime of the Maldives. Further, the Maldives lacks the basic tools to analyse the exchange rate of the country; for example, information on the real exchange rates (RERs) and effective exchange rates (EERs). Therefore, this study aims to develop a set of key indicators for exchange rate analysis; examine the main issues related to the exchange rate; and evaluate the appropriateness of the current exchange rate regime of the Maldives. It provides policy makers for the first time estimates of the main indicators of the exchange rate for the Maldives. Since the basic indicators of exchange rate analysis do not exist for the Maldives, this study constructs indices for the nominal effective exchange rates (NEER), real effective exchange rate (REER) and the terms of trade (TOT). These indices facilitate the empirical analyses undertaken in this study. They would also be useful for the policy makers of the Maldives, to monitor the behaviour of the exchange rate in the country. To evaluate the performance and the appropriateness of the exchange rate peg in the Maldives, three specific issues related to the exchange rate are examined. They are: (i) equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) and exchange rate misalignments; (ii) inflation dynamics and exchange rate passthrough (ERPT); and (iii) partial dollarization in the Maldives. The econometric techniques of cointegration and error-correction modelling (ECM) were employed to analyse these issues. The period of analysis was 1990 – 2010 and monthly data was used. The estimation of the RER misalignments showed that the Maldives has experienced varying levels of misalignments over the last two decades, and the RER has been substantially misaligned for a little over one-third of the period under analysis. The analysis of inflation demonstrated the importance of foreign prices, nominal exchange rates (NER) and monetary growth in explaining inflation in the Maldives. The ERPT in the Maldives was estimated to be very high and rapid, as expected, given the small and open economy. With regards to the partial dollarization in the Maldives, the economy remains highly dollarized even by international standards. However, unlike most other countries in which dollarization has been an outcome of macroeconomic instability, in the Maldives, dollarization is driven both institutional factors and the rapid development of the tourism sector. The high dollarization ratios also contribute towards the high ERPT estimated for the Maldives. The current exchange rate regime of the Maldives was assessed based on the empirical results from these three issues and the other determinants of exchange rate regime. The results from the quantitative framework and the exchange rate analysis of the issues examined in this study provided a compelling case for a pegged exchange rate regime for the Maldives. This study also assessed the option of adopting official dollarization as an alternative exchange rate regime for the Maldives. This was found not to be a viable option for the Maldives currently. The present study provides {{for the first time a}} comprehensive investigation of the exchange rate regime in the Maldives and would be a useful resource for policy makers in managing the country’s exchange rate policy...|$|E
