2500|$|Sometime in February 1692, likely {{after the}} afflictions began but before {{specific}} names were mentioned, {{a neighbor of}} Rev.

The cake, made from <b>rye</b> <b>meal</b> and urine from the afflicted girls, was fed to a dog. According to English folk understanding of how witches accomplished affliction when the dog ate the cake, the witch herself would be hurt.

This superstition was based on the Cartesian [...] "Doctrine of Effluvia", which posited that witches afflicted others by the use of [...] "venomous and malignant particles, that were ejected from the eye", according to the October 8, 1692 letter of Thomas Brattle, a contemporary critic of the trials.|$|E

Different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains belonging to similar species have different properties and so effects/benefits can be different from one strain to another within the same species (Fukushima et al., 2011). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of Lactobacillus sakei multiplied in extruded rye substrate on dairy cows rumen fluid parameters, milk yield and milk composition. Extruded rye wholemeal (moisture content 8. 6 %) produced by a single-screw extruder (Ustukiu malunas Ltd, Lithuania) was used as the fermentation medium for LAB multiplication.

The {{weight average molecular weight}} (Mw) of extractable carbohydrates in β-glucan concentrate decreased eight-fold after inclusion in the BG bread when exposed to in vitro digestion, while the Mw of purified extractable carbohydrates in AX bread was reduced two-fold, and remained almost unaffected until reaching the terminal ileum of pigs. Similarly, the Mw of purified extractable carbohydrates in GR and RK bread was not significantly changed in the ileum. The AX bread resulted in the highest concentration of dissolved arabinoxylan in the ileum among all the breads that caused a substantial increased in ileal AX viscosity. Nevertheless, for none of the breads, the Mw of extractable carbohydrates was related neither to the bread extract nor ileal viscosity...|$|R

Although {{it is not known}} whether this and other early references refer to precisely the bread that {{came to be known as}} Pumpernickel, Westphalian pumpernickel is distinguished by use of coarse <b>rye</b> <b>meal</b> and a very long baking period, which gives the bread its characteristic dark color.

40|$|Abstract Background Favorable {{dietary habits}} promote health, whereas {{unfavorable}} habits link to various chronic diseases. An individual's " sense of coherence" (SOC) {{is reported to}} correlate with prevalence of some diseases to which dietary habits are linked. However, understanding what determines an individual's dietary preferences and how to change his/her behavior remains limited. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate associations between dietary intake and SOC in adults. Methods Diet intake was recorded by an 84 -item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and SOC was measured by the 13 -item Antonovsky questionnaire in 2, 446 men and 2, 545 women (25 – 74 years old) from the population based northern Sweden MONICA screening in 1999. Results Intakes of energy, total and saturated fat, ascorbic acid, sucrose, and servings of fruits, vegetables, cereals, and sweets correlated with SOC among women, whereas intakes of total and saturated fat, ascorbic acid, fiber, and alcohol, and servings of fruits, vegetables, bread, bread and cereals, fish, and potatoes correlated with SOC among men. With a few exceptions, intakes of these nutrients/foods were significantly explained by SOC quartile scores in linear GLM models. Both women and men classified into the highest SOC quartile had significantly higher age-BMI-education standardized mean intakes of vegetables than those in the lowest quartiles. Women in the highest SOC quartile also had higher intake of fruits but lower intakes of energy, total and saturated fat, sucrose, and sweets. Projection to latent structures (PLS) multivariate modeling of intakes of the 84 food items and food aggregates simultaneously on SOC scores supported low SOC to coincide with a presumably less health promoting dietary preference, e. g. intake of pizza, soft drinks, candies, sausages for main course, hamburgers, mashed potato, chips and other snacks, potato salad, French fries, whereas men and women with high SOC scores were characterized by e. g. high intake of <b>rye</b> crisp whole <b>meal</b> bread, boiled potato, vegetables, berries, and fruits. Conclusion Both men and women in the highest, as compared with the lowest, SOC score quartile reported more "healthy" food choices. Dietary habits for individuals in the lowest SOC quartile therefore may render a higher risk for various endemic diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Several studies {{report that}} dietary fibre from {{different}} sources promotes {{the feeling of}} satiety and suppresses hunger. However, results for cereal fibre from rye are essentially lacking. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate subjective appetite during 8 h after intake of iso-caloric rye bread breakfasts varying in rye dietary fibre composition and content. Methods The study was divided into two parts. The first part (n = 16) compared the satiating effect of iso-caloric bread breakfasts including different milling fractions of rye (bran, intermediate fraction (B 4) and sifted flour). The second part (n = 16) investigated the dose-response effect of rye bran and intermediate rye fraction, each providing 5 or 8 g of dietary fibre per iso-caloric bread breakfast. Both study parts used a wheat bread breakfast as reference and a randomised, within-subject comparison design. Appetite (hunger, satiety and desire to eat) was rated regularly from just before breakfast at 08 : 00 until 16 : 00. Amount, type and timing of food and drink intake were standardised during the study period. Results The Milling fractions study showed that each of the rye breakfasts resulted in a suppressed appetite during the time period before lunch (08 : 30  12 : 00) compared with the wheat reference bread breakfast. At a comparison between the rye bread breakfasts the one with rye bran induced the strongest effect on satiety. In the afternoon the effect from all three rye bread breakfasts could still be seen as a decreased hunger and desire to eat compared to the wheat reference bread breakfast. In the Dose-response study both levels of rye bran and the lower level of intermediate rye fraction resulted in an increased satiety before lunch compared with the wheat reference bread breakfast. Neither the variation in composition between the milling fractions nor the different doses resulted in significant differences in any of the appetite ratings when compared with one another. Conclusion The results show that rye bread can be used to decrease hunger feelings both before and after lunch when included in a breakfast <b>meal.</b> <b>Rye</b> bran induces a stronger effect on satiety than the other two rye fractions used when served in iso-caloric portions.

6000|$|The north {{wind had}} already begun to cool the pond, though it took many weeks of steady blowing to {{accomplish}} it, it is so deep. When I began to have a fire at evening, before I plastered my house, the chimney carried smoke particularly well, because of the numerous chinks between the boards. Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and rafters with the bark on high overhead. My house never pleased my eye so much after it was plastered, though I was obliged to confess that it was more comfortable. Should not every apartment in which man dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity overhead, where flickering shadows may play at evening about the rafters? These forms are more agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most expensive furniture. I now first began to inhabit my house, I may say, when I began to use it for warmth as well as shelter. I had got a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth, and it did me good to see the soot form {{on the back of the}} chimney which I had built, and I poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than usual. My dwelling was small, and I could hardly entertain an echo in it; but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from neighbors. All the attractions of a house were concentrated in one room; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; and whatever satisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive from living in a house, I enjoyed it all. Cato says, the master of a family (patremfamilias) must have in his rustic villa [...] "cellam oleariam, vinariam, dolia multa, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et virtuti, et gloriae erit," [...] that is, [...] "an oil and wine cellar, many casks, so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times; it will be for his advantage, and virtue, and glory."

With {{the exception of}} laufabrauð, none of these is mentioned in written records until the late 18th century. Laufabrauð is sometimes called “snowflake bread” in English because of its intricate cut-out pattern.

40|$|The palat {{ability of}} {{different}} cereals was studied in 2 two-way choice (preference) experiments using pigs of 56 d {{of age and}} 17 kg of BW. In Exp. 1, the effect of 24 cereals vs. a common reference diet containing white rice on feed preference in pigs was studied. Pigs were offered free choice between the reference diet and a diet with the cereal under study for 4 d. Barley, corn (2 sources), wheat, cassava <b>meal,</b> biscuit <b>meal,</b> <b>rye,</b> sorghum, and 1 source of oats were tested at inclusion rates of 300 and 600 g-kg- 1. Shortgrain rice (whole, brown, or extruded white), long-grain white rice (raw and cooked), extruded barley, extruded corn, extruded wheat, oats (2 sources), thick rolled oats, cooked oats, and naked oats (raw, extruded, or micronized) were tested at inclusion rates of 150, 300, and 600 g-kg- 1. Relative preference of cereals (% of total feed intake) was affected by type of cereal and by rate of inclusion. The diets containing extruded rice (150 g·kg- 1), extruded naked oats (150, 300, and 600 g·kg- 1), or naked oats (150 and 300 g·kg- 1) were preferred (P < 0. 05) by pigs to the reference diet. However, the reference diet was preferred (P < 0. 05) to the diets containing 150, 300, and 600 g·kg- 1 of cooked long-grain rice, oats, or cooked oats, 300 and 600 g·kg- 1 of extruded wheat, wheat, corn, sorghum, or unhulled short-grain rice, and 600 g·kg- 1 of thick rolled oats, extruded corn, rye, extruded barley, micronized naked oats, barley, cassava, or biscuit meal. Extrusion improved (P < 0. 05) preference values for corn and naked oats by pigs, but {{had no effect on}} barley, rice, or wheat. In Exp. 2, the preferences of pigs for oats and barley were studied using mash and pelleted diets. Diet form did not affect preference in oats diets. However, for barley, greater preference values were obtained when measured in pelleted form compared with mash form. Additionally, direct 2 -way choices were also performed between oats and barley diets and between diets presented in mash and pelleted forms. Pigs preferred barley to oats, and preferred diets presented in pelleted form to those presented in mash form. In conclusion, cereal type, inclusion rate, and diet form affected feed preference in pigs. Using cereals with greater preference values may contribute to the formulation of more palatable feeds, which enhance feed intake of piglets at critical stages such as weaning time...|$|R
6000|$|Bread I {{at first}} made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes, which I baked before my fire {{out of doors}} on a shingle {{or the end of}} a stick of timber sawed off in {{building}} my house; but it was wont to get smoked and to have a piny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last found a mixture of <b>rye</b> and Indian <b>meal</b> most convenient and agreeable. In cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession, tending and turning them as carefully as an Egyptian his hatching eggs. They were a real cereal fruit which I ripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths. I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making, consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive days and first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness of nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet, and travelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the dough which, it is supposed, taught the leavening process, and through the various fermentations thereafter, till I came to [...] "good, sweet, wholesome bread," [...] the staff of life. Leaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the spiritus which fills its cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved like the vestal fire--some precious bottleful, I suppose, first brought over in the Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still rising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land--this seed I regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at length one morning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which accident I discovered that even this was not indispensable--for my discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process--and I have gladly omitted it since, though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be, and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces. Yet I find it not to be an essential ingredient, and after going without it for a year am still {{in the land of the}} living; and I am glad to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottleful in my pocket, which would sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is simpler and more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than any other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances. Neither did I put any sal-soda, or other acid or alkali, into my bread. It would seem that I made it according to the recipe which Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ. [...] "Panem depsticium sic facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in mortarium indito, aquae paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene subegeris, defingito, coquitoque sub testu." [...] Which I take to mean,--"Make kneaded bread thus. Wash your hands and trough well. Put the meal into the trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly. When you have kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover," [...] that is, in a baking kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this staff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw none of it for more than a month.|$|R

Also the dietary glycaemic- and insulinaemic indices of foods may play a role. Rye products are interesting in this context as they are usually consumed in wholegrain form and have been demonstrated to induce low insulin responses, {{with or without a}} simultaneous lowering of the glycaemic index (GI). The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the possible cause of low postprandial insulin response to rye, and to elucidate potential effects of processing condition, extraction rate and rye variety. Insulin response as well as glycaemic response and course of glycaemia were evaluated in the postprandial phase. Additionally a marker of colonic fermentation was analysed in the postprandial phase (breath hydrogen) and appetite regulating properties were investigated using subjective ratings, analysis of plasma ghrelin, and quantification of voluntary food intake at a subsequent <b>meal.</b> Wholegrain <b>rye</b> products, ingested as boiled kernels and breads as well as endosperm rye (sifted rye) bread and porridge, induced low insulin responses and also a well regulated course of glycaemia, noted as blood glucose curves with lower incremental peaks, remaining above fasting for a longer time. However, some rye varieties were devoid of benefits on course of glycaemia and insulin economy. Two measurements of the course of glycaemia were introduced, the GP and GP 2, defined as the duration for incremental postprandial glycaemic response divided by the glucose incremental peak or squared glucose incremental peak, respectively. The GP and GP 2 of the products were correlated to the insulin response, as well as to late subjective satiety, suggesting that they are good predictors of postprandial events. Suggested mechanism for the lowered glycaemic and insulinaemic responses were a high content of viscous fibres, bioactive components, e. g. phenolic acids and a dense food structure, contributing to a lowered digestion and uptake of carbohydrates in the small intestines. Furthermore, rye products induced early colonic fermentation, already in the postprandial phase, possibly explained by the presence of arabinoxylans, fructans, and other dietary fibre compounds of low molecular weight. The increase in colonic fermentation, measured as increase in breath H 2, correlated with lower late postprandial concentration of FFA and the GP and GP 2 of the products, suggesting increased glucose tolerance already in the postprandial phase after rye products. Rye products, in particular boiled rye kernels induced high postprandial subjective satiety and promoted satiety also at a subsequent voluntary <b>meal.</b> The <b>rye</b> kernel breakfast lowered the voluntary energy intake at a second meal with 16 %. The mechanism behind this satiating effect of rye was suggested to be the high content of dietary fibres (DF) and high water content introducing a bulking effect. Also, high content of viscous and fermentable DF can lower gastric emptying rate. The low postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia seen with several rye products appears to contribute to a lowered rebound of the hunger peptide ghrelin prior to the second <b>meal.</b> <b>Rye</b> products made from whole kernels and wholegrain- and endosperm rye bread induced lower postprandial insulinaemia and glycaemia than wholegrain- and endosperm rye porridges, while porridges and whole kernels induced higher subjective satiety. Boiled rye kernels also supressed the desire to eat {{to a greater extent than}} boiled wheat kernels in the later postprandial phase (tAUC 210 – 270 min). Several components are suggested to contribute to the observed lowered insulinaemia, well regulated glycaemia and improved satiating effects of certain rye products...|$|R
5000|$|A simple, all-rye bread can be {{made using}} a sourdough starter and rye meal; it will not rise {{as high as a}} wheat bread, but will be more moist with a {{substantially}} longer keeping time. Such bread is often known as [...] "black bread" [...] (Schwarzbrot in German, chyorniy khleb in Russian) from their darker color than wheat breads (enhanced by long baking times, creating Maillard reactions in the crumb). The German Vollkornbrot (whole-grain bread) is something of an archetypical example, containing both <b>rye</b> <b>meal</b> and cracked whole rye grains (which are generally soaked overnight before incorporating into the dough). It is used both as an appetizer substrate for such things as smoked fish and caviar and as a sandwich bread. A very similar, but darker, bread, German-style pumpernickel, has an even darker color derived from toasted leftover bread and other agents. Due to the density of the bread, the yeast in the starter is used at least as much for the fermentation character in the bread itself as it is for leavening. Danish rugbrød (rye bread), another archetypical example, is typically made with sour dough, with either straight rye flour or mixed with whole and/or cracked rye kernels. Any breads containing wheat flour are not considered rugbrød, but white bread. A variety of seeds, such as pumpkin, poppy and caraway, may be added for taste. Rugbrød is a staple lunch food, typically eaten topped with cold or warm fish and meats, cheese or any other cold cut.|$|E

40|$|The {{digestibility}} of protein, fats, carbohydrates, {{and energy}} in three feed ingredients (sorghum, wheat bran, and rye) in common carp, Cyprinus carpio, was studied using the chromic oxide method. Three experimental diets were tested. Each contained 52. 5 % of a basal diet and 47. 5 % {{of the test}} ingredient. The carbohydrate levels in the test ingredients ranged 65 - 83 % and the pro- tein levels ranged 11 - 18 %. Therefore, carbohydrates were the main energy source. Results showed that the digestibility of protein in rye (91. 89 %) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than in sorghum (71. 86 %) and wheat bran (80. 64 %), producing 12. 4, 6. 7, and 9. 3 kJ/g digestible ener- gy, respectively.

6000|$|It {{was very}} pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch {{myself into the}} night, {{especially}} if {{it was dark and}} tempestuous, and set sail from some bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of <b>rye</b> or Indian <b>meal</b> upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing. I had many a genial thought by the cabin fire [...] "as I sailed." [...] I was never cast away nor distressed in any weather, though I encountered some severe storms. It is darker in the woods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet the faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of particular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, {{in the midst of the}} woods, invariably, in the darkest night. Sometimes, after coming home thus late in a dark and muggy night, when my feet felt the path which my eyes could not see, dreaming and absent-minded all the way, until I was aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch, I have not been able to recall a single step of my walk, and I have thought that perhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsake it, as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance. Several times, when a visitor chanced to stay into evening, and it proved a dark night, I was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear of the house, and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue, and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his eyes. One very dark night I directed thus on their way two young men who had been fishing in the pond. They lived about a mile off through the woods, and were quite used to the route. A day or two after one of them told me that they wandered about the greater part of the night, close by their own premises, and did not get home till toward morning, by which time, as there had been several heavy showers in the meanwhile, and the leaves were very wet, they were drenched to their skins. I have heard of many going astray even in the village streets, when the darkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife, as the saying is. Some who live in the outskirts, having come to town a-shopping in their wagons, have been obliged to put up for the night; and gentlemen and ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way, feeling the sidewalk only with their feet, and not knowing when they turned. It is a surprising and memorable, as well as valuable experience, to be lost in the woods any time. Often in a snow-storm, even by day, one will come out upon a well-known road and yet find it impossible to tell which way leads to the village. Though he knows that he has travelled it a thousand times, he cannot recognize a feature in it, but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in Siberia. By night, of course, the perplexity is infinitely greater. In our most trivial walks, we are constantly, though unconsciously, steering like pilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands, and if we go beyond our usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some neighboring cape; and not till we are completely lost, or turned round--for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut in this world to be lost--do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness of nature. Every man has to learn the points of compass again as often as he awakes, whether from sleep or any abstraction. Not till we are lost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations.|$|R
