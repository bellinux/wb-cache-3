40|$|Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti {{inflammatory}} drug (NSAIDs). It {{has been}} reported as a safe substitute of diclofenac sodium which has been banned for veterinary use in Pakistan, Nepal and India due to its <b>relay</b> <b>toxicity</b> associated with the catastrophic and unprecedented decline in vulture population during last 17 years. Diclofenac was very cheap and commonly used drug and it was highly toxic when dose of 0. 8 mg /kg was administered directly to the vulture in captivity. Although diclofenac is now regarded as a devastating environmental toxicant in recent times, {{but it is still}} used in veterinary practice. Meloxicam was safe for vultures up to the dose of 2 mg/Kg which is more than its likely maximum level of exposure (MLE) to wild vultures. Marked inter-species differences in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of NSAIDs had been reported and pharmacokinetic data could not be extrapolated from one species to another. However, consequent upon to relentless International pressures for elimination of diclofenac sodium from veterinary practice, the governments in the subcontinent are freely registering meloxicam for veterinary use without giving any due consideration to species specific PK-data. Manufacturers are selling veterinary injections of meloxicam without giving animal specific dosage. There is need to study pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in the domestic target species under local conditions, to enable its rational clinical use...|$|E
40|$|Meloxicam, a non-steroidal anti-Inflammatory drug {{has been}} {{registered}} in Pakistan {{as a safe}} substitute of diclofenacsodium which was banned for veterinary use, due to its <b>relay</b> <b>toxicity</b> associated with the catastrophic decline in vulturepopulation of the Indian subcontinent. In Pakistan, Injection is the only dosage form registered for veterinary purposeswhereas Boehringer Ingelheim are licensed to sell meloxicam liquid oral suspension in UK and USA for use in dogs. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine absolute bioavailability in dogs under local conditions of Pakistan. Eightdogs were used in two groups A & B (4 x 4) in a cross over fashion. The dogs in-group A were administered anintravenous bolus of meloxicam 0. 2 mg. kg- 1 b. wt. and dogs in group B were administered an oral single dose ofmeloxicam 0. 2 mg. kg- 1 b. wt. After wash out period of 14 days, experiment was repeated by change of treatment to groupA and B. The blood samples were drawn at pre defined time intervals up to 96 h. An HPLC method developed/validatedat laboratories of UVAS/ LCWU, Lahore was used for the measurement of meloxicam concentration in plasma. TheAUC (area under the curve) of all the dogs was determined from the plasma concentration versus time data following I/Vand oral administration of the drug. The result indicated that the absolute bioavailability of meloxicam following oraladministration at the dose of 0. 2 mg. kg- 1 b. wt. was 90. 24 %. It is recommended that the oral dosage form like suspensionmust be developed / marketed in Pakistan in order to ensure easy administration of meloxicam at user end...|$|E
40|$|Meloxicam {{has been}} {{reported}} as an eco-friendly alternate of diclofenac sodium which was banned for veterinary use during 2005 - 06, due to its <b>relay</b> <b>toxicity</b> associated with the catastrophic decline in vulture populations in Indian subcontinent. It is a preferential cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibiter with higher therapeutic index as compared to diclofenac, indomethacin and piroxicam. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam was studied in dogs. Eight dogs used in the experiment were administered @ 0. 2 mg. kg- 1 body weight as an intravenous (IV) bolus of meloxicam through cephalic vein. Blood samples (3 - 5 mL) were drawn pre medication and then up to 96 hours post-medication. Plasma concentrations of meloxicam were measured in triplicate by HPLC method developed and validated at laboratories of University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences and Lahore College for Women University, Lahore Pakistan. The plasma concentration versus time profile was prepared. Mean (± SD) values of pharmacokinetic parameters viz area under curve (AUC), steady state volume of distribution (VDss), half-life (t 1 / 2), mean residence time (MRT) and clearance (Cl) were 30. 93 ± 0. 503 μg. h. mL- 1, 0. 223 ±. 001 L. kg- 1, 23. 81 ± 0. 746 h, 34. 29 ± 0. 5 h and 0. 0065 ± 0. 003 L. h- 1. kg- 1 respectively. These parameters of meloxicam in dogs were comparable to the reported values in dogs but different when compared with PK values in many other species like sheep, goats, horses, chicken, rabbits and rats. The pharmacokinetic parameters were put in different PK-equations for calculations of dose. We recommend a single IV dose of 0. 2 mg. kg- 1 body weight of meloxicam in dogs...|$|E
40|$|Diclofenac Sodium, a Non-steroidal anti-Inflammatory drug (NSAID) {{was banned}} for {{veterinary}} use in Pakistan, India and Nepal in 2005 - 06 due to its <b>relay</b> <b>toxicity</b> associated with catastrophic decline in the populations of vulture in South Asia. The main aim of the present research was to study pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in goats under local conditions. Meloxicam is another NSAID, reported as a safe alternate to diclofenac. It is a preferential cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibiter with higher therapeutic index as compared to diclofenac, indomethacin and piroxicam. Eight healthy goats investigated, were administered meloxicam 0. 6 mg. kg- 1 b. wt, as intravenous bolus, into the jugular vein. Blood samples(5 mL) were collected before medication and then up to 96 hours post medication. Plasma concentrations of meloxicam were measured in triplicate by HPLC method developed and validated at laboratories of UVAS and Lahore College for Women University, Lahore Pakistan. The plasma concentration versus time profile was prepared. Mean (+ SEM) values of pharmacokinetic parameters viz area under curve(AUC); steady state volume of distribution(VDss), half-life(t 1 / 2); mean residence time(MRT) and clearance(Cl) were 22. 81 ± 1. 25 μg. h/mL, 0. 266 ± 0. 007 L/kg, 7. 34 ± 0. 31 h, 7. 34 ± 0. 46 h and 0. 026 ± 0. 002 L/h/kg respectively. These values were comparable to value reported for goats. However, these pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly different when compared with other species including livestock. The pharmacokinetic parameters were put in different equations for calculations of dose. In conclusion interspecies variations exist in pharmacokinetics of meloxicam. Furthermore, a single IV injection of meloxicam @ dose of 0. 6 mg. kg- 1 b. wt may safely be used therapeutically in goats...|$|E
