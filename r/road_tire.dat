40|$|Evaluation {{of recent}} {{advances}} in tire technologies such as advanced deflection agricultural tires (Firestone IF and VF) and precision tire inflation technologies on soil compaction, traction, fuel economy and crop yield responses are important. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the effects of field and transport (<b>road)</b> <b>tire</b> inflation pressure settings of row-crop agricultural tractor and planter tires on soil compaction. A randomized complete block design experiment was conducted at the Iowa State University farm at Boone, Iowa for two tire inflation pressure levels on Dual Front (Firestone IF 420 / 85 R 34) and Dual Rear (Firestone IF 480 / 80 R 50) tires on a John Deere 8310 R MFWD tractor, and transport tires (Super single 445 / 50 R 22. 5) on a John Deere DB 60 planter. Soil compaction was measured using Stress State Transducers (SSTs) buried at 15 -cm and 30 -cm depths beneath the untrafficked soil surface. The soil cone index depth profile was measured at tire-centerline, tire-edge and 20 cm laterally outboard of the tire edge before and after tractor-planter tire passes. Peak Octahedral Normal Stress (ONS) and the corresponding Octahedral Shear Stress (OSS) values in soil were calculated from the SST data. The peak ONS and corresponding OSS values from the <b>road</b> <b>tire</b> inflation pressure settings were statistically higher (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the field tire inflation pressure settings. The maximum ONS was observed at 15 cm soil depth from the <b>road</b> <b>tire</b> inflation pressure setting of the rear tractor tires (179 kPa tire inflation pressure and 33 kN load per tire). The ONS from the front tractor tires (138 kPa tire inflation pressure and 17 kN load per tire) and planter transportation tires (620 kPa tire inflation pressure and 16. 5 kN load per tire) were similar. Cone index data also showed significant differences, comparing before and after tires passes, at the tire-centerline. The peak cone index values for the 0 to 100 mm soil depth range were 1. 3 MPa and 1. 2 MPa from the road and field tire inflation pressure settings, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Tires are {{the main}} contact between a vehicle and the <b>road.</b> <b>Tire</b> {{modelling}} for full vehicle simulations is a challenge due to tires' non-linear behaviour and strong coupling between their different degrees of freedom. Several approaches for tire modelling with regard to handling are available. Empirical models such as Magic Formula fitted to test data are the most widely used. The aim of this thesis is to find an alternative tire model with relatively few parameters that are physically meaningful and hence suitable for parametric sensitivity studies. The model should also be representative of tire behaviour by an acceptable fit to tire test data. A survey of applications of tire models and suitable parameters for sensitivity analysis has been performed within Volvo cars with focus on handling. Simultaneously a literature study {{has been done to}} identify and categorize available tire models. TMeasy was chosen {{to be used in the}} parametric sensitivity studies. This semi-physical tire model fits to test data relatively well and is based on fewer parameters compared to the Magic Formula. The main reason for the selection of TMeasy is that the parameters describing the model, represent tire characteristics that were identified in the application survey as target parameters for sensitivity analysis. The effect of tire parameters on vehicle handling characteristics have been investigated by implementing TMeasy in Adams/Car and performing full vehicle simulations...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{adherence}} {{phenomena in}} tire/road interaction {{is a key}} factor in the automotive field for safety and performance studies. In particular, many developments are focused on innovative tire structures and compounds, able to minimize braking distances, to preserve vehicle stability in panic situations and to guarantee optimal road holding on wet/icy surfaces. During <b>road</b> <b>tire</b> contact, two friction mechanisms prevail i. e. the adhesive and hysterical contribution. The complex tire/road interaction, as concerns macro roughness scale, is usually studied considering a rigid body (asphalt) which indents with a deformable body (rubber). The friction force deforming hysteresis component {{is a function of the}} time stress-field variation in the deformable body, due to indentation. The main aim of this study is to find out a formulation of the stress field in the rubber overcoming the limits of the one taken into account in the Gr. e. t. a. Model (Grip Estimation for Tire Analysis), based on the Kuznetsov–Gorokhovsky formulation. This approach shows evident limits being a bi-dimensional theory applied to a tri-dimensional domain. In this paper, an analysis on the stress field distribution of a deformable rubber parallelepiped specimen due to indentation has been conducted using the Hamilton formulation for stresses calculation. This theory refers to a deformable infinite half-space and it has been applied to a finite domain. To find out the minimum domain dimensions a finite element model has been developed, carrying out simulation under analogous working conditions, in no-sliding condition. The results show a good correlation between the numerical and analytical model in an opportunely dimensioned finite domain for the analyzed working condition...|$|E
40|$|Kurzfassung Innerhalb dieses Beitrags wird die numerische Simulationsmethode der Extended Discrete Element Methode (XDEM) vorgestellt, mit der die Wechselwirkung zwischen Reifen und steinigem Untergrund detailliert beschrieben werden kann. Dabei wird der Reifen als ein Kontinuum betrachtet, das mit der Finiten Element Methode (FEM) abgebildet wird. Der grobkörnige Untergrund, wie beispielsweise Sand oder Kies, wird als granulares Medium betrachtet. Dieses kann sehr vorteilhaft mit der Diskreten Element Methode (DEM) behandelt werden, die eine Betrachtung der individuellen Partikel zulässt. Basierend auf den Gesetzen von Newton werden Position und Orientierung aller Partikel berechnet, wobei Kräfte zwischen den Partikeln und dem Reifen berücksichtigt werden. Kräfte zwischen Partikeln und Reifen treten als Randbedingungen in der FEM Struktur des Reifens auf, und führen damit zur Deformation und somit zu Spannungverteilung in der Reifenstrucktur. Eine Integration in der Zeit bestimmt sowohl den Zustand des Untergrunds als auch die Reaktion des Reifens. Dies wird durch eine {{innovative}} Kopplung zwischen der Discrete Particle Method (DPM) zur Beschreibung des granularen Mediums und dem Finite Element Löser DiffPACK erreicht und deshalb als Extended Discrete Element Methode bezeichnet wird. Beides sind objekt- orientierte Software-Werkzeuge, die über eine Schnittstelle die notwendigen Daten austauschen, so dass der Anwender sein Augenmerk auf die Problemlösung richten kann als sich mit Datenaustausch und Algorithmen zu befassen. Damit wurde ein vielseitiges und flexibles Werkzeug zur Lösung vielfältiger Probleme wie auch die Bewegung eines Reifens im Schnee geschaffen. Das neuartige Konzept ist sowohl auf Windows als auch auf UNIX basierenden Betriebssystemen verfügbar. Abstract The {{objective of}} this contribution is to resolve different length scales in structure analysis by an interface coupling the Discrete Element Method (DEM) with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and therefore, is labelled Extended Discrete Element Methode (XDEM). This approach distinguishes itself from other methods in so far that no overlapping domains between Finite and Discrete Elements exist. Both domains are separated in physical space and numerical simulation domain. The proposed approach is relevant to almost all engineering applications that deal with granular matter such as storage in hoppers, transport on conveyor belts or displacement of granular material as in mixers or excavation of soil. For these applications an engineering device such as mixer blades or cutting tools are in contact with granular matter. Contacts with individual particles generate contact forces that act on both the engineering device and the granular material. The latter experiences a displacement of individual particles whereby the engineering structure responds with deformation and stresses. In order to predict and optimize both the behaviour and motion of granular material and the structures in contact, numerical simulation tools are increasingly employed [1]. Simulations are popular especially because experiments which are often expensive, time- consuming and sometimes even dangerous [2]. The continuous increase in computing power is now enabling researchers to implement numerical methods that do not focus on the granular assembly as an entity, but rather deduce its global characteristics from observing the individual behaviour of each grain. An interaction between granular media and a structure relies on a transfer of forces between them. Granular media consists of an ensemble of particles of which a number of particles may be in contact with a surface e. g. walls as surfaces of solid structures. The contact is resolved similar to inter-particle contacts by a representative overlap. It defines the position of impact {{as well as the}} force acting on the particle at this position. The same force, however, into the opposite direction defines a mechanical load for the structure. In order to determine the effect of forces on the solid structure, it is discretised by finite elements. The impact of the force is transferred to the nodes of the respective surface element and appears as a load for the finite element system. Hence, integrating particle dynamics and the response of the solid structure due to particle impacts advances both new position of particles and corresponding deformation and stress of the solid structure in time. Developing flexible software which is capable of performing simulation in different applications will enable the engineers to focus entirely on their specific problem and hence save them valuable time. This concept is supported by the software tools of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM) and Diffpack. Hence, the solid structure is analysed by the Finite Element Method under load due to the impact of individual particles that changes both in time and space. For this purpose traditional formulations of the Finite Element Method are employed that are available by the commercial multi-physics software package Diffpack. It represents object-oriented hierarchy of classes that provide an excellent interface to introduce external loads from particle impact onto the finite element structure. Diffpack is an object-oriented development environment, which comes as a rich set of C++ classes, for the numerical modelling and solution of arbitrary differential equations. User applications cover a wider range of engineering areas and span from simple educational applications to major product development projects. The behaviour of granular material is represented by the advanced software package of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM), which is based on the Discrete Element Method. It is designed to relieve users from underlying mathematics and software design and allows them to focus on physics and their applications. The software uses object oriented techniques that support objects representing three-dimensional particles of various shapes such as cylinders, discs or tetrahedrons for example, size and material properties. This makes it a highly versatile tool dealing with a large variety of different applications of granular matter arising in the automotive industry, such as <b>road</b> <b>tire</b> interaction. Various force models for the inter- particle and particle-wall contacts are also available. A minimal user interface easily allows extending the software further by adding user-defined impact models or material properties to an already available selection of materials and properties. Thus, the user is relieved of the underlying mathematics or software design, and therefore, is able to direct his focus entirely onto the application. The Discrete Particle Method is written in C++ programming language and works both in Linux and Windows environments...|$|E
