2500|$|Shortly after guitarist Thurston Moore {{moved to}} New York City in early 1977, he formed a group, <b>Room</b> <b>Tone,</b> with his roommates, who later changed their {{name to the}} Coachmen. After {{the breakup of the}} Coachmen, Moore began jamming with Stanton Miranda, whose band, CKM, {{featured}} Kim Gordon. Moore and Gordon formed a band, appearing under names like Male Bonding and Red Milk and the Arcadians, before settling on Sonic Youth just before June 1981. The name came from combining the nickname of MC5's Fred [...] "Sonic" [...] Smith with [...] "Youth" [...] from reggae artist Big Youth. Gordon later recalled that [...] "as soon as Thurston came up with the name Sonic Youth, a certain sound that was more of {{what we wanted to do}} came about." [...] The band played Noise Fest in June 1981 at New York's White Columns gallery, where Lee Ranaldo was playing as a member of Glenn Branca's electric guitar ensemble. Their performance impressed Moore, who described them as [...] "the most ferocious guitar band that I had ever seen in my life", and he invited Ranaldo to join the band. The new threesome played three songs at the festival later in the week without a drummer. Each band member took turns playing the drums, until they met drummer Richard Edson.|$|E
5000|$|... {{4-channel}} audio installation, variable durationA <b>room</b> <b>tone</b> is {{a recorded}} element of sound design, often {{employed in the}} movie industry, to impress the sonic ambience of a depicted environment. It {{is the sound of}} “silence” in a room, though never quite silent as each <b>room</b> <b>tone</b> is inflected by different characteristics such as sonic reflections bouncing off physical architecture, the absorptive presence of bodies, and other kinds of technology present (i.e., the subtle hum of air-handling systems and lights). <b>Room</b> <b>Tone</b> is run by a computer program that generates sounds drawn from a database of approximately 1,000 room tones through four separate channels. The program may layer, cut up, and combine these room tones, varying in duration and volume, to create a new, dynamic, and visceral <b>room</b> <b>tone</b> for any particular space. Constantly changing and evolving, the aural experience of <b>Room</b> <b>Tone</b> humorously plays with the oft-cited adage of John Cage: “There {{is no such thing as}} an empty space or an empty time. There is always something to see, something to hear. In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Richard Brophy {{wrote in}} DJ Magazine [...] "German experimentalists bypass the 21st century, {{creating}} a musical zone that unites the 20th and the 22nd centuries on a sun drenched, achingly slow disco trip that navigates between glacial synths and Afro drums." [...] In UK magazine The Clash Charlie Frame described the music as [...] "mossy culture multiplying {{on a bed}} of wires and computer chips" [...] and the band's aesthetic as [...] "petrol punk (…) that fuses IDM, industrial, African rhythms, Kafka, Godard and Giger with something altogether more futuristic {{than the sum of its}} parts." [...] Boomkat stated: [...] "An engrossing and entirely out-of-its-time album from an always intriguing fixture of the German leftfield." [...] American journalist Philip Sherburne wrote on eMusic [...] "both rhythmic slippage and rubbery <b>room</b> <b>tone</b> point to [...] "real" [...] instruments in [...] "real" [...] space and time, a matrix whose shorthand is [...] "rock 'n' roll." [...] But synthesizers, electronic effects and the very fabric of the music itself always pulls the live-band fantasy back inside a different kind of logic: an ideal form mapped to an infinitesimally pixellated grid. It's hard to put your finger on, but you can feel it, and that's precisely what gives the record its charge: humans imitating machines imitating humans, or maybe the other way round.".

5000|$|Part three: Later {{the same}} day, {{the crew is}} setting up for a dream {{sequence}} in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, [...] "you just got to roll with things." [...] Nicole admits {{that she had a}} dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito (Peter Dinklage) complains that the dream sequence is a cliché ("I don't even have dreams with dwarves in them!") and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is [...] "ready". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of <b>room</b> <b>tone.</b> The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and during this moment they each daydream about different things.

40|$|The {{effect of}} finite source size {{on the power}} {{statistics}} in a reverberant <b>room</b> for pure <b>tone</b> excitation was investigated. Theoretical {{results indicate that the}} standard deviation of low frequency, pure tone finite sources is always less than that predicted by point source theory and considerably less when the source dimension approaches one-half an acoustic wavelength or greater. A supporting experimental study was conducted utilizing an eight inch loudspeaker and a 30 inch loudspeaker at eleven source positions. The resulting standard deviation of sound power output of the smaller speaker is in excellent agreement with both the derived finite source theory and existing point source theory, if the theoretical data is adjusted to account for experimental incomplete spatial averaging. However, the standard deviation of sound power output of the larger speaker is measurably lower than point source theory indicates, but is in good agreement with the finite source theory...|$|R

The original version, a performance clip set in a blue <b>toned</b> <b>room</b> and interspersed with shots {{of a young girl}} being studied by scientists, was disliked by the band and quickly disowned, although it had already aired on various British television shows by this point. A replacement video (directed by Nigel Dick) was then filmed on a shoestring budget, featuring the duo in a rural location (some of which was filmed in Curt Smith's back garden) and interspersed with news and sports footage from a TV set. Both clips were released to UK and European markets in mid-1984. The third and final video was made for the [...] "US Remix" [...] of the song in early 1986 and portrayed a family preparing a bomb shelter for nuclear fallout, in keeping with the theme of Raymond Briggs' graphic novel When the Wind Blows.

40|$|AIM – This article {{examines}} how {{men and women}} who have left problematic drug use describe their own previous use of amphetamine in the context of sexual activity as well as the views in the drug-using environments on amphetamine and sex. METHODS – The article builds on a qualitative study of sexuality, intimate relationships and drug use against the backdrop of the exit process from drug abuse. The 35 interviewees comprise a heterogeneous group in terms of both drug abuse history and life circumstances in general. RESULTS – In the sexual practices of our informants, amphetamine has been used to increase sexual desire and to enhance sexual experience. Initially, the drug appears to facilitate pornography inspired sexual experimentation, which is experienced as something positive, but gradually this is for many transformed into sexual practices that are seen as practically manic, with marathon sex being an important component. Among men, sometimes the sexual interest is channeled into an intense masturbating, as a substitute for a sexual partner or in order not to disturb the amphetamine experience by involving a live partner. Once amphetamine use starts to lead to problematic effects on social life and mental and physical health, desire becomes increasingly difficult to maintain. Although amphetamine is associated with sex in the amphetamine environment there is also <b>room</b> for <b>toning</b> down sexual activity and instead use the total focus of the high for crime (breaking) or other practical acitivties such as repairs or housecleaning (tinkering). CONCLUSION – Our study shows that amphetamine has a reputation for enhancing sexual experience, which has increased its powers of attraction for both men and women. The impact of amphetamine on sexuality is influenced by personal experiences and culturally determined expectations. Even when one manipulates the sexual act with amphetamine the strong individuality that characterizes human sexuality in general remains. The total experience of mixing amphetamine and sex, which for most is changing in a negative direction over time, appears to be a result of the interaction between the drug, the social and relational setting and the sexual script of the individual...|$|R
