The first part of the report contains a general discussion of the principles governing the toxicological evaluation of and assessment of dietary exposure to food additives. A summary follows of the Committee’s evaluations of technical, toxicological and dietary exposure data for seven food additives (advantame; glucoamylase from Trichoderma reesei expressed in Trichoderma reesei; glycerol ester of gum rosin; glycerol ester of tall oil rosin; glycerol ester of wood rosin; nisin; and <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> modified gum arabic) and an assessment of dietary exposure to cadmium from cocoa and cocoa products. Specifications for the following food additives were revised: annatto extracts (solvent-extracted bixin and solvent-extracted norbixin); Benzoe tonkinensis; food additives containing aluminium and/or silicon; mineral oil (medium viscosity); modified starches; paprika extract; phosphates (analytical methods for the determination of phosphorus and revision of specifications); 3 -phytase from Aspergillus niger expressed in Aspergillus niger; potassium aluminium silicate; and potassium aluminium silicate–based pearlescent pigments.

40|$|A common {{modification}} of starch is esterfication with anhydrous <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> (OSA).   The modification makes the polymer surface active {{and it also}} incorporates a carboxyl group to the starch, which can be negatively charged. The characteristics of OSA starch make it interesting for usage in combination with egg yolk proteins in food emulsions. It {{is not only the}} individual ingredients that affect the product; interactions between ingredients and ingredient-dispersion medium have a great impact on factors such as structure and stability. Knowledge about how the interactions affect emulsion properties would make it possible to predict the behavior of an emulsion, which would be a great advantage in the formulation of food emulsions. Therefore, this is a subject of interest. The purpose of this master thesis was to further investigate the interactions between OSA starch and α – β-livetin in solutions and in emulsions. First, the charges of the macromolecules were studied by titration. Interactions in solution were then analyzed through turbidity and solubility measurements. The adsorption of OSA starch onto livetin and the interfacial rheology were also studied. Finally, an emulsion stability experiment was made. Strong interactions between the two macromolecules were observed in solutions at pH 4. 0. This was probably due to hydrophobic interaction; however it could also be explained by electrostatic interaction. In the emulsions the adsorption of starch onto livetin was highest at pH 4. 5, and then decreased with increasing pH values. The absence of OSA starch adsorption at pH 4. 0, despite the strong interaction in solution, could be explained by complex formation immediately in solution. Less starch would then be able to reach the interface and adsorb. In the interfacial rheology experiments, an indication of decreased complex dilational modulus of the interfacial layer, caused by OSA starch addition was seen at low pH values. This could be due to aggregation of the proteins and formation of an uneven interfacial layer. OSA starch would then be able to adsorb and disturb the elasticity. Some differences in the stability of an emulsion only containing livetin, and an emulsion with both livetin and OSA starch could be observed. However, more investigations are needed to be made to understand the underlying mechanisms...|$|R

Among three different CO 2 -fixing metabolic reactions catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase, PEP carboxylase, and malic enzyme, PEP carboxykinase was the most important for the anaerobic growth of M. succiniciproducens and <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> production. Oxaloacetate formed by carboxylation of PEP was found to be converted to <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> by three sequential reactions catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and fumarate reductase.

The effectiveness of these beads is claimed to be from <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> release (a compound with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties), which is then absorbed through the skin. AIM: To investigate whether Baltic amber teething necklaces purchased in Australia contained <b>succinic</b> <b>acid,</b> and to quantify <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> release from the beads. METHODS: Infrared spectroscopy was used {{to confirm that the}} teething necklaces were made of Baltic amber. The amount of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> contained within the beads was quantified, and <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> release from intact beads was measured in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 5. 5 or octanol to simulate aqueous or oily skin environments. RESULTS: Each necklace (33 beads in length) contained 19. 17 ± 4. 89 mg of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> (mean±se). Over a 6 -month period, no <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> was detected in PBS, while 0. 13 ± 0. 09 mg of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> per necklace was released in octanol. Only one replicate of amber beads in octanol released <b>succinic</b> <b>acid,</b> and they had fragmented, with shards free-floating in the solvent. DISCUSSION: It is likely <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> was only detected because the beads were breaking down in octanol, which does not occur when worn around the neck of a child. Furthermore, the hydrophilic properties of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> would not favour its absorption across hydrophobic layers of the skin and into the bloodstream.

Methods. Infrared spectroscopy was used {{to confirm that the}} teething necklaces were made of Baltic amber. The amount of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> contained within the beads was quantified, and <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> release from intact beads was measured in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 5. 5 or octanol. Anti-inflammatory activity of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> was compared with ibuprofen, paracetamol and hydrocortisone in vitro using THP- 1 human macrophages stimulated with LPS. Secretion of the cytokines IL- 1 a, IL- 1 b, IL- 8 and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Results. Each necklace (33 beads in length) contained 19. 17 ± 4. 89 mg of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> (mean ± se). Over a 6 -month period, no <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> was detected in PBS.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Succinic</b> <b>acid</b> was {{produced}} by fermentation of Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens using glycerol as a carbon source. When cells were anaerobically cultured in a medium containing 6. 5 g/L glycerol, a high <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> yield (133 %) was obtained while avoiding the for-mation of by-product acetic acid. The gram ratio of suc-cinic acid to acetic acid was 25. 8 : 1, which is 6. 5 times higher than that obtained using glucose (ca. 4 : 1) as a carbon source. Therefore, <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> can be produced with much less by-product formation by using glycerol as a carbon source, which will facilitate its purification. When glucose and glycerol were cofermented with the increasing ratio of glucose to glycerol, the gram ratio of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> to acetic <b>acid</b> and <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> yield de-creased, suggesting that glucose enhanced acetic acid formation irrespective {{of the presence of}} glycerol.

40|$|<b>Succinic</b> <b>acid</b> {{produced}} by yeast during bread dough fermentation can significantly affect the rheological {{properties of the}} dough. By introducing mutations in the model S 288 C yeast strain, we showthat the oxidative pathway of the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt contribute significantly to <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> production during dough fermentation. More specifically, deletion of ACO 1 and double deletion of ACO 1 and ICL 1 resulted in a 36 and 77 % decrease in <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> levels in fermented dough, respectively. Similarly, double deletion of IDH 1 and IDP 1 decreased <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> production by 85 %, while also affecting the fermentation rate. By contrast, double deletion of SDH 1 and SDH 2 resulted in a two-fold higher <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> accumulation compared to the wild-type.

Metabolic flux analyses were carried out to estimate flux distributions to achieve the maximum in silico yield of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> in E. coli. The maximum in silico yield of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> was only 83 % of its theoretical yield.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Succinic</b> <b>acid</b> is a building-block {{chemical}} {{which could}} be used as the precursor of many industrial products. The dissolved CO 2 concentration in the fermentation broth could strongly regulate the metabolic flux of carbon and the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase, which are the important committed steps for the biosynthesis of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> by Actinobacillus succinogenes. Previous reports showed that <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> production could be promoted by regulating the supply of CO 2 donor in the fermentation broth. Therefore, the effects of dissolved CO 2 concentration and MgCO 3 on the fermentation process should be investigated. In this article, we studied the impacts of gaseous CO 2 partial pressure, dissolved CO 2 concentration, and the addition amount of MgCO 3 on <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> production by Actinobacillus succinogenes ATCC 55618. We also demonstrated that gaseous CO 2 could be removed when MgCO 3 was fully supplied. Results An effective CO 2 quantitative mathematical model was developed to calculate the dissolved CO 2 concentration in the fermentation broth. The highest <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> production of 61. 92 g/L was obtained at 159. 22 mM dissolved CO 2 concentration, which was supplied by 40 g/L MgCO 3 at the CO 2 partial pressure of 101. 33 kPa. When MgCO 3 was used as the only CO 2 donor, a maximal <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> production of 56. 1 g/L was obtained, which was just decreased by 7. 03 % compared with that obtained under the supply of gaseous CO 2 and MgCO 3. Conclusions Besides the high dissolved CO 2 concentration, the excessive addition of MgCO 3 was beneficial to promote the <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis. This was the first report investigating the replaceable of gaseous CO 2 in the fermentation of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid.</b> The results obtained in this study may be useful for reducing the cost of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> fermentation process. </p...|$|R
