2500|$|This is not {{the only}} version that has taken liberties with the staging. “When Catastrophe was {{performed}} in the Beckett Festival on 15 September 1999, the director Robert O’Mahoney, interpreted the climax very differently [...] After Johnny Murphy <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> glared with great dignity at the audience, his lips parted and stretched into an imitation of Edvard Munch’s The Scream. This nullified the impact of the ending, as Protagonist was reduced to nothing more than an abject silently screaming victim.” ...|$|E
60|$|Wingrave <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} Lady Ruth contemplatively.|$|E
60|$|But {{whenever}} {{he moved the}} old Lion <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> growled.|$|E
60|$|Razumov {{could not}} prevent himself from <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> Sophia Antonovna nodded slightly.|$|R
60|$|By and by he saw Charly sharply <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> gaze {{towards the}} opening.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot {{you doing}} here?" [...] asked the Englishman, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{regarding}} Mr. Wrenn as a housewife does a cockroach in the salad-bowl.|$|R
60|$|But {{when the}} Lion saw him move he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> roared.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of this gloomy {{abstraction}} Courtland suddenly <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> listened.|$|E
60|$|The bandit <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> paced back {{to where}} he could look out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{quite sure}} that Peterkin is," [...] added Jack, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> looking across the fire at the half-recumbent form of our companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Sewell," [...] said Moses, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{suddenly}} looking {{him straight}} in the eyes, [...] "do you know anything of my family?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll have it explained, though,' said Mr. Pickwick, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{hammering}} the table. 'I'll {{see this}} Dodson and Fogg! I'll go to London to-morrow.' ...|$|R
60|$|Cesare <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{his lips}} parted in the faintest vestige of a smile.|$|E
60|$|Jack <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him. It {{was one of}} his {{peculiar}} looks.|$|E
60|$|M. d'Ogeron {{the younger}} <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> looked the Captain boldly in the face.|$|E
6000|$|Above him circled {{thousands}} {{of his friends}} the gulls, wondering if their benefactor were really dead and it was proper to eat him. But when they saw him <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> groan and tremble they knew he still lived, {{and one of them}} said to his comrades: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And wave them {{slowly in}} and out, While drawing them asunder; And in a minute's time, no doubt, He'll <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> look about With eyes of wrath and wonder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a minute," [...] {{said the}} boy, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> looking boldly at his guardian. [...] "I am a free-born Englishman, and {{will return to}} England if I think fit." ...|$|R
60|$|The Angel <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{into his}} eyes came the glow {{associated}} with celestial strains.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} Gr-gr-gr sat in thought. Then he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{addressed}} my guard.|$|E
60|$|Boulte <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> said slowly, 'Oh, you liar!' Kurrell's face changed. 'What's that?' {{he asked}} quickly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Halloa! {{what are}} you up to, my dear?' said Mr Codlin, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> yawning. Then observing that his {{companion}} was fast asleep, he added in an earnest whisper, 'Codlin's the friend, remember--not Short.' ...|$|R
60|$|Cosmo {{is perhaps}} dreaming {{that he is}} back at Osborne, for he calls out, as if in answer to a summons, that he is up and nearly dressed. He then <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> surveys Ginevra.|$|R
60|$|Marston {{did try to}} <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{did change}} <b>his</b> opinion. His neck {{felt as if it}} were a {{complication}} of iron hinges, which had become exceedingly rusty, and stood much in need of oil.|$|R
60|$|Finally, however, he {{finished}} the game, and then he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> looked sharply at his visitors.|$|E
60|$|The {{silence in}} the big room had grown oppressive when Barrington <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> sat stiffly upright.|$|E
60|$|After a time Buttchee <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{wiped his}} eyes, in which were many tears--but not of sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|The wizard, without <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{stuffing}} <b>his</b> {{mouth full}} {{to prevent the}} power of speech, glanced keenly about the floor. Observing the fresh skin in a corner, {{and one or two}} ribs, he bolted the bite, and said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is present?" [...] {{interrupted}} the blind man, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> tossing back <b>his</b> {{hair with a}} gesture {{that for the first}} time gave Richard a sense that his eldest brother was indeed before him. [...] "Methought I heard another voice." ...|$|R
6000|$|RAINA (a little moved). I'm sorry. I won't scold you. (Touched by {{the sympathy}} in her tone, he <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> looks gratefully at her: she {{immediately}} draws hack and says stiffly) You must excuse me: our soldiers {{are not like}} that. (She {{moves away from the}} ottoman.) ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked up}} at her, vacant and wistful, forlorn already, as if the death-parting was over.|$|E
60|$|With {{his hand}} still {{mechanically}} {{pointing at the}} table Noel Vanstone <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> looked up at Mrs. Lecount.|$|E
6000|$|Almayer again <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> in the accents {{of a man}} {{accustomed}} to the buffets of evil fortune asked hardly audibly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do I not?' said <b>his</b> companion, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{looking at}} him, {{but he had}} turned again. 'Do I not? Have I not confided to you the easy schemes I have formed for our advantage; OUR advantage, mind; not mine alone; and what is my return? Attempted flight!' ...|$|R
60|$|Razumov <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sharply <b>and</b> {{attached}} on her {{a prolonged}} thoughtful glance.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the clip-clop, clip-clop of hoofs caused Duane to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> listen. Horses {{were coming}} {{down the road from}} the head of the valley. The hour was unusual for riders to come in. Presently the narrow, moonlit lane was crossed at its far end by black moving objects. Two horses Duane discerned.|$|R
