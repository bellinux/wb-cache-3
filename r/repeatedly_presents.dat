40|$|Henri Bergson&# 039;s {{philosophy}} {{presents the}} relationship between life and matter in both dualistic and monistic terms. Life is duration, a rhythm of incalculable novelty that approaches pure creative activity. In stark contrast, matter is identified with the determinism of homogeneous space. After Time and Free Will, Bergson concedes some share of duration to matter. In this context, his dualism {{can be understood as}} a methodological step towards the articulation of a monistic metaphysics of duration. This article suggests that the distinction between life and matter is also motivated by an unconscious imperative to establish a sexed hierarchy. Bergson <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presents</b> life as seminal, while matter is figured in terms of passivity...|$|E
40|$|Grand Variations is a {{work for}} large {{orchestra}} built on an original theme and six variations. My primary concerns when composing were communication, continuity, and distortion. To musically communicate an idea repetition is essential, {{and the type of}} repetition presented in theme and variations provided what I was looking for. In addition, the fact that the theme will be repeated over and over leads to a built in continuity. The final concern, distortion, may be achieved by pulling away from a more straightforward presentation of the thematic material. 	Two additional elements played a large role in the work—cyclic forms, and quantum physics. The composition Déserts by Edgard Varese, and the jazz work Nefertiti by Wayne Shorter, both contain strong cyclic features. Nefertiti uses the same melody repeated over and over, while Déserts, on the other hand, <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presents</b> the same musical gestures, and sound objects, but with slight changes to achieve its own cyclic sound world. These two works framed the way that I approached variations, yet are at odds with each other. Through my reading of quantum physics, I found a way to join the two into a working structure, and the book, The Grand Design, by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow, helped me to do it. Because of this, I decided early on to honor that influence, and the title Grand Variations reflect that...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{transplant}} {{recipients are}} at significantly {{greater risk of}} developing skin malignancies due to combination immunosuppressive therapy. A significant number of patients present with lesions needing excision at multiple outpatient follow-up visits. For basal cell carcinoma, we have recently described how combining CO 2 laser with Photodynamic therapy greatly increases the efficacy of long-term tumour clearance compared with each modality alone. We present {{a case of a}} 66 -year-old renal transplant therapy patient who <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presents</b> with new skin malignancies, in whom we treated successfully with Laser-Photodynamic therapy in a see-and-treat setting. This therapy offers patients the possibility of better cosmetic and functional results whilst obviating the need for repeated surgery. Other pre-cancerous lesions such as solar keratoses are prevalent in this patient group and respond extremely well to Photodynamic therapy monotherapy. We propose a regular clinic for renal transplant patients in a laser facility equipped with CO 2 laser and Photodynamic therapy, histopathology and punch-biopsy materials. This strategy allows simple and effective treatment of multiple lesions simultaneously, avoidance of numerous operations, avoidance of non-essential outpatient appointments that result in booking furthers visits for treatment, whilst facilitating diagnostic biopsies of potentially malignant lesions. We outline a care pathway for a see-and-treat clinic that implements this novel treatment modality improving the care of this unique patient population...|$|E

40|$|The essay starts by {{referring}} to a central moment in Shakespeare’s Coriolanus, when the Roman hero reacts to his banishment by banishing: “I banish you!" (3. 3. 123). These lines, the essay argues, provide, in a condensed form, a radical shift of perspective {{on the question of}} the boundaries of Rome: how far does Rome extend? Can Rome banish herself ? Does Rome move with Coriolanus as he moves “elsewhere” (3. 3. 135) ? They also force the audience to reconsider the "nature" of the political decision that leads to the ban. Taking its cue from this line, the essay shows that the question of boundaries in Coriolanus is intimately connected with the uncanny logic of "auto-immunity" which affects Rome’s body politic, a "strange illogical logic by which a living being can spontaneously destroy [ [...] . ] the very thing within it that is supposed to protect it against the other" (J Derrida). The essay also argues that auto-immunity prevails insofar as political life in Rome <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presents</b> itself as life under a state of exception (G. Agamben), a life which is ultimately produced as the bare life of the homo sacer. Coriolanus clearly emblematizes the bare life of the homo sacer. Yet as a Roman / un-Roman hero, he also shows "practices of self-undoing that could clear a path out of the state of exception" (Kuzner). Most notably amongst these, the essay concludes, is his encounter with Aufidius, an encounter which temporarily enacts a "dis-arming" regime of inoperativeness focusing on the un-martial "nothing" (4. 5. 127) of masculine dreams and fantasies...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{characteristics}} of King Lear can {{be accounted for}} {{in terms of the}} dramatic satire Jonson pioneered. Shakespeare certainly knew two of those satiric works. His company performed the play that launched Jonson 2 ̆ 7 s experiment with satire, Every Man out of His Humour, in 1599 and his satiric tragedy, Sejanus, in 1603. Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s name is included among those who acted in Sejanus in the 1616 Folio edition Jonson made of his plays. Shakespeare seems to have used the dramatic satire Jonson pioneered not as an overall genre shaping his play, but as a source for elements transformed in startling and unpredictable ways. ^ Chapter one of this dissertation analyzes Every Man out and identifies five {{characteristics of}} dramatic satire whose application in King Lear is the subject of chapter five. Those characteristics are (1) the satyrist, (2) the satiric vision, (3) judgmental perspective, (4) purgation or curative strategy of intensification, and (5) medical metaphor. The intervening chapters look at how the experiment with satire evolved in Jonson 2 ̆ 7 s Cynthia 2 ̆ 7 s Revels and Poetaster, Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s Troilus and Cressida, and Sejanus, which employs a sixth characteristic found in Lear, the disturbing conclusion. ^ Lear represents the tragic apotheosis of the satyrist character Jonson introduced in Every Man out. Progressively, throughout the play, Lear escalates the rhetoric of defiance. Lear also harkens back to Jonson 2 ̆ 7 s introduction of satire to the stage through use of the satiric vision, a loosely structured speech in which a character decries the state of his world. Key to both Jonson 2 ̆ 7 s and Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s amalgam of satire with tragedy is a denigrating perspective on the tragic protagonist; Lear and Gloucester, like Sejanus, are subjected to belittling perspectives. Jonson <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presents</b> intensification as a curative strategy; intensification of a character 2 ̆ 7 s folly or vice leads to exposure and purgation. Lear too grows worse that he may become better. The characterization of his daughters depends on medical metaphor, the language of the body Jonson used to describe states of being. Sejanus ends thwarting the audience 2 ̆ 7 s sense of justice. So does Lear. Both plays prompt the audience to protest [...] at evil unchecked, on the one hand, and at goodness wasted, on the other. ...|$|E

40|$|Reinforcers {{lose their}} {{effectiveness}} {{when they are}} <b>presented</b> <b>repeatedly.</b> Early researchers labeled this loss of effectiveness as satiation without conducting an experimental analysis. When such an analysis is conducted, habituation provides a more precise and empirically accurate label for the changes in reinforcer effectiveness. This paper reviews some of the data that suggest that habituation occurs to <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presented</b> reinforcers. It also argues that habituation has surprisingly different implications than satiation for theory and practice in behavior analysis. For example, postulating that habituation occurs to <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presented</b> reinforcers suggests ways for maintaining {{the strength of a}}n existing reinforcer and for weakening the strength of a problematic reinforcer that differ from those implied by an account in terms of satiation. An habituation account may also lead to different ways of conceptualizing the regulation of behavior. For example, habituation may be a single-process contributor to the termination of behaviors that are usually attributed to satiation (e. g., ingestive behaviors such as eating and drinking), fatigue (e. g., energetic behaviors such as running), the waning of attention (e. g., cognitive behaviors such as studying), and pharmacodynamic factors (e. g., drug taking) ...|$|R

In Experiment 1, both groups showed the MEE for butterflies, preferring previously presented butterfly pictures over new ones. For spider pictures, only NACs showed an MEE, whereas SFs showed no preference. Experiment 2 involved a more unpleasant presentation situation, because for each picture, participants had the difficult task to indicate what had been presented to them. This led to a reversed MEE for spiders in SFs: They preferred new spider pictures over previously presented ones. In both experiments, no evidence was observed for the ability to differentiate between old an new pictures. The results are tentatively explained within Zajonc' theory of the MEE, and they are related to the concept of sensitization in anxiety disorders...|$|R

However, there has been tentative evidence that the presentation of novel sounds can have beneficial effects on cognitive performance.

Task-irrelevant novel sounds facilitated attentional performance similarly in children with and without ADHD, as indicated by reduced omission error rates, reaction times, and reaction time variability without compromising performance accuracy.

40|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} are often treated by <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presenting</b> stimuli that are perceptually similar to original stimuli to which fear was originally acquired. Fear can return {{after it is}} extinguished because {{of the differences between}} these stimuli. It may possible to attenuate return of fear by manipulating attention to the commonalities between feared stimuli and extinction stimuli. After acquiring fear for an animal-like stimulus by pairing with an electro-cutaneous shock, fear was extinguished by <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presenting</b> a similar stimulus. During extinction participants were asked questions that instructed them to attend towards the features in common between the acquisition and extinction stimulus or towards the unique features of the extinction stimulus. Return of fear was assessed by presenting a second perceptually similar stimulus after extinction. Participants showed a return in skin conductance responding after extinction in the unique condition, and not in the common condition. Both groups showed a return in self-report ratings of US expectancy. Neither group showed a return in fear potentiated startle, but there was evidence that this may have been due to individual differences in emotional attentional control. It may be possible to enhance extinction and prevent a return of the physiological aspects of fear by manipulating attention during extinction. However, this does not appear to influence explicit expectancy of aversive outcomes. Individual differences in attentional control may influence this process. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
