5|$|The 2013 {{range of}} Naim {{equipment}} has aluminium chassis and sleeves; the fascia is die-cast zinc. Inside, circuit boards float, and the <b>rear-mounted</b> mains switch and IEC socket are decoupled to reduce microphony. Techradar {{noted that the}} XS, launched in late 2008, is the first Naim device to use a new bayonet PCB-mounting technique to float the circuitry.|$|E
5|$|The current model {{features}} a 250kg bomb matched to a nose-mounted guidance kit and a <b>rear-mounted</b> range extension kit, containing a rocket booster and enlarged fins. There {{is also a}} 125kg, first tested in 2009, and a proposed 1000kg version.|$|E
5|$|The {{ignition}} system {{consisted of two}} <b>rear-mounted,</b> crankshaft-driven magnetos, each supplying one {{of a pair of}} spark plugs fitted to each cylinder. This is common practise for aero engines, as it ensures continued operation {{in the case of a}} single magneto failure, and has the advantage of more efficient combustion over a single spark plug application.|$|E

5|$|Large {{sections}} of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt 1969 Dodge Charger. It {{appears to have been}} tuned for performance. A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a <b>rear-mounted</b> storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate the car in the chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E
5|$|The Henschel version used a {{conventional}} hull design with sloped armour resembling {{the layout of}} the Panther tank. It had a <b>rear-mounted</b> engine and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimeter-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on transverse torsion bars, in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls, the wheels were only overlapping without being interleaved — the full Schachtellaufwerk rubber-rimmed roadwheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the TigerI and Panther.|$|E
5|$|With the Norwegian {{operation}} requirements {{drawn up}} for a coastal reconnaissance floatplane, a series of modifications were requested to the original design. The changes included a redesign of the float structure to accommodate either a torpedo or bomb load carried under the center fuselage to supplement five underwing bomb racks. Additional armament changes led {{to a combination of}} six machine guns replacing the four machine gun (two fixed forward, two flexible <b>rear-mounted</b> 7.9mm)/one cannon (forward facing, fixed 20mm) arrangement that was in the initial design. Provision for a rear under-fuselage gun was also made. Further equipment requirements including fitting a rear fuselage-mounted camera as well as changes to instrumentation and radio equipment.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, AMT issued {{models of}} at least three {{different}} pieces of American LaFrance fire-fighting apparatus, including a pumper, a <b>rear-mount</b> aerial ladder truck, and a <b>rear-mount</b> articulating boom truck. The prototypes were selected to maximize the number of shared parts (e.g., almost all of the cab and diesel motor parts), apparently in order to minimize tooling costs. All 3 kits have been reissued by AMT-Ertl in recent years.|$|R
50|$|Options {{can include}} a fire {{suppression}} system, a 360 degree camera system, a GPS system, and a front- or <b>rear-mounting</b> self-recovery winch.|$|R
50|$|All DLT-registered {{vehicles}} {{are required to}} mount a registration plate in an easily visible position at the front and {{at the rear of}} the vehicle, except for motorcycles, for which only <b>rear-mounting</b> is required. Vehicles must also display an annual tax payment decal on the windshield or another visible location, depending on the type of vehicle.|$|R
5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a <b>rear-mounted</b> turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E
25|$|The DMC-12 {{features}} {{a number of}} unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted stainless-steel body panels, and a <b>rear-mounted</b> engine.|$|E
25|$|HM.1000 Balerit – 1986, two-seat factory-built microlight, pusher propeller, <b>rear-mounted</b> 64hp Rotax engine, {{designed}} by Mignet's son and nephew {{and used by}} the French Army.|$|E
50|$|Riverdale's local FDNY Fire Station is Engine 52/Ladder 52, {{located at}} 4550 Henry Hudson Parkway East in Central Riverdale. Engine 52/Ladder 52 {{is the only}} firehouse in Riverdale and the northernmost fire station {{operated}} by the FDNY. (Engine and Ladder 52 and Engine and Ladder 10 on Liberty Street in Lower Manhattan {{are the only two}} FDNY fire companies where the engine company and the ladder company have the same number.) Engine Company 52 currently operates a 2003 Seagrave Commander II Custom 1000/500 Pumper Engine and Ladder Company 52 currently operates a 2006 Seagrave Commander II Custom 100' <b>Rear-Mount</b> Aerial Ladder Truck.|$|R
25|$|Ladder Companies are {{generally}} equipped with Seagrave aerials. Ladder length varies and often {{depends on the}} geographic area to which the unit is assigned. Those in the older sections of the city often use tiller trucks to allow for greater maneuverability. Before Seagrave was the predominant builder, Mack CF's built with Baker tower ladders were popular. Most FDNY aerials are built with 75’, 95' or 100' ladders. Tiller ladders, rear mount ladders and mid-mount tower ladders are the types of trucks used. In 2010, The FDNY chose Ferrara over Pierce, and E-One for a new contract that issued for 10–100' <b>rear-mount</b> ladder trucks, using a chassis and stainless steel cab custom-designed to FDNY specifications. Delivery {{of the first of}} these new trucks is anticipated in the 1st quarter of 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Accordingly, Santos-Dumont had a Hargrave-cell (box kite-like) biplane {{powered by}} an Antoinette engine. The wings, each {{made up of}} three cells, were at the back and {{configured}} with pronounced dihedral to make the aircraft laterally stable. The [...] Antoinette liquid-cooled, fuel-injected V8 engine was mounted at the extreme rear end of the fuselage, itself located almost vertically equidistant between the biplane wing panels' wing roots, with the <b>rear-mount</b> engine driving a pusher propeller, and the pilot stood in a balloon basket immediately {{in front of the}} engine. A movable boxkite-style cell at the nose, pivoted on a universal joint within it and controlled by cables was intended for yaw and pitch control. This layout would later come to be called a [...] "canard configuration". It was constructed from bamboo and pine joined by aluminium sockets and was covered with Japanese silk.|$|R
25|$|Following two designs styled simply monoplanes Nos. 1 and 2, ASL's third {{design was}} called the Valkyrie. All three were of tail-first or canard layout with <b>rear-mounted</b> engines and pusher propellors.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Nissan {{introduced}} the GT-R featuring a <b>rear-mounted</b> transaxle. The AWD system requires two drive shafts, one main shaft {{from the engine}} to the transaxle and differential and a second drive shaft from the transaxle to the front wheels.|$|E
25|$|The MKR15 {{recovery}} variant {{is able to}} flat tow a 110,000 pound (49895kg) vehicle, is able to {{lift and}} tow a 96,000-pound (43545kg) vehicle, is equipped with <b>rear-mounted</b> winches with a 78,000 pound (35380kg) combined straight-pull rating, and a front-mounted self-recovery winch with a 20,000-pound (9072kg) straight-pull rating.|$|E
50|$|Sutphen {{produces}} {{all types}} of fire related vehicles on their own chassis including the usual engines, ladders, and rescues but also provides bodies for commercial chassis applications. The company still produces mid-mount aerials as either a tower ladder platform (with a bucket/basket) or in a ladder tower form (no bucket) plus industrial application aerials today. On April 21, 2016 at FDIC International the company debuted its first ever <b>rear-mount</b> aerial with the Sutphen SLR 75. The following year Sutphen previewed a 108-foot model. Previously, Sutphen had produced tillers in the 1990s including a unique tiller-tower concept where the bucket of the tiller aerial also acted as the tillerman's cab. The concept {{never made it to}} production. All Sutphen aerials are made of Aluminum alloys and fastened with aircraft-type Huck Bolts. The hydraulics are custom designed and built by the company for their applications.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{rebranding}} to Scania in 1968, Scania-Vabis {{had delivered}} {{a very limited}} number of CR76 chassis-frameworks (less actual bodywork) with transversally <b>rear-mounted</b> engine for external bodying, based on the complete bus with the same name. From 1968 it was also delivered as a standard bus chassis known as BR110.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} BMW had {{launched}} the 700, a small car with an air-cooled, <b>rear-mounted</b> 697cc boxer engine {{derived from the}} engine powering the R67 motorcycle. It was available as a 2-door sedan and as a coupe, both versions having been designed by Giovanni Michelotti. There was also a more powerful RS model for racing.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, BMW {{was seeking}} to broaden its model range through the {{addition}} of compact cars and SUVs. This sparked a series of compact car concept vehicles from the company during the early 1990s. The first were the E1 and Z13, powered by an electric motor and a <b>rear-mounted</b> 1100cc BMW motorcycle engine, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The Falcon 7X is a three-engined {{cantilever}} monoplane with a low-positioned, highly swept wing. It has {{a horizontal}} stabiliser at mid-height and a retractable tricycle landing gear, and three <b>rear-mounted</b> Pratt & Whitney PW307A turbofan engines : {{two on the}} side of the fuselage and one in a center position, and room for 20 passengers and two crew. It is the first production Falcon jet to offer winglets.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, de Dietrich debuted the Torpilleur (Torpedo) racer, which {{featured}} a four-cylinder engine and independent suspension in front, for the Paris-Amsterdam Trial; Gaudry wrecked en route, but still placed third. The response was substantial, exceeding one million gold francs. The 1899 torpilleur was less successful, despite underslung chassis, a <b>rear-mounted</b> monobloc four, and twin carburettors; poor preparation left {{none of the}} works teams able to complete the Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|Panniers {{or special}} luggage {{carriers}} (including waterproof packing bags) enable {{the transport of}} goods and are useful for shopping. Parents sometimes add <b>rear-mounted</b> child seats and/or an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar to transport children. Trailers of various types and load capacities may be towed to greatly increase cargo capacity. In many jurisdictions bicycles must be fitted with a bell; reflectors; and, after dark, front and rear lights.|$|E
25|$|Built {{mostly from}} aluminum, the XV-1 {{fuselage}} {{consisted of a}} streamlined tube mounted on skid landing gear, with a <b>rear-mounted</b> engine and a pusher propeller. It also had tapered stub wings mounted high on the fuselage. In turn, twin tailbooms and twin vertical surfaces, interconnected by a horizontal stabilizer elevator, were mounted to the wings. A three-bladed main rotor powered by blade tip pressure jets was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, above the wing roots.|$|E
25|$|It was {{at around}} this time that Rover, too, {{was working on a}} {{successor}} to the original Mini. Its first concept was the ACV30 which was unveiled at the 1997 Monte Carlo Rally. The name was partially an acronym of Anniversary Concept Vehicle, whilst the '30' represented the 30 years that had passed since a Mini first won the Monte Carlo Rally. The vehicle itself was a two-door coupe powered by a <b>rear-mounted</b> MG F engine.|$|E
25|$|While 1985 {{was to be}} {{the last}} year of the second {{generation}} model, delays in production of the third generation model led to a surplus of second generation Supras. During the first half of 1986 the 1985 P-type was still offered for sale, with only minor cosmetic changes as well as the addition of a now mandatory <b>rear-mounted</b> third brake light on the hatch. These were all labelled officially as 1986 models. P-types were the only model available in 1986.|$|E
25|$|A sports racing car—The Piranha—was {{developed}} {{around the}} same time, to demonstrate {{the use of a}} new plastic for the structural parts of the automobile— Cyclic ABS. This lightweight (1,400lb) vehicle was developed in several generations, using a <b>rear-mounted</b> Corvair engine. Model car company Aluminum Model Toys began small scale production of actual cars through their division run by Gene Winfield. Winfield was able to obtain feature placement of this car on television as The U.N.C.L.E. Car in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|$|E
25|$|Racks {{under the}} seats {{were used for}} {{ammunition}} and rations; additional racks behind the seat backs held the squad's rifles and other stowage. A small rack for mines was added {{on the outside of}} the hull just above the tracks. In combat, most units found it necessary to stow additional food, rucksacks and other crew stowage {{on the outside of the}} vehicle. Luggage racks were often added in the field, and very late vehicles had <b>rear-mounted</b> racks for this crew stowage.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{fuselage}} included a height differential between the two seats of the cockpit; this provided generous levels of visibility for the instructor in the rear seat. Each cockpit is fitted with a Martin-Baker Mk10B zero-zero rocket-assisted ejection seat. Air is fed to the aircraft's <b>rear-mounted</b> Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour engine via intakes {{on each of the}} forward wing roots. During the aircraft's development, Hawker had worked closely with Rolls-Royce to reduce the engine's fuel consumption and to ensure a high level of reliability.|$|E
25|$|Under license from Cierva in the 1920s and 1930s, the Pitcairn & Kellett {{companies}} made further innovations. Late-model autogyros {{patterned after}} Etienne Dormoy's Buhl A-1 Autogyro and Igor Bensen's designs feature a <b>rear-mounted</b> engine and propeller in a pusher configuration. The term Autogiro was a trademark of the Cierva Autogiro Company, and the term Gyrocopter {{was used by}} E. Burke Wilford who developed the Reiseler Kreiser feathering rotor equipped gyroplane {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. The latter term was later adopted as a trademark by Bensen Aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Tu-154 {{is powered}} by three <b>rear-mounted</b> low-bypass {{turbofan}} engines arranged similarly {{to those of the}} Boeing 727, but it is slightly larger than its American counterpart. Both the 727 and the Tu-154 use an S-duct for the middle (Number 2) engine. The original model was equipped with Kuznetsov NK-8-2 engines, which were replaced with Soloviev D-30KU-154 in the Tu-154M. All Tu-154 aircraft models have a relatively high thrust-to-weight-ratio which give excellent performance, at the expense of lower fuel efficiency. This became an important factor in later decades as fuel costs grew.|$|E
