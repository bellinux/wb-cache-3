25|$|There {{have been}} many calls for {{alternative}} approaches to rupture risk assessment over the past number of years, with many believing that a biomechanics-based approach may be more suitable than the current diameter approach. Numerical modeling is a valuable tool to researchers allowing approximate wall stresses to be calculated, thus revealing the rupture potential of a particular aneurysm. Experimental models are required to validate these numerical results and provide a further insight into the biomechanical behavior of the AAA. In vivo, AAAs exhibit a varying range of material strengths from localised weak hypoxic regions to much stronger <b>regions</b> <b>and</b> <b>areas</b> of calcifications.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation is {{extremely}} wasteful of water because the distribution infrastructure is old and poorly maintained. In 1993 only an estimated 5% of required maintenance expenditures was allocated. Overall, an estimated 70% of the nation's water supply network {{is in need}} of repair or replacement. The quality of drinking water from this aging system is poorly monitored—the water management staff has been cut drastically because of inadequate funds. Further, there is no money to buy new water disinfection equipment when it is needed. Some aquifers near industrial and mining centers have been contaminated by heavy metals, oils, and sanitary wastes. In addition, many localities rely on surface sources, making users vulnerable to agricultural runoff and livestock waste, which seep gradually downward from the surface. The areas of lowest water quality are the heavily populated regions of the Chui Valley and Osh and Jalal-Abad <b>Regions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>areas</b> along the rivers flowing into Ysyk-Köl.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} mode of {{operation}} for a TEM is the bright field imaging mode. In this mode the contrast formation comes from the sample having varying thickness or density. Thicker areas of the sample and denser areas or regions with a higher atomic number will block more electrons and appear dark in an image, while thinner, lower density, lower atomic number <b>regions</b> <b>and</b> <b>areas</b> with no sample in the beam path will appear bright. The term [...] "bright field" [...] refers to the bright background field {{where there is no}} sample and most of the beam electrons reach the image. The image is assumed to be a simple two dimensional projection of the sample's thickness and density down the optic axis, and to a first approximation may be modelled via Beer's law, more complex analyses require the modelling of the sample image to include phase information.|$|E
