2500|$|Free {{movement}} of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, 'Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States'. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all [...] "trading rules" [...] that are [...] "enacted by Member States" [...] which could hinder trade [...] "directly or indirectly, actually or potentially" [...] would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This [...] "wide test", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former [...] "Buy Irish" [...] company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities 'manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, [...] "protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants", [...] "national treasures" [...] of [...] "artistic, historic or archaeological value" [...] and [...] "industrial and commercial property." [...] In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association {{is one of the}} 'fundamental pillars of a democratic society', against which the free {{movement of}} goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less <b>restrictive</b> <b>measure</b> could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.|$|E
60|$|The magnanimity which resolved, {{that for}} principle's sake no {{efforts should be}} spared to crush a bestial despotism, was {{acknowledged}} by every manly spirit whom Party degenerating into Faction had not vitiated. That such was the dictate of confiding wisdom had long been inwardly felt; and the prudence of the course was evinced by the triumphant issue; but to the very completeness of this triumph may be indirectly attributed no {{small portion of the}} obloquy how heaped upon those advisers through whom it was achieved. The power of Napoleon Buonaparte was overthrown--his person has disappeared from the theatre of Europe--his name has almost deserted the columns of her daily and weekly Journals--but as he has left no Successor, as there is no foreign Tyrant of sufficient importance to attract hatred by exciting fear, many honest English Patriots must either find, or set up, something at home for the employment of those affections. This is too natural to occasion surprise; thousands are so framed, that they are but languidly conscious of their love of an object, unless while they feel themselves in an active state of aversion to something which they can regard as its opposite.--Thus we see Men, who had been proud of their attachment to his Majesty's Ministers, during the awful struggle, {{as soon as it was}} over, allowing on the first temptation that proud attachment to be converted into immoderate suspicion, and a long experienced gratitude into sudden alienation.--Through this infirmity, many were betrayed into taking part with the Men whom they had heretofore despised or condemned; and assisted them in reviling their own Government for suffering, among the States of the Continent, institutions to remain which the respective nations (surely the best, if not the only judges in the case) were unwilling to part with; and for having permitted things to be done, either just and proper in themselves, or if indeed abuses, abuses of that kind which Great Britain had neither right to oppose, nor power to prevent. Not a Frenchman is in arms in Spain! But (alas for the credit of the English Cabinet!) Ferdinand, though a lawful, appears to be a sorry King; and the Inquisition, though venerated by the People of Spain as a holy tribunal, which has spread a protecting shade over their religion for hundreds of years, is, among Protestants, an abomination! Is that, however, a reason why we should not rejoice that Spain is restored to the rank of an Independent nation; and that her resources do not continue at the disposal of a foreign Tyrant, for the annoyance of Great Britain? Prussia no longer receives decrees from the Tuilleries; but nothing, we are told, is gained by this deliverance; because the Sovereign of that Country has not participated, as far as became him, a popular effervescence; and has withheld from his subjects certain privileges which they have proved themselves, to all but heated judgments, not yet qualified to receive. Now, if numbers can blame, without cause, the British Cabinet for events falling below their wishes, in cases remote from their immediate concerns, the reasonableness of their opinions may well be questioned in points where selfish passion is touched to the quick.--Yes, in spite of the outcry of such Men to the contrary, every enlightened Politician and discerning Patriot, however diffident as to what was the exact line of prudence in such arduous circumstances, will reprobate the conduct of those who were for reducing public expenditure with a precipitation that might have produced a convulsion in the State. The Habeas Corpus Act is also our own near concern; it was suspended, some think without sufficient cause; not so, however, the Persons who had the best means of ascertaining the state of the Country; for they could have been induced to have recourse to a measure, at all times so obnoxious, by nothing less than a persuasion of its expediency. 'But persuasion (an Objector will say) is produced in many ways; and even that degree of it which in these matters passes for conviction, depends less upon external testimony than on the habits and feelings of those by whom the testimony is to be weighed and decided upon. A council for the administration of affairs is far from being as favourably circumstanced as a tribunal of law; for the Party, which is to pronounce upon the case, has had to procure the evidence, the sum and quality of which must needs have been affected by previously existing prejudices, and by any bias received in the process of collecting it.--The privileges of the subject, one might think, would never be unjustifiably infringed, if it were only from considerations of self-interest; but power is apt to resort to unnecessary rigour in order to supply the deficiencies of authority forfeited by remissness; it is also not unfrequently exerted merely to shew that it is possessed; to shew this to others while power is a novelty, and when it has long ceased to be so, to prove it to ourselves. Impatience of mind, moreover, puts men upon the use of strong and coarse tools, when those of lighter make and finer edge, with due care, might execute the work much better. Above all, timidity flies to extremes;--if the elements were at our command, how often would an inundation be called for, when a fire-engine would have proved equal to the service!--Much more might be urged in this strain, and similar suggestions are all that the question will admit of; for to suppose a gross appetite of tyranny in Government, would be an insult to the reader's understanding. Happily for the Inhabitants of Westmoreland, as no dispositions existing among them could furnish a motive for this <b>restrictive</b> <b>measure,</b> so they will not be sorry that their remoteness from scenes of public confusion, has placed them where they will be slow to give an unqualified opinion upon its merits. Yet it will not escape their discernment, that, if doubts might have been entertained whether the ignorant and distressed multitude, in other parts of the Island, were actually brought to a state that justified the suspension of this law, such doubts must have been weakened, if not wholly removed, by the subsequent behaviour of those in the upper ranks of society, who, in order to arraign the Government, and denounce the laws, have seized every opportunity of palliating sedition, if not of exculpating treason. O far better to employ bad men in the detection of foul conspiracies, than to excuse and shelter--(would that I were allowed to confine myself to these words)--than to reward and honour--every one that can contrive to make himself conspicuous by courses which, wherever they are not branded with infamy, find the national character in a state of degradation, ominous (if it should spread) for the existence of all that ought to be dear to Englishmen.|$|E

We investigated staff perspectives {{on the use of}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> with adolescents with mild ID in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} current Dutch policies on reduction. Method: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of Dutch care professionals. 195 staff members working in settings providing care for people with ID filled out the survey (response 68. 7 %). Results: If there is danger, physical aggression or sexually abusive behavior almost all (87. 8 – 96. 8 %) staff members consider the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> The most often mentioned goals of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> are averting or avoiding danger (90. 4 % and 83. 0 %). Furthermore 63. 8 % of staff members use <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> to calm adolescents. Very few staff were able to express how they could reduce the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> Conclusion: Physical and mechanical restrictions are generally considered most intrusive, but the results show awareness of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> on pedagogical grounds (e. g. limiting the use of mobile phones and social media). Current policies do not address these ‘pedagogical’ measures, making staff members question the lawfulness of their actions.

Results: During the period, there was an increase in support for restrictive policymeasures; in belief in the effectiveness of thesemeasures and in belief in the harm caused by drinking.

However, such a case is quite likely to occur in the future with the increasing usage of the kinds of measures mentioned above. Based on this concern, the "relationship between existing WTO rules and specific trade obligations set out in MEAs" has been included in the agenda for the Doha Round negotiations under the WTO (Doha Development Agenda). When such a case goes to the WTO dispute settlement proceedings, what status should be given to the MEA in question? Is it a valid scenario for WTO panels and the Appellate Body to give priority to a specific MEA over WTO agreements in accordance with the MEA's conflict of law rules or public international law, thereby confirming the WTO consistency of trade restrictive measures under that MEA? Academics have discussed at length whether MEAs and other non-WTO international law can become the applicable law in the WTO dispute settlement proceedings. This paper considers this problem by comparing and analyzing in detail the arguments of Joost Pauwelyn (Duke University Faculty of Law), who affirmatively answers this problem and of Joel Trachtman (The Fletcher School, Tufts University) who answers negatively. From the perspective of supporting the coherence of international law, this paper concludes by siding with Pauwelyn's argument. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} analyses {{the magnitude}} of the intergenerational correlation in worklessness in the UK using the two British birth cohorts. By using the British Cohort Study of those born in 1970, {{the magnitude of}} the intergenerational correlation of worklessness can be assessed for a new cohort {{for the first time in}} the UK and the trend in intergenerational worklessness can be considered across time. Two empirical identification strategies commonly used in the literature are applied to UK data and a third empirical strategy, utilising the recession of 1981 is introduced to attempt to identify causality. The intergenerational correlation in worklessness in the UK is large and has increased across time, although the differences in the coefficients are not statistically significant. When a more <b>restrictive</b> <b>measure</b> of sons’ worklessness is introduced, this difference becomes statistically significant. This suggests supportive evidence of the intergenerational mobility literature for the UK. There are no statistically significant findings on causality in intergenerational worklessness, driven by either measurement issues or a lack of causality. Intergenerational mobility, unemployment...|$|E
