5000|$|The {{military}} {{version with}} a sidecar (M12a SM) had a removable sidecar, a four-speed gearbox with <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> and <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> and separately operated drum brakes 220 mm in diameter. The FN M12a {{was introduced to}} the public in extensive use at an international military competition in July 1938 in Spa, Belgium. In 2012 an article in Motorrad Klassik described this combination as [...] "vastly superior to all military motorcycles with sidecar".|$|R
5000|$|The 666, {{like the}} corresonding {{medium-sized}} Fiat 626, was produced from 1940 as [...] "Unified" [...] truck: since 1937, by law, the War Department required all manufacturers of civilian trucks to have standard features regarding weight, number of axles, speed and capacity, {{in order to}} simplify logistics in case of requisition by the armed forces.The 626 and the 666, which replaced on assembly lines, respectively, the Fiat 621 and Fiat 632, were the first trucks of the Turin with forward control, and with the engine totally contained inside the cabin.The chassis was made of longitudinal members on two axels, with front-wheel steering and twin rear-wheel drive, a wheelbase and track width of 3.85 meters by 1.84 meters. The truck had a Fiat 366, 6-cylinder 9365 cc, diesel engine, which developed 105 hp at 2000 rpm and was characterized by the innovative layout of guides that allowed a quick and simple replacement from the front. The gearbox had 4 forward speeds and one <b>reverse</b> with <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b> Externally, it differed from the Fiat 626 only in size, the shape of the windscreen and the body. The trailers, with 6260 kg capacity (twice the 626), could carry 20 equipped soldiers.The vehicle was produced from 1940 to 1945 in civil and NM (Nafta Military) 666N diesel versions (nafta) for the armed forces. In 1943, the BM version gasoline was approved for military use, but the armistice prevented production.|$|R
50|$|The P-39, P-63, and Douglas XB-42 Mixmaster used V-1710-Es, exchanging the {{integral}} <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> for an extension shaft driving a remotely located <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> and propeller. Aircraft {{such as the}} P-38, P-40, P-51A, and North American P-82E used close-coupled propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gears,</b> {{a feature of the}} V-1710-F series.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this engine was the {{epicyclic}} propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> which contained a clutch designed to limit the maximum torque, thus protecting the <b>reduction</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rolls-Royce Falcon {{engine of}} 1915 {{featured}} epicyclic propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> which contained a clutch designed {{to limit the}} maximum torque, thus protecting the <b>reduction</b> <b>gears.</b> The later Merlin engine from the same company used opposite rotation <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> to provide counter-rotating propellers for twin-engined aircraft, a much cheaper method than designing and building the engines to run in opposite directions.|$|R
50|$|Engine No. 2 also {{received}} the new style cylinder banks and was tested both {{with and without}} the <b>reduction</b> <b>gear.</b> The direct drive and <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> units were interchangeable, and were switched between the two engines as needed.|$|R
