5|$|The USAD {{requires}} {{a diversity of}} achievement within each team; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by GPA. The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value {{regardless of whether it}} is from an advanced placement, honors, regular or <b>remedial</b> <b>class.</b> An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about {{different}} teacher’s ´conception of <b>remedial</b> <b>classes</b> and its function in Today´s School. “A school for everyone” the utopia that all schools and teachers aspire for. All pupils, regardless of ethnic background, class, and religious affiliation {{should be able}} to go to school without being segregated and are seen as different. A large part of the research at this moment shows a picture of segregated schools with <b>remedial</b> <b>classes.</b> If <b>remedial</b> <b>classes</b> cause segregation or inclusion is a dilemma that should be highlighted and discussed. Pupils who are in need of special support should be supported, without being segregated and perceived as different. To perform this study, qualitative interviews were made. Seven teachers have participated and gave their views on <b>remedial</b> <b>classes</b> and what function they fill for the school. My theory that has been used highlights two conditions at school. One is segregating integration with the compensatory perspective (kompensatoriska perspektivet), and the other is including integration with the democratic participatory perspective (deltagarperspektiv). The result shows that the teachers who were interviewed, despite the intentions of the  “A school for everyone” and with all risk that <b>remedial</b> <b>classes</b> carries with it, consider it compensatory perspective should be followed to accommodate all the pupils’ needs according to their conditions...|$|R

On October 3, Florescu married Rose-Henriette Le Roho d'Alcobia (born 1849), the orphaned scion of an Anglo-French-Portuguese family. According to one account, they did not have any children of their own, but later adopted a boy named Ion.

To rig the BLAAR, Dwight frames several students from the class by secretly putting items in their lockers that make it appear like they were responsible for the pranks. He also uses the opportunity to unlawfully fire Mr. Teller (Adam Pally), the compassionate <b>remedial</b> <b>class</b> teacher who, along with the other teachers, disagrees with Dwight and Stricker's antics and sees through Dwight's plan. Rafe immediately goes to Dwight’s office and begs him not to suspend the other students since he was the one responsible for the pranks; when Dwight refuses, Rafe creates a crazy dance party by activating the sprinkler system and fire alarm, which soaks the school and the students in colored dye that was intended to be yet another one of his pranks, which prompts Dwight to expel Rafe permanently.|$|E

Students obtain relatively little in the way of career counseling and directed study at most community colleges, of the type that appears to be quite effective at raising completion rates and subsequent earnings at proprietary training schools (Rosenbaum, 2001); as a result, their knowledge of and preparation for high-demand and well-paying jobs in the labor market, and of which courses of study might help them achieve higher earnings, is very limited.|$|R

40|$|The study aims to {{evaluate}} how teachers in my research have reasoned regarding gender and gender equality, notions on ethnicity, and specific conceptions or constructions on “swedish-ness” and “immigrants”. The vital {{point in this}} study will be {{to examine the relationship}} be-tween gender equality, ethnocentrism and racism. The question formulation that I have ap-plied are: On what grounds teachers conceive the concepts of gender and gender equality? How do teachers experience their work with gender equality in <b>remedial</b> <b>classes?</b> Do the teachers that work in <b>remedial</b> <b>classes</b> experience any obstacles in the pursuit of gender equal-ity in their daily work? I have used the method of qualitative interviews with five teachers in <b>remedial</b> <b>classes</b> from five different schools. As a theoretical perspective, I’ve applied the postcolonial perspective where the perception of “us” and “they” are central concepts. I have also used intersectionality as an analytical tool to take in account the different social categories all together. The result I came to was that the teachers in my study through their talk on gender equality did an ethnical distinction that polarized a “Swedish” way of being in relation to the “immi-grants”. Also, by talking about gender equality they positioned themselves as Swedes and defined the “immigrant family” as obstacles in the pursuit of equality. In particular, the teach-ers portrayed the “immigrant girl” as oppressed...|$|R
