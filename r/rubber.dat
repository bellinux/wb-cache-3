5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few <b>rubber</b> plants left in the {{concession}} that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the <b>rubber.</b> Once this process was completed the <b>rubber</b> tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of <b>rubber</b> plantations and the gathering of <b>rubber</b> from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government {{to reduce the size}} of its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting <b>rubber</b> within the confines of its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, Chinese Foochow {{settlers}} in Sibu tried {{to convert the}} town into a rice cultivation centre. However, this vision did not materialise because the soil was not suitable for rice cultivation. In August 1909, Charles Brooke agreed to grant land titles to Sibu Chinese farmers and encouraged them to cultivate <b>rubber</b> plantations. The rise of <b>rubber</b> prices from 1909 to 1911 had encouraged another 2,000 Foochow settles to come to Sibu. The demand for <b>rubber</b> rose again during Korean War between 1950 and 1953 and has benefited Sibu <b>rubber</b> plantations. Local farmers later used the profits from <b>rubber</b> plantations into setting up shops at Sungai Merah and Durin bazaars and involve in more profitable timber industry. During the Sarawak Communist Insurgency in the 1970s, rural farmers had to abandon their <b>rubber</b> plantations because of martial law declared by the state government which forbade them for helping the communists operating in the jungles.|$|E

This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the <b>rubber</b> fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final <b>rubber</b> layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The <b>rubber</b> sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} reports into the {{operation}} of the Free State were issued starting with the British Consul, Roger Casement's Casement Report and followed by reports commissioned by the Free State and Leopold II. These detailed unlawful killings and other abuses made by Abir and Leopold II was embarrassed into instituting reforms. These began with the appointment of American Richard Mohun by Leopold II as director of Abir. However, <b>rubber</b> exports continued to fall and rebellions increased, resulting in the Free State assuming control of the concession in 1906. Abir continued to receive a portion of profits from <b>rubber</b> exports and in 1911 was refounded as a <b>rubber</b> plantation harvesting company. The later history of the company is unknown but it was still active in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Abir {{collected}} 70 tons {{of dried}} <b>rubber</b> in 1895, rising to 410 tons in 1898 {{by which time}} it had eleven operational posts. At {{the same time the}} price of <b>rubber</b> also increased from 6.30–6.50 fr per kilogram in 1894 to 8.04–10.00 fr per kilogram in 1898. Abir's costs in 1897 amounted to 0.25 fr per kilogram to purchase the <b>rubber</b> from the collectors (in lieu of tax), 0.4 fr for transportation, 0.25 in export duty paid to the Congo Free State and 0.45 for storage for a total cost of 1.35 fr per kilogram. In the same year Abir could sell on the <b>rubber</b> in Europe for up to 10 fr per kilogram. Abir's profits rose with the increasing quantity and price of <b>rubber,</b> for the first two years (1892–94) the company recorded a total profit of 131,340 fr, this had increased almost twentyfold by 1898 when they recorded a 2,482,697 fr profit just for one year. As a result, the dividend paid in 1898 was 1,100 fr per 500 fr share. These profits were made in spite of increasing costs due the doubling of export duty in 1892 and the construction of the Leopoldville-Matadi railway in 1894 which increased the cost of moving <b>rubber</b> to the coast to 0.63 fr per kilo, more than the entire trip to Antwerp had taken in 1892.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} natural {{polyisoprene}} content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce <b>rubber.</b> The chemical structure of <b>rubber</b> from the mushroom consists of a high molecular mass homologue of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans isoprene units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase has been identified as required for the initiation of <b>rubber</b> synthesis in L.volemus and several other milk cap species.|$|E

5|$|The Abir Congo Company (founded as the Anglo-Belgian India <b>Rubber</b> Company {{and later}} {{known as the}} Compagnie du Congo Belge) was a company that {{exploited}} natural <b>rubber</b> in the Congo Free State, the private property of King Leopold II of Belgium. The company was founded with British and Belgian capital and was based in Belgium. By 1898 there were no longer any British shareholders and the Anglo-Belgian India <b>Rubber</b> Company {{changed its name to}} the Abir Congo Company and changed its residence for tax purposes to the Free State. The company was granted a large concession in the north of the country and the rights to tax the inhabitants. This tax was taken in the form of <b>rubber</b> obtained from a relatively rare <b>rubber</b> vine. The collection system revolved around a series of trade posts along the two main rivers in the concession. Each post was commanded by a European agent and manned with armed sentries to enforce taxation and punish any rebels.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural <b>rubber.</b> The <b>rubber</b> was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii <b>rubber</b> vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The <b>rubber</b> was gathered by tapping a <b>rubber</b> vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of <b>rubber</b> for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence <b>rubber</b> collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk <b>rubber.</b> By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E
5|$|The Free State was intended, above all, to be {{profitable}} for its investors and Leopold in particular. Its finances were frequently precarious. Early reliance on ivory exports {{did not make}} {{as much money as}} hoped and the colonial administration was frequently in debt, nearly defaulting on a number of occasions. A boom in demand for natural <b>rubber</b> in the 1890s, however, ended these problems as the colonial state was able to force Congolese males to work as forced labour collecting wild <b>rubber</b> which could then be exported to Europe and North America. The <b>rubber</b> boom transformed what had been an unexceptional colonial system before 1890 and led to significant profits. Exports rose from 580 to 3,740 tons between 1895 and 1900.|$|E
