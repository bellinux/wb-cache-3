The first machines brought to production were grain cleaning machines, later plow cultivators, potato sorters and in 1915 the first fertilizer spreader was put on the market. Early on Dreyer began exporting of his machinery; in 1906 the first grain cleaning machines were sold in Valparaíso, Chile. He substantiated this with his slogan: [...] "We must go out to the world". In 1942, the first potato harvesters were introduced to the market and in 1949 the seed drill machines and 1959, a manure spreader. In the 1960s, the two-disc ZA fertilizer spreaders and D4 seed drills were very successful, which helped Amazone to reach market leadership at this time. In 1967 the company entered into tillage and there developed the first Amazone manufactured PTO driven tillage equipment that could be used with a drill.

40|$|Non-chemical {{methods for}} weed control play an {{important}} role for the management of weeds in organic cropping systems in Europe. With the expansion of the organic area in recent years, more research has been conducted to develop new methods and improve management strategies. Currently, weed harrows, <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivators</b> and inter-row cultivators are the principal methods used for full-width treatments in large agricultural crops, such as cereals, oil seed rape, maize and pulses. The mechanical methods are often combined with cultural measures, e. g. stale seedbeds, delayed sowing, placement of fertilizers etc., to benefit from the additive and sometimes even synergistic effects of combining direct and cultural methods. In row crops, such as sugar beets and horticultural crops, thermal and mechanical methods are mostly combined to remove as many weeds in the rows as possible in order to minimize the need for manual weeding. Weeds growing between the rows are easily controlled by inter-row cultivation. Robotic weeding for intra-row weed control is now possible for transplanted crops, and inter-row hoes have been equipped with GPS-systems and cameras for optimizing precision and steering. Works on new GPS technology is currently focusing on seeding systems with the ability to create parallel or diamond crop establishment patterns, which enable inter-row hoeing to be conducted in different directions. So far, non-chemical methods have had little uptake in conventional farming but national and EU-based legislative initiatives may change the situation radically in the near future. Several European countries have launched pesticide action plans and the EU a new directive for the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM); all aiming for minimizing the reliance on herbicides. This is expected to accentuate the need for non-chemical methods...|$|R

40|$|The inland drift-sand {{areas in}} {{northern}} Europe are characterised by a rapid decline in both aeolian activity and areal size. Many former drift-sand surfaces have become immobilised by natural or man-induced processes, such as conversion into forest or other terrain for agricultural, economic or societal purposes. The sharp reduction {{of these areas}} automatically implies the disappearance in Western Europe of a unique landscape with a high natural and cultural-historic value. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} investigate how drift-sand areas can be preserved, how the balance between the active areas and those colonised with drift-sand vegetation can be kept under control, and how introducing techniques that reactivate, or benefit, the aeolian processes can counteract irreversible immobilisation by subsequent colonisation. Four such techniques (<b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator,</b> beach sand cleaner, disk harrow and excavator) were evaluated during an 8 -month experiment on drift-sand stabilised by grey hair grass and algae crusts at Kootwijkerzand, The Netherlands. The effect of the techniques was measured using five key-parameters: the raising and lowering of the surface due to aeolian activity, the horizontal sediment transport flux, the vertical sediment accumulation flux, changes in the grain size of the top layer due to aeolian processes, and changes in the organic matter content of the topsoil. The effect of each technique on soil compaction, surface roughness and the amount of plant residue left on the field is also discussed. The highest aeolian activity (horizontal and vertical flux, surface lowering) was observed on test fields treated with the beach sand cleaner and the <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator.</b> The changes in grain size and organic matter content of the top layer were also highest in these fields. Of the four techniques tested, the beach sand cleaner and the <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator</b> are thus the most recommendable methods to reactivate drift-sand stabilised by grey hair grass and algae crusts.

40|$|If 2 ̆ 2 tillage 2 ̆ 2 {{is defined}} as the {{mechanical}} manipulation of soil, it follows, then, that a 2 ̆ 2 tillage system 2 ̆ 2 would be the sequence of soil-manipulation operations performed in producing a crop. Today, however, such a definition is recognized as inadequate. We know, for instance, that the management of non-harvested plant tissue (i. e., residue) affects both crop production and soil erosion, and that field operations in which the soil is not tilled have a marked influence on soil condition. Therefore, in this publication, a tillage system is the sequence of all operations involved in producing the crop, including soil manipulation, harvesting, chopping or shredding of residue, application of pesticides and fertilizers, etc. But before describing and comparing the various tillage systems for corn, some terminologies and possible points of confusion need to be addressed. These have to do with primary vs. secondary tillage and the different ways in which similar tillage systems could be defined. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY TILLAGE For many tillage systems, the specific operations can be separated into 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secondary. 2 ̆ 2 Primary tillage loosens and fractures the soil to reduce soil strength and to bring or mix residues and fertilizers into the tilled layer. The implements (2 ̆ 2 tools 2 ̆ 2) used for primary tillage include moldboard, chisel and disk plows; heavy tandem, offset and one -way disks; subsoilers; and heavy -duty, powered rotary tillers. These tools usually operate deeper and produce a rougher soil surface than do secondary tillage tools; however, they differ from each other as to amount of soil manipulation and amount of residue left on or near the surface. Secondary tillage is used to kill weeds, cut and cover crop residue, incorporate herbicides and prepare a seedbed. The tools include light- and medium -weight disks, field <b>cultivators,</b> <b>rotary</b> hoes, drags, powered and unpowered harrows and rotary tillers, rollers, ridge- or bed -forming implements, and numerous variations or combinations of these.

The background to the experiment was a 2005 study showing potentially higher yield, higher cleanness and higher sugar con tent when primary tillage was carried out to 35 cm depth with a <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator.</b> On four field sites in Skåne (L:a Isie, Ädelholm, Stävie and Vragerup), five different treatments were compared: mouldboard ploughing in the autumn to 20 cm; mouldboard ploughing in the autumn to 20 cm + rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the autumn to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; and mouldboard ploughing in the spring to 20 cm. The <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator</b> used in the treatments is manufactured by a Dutch company, Imants. The implement cultivates the soil with spade tines fitted on arms that are mounted on a horizontal rotating PTO-driven axle. Beet plants were inspected and yield determined in the experiment, and three soil parameters were examined: penetration resistance, water infiltration and infiltration of blue dye. Root shape was also examined. The site at Stävie was not harvested due to poor beet establishment. At the other sites, the highest yield was found when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. Pooling of the results from the three harvested sites showed that the yield was significantly higher (+ 4 %) and the sugar content was also significantly higher (+ 0. 3 %) when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn compared with conventional mouldboard ploughing in the autumn. The penetration resistance tended to be lower and the water infiltration rate higher when soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. The amount of blue colour covering the soil was also higher.

Soil organic carbon content, aggregate stability, saturated hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, root length density and rooting depth were all less under ryegrass than kikuyu pasture. There was, however, no consistent effect of pasture-type on pore size distribution or penetrometer resistance. Differences in penetrometer resistance were most obvious in the 10 - 30 cm layer with subsurface compaction being evident at some sites under both types of pasture. This was attributed to the treading effects of grazing cattle plus formation of a compacted layer at the depth of tillage under ryegrass pastures. Subsoil tillage of a ryegrass pasture resulted in a substantial reduction in penetrometer resistance in the compacted 10 - 20 cm layer and increases in hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, root length density and rooting depth.

40|$|The {{positive}} effects on soil tilth from cropping and fertilisation are prone to destructive forces from traffic and tillage. This presentation provides results from a project aiming to quantify {{the relative importance of}} crop rotation, fertilisation and traffic/tillage and their interactions. The investigation includes a field trial established 1986 on loamy sand and another initiated 1997 on a sandy loam. All 1986 -trial plots are grown with annual cash crops. Annual incorporation of animal slurry and straw residues is compared to reference plots receiving no organic matter. In the 1997 -trial, a diversified crop rotation including grass ley and catch crops is compared to a sequence of annual cash crops excluding catch crops. The latter treatment is performed with and without annual application of animal slurry. In both trials, half of all plots were mechanically compacted by tractor the year prior to investigation. The 1986 -trial also included part-plots intensively tilled with a <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator.</b> Results obtained so far in the 1997 -trial indicate that soil organic carbon, microbial biomass, hyphal lengths and soil pore volume are significantly increased by manure application but especially by the diverse crop rotation. In contrast, clay dispersibility and wet aggregate stability were not significantly affected. Hence, biological soil attributes may serve as early indicators of soil quality changes. In the 1986 -trial, significant effects of the organic matter treatment were apparent for some biological (microbial biomass), chemical (total and hot-water extractable organic C) and physical (bulk soil strength and friability) attributes.

The results showed that a maximum temperature of 63 °C at a 25 mm depth was observed with a steam dose of 2. 78 kg m- 2. With a 2. 78 kg m- 2 dose, the operative time was approximately 14 h ha- 1 and total fuel consumption was 768 kg ha- 1. An estimated mean steam dose of 2. 3 kg m- 2 could be able to provide similar yield and hand weeding times responses to the highest steam dose applied, thus reducing both the operative time and fuel consumption of the machine...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{competition}} {{is a major}} problem in organic agriculture, because the use of herbicides is prohibited. Vegetable crops are generally the most sensitive from this point of view, especially the sown ones, because they often need plenty of time for emergence. This often implies a large effort for hand weeding in the rows, which are very difficult to be treated physically in a selective way. Soil steaming could be a possible solution for preventive weed control/weed seedbank depletion in organic/integrated low-competitive vegetable crops, in order to reduce labor time for in-row hand-weeding. The effect of bioflash system (consisting in the distribution of steam and CaO) on weed seedbank was “exploited” to develop a new machine for “band-steaming”. In this case, steaming is performed just in strips, where the crop will be successively sown. Each strip corresponds to one crop row. The machine is drawn and is equipped with a water tank, a hopper containing the exothermic compound (CaO) and an industrial steam generator providing an outflow of about 1300 kg h- 1. The steam generator unit is connected to a 5. 10 m wide, PTO-driven <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator</b> with 12 units. Each unit is connected to a steam pipe and is characterized by the rotating tool and a carter which bears the steaming bar. The tested working speed ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 5 km h- 1. The steam injection is superficial in order to kill the weed seeds till a depth of about 5 cm. The prototype has been tested on carrot in four organic farms spread throughout Italy. The results are encouraging as the soil temperature peak was about 80 °C and the weed emergence reduction, 10 days after planting, ranged on average from 70 % up to over 90 %. On average the 50 % of labour demand for hand weeding was saved (about 200 h ha- 1). However the machine needs to be improved {{in order to make the}} steam injection more efficient and this treatment more sustainable (more effective and cheaper) ...|$|E
40|$|Yield {{and soil}} mapping {{were carried out}} in 2007 and 2008 in a 9. 1 ha {{commercial}} olive tree plantation for olive oil production. The orchard is in the southern Peloponnese, where olives are cultivated extensively for {{extra virgin olive oil}} production. The field is planted in rows with about 1650 trees in total. Weed control was practiced during the previous 3 years using post emergence herbicides under no-tillage over about 2 / 3 of the field, and over the remaining 1 / 3 by mechanical weeding using a <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator.</b> For yield mapping, olives were collected manually using rods to shake the tree shoots and letting the olives fall onto a plastic net covering the ground. Sacks of approximately 58 kg capacity were filled with olives from as many adjacent trees as were needed to fill a sack. The location of the sacks, or group of closely placed sacks, was identified using a commercial GPS (5 m resolution). In addition, 91 cores of soil were taken at a depth of 0 - 30 cm on a 30 -m systematic sampling grid corresponding to a density of 10 soil samples per ha. The soil properties measured were penetration resistance, soil texture, organic matter, pH, P, NO(3) -N, K, Mg, Zn, Mn, Fe, B and Ca contents. The effect of the method of weed control on the soil condition for post emergence herbicides under no-tillage versus rotary cultivation was evaluated on the basis of soil organic matter content and penetration resistance. The data were analyzed using both descriptive statistics and geostatistical methods. Maps were created as a basis for site-specific management of P, K and lime, and these were applied 15 days after harvest in the winter of 2008. The results indicated considerable spatial variation in yield and soil properties. The soil organic matter content was about 22 % greater and the penetration resistance about 26 % less in the areas under no-tillage. The mean pH increased from 5. 9 to 7. 0 as a result of lime application in the areas with pH below 6. 5...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the geological development of the north-western Europe. Various aeolian deposits such as inland dunes, river dunes, cover sands, drift sands and coastal dunes, form the base of large areas in our present landscape. The role of wind erosion in today's north-west European landscapes is, besides in coastal dunes, mainly related to arable fields (on light sandy soils), and to some active remnants of the inland drift-sand areas. In both latter cases there is an urgent need to manage the wind-erosion process. The aim of this PhD thesis is to develop management tools and strategies to control unwanted and wanted wind erosion. On arable land the main objective of managing the wind erosion process is to minimize the on- and off-site damage by reducing erosion risk. The extent, frequency, intensity of wind erosion events, and thereby their on-site and off-site effects, is controlled by soil characteristics, climate and human activities. Field surveys in areas with light sandy soils in four European countries showed that the erosion risk on agricultural land on light sandy soils is controlled by the cropping system, openness of the landscape and farmers practices. Scenario runs with the WEELS wind erosion model give insight into the general change in erosion risk per month. The simulations point to major changes in erosion risk for changes in a wind-break network, but relatively small changes in erosion risk for the tested cropping systems and climate-change scenario's. With this information, the possible consequences for on-site and off-site damage can be estimated, and from this estimation, additional (policy) measures for controlling wind erosion can be formulated for the region in question. There are enough effective land-management techniques available to minimise the erosion risk to an acceptable level. Voluntary measures based on good agricultural practice work well in a cropping system with high valuable crops and farmers financial benefit from control measures. However, additional policy measures such as mandatory measures and subsidies are needed in case of cropping systems with low or negative net profits and in case of high risk for off-site damage for instance in the period after harvesting when the soil is not longer protected by a crop. Inland drift-sand areas, on the contrary suffer from a lack of wind erosion activity. In the remnant active drift-sand areas with nature as main land-use type, which were saved from the large scale forestation schemes at the begin of the twentieth century, an ecologically high valuable vegetation and fauna developed. The role of wind erosion as main landscape differentiating process has changed to a local process with limited impact on the further development of the drift-sand areas. The general trend is an ongoing reduction of wind erosion activity and further colonisation of the drift sands by vegetation. This development  addresses the reduced openness of the landscape, change in land-use, the limited size of the remainder open drift-sand areas, the relative high nitrogen-deposition and the invasion by exotic plant species. Without sufficient erosion activity the drift-sand pioneer vegetation turns into a grass dominated vegetation and eventually in forest. To maintain the positive interaction between erosion and the pioneer vegetation in the remaining active drift-sand areas, it is necessary to keep the active (bare) areas open (process management). In practice several tillage techniques are used by the terrain managers. Of these the beach-sand cleaner and the <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator</b> proved to be most effective to reactivate drift sand areas with a pioneer vegetation cover. At the same time the complete top soil needs to be removed to set back the succession (pattern management) in parts of the areas covered with higher succession stages. This can go hand in hand with reactivation of wind erosion on locations in order to slow down the succession rate. In that case the treated area should be at least 5 to 10 ha to guarantee a positive impact of erosion on the surrounding area. Other criteria are: the presence of a sufficient amount of erodible sand and an optimum erosive wind force...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was initiated to obtain some understanding on the behaviour of soil at higher moisture content {{and to explore}} the potential of preparing paddy fields with reduced amounts of water. This investigation comprised of three separate studies. Based on existing information that water could be reduced when soil clods were initially formed prior to flooding, the effects of clod size, clod initial moisture content and confining states on the rate of water uptake were explored. The moisture gradients within clods wetted and dried for different period of times were also studied. The results of the clod wetting experiments show that· the rate of water uptake by capillarity was greatest when clods were initially very dry and smaller clods tended to absorb water faster than bigger clods when under confined conditions. Confining {{had no effect on}} infiltration when the initial condition was very wet. On drying, the smallest clod dried the fastest, reduced greater volume and increased its dry bulk density significantly. Larger clods required,longer drying period to arrive at a uniform moisture profile within as compared to smaller clods. Results from the wetting experiments were tested against the infiltration model of. Jarvis and Leeds-Harrison (1987) and a model developed based on linear flow of heat into a solid (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959). A second project involved the study of soil deformation at high moisture contents in an attempt to produce clods with minimum draught force using simple relieved tines at various rake angles and depths in a soil tank. The principal. objective of the - ii - study was to utilise soil implement mechanics knowledge to improve the efficiency of soil preparation for wetland crops. Aspects like the nature of soil disturbance, extent of disturbance and draught requirement were investigated. The soil was in a plastic consistency prepared to three specified density states of 940, 1000 and 1250 kg/m 3 • The soil disturbance pattern was monitored using implanted coloured beads and glass sided tank studies. In addition, the extent and height of heave and surface disturbance were noted. Predictive models based upon Mohr-Coulomb soil mechanics theory were developed to predict the interaction between the soil and simple implements at three rake angles. These were based on the lateral failure theory of Godwin and Spoor (1977) and the two dimensional soil failure model of Hettiaratchi and Reece (1974). Results from the single tine study were tested against the models. A sliding resistance component and crescent effect were incorporated to improve the predictions for the 45 ° and 90 ° rake angle tines. The magnitude of each mode of failure is dependent upon the critical aspect ratio which varies with tine rake angles and soil conditions. The mode of failure is considered to be lateral when the tine aspect ratio is larger than the critical aspect ratio and an upward failure when the tine aspect ratio is lower than the critical aspect ratio. The predicted results are in close agreement with the results of the experimental studies. For the backward raked tine, a model was developed based on the formation of an elliptical wedge and bearing capacity type of failure ahead and below the wedge. This failure theory was based on the bearing capacity failure for deep footings. The model - iii - helped identify an additional parameter that influenced the draught force for a backward raked tine. This parameter is the sliding resistance component on both sides and beneath the elliptical soil wedge •. Results from multitine studies showed that draught force increased with tine spacinq but the increase was not significant. In the wet condition the tines merely cut slots and little or no interaction was noted. In an effort to find the optimum water level for soil puddlinq, a laboratory study was conducted to determine the influence of water-soil ratio on the ease of puddling air dry aqqreqates. Soil puddlinq was carried out usinq a·rotary stirrer simulatinq the rotary motion of a <b>rotary</b> <b>cultivator</b> commonly used in wetland preparation •. The results obtained showed that· the fastest dispersion of particles resultinq in a minimum wet bulk density of 1. 23 Mg/m 3, was achieved at a water-soil ratio of 1. 2. (A supersaturated condition equivalent to a moisture content of 120 % dry basis). Increasing the water-soil ratio above this value did not change the wet bulk density value for all stirring times...|$|E
