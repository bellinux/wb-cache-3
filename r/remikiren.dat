5000|$|Direct renin inhibitors {{can also}} be used for hypertension. The drugs that inhibit renin are {{aliskiren}} and the investigational <b>remikiren.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Remikiren</b> is a renin {{inhibitor}} {{under development}} {{for the treatment of}} hypertension (high blood pressure). It was first developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Compounds in this {{generation}} were more potent, more stable and had longer durations of action. One of these, CGP2928, a peptidomimetic compound, {{was the first}} renin inhibitor proven effective when taken orally. Tested on marmosets, it was only active at high doses. Development of new drugs in the second generation continued to improve pharmacokinetic properties. <b>Remikiren,</b> enalkiren and zankiren were then discovered. These were peptidomimetic inhibitors with improved structures that made them more specific, potent and stable. Unfortunately, clinical development was terminated because the drugs had poor oral bioavailability (poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized) and lowering blood pressure activity still remained low.|$|E
50|$|Pepstatin, {{which was}} {{described}} in 1972, was the first synthetic renin inhibitor, but poor pharmacokinetic properties prevented it from entering in vivo investigations. The first generation of renin inhibitors, such as H-142, were peptide analogues of angiotensinogen. However, these inhibitors had also limited drug-like properties. Hopes of breakthrough appeared in 1982 when development of the second generation renin inhibitors began. This generation consisted of peptide-like compounds, such as <b>remikiren,</b> enalkiren and zanikiren. They had more drug-like rather than substrate-like properties, and in 1990 they went to clinical trials. The second generation had its limitations and never completed clinical trials.|$|E
40|$|<b>Remikiren</b> is an orally {{available}} renin inhibitor with {{an established}} blood pressure-lowering effect {{in patients with}} essential hypertension. No data {{are available on the}} renal effects of <b>remikiren</b> in humans. We therefore studied the effects of a single oral administration of <b>remikiren</b> on blood pressure and renal function in 16 patients with essential hypertension on a restricted dietary sodium intake. <b>Remikiren</b> induced a peak fall in mean arterial pressure of 8. 5 +/- 0. 8 %. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained stable, whereas the effective renal-plasma flow rose by 11. 3 +/- 1. 4 %. As a consequence, the filtration fraction and the renal vascular resistance fell by 11. 7 +/- 1. 2 % and 17. 6 +/- 1. 3 %, respectively. These systemic and renal hemodynamic changes were more pronounced in individuals with a higher initial immunoreactive renin. <b>Remikiren</b> induced a significant rise in the fractional excretion of sodium [0. 38 % (0. 24 - 0. 52) to 0. 50 % (0. 31 - 0. 76) ] and lithium [28. 7 % (25. 0 - 32. 4) to 33. 2 % (27 - 39. 4) ]. Moreover, <b>remikiren</b> induced a decrease in urinary albumin excretion [497 (268 - 815) to 252 (114 - 389) mu g/h]. In patients with essential hypertension, a single oral dose of <b>remikiren</b> can induce a renal vasodilation, without affecting the GFR and despite a significant decrease in blood pressure. This systemic and renal hemodynamic response is more pronounced in case of a more activated renin-angiotensin system...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Remikiren</b> is an orally active renin {{inhibitor}} {{with established}} antihypertensive efficacy. As a single dose it induces renal vasodilatation, suggesting specific renal actions. Data on the renal effects of continued treatment by renin inhibition are not available, either {{in subjects with}} normal, or in subjects with impaired renal function. Methods. The effect of 8 days of treatment with <b>remikiren</b> 600 mg o. i. d. on blood pressure, renal haemodynamics, and proteinuria was studied in 14 hypertensive patients with normal or impaired renal function. The study was conducted on an ambulatory in-hospital basis and was designed in a single-blind, longitudinal order. Results. <b>Remikiren</b> induced a significant peak fall in mean arterial pressure of 11. 2 +/- 0. 8 %, with corresponding trough values of - 6 +/- 0. 8 %. This fall was somewhat more pronounced in the patients with renal function impairment (- 13. 3 vs - 9. 6 %; P < 0. 01). Glomerular filtration rate remained stable, whereas effective renal plasma flow increased from 301 +/- 35 to 330 +/- 36 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2) (P < 0. 05). Filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance fell by 10 +/- 2 % and 15 +/- 2 % respectively (both P < 0. 01). <b>Remikiren</b> induced a cumulated sodium loss of - 82 +/- 22 mmol and a positive potassium balance of 49 +/- 9 mmol (both P < 0. 01). During <b>remikiren,</b> proteinuria fell by 27 % (range - 18 to - 38 %; P < 0. 01) in the patients with overt proteinuria at onset (n = 6). In {{the remainder of the}} patients albuminuria fell by 20 % (range - 1 to - 61 %, P < 0. 05). No side-effects were observed. Conclusions. Continued treatment with <b>remikiren</b> induced a sustained fall in blood pressure, renal vasodilatation, negative sodium balance, and a reduction in glomerular protein leakage. These data are consistent with a renoprotective potential of renin inhibition...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to compare the effects of three potent {{reference}} renin inhibitors (<b>remikiren,</b> CGP 38560 A, and enalkiren) in sodium-depleted normotensive squirrel monkeys. In these monkeys, arterial pressure was measured in the conscious state with a telemetry system. Oral and intravenous maximal effective doses of the three renin inhibitors were compared in parallel groups of monkeys. In additional experiments, <b>remikiren</b> was given on top of either CGP 38560 A or enalkiren in the same animals. Finally, the three drugs were compared with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril. The effects of the three drugs on the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system (plasma renin activity, immunoreactive renin, and immunoreactive angiotensin II concentrations) were also measured. Our results show that <b>remikiren</b> was as effective as cilazapril and markedly more effective than CGP 38560 A or enalkiren in reducing arterial pressure in our monkey model. Interestingly, these differences in arterial pressure could not be explained by differences of in vitro potency or different biochemical changes of the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system, because the inhibitors all reduced immunoreactive angiotensin II to similarly low levels. One possible explanation is that, in our model, <b>remikiren</b> in contrast to CGP 38560 A and enalkiren is able to inhibit renin in a functionally important extraplasmatic compartment.

40|$|Section I of this thesis- Pharmacology- {{focuses on}} the {{systemic}} and renal effects of the specific renin inhibitor <b>remikiren</b> (Ro 42 - 5892) in hypertensive patients with different degrees of renal function impairment. It tests the hypothesis that <b>remikiren</b> is an effective antihypertensive agent with a favorable renal profile. This was the first study on the renal effects of an orally administered renin inhibitor in this target population. In section II- Pathophysiology- the renin inhibitor {{is used as a}} specific pharmacologic tool to study the role of the RAAS in the pathophysiology of renal sodium handling in primary hypertension. Since it is not feasible to measure local intrarenal RAAS-activity, the response to <b>remikiren</b> was used as a surrogate indicator for the state of activation of the RAAS. In these studies we tested the hypothesis that dysregulation of the (intrarenal) RAAS, leading to inappropriately elevated levels of the effector hormone angiotensin II, plays al role in the impaired renal sodium handling and abnormal renal hemodynaics, either or not in mutual interaction, in primary hypertension.

40|$|Pressure {{natriuresis}} (PN), i. e., {{a rise in}} renal sodium excretion {{in response}} to a higher BP, is involved in long-term BP regulation. PN is blunted in essential hypertension, but the mechanism is unknown. This study assessed the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in PN in eight essential hypertensive men from the individual correlations between spontaneous fluctuations in BP and time corresponding changes in sodium excretion (collected at 2 - and 4 -h intervals for 48 h), during strict sodium balance, without treatment, and during renin inhibition (<b>remikiren,</b> 600 mg oral compound). Without treatment, daily values for mean arterial pressure were 109. 5 +/- 1. 9 and 107 +/- 1. 9 mmHg, for urinary sodium excretion were 37. 2 +/- 2. 8 and 42. 0 +/- 2. 8 mmol/ 24 h, and for plasma renin activity were 2. 34 +/- 0. 48 and 2. 23 +/- 0. 44 nmol/L per h, respectively, for two consecutive days. During <b>remikiren</b> treatment, mean arterial pressure was 101. 9 +/- 1. 7 and 100. 8 +/- 1. 7 mmHg (P < 0. 05, versus baseline). Urinary sodium excretion was 39. 3 +/- 3. 7 and 45. 2 +/- 5. 3 mmol/ 24 h (not significant versus baseline), and plasma renin activity was 0. 79 +/- 0. 11 and 0. 82 +/- 0. 13 nmol/L per h (P < 0. 05 versus baseline). During <b>remikiren</b> treatment, BP correlated positively with sodium excretion in all patients but in only three of eight patients without treatment. The slope of the regression equation was steeper during <b>remikiren</b> treatment in seven of eight patients. Thus, the relationship between BP and natriuresis was more readily apparent during RAAS blockade, suggesting that RAAS activity blunts PN in hypertensive patients. Improved PN may contribute to the hypotensive effect of RAAS blockade and to maintenance of sodium balance at a lower BP level without volume expansion...|$|E
40|$|Background In {{essential}} hypertension an elevated renal vascular resistance (RVR) {{may be a}} marker of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-mediated impairment of renal sodium excretion. This hypothesis was tested by investigating whether, in subjects with {{essential hypertension}}, the natriuretic response to specific renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade by renin-inhibitor <b>remikiren</b> could be predicted from pretreatment renal vascular tone. Materials and methods Renal hemodynamics, {{and the effects of}} single (n = 17) and multiple doses (n = 8, 8 days) of <b>remikiren</b> (600 mg day(- 1)) on sodium excretion were studied under conditions of carefully controlled sodium balance. Results Pretreatment renal vascular tone showed considerable individual differences: filtration fraction (FF) ranged from 21. 2 to 30. 3 % and RVR from 18. 8 to 33. 5 10 (- 2) mmHg min mL(- 1) in the single dose study, and FF from 20. 8 to 24. 9 % and RVR from 14. 8 to 28. 8 10 (- 2) mmHg min mL(- 1) in the multiple dose study. <b>Remikiren</b> induced a fall in blood pressure, FF and RVR, with considerable interindividual variability in natriuretic response. During single dose, cumulative sodium loss was 5. 1 mmol per 5 h (- 8. 8 to + 24. 6), whereas after 8 days treatment cumulative sodium loss was 72 +/- 30 mmol (- 46 to + 187). The natriuretic response to <b>remikiren</b> during single as well as multiple dose significantly correlated with pretreatment renal vascular tone (estimated from FF and RVR) but not with remikiren-induced changes in renal hemodynamics or in hormonal parameters. Cumulative sodium loss was largest in patients with a higher pretreatment FF and RVR (r = 0. 74, P < 0. 001 and r = 0. 52, P < 0. 05, respectively, single dose; and r = 0. 75, P < 0. 05 and r = 0. 73, P < 0. 05, respectively, multiple dose). Conclusion These data support the hypothesis that in essential hypertension an elevated renal vascular tone is a marker of RAAS-mediated impairment of sodium excretion...|$|E
40|$|Background. In glomerular disease {{proteinuria}} {{usually has}} a circadian pattern with maximum excretion during the day. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) {{results in a}} 50 % reduction of proteinuria as measured in 24 -h urine collections. We questioned whether anti-proteinuric treatment by blockade of the RAS is as effective during the day as during the night. Methods. We analysed data from two intervention studies on proteinuria in patients with non-diabetic renal disease. In the first study, six hospitalized patients (proteinuria 5. 8 +/- 2. 9 g/day) were treated with the renin-inhibitor <b>remikiren</b> 600 mg o. d. during 8 days. In the second study eight ambulant patients (proteinuria 7. 5 +/- 2. 7 g/day) were treated during 6 weeks with the ACE-inhibitor trandolapril 4 mg o. d. Urine was collected in a day-and in a night-time portion. Results. Daytime proteinuria declined from 0. 29 +/- 0. 15 to 0. 22 +/- 0. 11 g/h (P < 0. 05) during <b>remikiren</b> and from 0. 33 +/- 0. 14 to 0. 16 +/- 0. 08 g/h (P Conclusion. In both studies relative nocturnal therapy resistance to the antiproteinuric effect of RAS blockade was found, despite 24 -h efficacy of blood pressure effect. This may have clinical relevance because it contributes to rest-proteinuria and thus may affect long term renal function outcome. It may be worthwhile to explore alternative therapeutic regimens to improve the nocturnal antiproteinuric response...|$|E

40|$|Standard {{treatments}} {{available today}} for treating hypertension is diuretics, β-blockers, {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} inhibitors (ACEs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, a-blockers, vasodilators, and centrally acting drugs. It is difficult to achieve the optimized renin angiotensin aldosterone system suppression with currently available antihypertensive agents, because ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics all activate the compensatory feedback mechanism that increases renin release and increase plasma renin activity. The first orally active direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) were developed in 1980 s, including enalkiren, <b>remikiren,</b> and zankiren. However, poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, less bioavailability (< 2 %), short half life, and low potency hindered {{the development of these}} compounds.

40|$|Many {{patients}} with essential hypertension {{respond to a}} high dietary sodium intake with a rise in blood pressure. Experimental {{evidence suggests that the}} renal hemodynamic response to sodium determines, at least partially, this rise in blood pressure. Our aim was to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the renal and systemic adaptation to a change in dietary sodium. We studied changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (millimeters of mercury), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), body weight, and immunoreactive renin in 17 {{patients with}} essential hypertension and 15 normotensive control subjects, randomly crossing over between a 3 -week sodium-restricted (50 mmol/ 24 h) and a sodium-replete (200 mmol/ 24 h) diet period. In addition, the effects of renin inhibition by <b>remikiren</b> (600 mg, single oral dose) were studied during the high sodium period.

40|$|The use {{of drugs}} that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system {{is one of the}} {{effective}} way to intervene in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disorders, especially in hypertension treatment. The idea of blocking the renin system at its origin by renin inhibitor has existed for more than 30 years. Renin inhibitor supresses the covension of angiotensinogen into angiotensin, and further deacreases the generation of the active peptide angiotensin II. The first generation (enalkiren) and second generation (<b>remikiren)</b> of orally active renin inhibitors were never used clinically because of low bioavailability and weak blood pressure-lowering activity. At present, aliskiren is the first non-peptide orally active renin inhibitor of the third generation to progress to phase III clinical trials and was approved by U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2007. Aliskiren becomes the first renin inhibitor with indications for the treatment of hypertension in Indonesia, a compounds with improved oral bioavailability, specificity and efficacy.

40|$|The {{application}} of a new hybrid RF/DC quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer to support drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies is described. The instrument {{is based on a}} quadrupole ion path and is capable of conventional tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) as well as several high-sensitivity ion trap MS scans using the final quadrupole as a linear ion trap. Several pharmaceutical compounds, including trocade, <b>remikiren</b> and tolcapone, were used to evaluate the capabilities of the system with positive and negative turbo ionspray, using either information-dependent data acquisition (IDA) or targeted analysis for the screening, identification and quantification of metabolites. Owing to the MS/MS in-space configuration, quadrupole-like CID spectra with ion trap sensitivity can be obtained without the classical low mass cutoff of 3 D ion traps. The system also has MS(3) capability which allows fragmentation cascades to be followed. The combination of constant neutral loss or precursor ion scan with the enhanced product ion scan was found to be very selective for identifying metabolites at the picogram level in very complex matrices. Owing to the very high cycle time and, depending on the mass range, up to eight different MS experiments could be performed simultaneously without compromising chromatographic performance. Targeted product ion analysis was found to be complementary to IDA, in particular for very low concentrations. Comparable sensitivity was found in enhanced product ion scan and selected reaction monitoring modes. The instrument is particularly suitable for both qualitative and quantitative analysis...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} studies impressively demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) significantly reduce proteinuria and retard progression of glomerular disease. The underlying intraglomerular mechanisms {{are not yet}} fully elucidated. As podocyte injury constitutes a critical step in the pathogenesis of glomerular proteinuria, beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB may partially result from interference with a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in podocytes. The knowledge of expression and function of a local RAS in podocytes is limited. In this study, we demonstrate functional expression of key components of the RAS in differentiated human podocytes: podocytes express mRNA for angiotensinogen, renin, ACE type 1, and the AT 1 and AT 2 angiotensin receptor subtypes. In Western blot experiments and immunostainings, expression of the AT 1 and AT 2 receptor was demonstrated both in differentiated human podocytes and in human kidney cortex. ANG II induced a concentration-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration via AT 1 receptors in differentiated human podocytes, whereas it did not increase cAMP. Furthermore, ANG II secretion was detected, which was blocked by neither the ACEI captopril nor the renin inhibitor <b>remikiren</b> nor the chymase inhibitor chymostatin. ANG II secretion of podocytes was not increased by mechanical stress. Finally, ANG II was found to increase staurosporine-induced apoptosis in podocytes. We speculate that ACEI and ARB exert their beneficial effects, in part, by interfering with a local RAS in podocytes. Further experiments are required to identify the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of podocyte protection. Copyright © 2006 the American Physiological Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
