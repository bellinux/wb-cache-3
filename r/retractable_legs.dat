50|$|Meatwad is a ball-shaped wad {{of ground}} meat {{with only one}} single tooth and is covered in {{yellowish}} dots and hairs. Meatwad {{does not have a}} nose or ears, but he does have retractable arms that only appear when needed. Meatwad also has <b>retractable</b> <b>legs</b> as well, but he almost always rolls around and rarely ever uses them. Just like Master Shake and Frylock, Meatwad occasionally wears clothing but does not typically wear them on a normal basis.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{frequently}} claimed that Richard Lovell Edgeworth created a caterpillar track. It {{is true that}} in 1770 he patented a [...] "machine, that should carry and lay down its own road", but this was Edgeworth's choice of words. His own account in his autobiography is of a horse-drawn wooden carriage on eight <b>retractable</b> <b>legs,</b> capable of lifting itself over high walls. The description bears no similarity to a caterpillar track. Armoured trains appeared in the mid-19th century, and various armoured steam and petrol-engined vehicles were also proposed.|$|E
5000|$|Stand {{bags are}} in the family of carry bags but {{additionally}} feature rigid internal reinforcement and <b>retractable</b> fold-out <b>legs,</b> which make the bag a tripod allowing it to be securely placed on the turf.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the AT-TE, other vehicles were created for Clone Wars media and depicted as predecessors to the walkers featured in the original trilogy. One such walker is the two-legged All Terrain Attack Pod (AT-AP), {{a variation of the}} AT-PT, seen in Revenge of the Sith and Clone Wars media. Alex Jaeger designed the AT-AP per Lucas' request to [...] "diversify the Clone armor". The AT-AP features a variety of artillery weapons, a <b>retractable</b> third <b>leg</b> for stability, and other offensive features.|$|R
50|$|The {{biggest concern}} with a ballbot is its safety {{in case of}} a system failure. There have been several {{attempts}} in addressing this concern. The CMU Ballbot introduced three <b>retractable</b> landing <b>legs</b> that allow the robot to remain standing (statically-stable) after being powered down. It is also capable of automatically transitioning from this statically-stable state to the dynamically-stable, balancing state and vice versa. Rezero featured a roll-over safety mechanism in order to prevent serious damage {{in case of a}} system failure.|$|R
5000|$|The G-27's twin [...] Shvetsov M-11 five {{cylinder}} radial engines were {{mounted at}} the outer {{ends of the}} centre section, with their cylinders projecting for cooling and driving twin blade propellers. The main legs of the tailwheel undercarriage were under the engines. On the first flight the legs were fixed and enclosed with trouser fairings but during development the fairings were removed and later <b>retractable</b> <b>legs</b> were introduced. Skis could be substituted for the wheels for winter use. The G-27 had a fixed tailwheel positioned ahead of the empennage.|$|E
50|$|For Red Dwarf Remastered, Blue Midget was {{completely}} redesigned {{to resemble a}} bubble car with <b>retractable</b> <b>legs</b> used for taking off and walking (replacing the caterpillar tracks), and small arms. The new design was also used for Blue Midgets reappearance in Series VIII, where the ship gained its third, substantially larger cockpit; this came in tandem with Kryten's nanobots' reconstruction of Red Dwarf, also with a complete redesign. The walker design carried over when the ship reappeared in Series X, though the legs and arms do not feature. This time the physical model originally built for Red Dwarf Remastered, which had never been used, replaced the CGI version. The cockpit was again given a redesign more akin {{to that of the}} Series VI-VII Starbug cockpit with four seats. The set itself was a heavy modification of the Series X Drive Room.|$|E
40|$|The {{first report}} is about: A jack-up rig is a mobile {{offshore}} platform. Basically, it is a self-elevating pontoon, {{which can be}} supported by <b>retractable</b> <b>legs</b> resting on the sea bed. Recently, it is proposed to use these platforms for production of marginal fields, what implies a longer term use. Furthermore, there are plans to use such platforms in deeper water. For design calculations and for checking whether the rig {{can be used on}} a new location, it is necessary to know the horizontal wave forces acting on the leg. Since the jack-up leg consists of many bars, direct wave force calculations are time consuming. Therefore, a schematization is required. The second report is about: The calculated and measured drag and inertia coefficients for a complete jack-up leg bay at high Reynolds numbers (0. 5 - 1. 2 * 10 e).

2500|$|To {{minimize}} drag, {{many modern}} gliders [...] {{have a single}} wheel, retractable or fixed, centered under the fuselage, which {{is referred to as}} monowheel gear or monowheel landing gear. Monowheel gear is also used on some powered aircraft, where drag reduction is a priority, such as the Europa XS. [...] Both monowheel gliders and monowheel power aircraft use <b>retractable</b> wingtip <b>legs</b> (with small castor wheels attached) to prevent the wingtips from striking the ground.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a Mobile Lunar Habitat (MLH) structural design consisting of advanced composite materials. The habitat design {{is derived from the}} cylindrical-shaped U. S. Lab module aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and includes two lateral ports and a hatch at each end that geometrically match those of the ISS Nodes. Thus, several MLH units can be connected together to form a larger lunar outpost of various architectures. For enhanced mobility over the lunar terrain, the MLH uses six articulated insect-like robotic, <b>retractable</b> <b>legs</b> enabling the habitat to. t aboard a launch vehicle. The carbon-composite shell is sandwiched between two layers of hydrogen-rich polyethylene for enhanced radiation shielding. The pressure vessel is covered by modular double-wall panels for meteoroid impact shielding supported by externally mounted stiffeners. The habitat s structure is an assembly of multiple parts manufactured separately and bonded together. Based on the geometric complexity of a part and its material system, an appropriate fabrication process is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Dynamically stable mobile robots {{with a high}} {{centre of}} gravity and a small foot print are {{breaking}} new grounds {{in the field of}} mobile robotics. While in operation, these robots are dynamically stable, relying on inertial forces to maintain pose. And when not in operation, they rely on legs or kick stands to maintain static stability. The transition between the dynamic and static state should be automatic and smooth so as to give these robots truly autonomous capabilities. Ballbot has three <b>retractable</b> <b>legs</b> arranged in tripod configuration. Each leg is a servo controlled four bar slider crank mechanism with 1 DOF. In this work we explore means of automatic transition in Ballbot, by taking advantage of the properties of the leg mechanism. We consider two such methods, lean and take-off, and simultaneous withdrawal. We come up with generalized design intent for designing leg mechanisms to be used in dynamically stable robots. We also present the kinematic analysis of the spatial mechanism formed when the body and legs are taken together as a single mechanism. I Acknowledgement I would like to thank my advisor Prof. Ralph Hollis for his invaluable guidance, help and support in pursuing this work. Many thanks to Dr. George Kantor, for helping out with various technical and software related aspects of Ballbot. It was really a pleasure working with Eric Schearer, thanks to you. Tom Lauwers’s support in understanding the existing software and implementing new software is greatly acknowledged and thanked for.

50|$|On 5 December 1951, {{the first}} {{production}} Ouragan conducted its maiden flight. There was little {{difference between the}} pre-production and production aircraft, the most significant being alterations {{to the design of}} the doors enclosing the <b>retractable</b> nosewheel landing <b>leg</b> in response to accidents that occurred on the first two prototypes. By the end of 1952, a total of 39 production aircraft had been completed; a further 93 were manufactured in 1953, and the final 118 were finished by mid-1954.|$|R
5000|$|The Yatsenko I-28 was a 1930s Soviet single-seat fighter {{designed}} by Vladmir Yatsenko and first flown in 1939. The I-28 was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of mixed construction {{powered by a}} [...] Tumansky M-87 radial piston engine. It had an enclosed single-seat cockpit with a rearwards sliding canopy. The wing had an inverted-gull shape to reduce {{the length of the}} <b>retractable</b> main landing <b>legs.</b> The prototype was destroyed shortly after the first flight but an order was placed for 30 production aircraft. Also ordered was a prototype of an attack version, the I-28Sh. Although the first five production aircraft were completed the programme was cancelled in early 1940.|$|R
50|$|Aeroflot {{issued a}} {{requirement}} for two transport aircraft types. Bartini began design work in October 1934 on an aircraft to meet the larger 10/12 passenger specification. Initially Bartini intended the Stal-7 to use a steel tube truss airframe, with fabric covering, but problems with complexity and {{the flexibility of the}} truss structure led Bartini to re-design the aircraft with a light-alloy monocoque structure. The hydraulically <b>retractable</b> main undercarriage <b>legs</b> retracted rearwards into the engine nacelles, which were positioned at the junction of the inverted gull wings. The trailing edges had hydraulically operated flaps inbord and ailerons outboard. Both the wings and tail surfaces were sharply tapered and the inboard wing sections sloped sharply upwards to pass through the fuselage cabin.|$|R
5000|$|The NC.211 {{originated}} as the NC.210 {{powered by}} four [...] Gnome-Rhône 18R 18-cylinder radial engines. With {{a change of}} engine type to the [...] Gnome-Rhône 14R the designation changed to NC.211. Intended to provide the French Air Force, (French: Armée de l'Air (ALA), literally Army of the Air), with strategic transport and paratrooping capability the Cormoran was a large four-engined aircraft with a double-deck fuselage, high-set wing and tricycle undercarriage. Constructed largely of light-alloys with stressed skins and steel high stress components the Cormoran had a conventional tail unit with tailplane attached to the extreme rear of the fuselage and fin also. The cockpit was situated forward of the wing leading edge above the forward fuselage which also had large clamshell doors to the [...] lower deck cargo compartment. Passengers, paratroops and stretchers were to have been carried in both the lower cabin and the upper cabin, which was {{on the same level}} as the cockpit aft of the wing. The <b>retractable</b> twin-wheeled undercarriage <b>legs</b> retracted into the rear of the inboard engine nacelles and the underside of the forward fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|Designed in 1975 {{and first}} flown in 1981, the Orion {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} kitbuilt aircraft to be constructed from composite materials. [...] It is a low wing cantilever monoplane with a T-tail, of conventional layout except for its pusher configuration; this places the cabin well ahead of the leading edge and provides an excellent downward view. The Orion is built from Kevlar reinforced glassfibre shells, with foam filling in the wings. The latter, which have 4.5° of dihedral, are straight edged and only slightly tapered, with blunt tips. They carry electrically driven split flaps. [...] Its cabin seats four in two side-by-side rows and is entered by centrally hinged gull wing doors. The engine, a Lycoming O-360 variant of either 180 hp or 200 hp (134/149 kW) is mounted over the wing trailing edge line and drives a three-bladed propeller, mounted at the extreme tail, via a long shaft. [...] Behind the wing the fuselage tapers on its underside; it carries a broad fin with a straight, swept leading edge and rudder, on top of which is the straight, tapered tailplane and horn balanced elevators. Below the fuselage is a long, shallow ventral strake. The tricycle undercarriage is electrically <b>retractable.</b> The main <b>legs</b> fold inwards; when deployed, they splay out strongly.|$|R
50|$|In 1932 the Polish {{ministry}} of Transport {{let it be}} known that they wanted a multi-engined feeder-liner to operate low frequency routes with challenging. Designer Zbysław Ciołkosz was given the task and his design resulted in the PZL.27. In addition to Ciołkosz's design DWL (Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) started the design of a competitor, with support promised by the Ministry, hoping that their design would be superior and win orders in place of the officially sanctioned PZL.27. Two airframes were built, with one intended for static testing, the low-wing cantilever monoplane was of mixed construction with a one-piece two-spar wooden wing, tapering in chord and thickness, covered with plywood forward of the mainspar and the under sides with fabric covering the rest. Four section Handley-Page automatic slats were fitted to the entire leading edges out board of the engine nacelles and differential slotted ailerons at the trailing edges.The fuselage of the RWD-11 comprised a welded chrome-molybdenum-steel tubing structure, covered with plywood from the nose, aft to the cabin door, with fabric aft of the door to the fabric covered wooden tail-section. The cockpit had excellent visibility for the two pilots who sat side by side forward of the comfortable passenger compartment which seated six in three pairs on adjustable seats, with electric lighting, controlled ventilation and controlled heating from heat exchangers on the engine exhausts. The cabin had a cargo compartment aft of the seats and could be converted to all freight or postal duties. Two <b>retractable</b> main undercarriage <b>legs</b> were fitted with oleo-pneumatic shock-absorbers, medium pressure braked Dunlop wheels, as well as the non-retractable castoring Dowty tailwheel. Provision for fitting a retractable tailwheel undercarriage was also provided.|$|R
