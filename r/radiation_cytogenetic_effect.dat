40|$|The {{purpose of}} our work was to study the <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> induced by deposit mycoflora in Vicia faba (2 n = 12) beans from the {{collection}} of Suceava Genebank. <b>Cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> were studied by means of classical plant chromosomes methods of study. We have observed that the values of the mitotic indexes are decreasing in accordance with the increasing of the storage age and also with the number of mycoflora species that are infesting the beans. Infestation with specific mycoflora produced a relatively large number, statistically significant by comparison to the controls, of interphasic aberrations and also of chromosomal aberrations in mitosis ana-telophase in all studied probes. Comparing our results with similar published data, we can strongly state that the <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> induced by deposit mycoflora in Vicia faba seeds are similar with those produced by the action of a weak mutagenic agen...|$|R

The electromagnetic field with two frequencies (980, 950 MHz, 200 KHz Mod), 5 w and 500 ppm Toluene applied for two weeks. Microwave irradiation had no significant effect on the frequency of micronucleus induced, but exposure of animals to toluene alone and in combination with microwave have significantly increased the induced micronucleus (p< 0. 05). Indeed combination exposure of microwave and toluene showed higher rates of micronucleus in comparison with toluene alone.

40|$|Measurements of {{chromosome}} aberrations in {{peripheral blood}} lymphocytes are currently {{the most sensitive}} and reliable indicator of radiation exposure {{that can be used}} for biological dosimetry. This technique has been implemented recently to study radiation exposures incurred by astronauts during space flight, where a significant proportion of the dose is delivered by high-LET particle exposure. Traditional methods for the assessing of cytogenetic damage in mitotic cells collected at one time point after exposure may not be suitable for measuring high-LET radiation effects due to the drastic cell cycle perturbations and interphase cell death induced by this type of exposure. In this manuscript we review the recent advances in methodology used to study high-LET induced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> and evaluate the use of chemically-induced Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC) as an alternative to metaphase analysis.

In human, berenil is an effective drug {{in the treatment of}} early stage of African trypanosomiasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis. In this work, the <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effect</b> of berenil was tested in the lymphocyte cultures of river buffalo at three final concentrations; 0. 25, 0. 50 and 1 mg ml ha - 1. Chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges and micronucleus test are the three cytogenetic parameters used in this study. The results demonstrated that the numbers of cells with different types of structural chromosomal aberrations, including breaks, gaps, deletions, fragments and centric fusions were increased significantly in cultures treated with different doses of berenil compared to the control. This increase was dose dependent where there was a positive correlation between increased drug concentration and induction of chromosomal aberrations. The frequency of sister chromatid exchanges and the formation of micronuclei in all lymphocyte cultures treated with different doses of berenil were increased significantly compared to the control and these increases were also dose dependent.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> of therapeutic exposure to radioiodine preceded by rhTSH in an animal model. Three groups of Wistar rats (n = 6) were used: one group was treated only with I- 131 (11. 1 MBq/animal); {{the other two groups}} received rhTSH (1. 2 mu g/rat of either Thyrogen or rhTSH-IPEN, respectively) 24 h before administration of radioiodine. The percentage of lymphocytes with chromosome aberrations and the average number of aberrations and of dicentrics per cell were determined on blood samples collected 24 h, 7 and 30 days after administration of I- 131. The data show that the treatment with radioiodine alone or associated with rhTSH resulted in a greater quantity of chromosome alterations in relation to basal values after 24 h, with a gradual decline after 7 and 30 days of treatment. An increase in chromosome alterations was also seen after rhTSH treatment alone.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{currently}} available data on in vivo induced chromosome {{damage in the}} blood lymphocytes of astronauts proves that, after protracted exposure of a few months or more to space <b>radiation,</b> <b>cytogenetic</b> biodosimetry analyses of blood collected within {{a week or two}} of return from space provides a reliable estimate of equivalent radiation dose and risk. Recent studies indicate that biodosimetry estimates from single spaceflights lie within the range expected from physical dosimetry and biophysical models, but very large uncertainties are associated with single individual measurements and the total sample population remains low. Retrospective doses may be more difficult to estimate because of the fairly rapid time-dependent loss of "stable" aberrations in blood lymphocytes. Also, biodosimetry estimates from individuals who participate in multiple missions, or very long (interplanetary) missions, may be complicated by an adaptive response to space radiation and/or changes in lymphocyte survival and repopulation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> of sildenafil citrate in SWR/J mouse bone marrow cells. Thirty-six males and 36 females were used and divided into four groups. Each group contained 18 animals (9 males and 9 females), weighing 30 – 35 g. These animals were orally administered with a single dose of 13, 26 or 40 mg/kg sildenafil citrate solution. A control group received normal saline in an identical condition. The animals were sacrificed at 12, 24 or 48 h, after the treatment. Chromosome aberrations were investigated in 50 metaphases per animal. No significant differences in the percentages of mitotic indices or in the frequencies of chromosome aberrations were observed between treated male and female mice at any doses or at any time intervals used, therefore, data from the two sexes were pooled when analyzed statistically. No significant (p< 0. 05) differences in the percentages of mitotic indices or in the frequencies of chromosome aberrations were observed between sildenafil citrate-treated groups and the control group at any doses or at any time intervals used. However, the percentages of centromeric adhesions increased significantly (p< 0. 01) in treated groups as compared with the control group at all doses and at all time intervals used. In conclusion, {{the results of the present}} study suggest that sildenafil citrate does not have <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> on mouse bone marrow cells, but the centromeric adhesions induced by this drug need further studies to confirm them and to investigate the possible mechanism(s) responsible for such effect...|$|R

40|$|Background: Studies of {{biological}} effects of low dose radiation are important due to exposure of large patient groups to low radiation doses during therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. Details {{of biological}} effects of neutron irradiation have been poorly studied, including <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> of its low doses, although {{they could be}} important during neutron therapy and for development of normatives on radiation protection with ion accelerators, including therapeutic ones. Aim: To study patterns of structural chromosomal damage in mammalian cells exposed to 14. 5 MeV neutrons at doses up to 1 Gy. Materials and methods: <b>Cytogenetic</b> <b>effect</b> of 14. 5 MeV neutrons was evaluated in human blood lymphocytes and Chinese hamster ovarian cells CHO-K 1 in the dose range of 0. 1 – 1. 2 Gy, dose rate range 0. 3 – 60 mGy/min, pulse frequency 50, 5, and 0. 017 Hz. Chromosome preparations were conventionally prepared. All types of chromosomal aberrations were included into the analysis. Results: In the 14. 5 MeV neutron dose range studied, both cell cultures demonstrated the same dose-effect pattern: a drastic increase of chromosomal aberrations frequency at doses of 0. 12 – 0. 15 Gy, with a somewhat lower increase {{of the number of}} aberration in the dose range 0. 3 – 0. 5 Gy and regular linear dose dependence thereafter. This pattern was found both on the total chromosome aberrations frequency and on dicentric (lymphocytes) and paired fragments (CHO-K 1) frequencies. Conclusion: The results obtained indicate the existence of a phenomenon of hypersensitivity and induced radio-resistance in human lymphocytes and Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO-K 1) following irradiation with 14. 5 MeV neutrons. </p...|$|R
40|$|Five to {{ten percent}} of all {{children}} suffer from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is often treated with the central nervous stimulant methylphenidate (MPH). In 2005 controversy arose due to a report of enhanced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> in 12 children after 3 months of MPH treatment. Since then, several prospective studies have been performed and published, which are summarized here. A table comparing the micronucleus frequencies, a marker investigated {{in all of these}} studies, is presented. An induction of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>effects</b> by MPH was only reported in one, the 2005 study by El-Zein et al., while all other studies, with now altogether 110 MPH-exposed individuals, showed no elevation. To address the question of long-term use of MPH, we published the data of 30 chronically treated children and also saw no difference compared to untreated children. Here, we report as new follow-up data that an additional 12 months time point in a small group of 12 children who had begun MPH therapy within our published study also did not reveal elevated cytogenetic damage. Furthermore, a previously unpublished analysis of urinary 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxodG; a non-invasive biomarker for DNA-base oxidation and its repair) in 11 children before and after 3 months of MPH exposure yielded no significant difference. Since gene mutations may not necessarily manifest as chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei or SCEs, we discuss the available data from animal models, which also do not reveal a mutagenic potential of MPH. Although the only two available epidemiological studies do not report elevated risk for MPH exposure, the results are not conclusive yet, and further monitoring of exposed populations is suggested...|$|R
