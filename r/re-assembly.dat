25|$|A {{teardrop}} attack involves sending mangled IP fragments with overlapping, oversized payloads to {{the target}} machine. This can crash various operating systems because of a bug in their TCP/IP fragmentation <b>re-assembly</b> code. Windows 3.1x, Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, as well as versions of Linux prior to versions 2.0.32 and 2.1.63 are vulnerable to this attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} set {{of parts}} was frequently enormous and a daunting logistical task to transport. <b>Re-assembly</b> also depended heavily upon the availability of skilled labour at the customer’s premises. However, {{as in the case}} of the Chauncy Maples, this was frequently the only viable option when the ultimate destination was very far inland, away from any semblance of modern communications.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} U.S second {{generation}} Matadors, Australia assembled the revised 1974 model from 1974 until 1976; but were still marketed through 1977. 1975s and 1976s were simply <b>re-assemblies</b> of the 1974 model. Concurrently, first generation Matadors were still assembled in Australia {{as late as}} December 1974. All Australian second-generation Matadors were powered with the AMC 360 V8 engine with automatic transmission.|$|R
40|$|Case StudyCase Study 3 A 4160 V, 3600 RPM motor on an {{existing}} vertical pump suffered a major failure {{attributed to a}} lightning strike. After repair vibration levels were well above shutdown with the motor running at above 1 inch/second. Several inspections and <b>re-assemblies</b> were made with the same results. During each assembly the rotor was low speed balanced and the assembled motor was balanced on a steel surface and rubber surface to less than 0. 1 inch/second. Further investigation of the vibration was pursued {{through the use of}} impact testing and finite element analysis. This testing and analysis revealed the existence of a natural frequency near running speed. Finite element analysis was used to make modifications to detune the system; however vibration levels did not change significantly. Final solution of the vibration problem consisted of two plane balancing the motor on the pump head indicating that the standard shop approach to balancing the motor was ineffective. This paper discusses potential causes of the problem and makes recommendations for identifying and correcting the problem...|$|R
40|$|Vilem Flusser {{introduces}} in his 'Into the Universe of the Technical Images' {{this universe}} as attracting the' existential interest of future humans'. He describes the technical images as <b>re-assemblies</b> of bits of truth that are leftovers: The universe of texts abstracted the world thoroughly. It also abstracted the orthographic rules of logic and reasoning until only disconnected {{bits of information}} remained. The technical images compute these bits {{in an attempt to}} make the world understandable again and to provide the possibility to communicate its possibilities dialogical. The consequence for the built environment sounds very simple: It has as its first task to serve the existential interest of future humans, their search for the sense of life. The present environment reflects the sense of life in a universe of texts: The shelter is brought to a state where it serves the physical human needs perfectly, and the forms of the shelters reflect the enterprise of science and technology, of progress towards a linear goal of an industrial society appropriately. The environment of the emerging universe has to change its focus. It has to enable the existential human need to experience the infinity of possibilities, explore them, change them, in a mutual exchange of at the same time challenge and reaction, appreciation, with the colleagues with the same specificity: consciousness. The sense of life can only be found in this permanent dynamic, dialogical experience. Five elements could symbolize this environment: The lonely tower, the element of contemplative moods, that cannot be failed to notice; The dense tubes, the continuously busy and productive element; The flat planes, the experimental element with a maximum of edges and contrast between environments and individuals, around which the confrontation with the linear goal is fought; The big connector, the symbol for the element that is only functional as infrastructure but inevitable as audience; And the refined capsule, the volume for best most facilitated exchange and common experience. Together they form an 'Institute for Culture', for sense-seeking. Site for some sketches is Pier 40 on the Hudson River Water Front in Manhattan. by Martin Wilhelm. Thesis (M. S.)

25|$|For the 1927 competition, six aircraft, {{from three}} manufacturers, {{were taken to}} Venice: a pair of Supermarine S.5s, three Gloster IVs and a single Short Crusader. The Crusader was slower than the others, and was {{intended}} for training, but crashed on 11 September 1927. The cause was later identified as a control rigging error, following <b>re-assembly</b> after the journey from the UK to Venice.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's two {{flight data}} {{recorders}} were removed for immediate examination, and investigations {{at the site}} of the accident were completed within a week. The wreckage of Papa India was then removed to a hangar at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough, Hampshire, for partial <b>re-assembly</b> aimed at checking the integrity of its flight control systems. An inquest was held into the 118 deaths, opening on 27 June 1972.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Cape Town, the {{locomotive}} {{had to be}} dismantled {{before it could be}} landed off the brig Charles by means of lighters. The locomotive was accompanied by its engineer-driver, a Scot named William Dabbs. It was partially re-assembled on the jetty and then moved to Alfred's Square, now part of the Parade in Cape Town. There, a galvanised iron shed was built over it and the <b>re-assembly</b> was completed by Dabbs.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services (QANTAS) {{bought the}} first {{prototype}} in November 1920 for GBP 2,798 {{with the intention}} of using it on a route between Charleville and Katherine. It first flew after <b>re-assembly</b> in Australia on 2 March 1921, being damaged on landing and not being repaired for over a year. The 547 proved utterly unsuited to outback conditions and was quickly decommissioned, its fuselage ending its days as a chicken coop in Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>re-assembly,</b> the {{locomotive}} was steam tested at York before transport to Carrog {{station on the}} Llangollen Railway. Early tests showed up two major problems: firstly the linkage to the blower was not strong enough, and secondly operating the water feed pump caused very serious priming of the boiler. It was later shown that the feed pump was five {{times the size of}} that required for the engine. This caused air to be fed into the horizontal boiler tube probably caused the priming.|$|E
25|$|<b>Re-assembly</b> of the Chauncy Maples {{proved to}} be even more arduous than the journey—in error, the part numbers had been stamped on each section prior to the {{galvanising}} process, making the task for the African engineers even more complex. It took two years to re-assemble; the vessel was finally launched on 6 June 1901 and named after Bishop Chauncy Maples, an Anglican missionary, later Bishop of Nyasaland. Tragically while on the way to take up his duties, his boat capsized during a storm on Lake Nyasa and he drowned because of the weight of his cassock.|$|E
25|$|Once pilot {{training}} {{was completed in}} April 1955, three aircraft were deployed to Bitburg Air Base in Germany, flying to Brookley AFB in Mobile, Alabama, cocooned, loaded on an aircraft carrier and delivered to Short Brothers at Sydenham, Belfast, for <b>re-assembly</b> and preparation for flight. At Bitburg they were allocated to Detachment 1 of the 7407th Support Squadron, and commenced operations flying over Eastern Bloc countries at high altitude (over 50,000ft) to acquire intelligence on military targets. Many {{attempts were made to}} intercept these aircraft to no avail, with some photos of fighter airfields clearly showing aircraft climbing for attempted intercepts. The European detachment probably only carried out six missions between mid-1955 and mid-1956 when the Lockheed U-2 took over as the deep penetration aerial reconnaissance asset.|$|E
25|$|Gartenskulptor (Garden Sculpture), for instance, {{had started}} out as a copy of the {{multiple}} P.O.TH.A.A.VFB, a self-portrait bust made of chocolate and birdseed standing on a bird-table, exposed to the elements. Referred to by Roth as a 'dis- and <b>re-assembly</b> object', each new incarnation gradually acquired working drawings, paintings, sculpted rabbits and collages placed on trellises in collector's gardens. It even acquired a real rabbit and the rabbit's hutch for a number of years. The last time it was installed in a garden was in 1989. When it was exhibited indoors in Switzerland, 1992, Gartenskulptor took up an entire room. By 1995 it was 20m long and included all sorts of objects including a fire ladder and television screens. By 2000, in Mönchengladbach, it was 40 metres long, having acquired elements from each of the installations' incarnations, including pebbly earth excavated by the architects Herzog and de Meuron for the facade of the Schaulager, for instance. The rabbit was no longer present.|$|E
500|$|The USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park {{is located}} along the Columbia River in Washington. Its purpose is [...] "to {{establish}} a permanent park in north Richland {{in recognition of}} all the decommissioned reactor cores off-loaded at the Port’s barge slip, transported and stored at the Hanford Site." [...] The park features Tritons sail superstructure (pictured) and eventually an information display {{on the history of}} Triton. The park also serves as a tourist attraction, especially due to its location, since Hanford is the resting place of spent reactor cores from several Navy ships. The park's tentative location {{is at the end of}} Port of Benton Boulevard in north Richland, Washington. Planning called for the Triton sail to be cut up for transport and <b>re-assembly</b> at the park site. Ground-breaking was initially scheduled to take place on 3 April 2008, with the dedication ceremony set for 19 August 2008 and a Fall 2009 start-date for construction. [...] On 23 October 2009, the Port of Benton encased Tritons conning tower in concrete at its new USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park in north Richland, Washington. [...] In mid-December 2009, the final pieces of Tritons sail were welded together at the park's site. [...] During the 11 August 2010 Port of Benton commission meeting, it was reported that bids for the first phase, which includes the park's electrical lighting system and the pouring the concrete around the Tritons sail, would be announced shortly by the port authority. The second phase would involve the park's landscaping, and the third phase would be the installation of a parking lot. [...] The park is part of the Richland Riverfront Trail, a marked hiking trail that focuses on the state of Washington's contribution to the nuclear history of the United States, and it connects to the Sacagawea Heritage Trail. [...] The USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park is located off George Washington Way near the Columbia River, and it was formally dedicated on November 10, 2011, the 52nd anniversary of the commissioning of the USS Triton.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 August, {{after more}} than a month of fighting, Tripoli International Airport finally fell to fighters from Libyan Central Shield, a {{coalition}} of Islamist and Misrata forces. The following day, Operation Dawn forces announced that they have consolidated the whole city and adjacent towns after driving out rival Zintan militias 90 kilometers south of the capital. Libya's newly elected parliament condemned the offensive and called the militants now in control of Tripoli [...] "terrorist organizations". Operation Dawn spokesman later called for the <b>re-assembly</b> of the previous Islamist-dominated GNC and said that the taking over of the airport was necessary to [...] "save the country's sovereignty". The Los Angeles Times reported that at least 90% of the airport's facilities, and 20 airplanes, were destroyed in the fighting.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps it was {{unwise to}} have ever so faintly sketched Ebbo's career through the ensuing troubles; but {{the history of}} the star and of the spark in the stubble seemed to need completion; and the working out of the {{character}} of the survivor was unfinished till his course had been thought over from the dawn of the Wittenberg teaching, which must have seemed no novelty to an heir of the doctrine of Tauler, and of the veritably Catholic divines of old times. The idea is of the supposed course of a thoughtful, refined, conscientious man through the earlier times of the Reformation, glad of the hope of cleansing the Church, but hoping to cleanse, not to break away from her--a hope that Luther himself long cherished, and which was not entirely frustrated till the <b>re-assembly</b> at Trent in the next generation. Justice has never been done to the men who feared to loose their hold on the Church Catholic as the one body to which the promises were made. Their loyalty has been treated as blindness, timidity, or superstition; but that there were many such persons, and those among the very highest minds of their time, no one can have any doubt after reading such lives as those of Friedrich the Wise of Saxony, of Erasmus, of Vittoria Colonna, or of Cardinal Giustiniani.|$|E
