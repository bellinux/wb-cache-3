5000|$|A {{heat sink}} {{may be used}} on the leads of <b>heat</b> {{sensitive}} components <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the component. This is especially applicable to germanium parts. (Note the heat sink will mean the use of more <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> complete the joint since heat {{taken up by the}} heat sink will not heat the workpieces.) If all metal surfaces have not been properly cleaned (ie, [...] "fluxed") or brought entirely above the melting temperature of the solder used, the result will be an unreliable ("cold solder") joint, even though its appearance may suggest otherwise.|$|R

The low conductance coefficient of air allows less <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> {{be lost to}} the environment. This flattening behavior compensate for common ostrich's rather poor cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL). These feather heavy {{areas such as the}} body, thighs and wings do not usually vary much from ambient temperatures due to this behavioural controls. This ostrich will also cover its legs <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss <b>to</b> the environment, along with undergoing piloerection and shivering when faced with low ambient temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|Roofing {{systems that}} can deliver high solar {{reflectance}} (the ability {{to reflect the}} visible, infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths of the sun, <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the building) and high thermal emittance (the ability to release {{a large percentage of}} absorbed, or non-reflected solar energy) are called cool roofs. Cool roofs fall into one of these three categories: inherently cool, green planted roofs or coated with a cool material.|$|R

50|$|Of axial-flow {{design with}} 15-stage {{compressor}} and 7-stage turbine, it incorporated many modern features. These included a rigid compressor-turbine rotor assembly carried on {{front and rear}} bearings. There was a single annular combustion chamber, of reverse-flow configuration to shorten the engine, air cooling of the turbine discs and turbine blades with extended roots <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the disc. The annular air intake surrounded a reduction gear for propeller drive takeoff, and the exhaust duct was also annular.|$|R
50|$|Thermally {{developed}} flow {{results in}} <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> transfer compared <b>to</b> developing flow because {{the difference between}} the surface temperature of the pipe and the mean temperature of the flow is greater than the temperature difference between surface temperature of the pipe and the temperature of the fluid near the pipe boundary.|$|R
50|$|A second use of dihelium ion is {{in ambient}} {{ionization}} techniques using low temperature plasma. In this helium atoms are excited, and then combine to yield the dihelium ion. The He2+ {{goes on to}} react with N2 {{in the air to}} make N2+. These ions react with a sample surface to make positive ions that are used in mass spectroscopy. The plasma containing the helium dimer can be as low as 30 °C in temperature, and this <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> damage <b>to</b> samples.|$|R

50|$|Chrome plating is a {{relatively}} common variation on surface finish for commercial griddles. The finish is aesthetically pleasing, but offers additional benefits to griddle operators. In its plated form chrome is non-porous, impermeable and non-reactive (inert) with food products, which limits food sticking during the cooking process and facilitates cleaning, as well as reduced flavor transfer between foods. The mirror finish of a chrome finish <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> transmission <b>to</b> the environment due to the low surface emissivity, a characteristic common to most highly polished surfaces.|$|R

5000|$|A vacuum cooker (...) is a {{stainless}} steel vacuum flask. The flasks come in various sizes ranging from 20 to 40 cm in diameter and 25 cm tall. A removable pot, with handle and lid, fits inside the vacuum flask. The pot and contents are <b>heated</b> <b>to</b> cooking temperature, and then sealed in the flask. The flask simply <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> loss <b>to</b> a minimum, so that the food remains at cooking temperature for a long time, and cooks without continued heating. Note that the food is not cooked in a vacuum. It is cooked inside a vacuum flask. The hollow evacuated wall of the cooker thermally insulates its contents from the environment, so they remain hot for several hours.|$|R

Approximately 30 % of the increase is associated with colder sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific.

A different mechanism is important at longer timescales (1960 s-present) over which the Southern Annular Mode trended upwards.

Players can do favors for {{ordinary}} {{people on the}} street either for money or for information on how to assassinate rival family made men. Like the Corleone family, all of the other families have made men. If the player simply shoots a made man, he will be hospitalized, not killed. To permanently eliminate a made man, the player must meet his [...] "kill condition"; that is, he must be killed in a specific way, such as being thrown from the roof of a building, hit by a car or killed using a certain execution maneuver. The only way the player can learn these kill conditions, and the location of each made man, is by doing favors for {{people on the street}}. The player can also do favors for various influential people, such as police chiefs, politicians, CIA agents, judges and DAs.

30|$|The {{aforementioned}} can {{be explained}} {{on the basis of}} the gelation kinetics. The gel strength increased with increasing temperature via cross-linking; thus, a low gel strength was measured when PAM/PEI was emulsified into the oleic phase via the low cross-linking density. This low gel strength may be due <b>to</b> the <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the PAM/PEI in the case of emulsification; the results indicate that this <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> transfer will be the situation for the emulsified system until complete separation is achieved. Finally, the emulsification was found to reduce the gel strength and to lower the gelation rate. Nevertheless, the ultimate gel strength could theoretically be achieved if sufficient time is allowed for the emulsified system to fully break. Hence, the control of emulsification (separation time) is critical in treatment design in terms of gel strength and gelation time.|$|R
