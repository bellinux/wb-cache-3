This was formerly arranged mechanically, {{and it was}} suitable for mass-production work although uncommon in job-shop work. With the widespread dissemination of affordable, fast, precise CNC, it became much more common, and today internal and external threads are often milled even on work where they would formerly have been cut with taps, die heads, or single-pointing. Some advantages of thread milling, as compared to single-point cutting or taps and dies, are faster cycle times, less tool breakage, and that a left- or <b>right-hand</b> <b>thread</b> can be created with the same tool. Additionally, for large, awkward workpieces (such as a fire hydrant casting), it is simply easier to let the workpiece sit stationary on a table while all needed machining operations are performed on it with rotating tools, as opposed to rigging it up for rotation around the axis of each set of threads (that is, for the [...] "arms" [...] and [...] "mouth" [...] of the hydrant).|$|E
50|$|The valves on industrial, {{medical and}} diving {{cylinders}} are usually {{of different sizes}} and types, as are the valves for different categories of gases, {{making it more difficult}} to mistakenly misuse a gas. For example, a hydrogen cylinder does not fit an oxygen supply line which would end in catastrophic failure. Some fittings use a <b>right-hand</b> <b>thread,</b> while others use a left-hand thread; left-hand thread fittings are usually identifiable by notches or grooves cut into them.|$|E
50|$|A turnbuckle, {{stretching}} screw or bottlescrew is {{a device}} for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables, tie rods, and other tensioning systems. It normally {{consists of two}} threaded eye bolts, one screwed into each end of a small metal frame, one with a left-hand thread {{and the other with}} a <b>right-hand</b> <b>thread.</b> The tension can be adjusted by rotating the frame, which causes both eye bolts to be screwed in or out simultaneously, without twisting the eye bolts or attached cables.|$|E

25|$|The right-side (usually {{the chain}} side) hole is <b>right-hand</b> <b>threaded,</b> and the left-side hole is {{left-hand}} (reverse) threaded {{to help prevent}} it from becoming unthreaded by an effect called precession.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, {{vehicles}} {{manufactured by}} the Chrysler Corporation used left-hand and <b>right-hand</b> screw <b>thread</b> for different {{sides of the}} vehicle to prevent loosening prior to the 1975 models. Most Buicks, Pontiacs, and Oldsmobiles used both left-handed and right-handed lug nuts prior to model year 1965. [...] It was later realized that the taper seat performed the same function. Modern vehicles use <b>right-hand</b> <b>threads</b> on all wheels.|$|R
50|$|A {{freewheel}} (also {{known as}} a block) consists of either a single sprocket or a set of sprockets mounted on a body which contains an internal ratcheting mechanism and mounts on a threaded hub. Threaded rear hubs were available in different thread patterns depending on the country of manufacture, French and British threads being the most common. British C.E.I. (Cycle Engineers Institute) thread was adopted as the international standard and {{is now known as}} B.S.C. (British Standard Cycle). It is a standardized <b>right-hand</b> <b>thread</b> (1.375 x 24 TPI) onto which a standard freewheel is screwed. This allows different brands of freewheels to be mounted on different brands of hubs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of screws are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is termed a right-hand thread; a common mnemonic device for remembering this {{when working with}} screws or bolts is [...] "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." [...] Another rule is this: curl the fingers of your right hand around the screw with your thumb pointing is the direction you want the screw to go. If the screw is right-handed (most screws are) and you turn the screw {{in the direction of}} your fingers the screw will move in the direction of your thumb. Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a <b>right-hand</b> <b>thread),</b> a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.|$|E

5000|$|English {{threaded}} bicycle bottom brackets are left-threaded on {{the right-hand}} (usually drive) side into the bottom bracket shell. This {{is the opposite of}} pedals into cranks because the sense of the relative motion between the parts is opposite. (Italian and French threaded bottom brackets have <b>right-hand</b> <b>threading</b> on both sides.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Swinger 340, Dart's {{performance}} model, {{was replaced}} by the Demon 340 with optional hood scoops and blackout hood treatment. In 1971, Chrysler abandoned their longstanding corporate practice of installing left-hand-threaded wheel studs {{on the left side of}} the vehicle; all-wheel studs on the Dart thenceforth used conventional <b>right-hand</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the UK, the British Standards Institution {{sets the}} {{standards}}. Included among the standards {{is the use}} left-hand threaded valves for flammable gas cylinders (most commonly brass, BS4, valves for non corrosive cylinder contents or stainless steel, BS15, valves for corrosive contents). Non flammable gas cylinders are fitted with <b>right-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> valves (most commonly brass, BS3, valves for non corrosive components or stainless steel, BS14, valves for corrosive components).|$|R
50|$|The pedal spindle is {{threaded}} to match a threaded {{hole at the}} outboard end of the cranks. Multi-piece cranks have a 9/16 in hole with 20 TPI (a diameter/pitch combination fairly unique to this application). One-piece cranks use a 1/2 in by 20 TPI hole. French pedal spindles use M14 x 1.25 (14 mm metric diameter with 1.25 mm pitch) threads, and thread loosely into a 9/16 pedal hole. The threading size is often stamped into the crank, near the pedal hole.The right-side (usually the drive-side) pedal spindle is right-hand threaded, and the left-side (usually the non-drive-side) pedal spindle is left-hand (reverse) threaded to help prevent it from becoming loose by an effect called precession.Although the left pedal turns clockwise on its bearing relative to the crank (and so would seem to tighten a <b>right-hand</b> <b>thread),</b> the force from the rider's foot presses the spindle against the crank thread at a point which rolls around clockwise {{with respect to the}} crank, thus slowly pulling the outside of the pedal spindle anticlockwise (counterclockwise) because of friction and thus would loosen a right-hand thread.For a short time in the early 1980s, Shimano made pedals and matching cranks that had a 1 in by 24 TPI interface. This was to allow a larger single bearing, as these pedals were designed to work with just one bearing on the crank side rather than the conventional design of one smaller bearing on each side.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the fatigue resistance of friction stir welded (FSWed) AZ 31 B-H 24 Mg alloy butt joints with emphasis on the effect of pin tool thread orientation (<b>right-hand</b> <b>thread</b> (RHT) and left-hand thread (LHT)) in the clockwise rotation. The friction stir welding resulted in recrystallized grains in the stir zone (SZ) and thermomechanicallyaffected zone (TMAZ), and partially recrystallized grains in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), with the lowest hardness appeared in the SZ. The fatigue life after friction stir welding was observed to be lower at high stress amplitudes, but remained nearly the same at low stress amplitudes. Fatigue strength was higher in the FSWed joints made with the LHT pin tool than with the RHT pin tool due to the elimination of the welding defects near the bottom surface via a downward material flow. Fatigue fracture basically occurred at or near the boundary between TMAZ and SZ. Fatigue crack initiated from the specimen surface or near surface defects in the case of LHT pin tool, and from the welding defects near the bottom surface in the case of RHT pin tool. Crack propagation was characterized by the formation of fatigue striations...|$|E
50|$|Edison screw (ES) is a {{standard}} socket for light bulbs in the United States. It was developed by Thomas Edison and was licensed in 1909 under the Mazda trademark. Normally, the bulbs have <b>right-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> metal bases (caps) which screw into matching threaded sockets (lamp holders). For bulbs powered by AC current, the thread is connected to neutral and the contact on the bottom tip of the base is connected to hot.|$|R
50|$|Most Edison screws have <b>right-hand</b> <b>threads</b> (lamp {{is turned}} {{clockwise}} to tighten), but left-hand threaded screws do exist, generally {{for use in}} special cases in which a specific voltage or wattage is required. This discourages using an incorrect bulb, which could result in an explosion or other incident. Locations such as railway trains and the New York City Subway have used light bulbs that have left-hand threads in order to discourage theft of the bulbs for use in regular light fixtures.|$|R
50|$|French {{bicycles}} before 1980 {{often used}} French-threaded bottom brackets (now {{difficult to find}} replacement parts for). French bottom brackets, like Italian ones, used <b>right-hand</b> <b>threading</b> on the fixed cups, making them subject to loosening by precession. Motobécane broke ranks with most other French manufacturers in the mid-70s, using Swiss-threaded bottom brackets (also difficult to find replacement parts for now). Swiss bottom brackets were identical to French, save that the fixed cups were reverse-threaded (like English ones), making them immune to loosening by precession. For more information, see bottom bracket specifications.|$|R
25|$|The {{bottom bracket}} shell is a short and large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and <b>right-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the {{bottom bracket shell}}.|$|R

5000|$|The spinner cap was {{introduced}} into the commercial vehicle and passenger automobile market in the 1930s. The spinner or [...] "knock-off" [...] was designed to keep the wheel on the automobile. They were screwed on and [...] "knocked on tightly" [...] using hammers and tools, hence the name [...] "knock-offs". Most setups will feature <b>right-hand</b> <b>threads</b> {{on the left side}} of the vehicle, and left-hand threads (rotate clockwise to remove) on the vehicle's right side so the screw-on spinner would stay tightened as the auto was in forward motion. The knock-off spinners were used until the development of the lug nut method attaching the wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Freewheels are {{threaded}} onto an axle hub, using conventional <b>right-hand</b> <b>threads.</b> As {{the bicycle}} rider pedals, the freewheel is continuously kept tight, as chain torque {{is in the}} right-hand direction. This becomes a problem when the freewheel needs to be removed. Having undergone high torque from leg muscles, {{it is difficult to}} loosen and remove the freewheels. A freehub, on the other hand, has cogs that slide onto an axially-splined cylindrical outer shell. A lockring or the last cog(s) are threaded onto the freehub. It is fastened to the wheel hub itself with a hollow retaining screw (for example, using a hex key on some models) through which the axle is inserted during operation.|$|R
50|$|Most (except for Italian and French) designs use <b>right-hand</b> (normal) <b>threading</b> for {{the left}} side and {{left-hand}} (reverse) threading for the right (drive) side. This is opposite of most pedal threading and is done for the same reason: to keep the bottom bracket cup from backing out of the bottom bracket shell due to precession.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} only on t he qualitative aspects of the phenomena of twisting the roving in the speed frame. The results of this simple analysis modified the conclusions reached earlier t hat the twist in the roving portion between the drafting system and the fl yer head consists of two components, named real twist and false twist. This work furnished grounds for the stat ement that the twist in the zone referred to consists of four components namely, real twist t a, false twist t f, pushed-back twist t c, and additional false twist t p arising {{as a result of}} the roving assuming the shape of space curv e as it pass through the flyer hole, each of different source of origin. Fu rthermore, it was found that the methods of threading the roving through the flye r head will either increase or decrease the number of turns of twist before or after the flyer head. Also it was shown that the false twist t p that created in the roving portion between the drafting system and t he flyer head when using <b>right-hand</b> <b>threading</b> can be utilized to strengthen the fi bre assembly in that zone to meet technological requirements dur ing production processe...|$|R
50|$|Relative {{direction}} and chirality are distinct concepts. Relative direction {{is from the}} point of view of the observer. A completely symmetrical object has a left and a right side, from the observer's point of view, if the top and bottom and direction of observation are defined. Chirality, however, is observer-independent: no matter how one looks at a <b>right-hand</b> screw <b>thread,</b> it remains different from a left-hand screw thread. Therefore, a symmetrical object has sinistral and dextral directions arbitrarily defined by the position of the observer, while an object that has chirality can have sinistral and dextral directions defined by characteristics of the object, no matter the position of the observer.|$|R
40|$|Linear back-drive {{differentials}} {{have been}} proposed as alternatives to conventional gear differentials for applications {{in which there is}} only limited rotational motion (e. g., oscillation). The finite nature of the rotation makes it possible to optimize a linear back-drive differential in ways that would not be possible for gear differentials or other differentials that are required to be capable of unlimited rotation. As a result, relative to gear differentials, linear back-drive differentials could be more compact and less massive, could contain fewer complex parts, and could be less sensitive to variations in the viscosities of lubricants. Linear back-drive differentials would operate according to established principles of power ball screws and linear-motion drives, but would utilize these principles in an innovative way. One major characteristic of such mechanisms that would be exploited in linear back-drive differentials is the possibility of designing them to drive or back-drive with similar efficiency and energy input: in other words, such a mechanism can be designed so that a rotating screw can drive a nut linearly or the linear motion of the nut can cause the screw to rotate. A linear back-drive differential (see figure) would include two collinear shafts connected to two parts that are intended to engage in limited opposing rotations. The linear back-drive differential would also include a nut that would be free to translate along its axis but not to rotate. The inner surface of the nut would be <b>right-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> at one end and left-hand threaded at the opposite end to engage corresponding right- and left-handed threads on the shafts. A rotation and torque introduced into the system via one shaft would drive the nut in linear motion. The nut, in turn, would back-drive the other shaft, creating a reaction torque. Balls would reduce friction, making it possible for the shaft/nut coupling on each side to operate with 90 percent efficiency...|$|R
40|$|FSW {{is a new}} {{solid-state}} process {{currently being}} investigated for joining aluminum alloys {{that are difficult to}} weld, where there is no perceptible wear of the pin tool throughout the experiment. The present report investigates and examines tool wear in the friction-stir welding of Al 6061 -T 6 and Al 6061 -T 6 containing 20 % (volume) Al 2 O 3 particles, a metal matrix composite (MMC), in order to compare wear optimized tool geometries and corresponding parameters. ^ The weld tool, referred to as pin tool or nib, did not exhibit any measurable wear in the FSW of the 6061 Al alloy even after traversing tens of meters of material. However, the pin tool geometry changed during the FSW of the Al 6061 -T 6 containing 20 % (volume) Al 2 O 3 particles. Tool wear was measured in relation to the original tool by weighing the photograph of the tool and comparing the percentage change relative to the original tool photograph. The maximum wear rate was roughly 0. 64 %/cm at 1000 rpm for the MMC at 1 mm/s traverse speed. The best performance involving the least wear for MMC FSW was observed at a tool rotational speed of 500 rpm and a traverse speed of 3 mm/s; where the corresponding wear rate was 0. 13 %/cm. Optical, scanning and transmission microscopy were used to characterize the microstructures of the base material and weld zone for the MMC confirming the solid phase nature of the technique. The microstructure of the friction stir weld zone shows a characteristic dynamic recrystallization phenomenon that acts as a mechanism to accommodate the super-plastic deformation and facilitates the bonding. Rockwell E hardness profiles for both aluminum alloys were measured from the base metals through the FSW zone near the through-thickness mid-section. ^ In the FSW of Al 6061 containing 20 % (volume) Al 2 O 3 particles, tool wear has been shown to depend primarily on rotational and traverse speeds, with optimum wear occurring at 1000 rpm. However, as the traverse or actual weld speed is increased from 1 mm/s to 11 mm/s, tool wear and tool wear rate decline. The most significant part of this work was the emergence of a self-optimized tool shape after a considerable traverse distance. When these shapes are developed, tool wear becomes negligible and final shape influences the residual weld properties by variations in the residual through-weld hardness profiles at the start of welding process in contrast to the end of welding experiments. A weld-related flow phenomenon in connection with the specific tool geometry during the FSW of MMC samples was observed using various <b>right-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> pin tools and self-optimized tool shape pins. ^ It may be concluded from this study that using a pin with self-optimized shape and no threads can be used successfully to join Al 2 O 3 reinforced aluminum alloys. As a result, the self-optimizing wear phenomena may provide a basis for designing optimized tools for other FSW systems, especially those involving appreciable tool wear or any other applications for which wear resistance is important.
