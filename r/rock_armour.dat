The direction and rate of influential currents is unknown, but it is calculated that [...] of coastal sediment per annum is scoured by the sea from the Hampton-on-Sea coast and deposited [...] to the west at Long Rock, Swalecliffe. This area with a defensive frontage of [...] is now known as the Hampton Flood Basin and Hampton Brook, now officially Westbrook, is still prone to floodlocking, as occurred in 2001. Although the 1959 sea wall and groynes were updated in 1983, and Hampton Pier Avenue's <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> revetment was upgraded in 1994, it is thought that eventually the sea defences would need to be raised. Nevertheless, although sea-damage was done by the great 1953 and 1978 storms, the upgraded defences protected this coast from the severe 1996 storm. Costs of increasing flood defences here are estimated at £1–7million, especially as the work has to be modified because this area is a SSSI and SPA. Cost and limitations meant that a short-term solution of £635,000 capital works was recommended by the Council Steering Group on 29 June 2009 to be implemented from winter 2011 to spring 2011. The recommendation was to hold the line with replacement and improvement of six timber groynes, importing a new beach of [...] partly taken from Long Rock, raising and extending the rear wall and closing off openings with floodgates.

40|$|The {{design of}} rubble mound {{structures}} like breakwaters and seawalls {{are influenced by}} the wave run-up and overtopping over them. The above phenomena largely depend on the type of the armour units as they directly interact with the incident waves. The hydrodynamic characteristics of various concrete armour units have been established by several researchers. A new armour block, ‘Kolos’, a modified version of Dolos, is considered in this study for a detailed investigation. An attempt is made to establish empirical relationships for the estimation of wave overtopping discharges over crown wall and run-up on Kolosarmoured slope exposed to random wave from the results of a comprehensive experimental program.

40|$|The {{dimensions}} of single layer concrete armour units (interlocking armour units) are calculated {{with a similar}} stability relation as the stability relation for quarry stone. In these design formulas an 'average/significant' wave load is used (Hs). Since quarry stone gains its stability only from gravity, this type of armour unit is constructed in a double layer and therefore some damage development is allowed. Interlocking armour units are constructed {{in a single layer}} and the design should be based on zero damage. This research investigates whether this different approach to damage leads to a different characteristic design wave load which will increase the accuracy of the design method for interlocking armour units. It is focussed on the influence of the wave height distribution on the stability of single layer concrete armour units in general and Xbloc in particular. For Xbloc, zero damage is defined as a criterion for <b>rocking</b> of the <b>armour</b> units: during design conditions "not more than 2 % of the units are allowed to move during more than 2 % of the waves". To find a stability relation based on this criterion, the stability of Xbloc is investigated according to <b>rocking</b> of <b>armour</b> units contrary to the conventionally approach to stability {{based on the number of}} displaced units from the armour layer. To find the relation between waves and rocking, physical model tests are performed. In these tests a model breakwater is loaded by wave series with different wave height distributions, wave steepness and groupiness. It resulted that every wave has a certain probability of causing <b>rocking</b> of an <b>armour</b> unit. This probability of rocking is mainly dependent on the height of individual waves and to a lesser extent on the groupiness of the wave series. The steepness of the waves appeared to have a negligible small influence. When the found rocking probability relation is combined with the criterion for rocking, it appears that H 2 % is mathematically a better fitting parameter for a stability relation according to rocking. A new stability relation for Xbloc is derived based on H 2 %. Additionally, it is found that very extreme wave heights can dislodge an armour unit in such a way that this armour unit does not interlock anymore. Because it is undesirable that armour units do not interlock anymore, dislodgement of armour units should be accounted for in the stability calculations. Therefore, also a stability relation based on dislodgement of units is provided. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} a {{monitoring}} carried out {{on the shore of}} Marina di Pisa (Tuscany, ltaly) are presented in this work: Marina di Pisa has been the centre of an impressive coastal defence project. This project has got started in the autumn of 2006 and will come to an end in the spring of 2008 : it has been necessary due to the poor conditions of this area, stili struck by lingering episodes of erosion. In fact, dating back to the late XIXth century the Pisan shore experienced first erosive phenomena (due t o a strong decrease of River Arno sediments discharge caused, amongst others, by an uncontrolled excavation of the riverbed), progressively worsened up to seriously menace the city centre of Marina di Pisa. The defence of buildings and houses had become a pressing priority and it was realized by the accomplishment of hard protection systems like sea walls (<b>rock</b> <b>armouring</b> in particular) : these sea walls solved the problem they were built for, but they caused the complete erosion of the fronting sand beaches as well. Subsequent forms of defence (breakwaters 80 m off the coast-line and grave l replenishments) were carried out, but with no particular gain even by an environmental impact standpoint. The above mentioned defence project has been put into execution in such a worrying situation: i t consists of the enlargement of few pre-existent groynes (subsequently linked at the head by submerged breakwaters) and of a huge gravel replenishment. A series of big cells will form that way, characterized by better water ctrculattOn, lessened envtronmental tmpact and wider gravel beaches. The monitoring ai m is to contro l the shore evolution in order to better define the processes acting on that sector of the littoral zone and, moreover, the need of integration and/or variations to the project. Besides, the monitoring has been extended to a beach (named Gorgona) one kilometre south of the cells where larger works h ave bee n executed: gravel replenishments have been realized a Iso on this beach, but the difference lies in the absence of offshore breakwaters. Therefore, it w ili be possible verifying the evolution of both these beaches given the sa me sea weather and w ave motion conditions. Thus beach profile and coast-line surveys have been accomplished at Gorgona beach using GPS technologies during various climatic conditions: so it has been possible keeping under contrai the beach evolution without the interference of any offshore structures parallel to the shoreline. At the same time sampling along transects going from the backshore to the shoreface have been made to define the grain-size variations normal to the coast-line. This observation has been particularly interesting because further shows that gravel and pebbles assume a dimensionai zonation on the backshore, while their diffusion under water is probably limited to the step, that is the limit foreshore-upper shoreface. Grain-size analysis has been conducted on every sample; the coarsest ones have undergone morphometric analysis as well j ust to better locate the mentioned zonation. Considering the remarkable peculiarity of the area in which this project has been rea lized (so much peculiar to probably make Marina di Pisa the only case of such a type), the obtained resu lts will be very useful not only to better understand processes acting on a gravel beach, but even to sort of deal with this kind of coastal defence works by improving the approach with which they are studied {{and at the same time}} to optimize them in the future...|$|R
40|$|Cooperation {{between the}} authors {{has led to}} a number of papers on main design {{parameters}} for berm breakwaters. These were the recession at the berm of a berm breakwater for assumed design conditions and main <b>armour</b> <b>rock</b> class, as well as the functional behaviour (wave overtopping and reflection), where often allowable overtopping rates determine the crest height of the structure. They also gave guidance on how some geometrical aspects may influence the recession. For example a flatter down slope, a higher berm level and a higher toe level all decrease the expected recession. Expected recession and expected wave overtopping (or requested crest height) are only two parameters that influence the design of the cross-section of a berm breakwater. In order to design a complete cross-section many more design decisions have to be taken into account. In the past clear design rules on determining a full cross-section of a berm breakwater were lacking and design was based on the experience with earlier designs (in Iceland and Norway) or simply on good reasoning and then testing the structure in a hydraulic laboratory. This paper gives guidance on all relevant geometrical design parameters...|$|R

To combat erosion, boulders acting as <b>armour</b> <b>rocks</b> and trees were placed at the base.

40|$|Two {{dimensional}} {{physical model}} tests are executed with Xbloc armour units on low crested structures {{to answer the}} objective. On the basis of findings in the literature study it can be expected that {{the stability of the}} Xbloc elements on low-crested breakwaters is a function of crest freeboard and crest width. The crest freeboard (Rc/Dn) varied from - 0. 8 to 0. 8 in steps of 0. 4 and the tested crest widths (Wc) are 3 and 9 armour units wide. Additionally all tests series are executed with a wave steepness of 2 and 4 %. All test series are executed once except the reference test series (Rc/Dn = 0, Wc = 3) which are repeated four times to acquire insight into the reliability of the test results. The number of <b>rocking</b> and displaced <b>armour</b> units is registered for the total breakwater, seaside slope and crest (also termed breakwaters sections). Settlements at both the sea- and leeward slope leads to openings in the armour layer at the transition from the seaside slope to the crest. As a consequence the interlocking properties of {{the upper part of the}} seaside slope and crest decreases and the area of the Xbloc crest elements normal to the wave induced flow increases. Moreover due to settlement the distance between two succeeding rows at the upper part of the slope increases whereas for the lower part of the slope it decreases. This together with the already decreased interlocking properties of the upper rows at the slopes and crest rocking results at both the upper part of the seaside slope and the outer seaward rows of the crest.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{stability}} of toe material for rubble mound breakwaters in depth limited conditions. The present equation, Van der Meer 1998, gives results for depth limited conditions but is not validated. The empirical equation is based on physical model tests done by Gerding 1993. The Van der Meer equation implies deep water and breaking waves on the structure slope. For shallow water conditions this assumption is not valid. Waves start breaking at the fore shore slope and toe which results in a different hydrodynamical wave load at the toe. Toe material is exposed to waves and starts behaving as <b>armour</b> <b>rock.</b> The uncertainties, introduced by shallow water situation are investigated in this research. The objective for this thesis is finding a more reliable design equation in this situation. Fore shore slope and wave steepness are considered of influence. The research is done by performing scale model tests in a two dimensional wave flume. The observations from the experiments and {{the analysis of the}} performed dataset gave following conclusions: Fore shore slope is strongly influencing toe stability. This is not only valid in shallow water but also in deep water. In shallow water, wave steepness influences toe stability as well. This is not proven for deep water. Very shallow water shows different hydrodynamic behaviour. Wave breaking occurs at the fore shore. The toe structure is attacked by breaking or already broken waves. Although a reduced wave height reaches the toe, damage is larger because the toe is exposed to turbulent wave attack. A new design equation for very shallow water is suggested in which fore shore slope and wave steepness are included. This is an empirical relation, using dimensionless relations like the Hudson stability number and a new damage number in percentages. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

5000|$|Rubble mound breakwaters use {{structural}} voids {{to dissipate}} the wave energy. <b>Rock</b> or concrete <b>armour</b> units {{on the outside}} of the structure absorb most of the energy, while gravels or sands prevent the wave energy's continuing through the breakwater core. The slopes of the revetment are typically between 1:1 and 1:2, depending upon the materials used. In shallow water, revetment breakwaters are usually relatively inexpensive. As water depth increases, the material requirements, and hence costs, increase significantly.New breakwaters, the wave attenuators - wawtech.net - are now available. Wave attenuators consist of concrete elements properly dimensioned ( [...] L = 2,10 m x H = 1,40 m x W = 2 m [...] ) placed horizontally just one feet under the free surface, positioned along a lone parallel to the coast.The wave attenuator has fours sea-side ( [...] seaward [...] ) slabs, one vertical slab and two rear-side ( [...] landward [...] )slabs each separated from the next by a space of 200 mm ( [...] 8" [...] ).An extra front-side ( [...] seaward [...] )shield stops the sand erosion near the installation area and the approaching of elements like plastic bags, all types of seaweeds, small size woods, etc. This row of 4 front side slabs and two rear side slabs, reflects the offshore wave by the action of the volume of water located under it which, made to oscillate under the effect of the incident wave, creates waves in phase opposition to the incident wave downstream from the slabs.The use of this type of wave attenuator solves a number of problems unsolved by rock breakwaters in the past.Such attenuators offer the following main advantages:- transparency to currents- no destruction of the seabed- partially invisible- maintenance of natural environments- coasts more competitive as water depth increases- possibility of modular installation- reversibility.- possibility to install each Wave attenuator elements stream-oriented or wind-oriented in order to stop the effect of the main erosion.- Realization of a sand-trap able to form new sand volumes.- Realization of a garbage-trap able to stop floating elements.|$|R
40|$|This Final Report {{presents}} the results of research on the sensitivity of outcome construction costs due to varying site investigation data. The study concentrated on the design {{for the construction of a}} new port and dry-dock complex at Duqm in the Al Wusta Region of the Sultanate of Oman. The study was carried out in co-operation with Posford Haskoning Ltd., Peterborough, United Kingdom. This report presents designs for two design phases, the preliminary design phase and the detailed design phase. In the scope of this research, a port lay-out already prepared by Posford Haskoning was adopted for this study. Following port components have been designed: breakwaters, quay walls, dredging works and land reclamation. Next costs and designs of the different port components are compared between the preliminary and the detailed design phase. In the first design phase, referred to as the preliminary design phase, a design is presented on basis of limited data. A lower bound (optimistic) and upper bound (realistic pessimistic) design are also presented. Subsequently cost estimations for the designs are established using a unit rate technique. In the second design phase, referred to as the detailed design phase, a design is presented on basis of more detailed data. Again lower bound and upper bound were indicated. Same unit rate technique was used to establish a cost estimate for the detailed design phase. The protective structures consist of two breakwaters. The main breakwater is protected with Core-Loc, the lee breakwater with <b>rock</b> as primary <b>armour</b> unit. A block-work wall is preferred as quay wall structure. In port projects like Duqm the geotechnical and wave data are of uttermost importance. On basis of the data available it has been indicated what design margins could realistically be expected for the breakwater design, the quay wall design and the dredging works and land reclamation. With the available information the sensitivity on costs of variations in the wave climate have been analysed. The results of this analysis are only valid for Duqm but they provide a good view for comparable projects. Contrary, the limited geotechnical information available made it only possible to give an indication of the margins to be expected at Duqm. For determination of the inshore wave climate same offshore wave data were used in both design stages. Although same offshore wave data were used in both design stages, the inshore wave climate changed considerably. In the first design phase hand calculations were used to determinate the inshore wave climate while in the second design phase the inshore wave climate was determined with a SWAN-analysis. The difference in inshore wave climate can be explained by the fact that the SWAN-analysis does take account of the bathymetric profile and the shape of the land. Small changes in wave climate can have great influence on the breakwater costs. Especially at the point where rock of sufficient weight to be stable is not available anymore and the breakwater has to be protected with Core-Loc primary armour.

40|$|A new {{approach}} in design of rubble-mound breakwater which uses smaller stones resulting in easier construction method and cheaper cost. Currently, {{there is a}} need felt amongst practising engineers to improve the design methods of rubble-mound breakwaters for both better stability and more economical construction. The large numbers of breakwaters suffering serious damage in the recent years, and the discard of available small stones in the conventional design using large <b>armour</b> <b>rocks,</b> have encouraged research around the world to find new design procedures. The construction of Grassy???s breakwater in King Island using limited size waste rock from nearby mine, and the improvement of Bruun???s beach profile theory by Dean, had provided an idea to conduct a study. The study was based on the prototype field data, new development in the equilibrium beach theories, and model tests as the main method. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish a new design basis for rubble-mound breakwaters based on the equilibrium beach principles, and to predict the future final profile of the prototype after design wave attack. Tests were conducted on a one-tenth scale model of the trunk of Grassy???s breakwater in Monash University???s large wave flume. Two series of tests were applied, the first was with sinusoidal waves, and the second was with spectral waves. The procedure of the tests followed the prototype carefully both in construction and environmental condition. The model comprised a mound of rock of two layers, ie the core and armour layers. The core was of continuous gradation with maximum size was less than 2 kg. The armour layer was in the range of 2 - 10 kg rock with average of 6 kg. The mound was approximately 2 m in height and 2. 2 m width with initially natural dumping slope at the face of incoming waves. The water depth at the location of the model was 1. 5 m. For each series, the condition for the first test was a storm which occurred on 9 / 10 December 1970 during the construction period; the designed significant wave of 7. 6 m high (prototype); and finally, the same design wave was applied after repairing the damage caused by the previous test in order to verify the final equilibrium profile. For each wave height two wave periods were applied, ie 11 and 10 seconds to study the effects of wave periods. The total duration of the tests was not less than 76 hours; this was equivalent to 240 hours in the prototype. The result showed that the final equilibrium profile had a slope steeper than the one predicted by the conventional Hudson???s equation, thus more economical in the use of material. The result also showed that the stability of the breakwater with the new design procedure was very good. In general, it can be said that Grassy???s breakwater will act as a beach, but its final profile slope will be slightly different from Dean???s equation. It also can be concluded that the use of equilibrium beach principles will give better stability to rubble-mound breakwaters, and the use of wider range of available material, in turn, will result in more economical construction...|$|R
