500|$|Heisman {{recalled}} that, when Strupper {{first arrived}} from Riverside Military Academy, Heisman {{could not imagine}} Strupper playing on the football team: [...] "Too light for the line, I didn't see how he could play in the backfield, because he wouldn't {{be able to get}} the signals. He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear enough for him to call the plays." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could <b>read</b> <b>your</b> lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball." [...] He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team.|$|E
500|$|Trautmann {{excelled at}} shot-stopping, {{particularly}} penalties, saving 60% {{of those he}} faced {{over the course of}} his career. The Manchester United manager Matt Busby mentioned Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: [...] "Don't stop to think where you're going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will <b>read</b> <b>your</b> thoughts and stop it." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that [...] "the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it". As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's 6–3 victory over England in 1953.|$|E
500|$|Coach John Heisman's swift backfield {{used the}} pre-snap {{movement}} of his [...] "jump shift" [...] offense, and Al Hill led the team in carries. Ev Strupper, arguably {{the best of the}} four, was partially deaf; because of his deafness, he called the signals instead of the team's quarterback. When [...] "Strupe" [...] tried out for the team, he noticed that the quarterback shouted the signals every time he was to carry the ball. Realizing that the loud signals would be a tip-off to the opposition, Strupper told Heisman: [...] "Coach, those loud signals are absolutely unnecessary. You see when sickness in my kid days brought on this deafness my folks gave me the best instructors obtainable to teach me lip-reading." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could <b>read</b> <b>your</b> lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I <b>read</b> <b>your</b> letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already <b>read</b> <b>your</b> hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E
500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{with a number of}} honorific nicknames. She has been compared to American recording artist Madonna in many media outlets, with Madonna identified as Queen of Pop and Minogue as the Princess of Pop. Birmingham Post said in 2000; [...] "nce upon a time, long before anybody had even heard of Britney, Christina, Jessica or Mandy, Australian singer Kylie Minogue ruled the charts as princess of pop. Back in 1988 her first single, I Should Be So Lucky, spent five weeks at number one, making her the most successful female artist in the UK charts with 13 successive Top 10 entries." [...] She is sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Pop/Pop Goddess. She has also been dubbed a Disco Queen. William Baker, co-author of her book , talking about her song [...] "Better the Devil You Know", commented, [...] "The track transferred well onto the dance-floor and heralded a long reign for Kylie as the new queen of disco... a pop princess." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic reviewed her box-set [...] and stated [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." [...] In November 2011, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Many celebrities have named Minogue as a role model. Many media outlets have said many people, particularly woman, have undergone regular checks for cancer symptoms since her breast cancer diagnosis. In December 2006, Sugar named her the Most Inspirational Celebrity as voted by teenage girls. Editor of the magazine Annabel Brog stated, [...] " [...] couldn't be any more inspirational. She's friendly, gorgeous, talented – and this year she's shown just how strong she is too." [...] Television host Giuliana Rancic cited Minogue's cancer story as [...] "inspirational" [...] when she too was diagnosed with cancer. She said, [...] "When you get diagnosed, you don't know what to do… you Google. I went online and I <b>read</b> <b>your</b> story, and it gave me the strength to go public as well." [...] Musical entertainers who have cited Minogue as an influence include September, Diana Vickers, Paris Hilton, and The Veronicas.|$|E

2500|$|According to Michael Tomasello, the key {{cognitive}} capacity distinguishing Homo sapiens {{from our}} ape cousins is [...] "intersubjectivity". This entails turn-taking and role-reversal: your partner strives to <b>read</b> <b>your</b> mind, you simultaneously strive to read theirs, {{and each of}} you makes {{a conscious effort to}} assist the other in the process. The outcome is that each partner forms a representation of the other's mind in which their own can be discerned by reflection.|$|E
