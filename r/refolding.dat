5|$|More {{than half}} of all known cancers involve {{mutations}} of p53, a tumor suppressor protein present in every cell which regulates the cell cycle and signals for cell death in the event of damage to DNA. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of tumors. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the <b>refolding</b> of p53's protein dimer in an all-atom simulation of water. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the <b>refolding</b> of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first peer reviewed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's <b>refolding,</b> {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E
25|$|The {{area had}} {{undergone}} polyphase deformation. The planar S0, {{is defined by}} the layering within chemogenic precipitate (BIF). The earliest folds F1, apart from being tight and appressed occur in intrafolial positions and also constitute the rootless folds. This folding has given rise to an axial planar penetrative foliation and is defined mainly by hornblende and to a lesser extend by chlorite and is co-parallel to the lithoboundaries identified as S0. S1 schistosity is defined by hornblende and chlorite, and this mineralogical association suggests that the deformation occurred under upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies conditions. The subsequent F2 resulted in <b>refolding</b> of S1 and transposition of S1 subparallel to the F2 axial trace. The most prominent planar structures are the discrete mylonitic foliation S2 attributed the regional NE-SW trending Bhavani shear. Mylonite development, biotitization, chloritization and microgranulation are found associated with these surfaces.|$|E

From {{the most to}} the least thermo-resistant, the four molecular species ranked as follows: (i) glycosylated form produced native, (ii) non-glycosylated form produced native, (iii) non-glycosylated form produced as inclusion bodies and <b>refolded,</b> and (iv) glycosylated form produced native chemically denatured and then <b>refolded.</b> On {{the basis of these}} results and of crystal structure data, we discuss the respective importance of protein folding and glycosylation in the {{thermal stability}} of recombinant FAEA...|$|R

500|$|Despite much effort, {{significant}} titers of prion infectivity {{have never}} been produced by <b>refolding</b> pure PrP molecules, raising doubt {{about the validity of}} the [...] "protein only" [...] hypothesis. In addition, the [...] "protein only" [...] hypothesis fails to provide a molecular explanation for the ability of prion strains to target specific areas of the brain in distinct patterns. These shortcomings, along with additional experimental data, have given rise to the [...] "multi-component" [...] or [...] "cofactor variation" [...] hypothesis.|$|E
500|$|Prions may {{propagate}} by transmitting their misfolded protein state. When a prion {{enters a}} healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins {{to convert into}} the misfolded prion form. In this way, the prion acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more proteins into prion form. In yeast, this <b>refolding</b> is assisted by chaperone proteins such as Hsp104. These refolded prions can {{then go on to}} convert more proteins themselves, leading to a chain reaction resulting in large amounts of the prion form. All known prions induce the formation of an amyloid fold, in which the protein polymerises into an aggregate consisting of tightly packed beta sheets. Amyloid aggregates are fibrils, growing at their ends, and replicate when breakage causes two growing ends to become four growing ends. The incubation period of prion diseases is determined by the exponential growth rate associated with prion replication, which is a balance between the linear growth and the breakage of aggregates. [...] The propagation of the prion depends on the presence of normally folded protein in which the prion can induce misfolding; animals that do not express the normal form of the prion protein can neither develop nor transmit the disease.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Refolding</b> of α-helical transmembrane {{proteins}} in vitro is technically difficult. There are relatively {{few examples of}} the successful <b>refolding</b> experiments, as for bacteriorhodopsin. In vivo, all such proteins are normally folded co-translationally within the large transmembrane translocon. The translocon channel provides a highly heterogeneous environment for the nascent transmembane α-helices. A relatively polar amphiphilic α-helix can adopt a transmembrane orientation in the translocon (although {{it would be at}} the membrane surface or unfolded in vitro), because its polar residues can face [...] the central water-filled channel of the translocon. Such mechanism is necessary for incorporation of polar α-helices into structures of transmembrane proteins. The amphiphilic helices remain attached to the translocon until the protein is completely synthesized and folded. If the protein remains unfolded and attached to the translocon for too long, it is degraded by specific [...] "quality control" [...] cellular systems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{association}} of a protein with a lipid bilayer may involve significant changes within tertiary {{structure of a}} protein. These may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded [...] or a re-arrangement in the folding or a <b>refolding</b> of the membrane-associated part of the proteins [...] It also may involve the formation or dissociation of protein quaternary structures or oligomeric complexes, and specific binding of ions, ligands, or regulatory lipids.|$|E
2500|$|Deleuze adapts the {{doctrine}} of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference. [...] "With univocity, however, {{it is not the}} differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, {{in the sense that it}} is said of difference. Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being." [...] Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one substance, God or Nature. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating process, an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, <b>refolding.</b> Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula [...] "pluralism = monism".|$|E

40|$|A tetrameric protein of {{therapeutic}} importance, Escherichia coli L-Asparaginase-II was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Asparaginase inclusion bodies were solubilized using low concentration of urea and <b>refolded</b> into active tetrameric protein using pulsatile dilution method. <b>Refolded</b> asparaginase was purified in two steps using ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatographic techniques. The recovery of bioactive asparaginase from inclusion bodies was around 50 %. The melting temperature (Tm) of the purified asparaginase {{was found to}} be 64 °C. The specific activity of <b>refolded,</b> purified asparaginase {{was found to be}} comparable to the commercial asparaginase (190 U/mg). Enzymatic activity of the <b>refolded</b> asparaginase was high even at four molar urea solutions, where the inclusion body aggregates are completely solubilized. From the comparison of chemical denaturation data and activity at different concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride, it was observed that dissociation of monomeric units precedes the complete loss of helical secondary structures. Protection of the existing native-like protein structure during solubilization of inclusion body aggregates with 4 M urea improved the propensity of monomer units to form oligomeric structure. This helped in improved recovery of asparaginase in bioactive tetrameric form...|$|R
