A panel of 14 experts having broad experience with clinical application of RPDs using thermoplastic resin was selected {{from members of}} the Japan Prosthodontic Society. At a meeting of the panel, “non-metal clasp denture” was referred as the generic name of RPDs with retentive <b>elements</b> (<b>resin</b> clasps) made of thermoplastic resin. The panel classified non-metal clasp dentures into two types: one with a flexible structure that lacks a metal framework and the other having a rigid structure that includes a metal framework.

Functional moiety of 2 -amino- 5 -hydroxy benzoic acid (AHBA) was chemically bonded to the amino group of cross-linked chitosan (CCTS) through the arm of chloromethyloxirane (CCTS-AHBA <b>resin).</b> Several <b>elements,</b> such as Ag, Be, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Ph, U, V, and rare earth elements (REEs), could be adsorbed on the resin. To use the resin for on-line pretreatment, the resin was packed in a mini-column and installed into a sequential-injection/automated pretreatment system (Auto-Pret System) coupled with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The sequential-injection/automated pretreatment system was a laboratory-assembled, and the program was written using Visual Basic software. This system can provide easy operation procedures, less reagent consumption, as well as less waste production. Experimental variables considered as effective factors in the improvement sensitivity, such as an eluent concentration, a sample and an eluent flow rate, pH of samples, and air-sandwiched eluent were carefully optimized. The proposed system provides excellent on-line collection efficiency, as well as high concentration factors of analytes in water samples, which results in highly sensitive detection of ultra-trace and trace analysis.

Uranium, molybdenum, and antimony {{were found to be}} about 40 % associated with fulvic and hydrophilic acids adsorbed on XAD resins at pH 2, the metal-organic association being not dissociated. Much higher percentages of the same elements, plus vanadium, were adsorbed on the DEAE resin at the pH of natural water, possibly because of the better preservation of acid labile organic complexes or of the supplementary adsorption of inorganic compounds. Ultrafiltration and dialysis made it possible to exclude colloidal fractions together with much U (78 %), Mo (80 %), V (55 %), and DOC (65 %). These elements and many others (including barium) were previously found to be quite reactive {{at the bottom of the}} lake, (apparently being scavenged by settling particles, which are mostly diatoms, then dissolved at the sediment-water interface). Conversely, trace elements with a conservative behavior in the bottom layer (such as lithium and cesium) were not found associated with dissolved organic mater (DOM). Barium was not strongly associated with the extractable DOM, which may argue for a direct interaction with inorganic particles or the existence of very labile complexes.

The preform was resin transfer molded with 3 M PR 500 epoxy <b>resin.</b> Finite <b>element</b> analyses (FEA) of the test specimens are conducted to assess intra- and inter- laminar progressive failure models. These progressive failure models are then implemented in a FEA of a circular fuselage frame of the same cross section and material for which test data was available.

The short column test specimens were cut {{from some of the}} fuselage frames. The branched shell finite element model of the frame included geometric nonlinearity and contact of the load platen of the testing machine with the frame. Intralaminar progressive failure is based on a maximum in-plane stress failure criterion followed by a moduli degradation scheme. Interlaminar progressive failure was implemented using an interface finite element to model delamination initiation and the progression of delamination cracks.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to choose a new resin for the BP Castro(bottle-making process. Four resins were tested using the standard 10 -week stack test: ExxonMobil HY A 30 I (the control), Chevron Marlex 9512 H, Dow DMDA 6200, and BP Solvay HPS 0 - 25 - 155. The study focused on five possible defects: bent neck, pushed up base, creased side wall, pushed in bumper, and creased label panel. The goal was to find a resin that performed as well as or better than the control resin. The test required bottles to be made and quality-checked for conformance to specification. The bottles were then put into an Environmental Stress Crack Resistance test and subsequently set up in a warehouse for a live load double stack test. Four pallets of each resin were loaded with ballast weight and left untouched. At the conclusion of IO weeks, the ballast weight was removed and the bottles were inspected for defects. None of the resins clearly outperformed the control <b>resin</b> on all <b>elements</b> of the evaluation. Due to the lack of supply of the control resin, a new resin had to be picked from this set; therefore, the comparison was narrowed down to a single defect type: bent neck.

40|$|Objective: Ceramic inlays are {{bonded to}} tooth {{structure}} with resin cements. During the resin cement setting, shrinkage stress develops at the interfaces. During tooth preparation, the undercut areas formed {{due to the}} different patterns of caries progression can either be blocked out before taking impression with suitable cement such as glass ionomer cement, or before making the final restoration in the laboratory. Then, the relieved space will be filled with luting cement in clinic. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare these two methods of undercut filling in term of stress distribution in the ceramic inlay. Materials and Methods: An axisymmetric finite element analysis was performed to study the stress distribution during inlay cementing. The solid model was generated from a longitudinal section of maxillary premolar in which a class I cavity with 60 degree undercut at the preparation wall and 20 degree divergence of the vertical walls was prepared. A thermal model was used to simulate the polymerization shrinkage of the <b>resin</b> cement. Finite <b>element</b> analysis was carried out in ANSYS environment. Results: Filling the undercut by glass ionomer cement decreased the stress concentration at the ceramic/cement interface. The dominant normal stress at the tooth cement interface in absence of glass ionomer cement was tensile with maximum of 30 Mpa. Using glass ionomer, cement developed stresses with different compressive and tensile signs. With increasing the thickness of resin cement (100 µm, 150 µm, 200 µm), the stress increased. Conclusion: Cements with minimum shrinkage and as thin layer as possible should be used. Filling the undercut with glass ionomer cement decreases the stress.

40|$|High-precision isotopic {{analysis}} of Cu in blood serum via multi-collector ICP-mass spectrometry (MCICP-MS) {{has recently been}} shown valuable for diagnosis and prognosis of diseases affecting Cu metabolism. However, {{as a result of}} the low Cu concentration (# 2 mg L- 1) in blood serum compared to the high contents of concomitant matrix elements (e. g., similar to 3000 mg L- 1 Na, similar to 1000 mg L- 1 S, similar to 100 mg L- 1 Ca and similar to 20 mg L- 1 Mg) and the measurable effect that the matrix typically exerts on the extent of instrumental mass discrimination in MC-ICP-MS, an exhaustive sample preparation protocol is required. In this work, an alternative procedure for Cu isolation from serum prior to isotope ratio measurement by MC-ICP-MS was evaluated. This procedure involves removal of the alkali and earth alkaline metals using 1 mL of Chelex- 100 chelating ion exchange resin, followed by further purification of the Cu-fraction using 250 mu L of AG MP 1 anion exchange <b>resin.</b> The matrix <b>elements</b> were removed efficiently and Cu recoveries were quantitative in all cases. The alternative Cu isolation procedure showed several advantages compared to the conventional procedure, e. g., (i) a reduction in the amount of acids, cost and time required and (ii) lower blank levels. The effect of (remaining) concomitant matrix elements on the Cu isotope ratio accuracy and precision attainable was evaluated using both the standard interface (combination of standard cones and a large dry interface pump) and the high-transmission 'jet' interface (combination of 'jet' cones and a large dry interface pump). For standard solutions, the jet interface provided a superior internal precision (improved by a factor of 1. 5) for the raw (uncorrected) Cu- 65 /Cu- 63 ratio and a mitigated extent of instrumental mass discrimination. However, the influence of matrix elements on the Cu isotope ratio results was stronger with the jet interface than with the standard interface. The proposed procedure was validated using standards with known isotopic composition, a serum reference material and human serum samples. No statistical differences were obtained (at a 95 % confidence interval) in the delta Cu- 65 values using the proposed and the conventional (two column passes using 1 mL of AG MP 1 resin) procedure. Finally, serum samples collected at different time points during a day from five volunteers were analysed in order to study diurnal variations in the serum Cu isotopic composition. No diurnal variations were established...|$|R
40|$|Estuaries are {{sensitive}} environments regarding {{their response to}} anthropogenic events. The accumulation of toxic trace elements, such as Cd and Pb, has detrimental consequences on benthic community composition and function {{that can lead to}} human health issues when seafood is consumed. Eutrophic water can generate blooms of macroalgae and can induce adverse changes in the structure of an entire food web. Environmental research is of fundamental importance to understand the sources, fates and effects of contaminants. It will permit the development of remediation strategies to improve sustainable practices. The approach taken in the research presented is focused on the measurement of trace elements in sediment, water and biota, and the application of stable isotopes in the detection of sources of contaminants. A novel set of data on New Zealand estuarine species, not usually screened for pollutants, has been assembled {{in the context of a}} number of estuarine systems that have been influenced by a range of anthropogenically generated contamination events. The combined use of diffuse gradient ‘in thin films’ (DGT) and the analysis of δ 15 N-NO 3 and δ 18 O-NO 3 in water, are new for New Zealand estuarine systems; the correlations generated will enhance baseline datasets for future environmental studies. This research additionally led to the development of a novel environmental indicator, “Ecohardness”, reflecting the estuarine chemical budget by the analysis of the material strength of cockle shell. From this research, lead, cadmium and zinc were found to be the most concerning polluting elements in the study location, with levels above sedimentary ANZECC safety guidelines. Phosphorus was found in high concentration in urban and rural estuaries heavily impacted by agricultural practices. Isotopic analysis confirmed sources of pollution with higher values of δ 13 C and δ 15 N near treated wastewater ponds. The accumulation of contaminants was also associated with river and stormwater inputs and the intensive use of fertilisers. The accumulation of trace elements was specifically associated with metal pathways rather than sedimentary composition. However, metal speciation is of fundamental importance in ecotoxicology and is regarded as more significant than bulk concentrations in water and sediment in the understanding of biological response of organisms to trace elements. Accumulation of trace elements in biota was found to be strongly associated to those that were captured in DGT devices deployed in the water (‘DGT-labile’ elements). DGT-labile elements can be defined as the “bioavailable” fraction, as this technique uses a hydrogel layer to control the diffuse transport of trace elements in solution, to a binding <b>resin.</b> All labile <b>elements</b> were found in higher concentration in the stream/estuarine environment than the ocean, demonstrating the characteristic of estuaries as a sink for trace elements. Further insight into the speciation of the various elements was permitted by calculating the rate of accumulation in different hydrogel thicknesses. Each element could be classified according to their behaviour ranking from putatively free simple inorganic cations with no resupply from complex ligands (e. g. Cd at Bureta), to fully sustained conditions with a constant degree of resupply of free ions and labile complexes (e. g. Ni, Fe and Cu at Bureta). The development of a novel environmental parameter “EcoHardness”, has application to examining pollutant response in estuarine bivalves. While microhardness has been measured previously in bivalves (cockle shell) and correlated to microstructure, this is the first time that microhardness for the same species was analysed in different estuaries that have different anthropogenic pollution attributes. The method demonstrated an increase of microhardness in response to a decrease of Ca content, that appeared to be inversely correlated to an increase of trace elements that were associated with the general chemical state of estuaries. Hence, harder shells were associated with more polluted estuarine areas. This parameter could be a valuable tool in the assessment of environmental changes linked to the increase of trace metal pollutants as observed around the world in the last few decades. This work has extended research into the environmental health of estuaries by combining a number of known analytical methodologies in a novel manner and through the development of a new technology. In addition, the work has examined a relevant trophic cascade of species further providing an insight into ecosystem functioning against a backdrop of human presence...|$|R
40|$|The Tasmanian {{sawmilling}} industry typically {{does not}} season eucalypt material specifically for furniture applications {{because of its}} highly refractory seasoning characteristics. Boards cut with wide faces parallel to the growth rings ('backsawn or 'flatsawn' boards), in particular, shrink significantly with drying and often experience surface checking (seasoning 'degrade'). It is standard practice to season timber batches under schedules designed to produce relatively high-grade structural material and sell the small proportion of boards that do not suffer seasoning degrade as furniture grade material. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate optimum seasoning of backsawn material specifically for furniture applications to take advantage of the premium prices paid by furniture manufacturers for degrade-free material. Acoustic emission is a well known non-destructive testing tool. Acoustic emission results from stress waves generated by irreversible stress release activity such as the growth of small cracks in a solid material under load. Acoustic emission is typically used in homogeneous materials such as plastics and metals to determine the structural integrity of components in situ. Acoustic emission was first measured in timber subject to external load over thirty years ago and has subsequently been measured in drying timber specimens where differential drying rates between the surface and centre of a sample may cause appreciable drying stresses. Acoustic emission appeared to be related to the severity of the drying conditions and the development of surface checking (Becker 1982, Noguchi et al. 1987). Under harsh drying regimes, surface checking occurred and a significantly higher AE rate was measured than in the same species subject to mild drying conditions. The 'AE rate' is a measure of the occurrence of high-energy bursts of acoustic waves during a particular time-period - the higher the AE rate, the more energetic bursts are measured. On this basis, it appeared feasible to measure acoustic emission in sample boards in a kiln during drying and adjust the drying conditions as the AE rate approached levels previously determined to correspond to surface checking. Various AE-based kiln control systems were reported in the literature (Honeycutt et al. 1985, Noguchi et al. 1987) but it appears acoustic emission was not satisfactorily related to surface check development. These control systems controlled the drying conditions based on arbitrary AE rates that were nominally selected as 'safe' without optimising the drying process. The heterogeneous structure of timber posed significant obstacles to forming a clear picture of the stress release processes occurring in timber. Acoustic emission measured in drying Tasmanian eucalypt boards was employed in this project as an online measure of the magnitude of the stresses during drying. Numerous batches of eucalypt boards were obtained from a sawmill during the project and dried under harsh conditions to induce surface checking. It was determined that the AE rate generated at the onset of surface checking in backsawn and quartersawn boards was effectively constant (within the variability of the material). This 'AE checking threshold' was independent of basic density and clearly independent of bulk stiffness (since the bulk tangential stiffness is effectively half the radial stiffness in the species studied). It appeared that the acoustic emission phenomenon was independent of the timber bulk material properties. It is proposed that acoustic emission waves propagate from irreversible slips or dislocations in the crystalline cellulose regions of cell walls under high stress. These slips are sudden, energetic stress release events which propagate stress waves from the local site. The amorphous regions of the cell structure behave in a rather plastic manner with local stress expected to be consumed by ductile flow processes that do not generate elastic waves. Dinwoodie (1968) reported the existence of such crystalline slips in spruce timber under external compression. Siau (1984) reported that the proportion by mass of cellulose in normal wood (as opposed to tension and compression wood) was remarkably constant and apparently independent of species. Further, the proportion of crystalline cellulose is also relatively constant (Siau 1984). This appears to be directly related to the remarkably constant AE rate measured at the onset of surface checking in this study. This finding led to the measurement of acoustic emission in other species. It was hoped that the same AE 'rate would be measured at the onset of checking in different woods. Acoustic emission was measured in backsawn radiata pine (Pinus radiata) and myrtle (Nothofagus cunninghamii). The acoustic emission measured in radiata pine was significantly different from the acoustic emission measured in the eucalypt material, with relatively 'massive' AE rates detected in boards free of seasoning degrade. This behaviour was attributed to brittle failure in the <b>resin</b> canals, structural <b>elements</b> not present in the eucalypt genus. The characteristic AE responses measured in drying myrtle boards resembled the behaviour measured in the eucalypt boards, apparently due to the more similar structure. Surface checking was detected at approximately the same AE rate as that measured in the eucalypt boards. Much of the improved understanding of the acoustic emission phenomenon developed in this study was facilitated by the existence of a one-dimensional nonlinear drying model developed by Oliver (1991). Oliver wrote KILNSCHED (KILN SCHEDULING PROGRAM), a computer program based on this model, which simulates the drying behaviour of a single board, with arbitrary bulk material properties, subject to arbitrary drying conditions. KILNSCHED is particularly suited to low temperature drying of eucalypt materials. Kiln drying trials quickly revealed that 'green' Tasmanian eucalypt boards invariably suffered surface checking within 24 hours when subject to drying temperatures as low as 23 °C dry bulb temperature and 21 °C wet bulb temperature (at 0. 5 m/s airspeed). Such temperatures are significantly lower than those often employed in drying material direct off-saw in the timber industry but none-the-less are considered 'harsh' in this study. At the commencement of this study, KILNSCHED was used in a purely predictive mode to assess drying schedules prior to drying. The author of this thesis modified KILNSCHED to simulate drying using the real-time drying temperatures measured in the experimental kiln. This allowed measured acoustic emission during drying to be compared with the drying behaviour calculated with KILNSCHED. This modification revealed that Tasmanian eucalypt timber is far more sensitive to small temperature fluctuations than was previously expected. The reader must keep this material sensitivity to temperature and temperature change in mind at all times when reading this thesis. The AE rate measured during drying was successfully related to the instantaneous strain at a board surface calculated with KILNSCHED using the measured drying conditions. Instantaneous strain is the strain component employed as the failure criterion in the drying model. This enabled the author to place considerable confidence in behaviour calculated with KILNSCHED and the 'optimum drying' program SMARTKILN discussed below. This author modified KILNSCHED to incorporate an optimisation algorithm that determined the optimum drying conditions required to dry the timber in the minimum time at a preset arbritrary maximum surface instantaneous strain. The resulting program, SMARTKILN, develops drying schedules to maintain the calculated surface instantaneous strain at a preset 'Control Strain' below the ultimate surface instantaneous strain. Together, SMARTKILN and acoustic emission measurement form the basis of Clever Kiln Controller®, a kiln control system to dry Tasmanian eucalypt timber in the minimum time with minimum degrade. In Clever Kiln Controller, SMARTKILN uses datalogged real time drying conditions to simulate the drying behaviour of a sample board in the kiln. Calculated drying behaviour is continuously compared with measured drying behaviour (measured AE rate and moisture profiles measured by regularly slicing sample boards). Provided the calculated and measured drying behaviour are satisfactorily matched, the optimum drying schedule developed by SMARTKILN is applied to the kiln. When the AE rate approaches the AE checking threshold, the drying conditions are automatically ameliorated to prevent surface checking. Subsequently, SMARTKILN develops a refined optimum schedule to incorporate the new datalogged drying conditions. This study has developed the understanding of acoustic emission from the existing (often misleading) information recorded in the literature to a level that could be incorporated with current knowledge of the behaviour of drying timber. The thesis describes how this was achieved. Various aspects of the understanding have been reported in papers published, in press or under review. The final result is the development of a commercial kiln controller which is described and already implemented in some selected experimental kilns at present restricted to eucalypt materials...|$|R
