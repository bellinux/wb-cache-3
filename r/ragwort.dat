5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is covered}} predominantly by temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 64 {{percent of the}} total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's fritillary, oblongleaf stonecrop, Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, Scotch broom, St. Johns wort, and tansy <b>ragwort.</b>|$|E

5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf <b>ragwort,</b> penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{living in}} grasslands, tarucas feed {{mainly on the}} local bushes, shrubs, and herbs {{for much of the}} year, {{although}} they supplement this diet with grasses during the rainy season. Plants commonly eaten include dwarf gentian, <b>ragworts,</b> lupins, senna, valerian, and clubmosses. Tarucas may also feed on agricultural crops, such as alfalfa, barley, and potato plants.|$|R
50|$|The slow-flying moths {{can often}} be seen feeding at flowers; it is common around its {{preferred}} food plants of the daisy family, for example groundsel (and other Senecio spp.), <b>ragworts</b> and Cineraria. The colourful hairy larvae feed openly on the plants, often stripping off all the leaves. The mature larvae will sometimes wander from the plant to pupate. The loosely spun cocoon incorporates some of the larval hairs and may also be found amongst leaves.|$|R
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{where the}} plant is native, <b>ragwort</b> {{provides}} a home and food source to at least 77 insect species.

60|$|Let us take as {{examples}} a single little set of instances, familiar to everybody, but far commoner {{in the world}} at large than the inhabitants of towns are at all aware of: I mean, the winged seeds, that fly about freely in the air by means of feathery hairs or gossamer, like thistle-down and dandelion. Of these winged types we have many hundred varieties in England alone. All the willow-herbs, for example, have such feathery seeds (or rather fruits) to help them on their way through life; and one kind, the beautiful pink rose-bay, flies about so readily, and over such wide spaces of open country, that the plant is known to farmers in America as fireweed, because it always springs up at once over whole square miles of charred and smoking soil after every devastating forest fire. It travels fast, for it travels like Ariel. In much the same way, the coltsfoot grows on all new English railway banks, because its winged seeds are wafted everywhere in myriads on the winds of March. All the willows and poplars have also winged seeds: so have the whole vast tribe of hawkweeds, groundsels, <b>ragworts,</b> thistles, fleabanes, cat's-ears, dandelions, and lettuces. Indeed, one may say roughly, there are very few plants of any size or importance in the economy of nature which don't deliberately provide, in one way or another, for the dispersal and dissemination of their fruits or seedlings.|$|R
40|$|Interspecific {{hybridization}} is {{an important}} mechanism of speciation in higher plants. In flowering plants, hybrid speciation is usually associated with polyploidy (allopolyploidy), but hybrid speciation without genome duplication (homoploid hybrid speciation) is also possible, although {{it is more difficult}} to detect. The combination of divergent genomes within a hybrid can result in profound changes to both genome and transcriptome. Recent transcriptomic studies of wild and resynthesized homoploid and allopolyploid hybrids have revealed widespread changes to gene expression in hybrids relative to expression levels in their parents. Many of these changes to gene expression are ?non-additive?, i. e. not simply the sum of the combined expression levels of parental genes. Some gene expression changes are far outside the range of gene expression in either parent, and can therefore be viewed as ?transgressive?. Such profound changes to gene expression may enable new hybrids to survive in novel habitats not accessible to their parent species. Here, we give a brief overview of hybrid speciation in plants, with an emphasis on genomic change, before focusing discussion on findings from recent transcriptomic studies. We then discuss our current work on gene expression change associated with hybrid speciation in the genus Senecio (<b>ragworts</b> and groundsels) focusing on the findings from a reanalysis of gene expression data obtained from recent microarray studies of wild and resynthesized allopolyploid Senecio cambrensis. These data, showing extensive non-additive and transgressive gene expression changes in Senecio hybrids, are discussed in the light of findings from other model systems, and {{in the context of the}} potential importance of gene expression change to hybrid speciation in plants.

40|$|Diversifying {{selection}} and gene flow were traditionally viewed as antagonistic forces, with diversifying selection promoting adaptation and speciation, and gene flow opposing them. However, their roles {{are far more}} complex than this. While gene flow can prevent speciation or initiate despeciation, it can also generate new hybrid species. Similarly, while adaptive divergence can be wiped out by gene flow, new adaptive variation can be introduced via hybridisation. The relative frequency of these outcomes, and indeed the frequency of gene flow and diversifying selection in general are largely unknown. This thesis illuminates these questions through evolutionary genomic analyses focussed on a recently diverged group of <b>ragworts</b> (Senecio). The Mediterranean Senecio species-complex contains several cases of hybrid speciation, {{as well as two}} species, S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius, which are a potential case of ecological speciation with gene flow, having adapted to high and low altitude habitats respectively on Mount Etna. However, their demography was previously un-studied. I first show that S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius diverged recently, at a time that coincides with the growth of Mount Etna to the altitudes which separate the species today, have experienced significant gene flow following their split, and are likely to be sister species, bolstering the hypothesis of ecological speciation. I further demonstrate that gene flow is common in the wider clade, and pinpoint multiple cases of gene flow amongst them. Finally, I identify several genes under positive selection in the clade, and show that the proportion of genes under selection is high relative to many other plant genera. The results further establish Senecio species as an invaluable model system for the study of diversification with gene flow, and suggest that high levels of gene flow and selection are features of their evolution, a situation which may prove to be common in plants. </p...|$|R
25|$|<b>Ragwort</b> is {{of concern}} to people who keep horses and cattle. In {{areas of the world}} where <b>ragwort</b> is a native plant, such as Britain and {{continental}} Europe, documented cases of proven poisoning are rare. Horses do not normally eat fresh <b>ragwort</b> due to its bitter taste. The result, if sufficient quantity is consumed, can be irreversible cirrhosis of the liver of a form identified as megalocytosis where cells are abnormally enlarged. Signs that a horse has been poisoned include yellow mucous membranes, depression, and lack of coordination.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the fact}} that <b>ragwort</b> is very {{attractive}} to such {{a vast array of}} insects, some of these are very rare indeed. Of the 30 species that specifically feed on <b>ragwort</b> alone, seven are officially deemed Nationally Scarce. A further three species are on the IUCN Red List. In short, <b>ragwort</b> is an exclusive food source for ten rare or threatened insect species, including the Cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae), the Picture Winged Fly (Campiglossa malaris), the Scarce Clouded Knot Horn moth (Homoeosoma nimbella), and the Sussex Emerald moth (Thalera fimbrialis). The Sussex Emerald has been labelled a Priority Species in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan. A Priority Species is one which is scarce, threatened and declining The remainder of the ten threatened species include three species of Leaf Beetle, another Picture-Winged Fly, and three micro moths.
