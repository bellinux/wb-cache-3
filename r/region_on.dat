5|$|A monsoon trough {{was noted}} {{along the coast}} of Australia's Northern Territory in late November into early December 1988. This system led to {{sporadic}} heavy rain in the <b>region.</b> <b>On</b> 12December, a tropical low consolidated from the monsoon trough over the Timor Sea, west of Darwin, Northern Territory. Moving southwest, the system skirted the Kimberley coast before turning west. Acquiring gale-force winds by 00:00UTC on 13December, the low was classified as a Category1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Ilona by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Perth, Western Australia. At this time it was situated near Adele Island. Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories, dubbing it Tropical Cyclone 03S. Decelerating somewhat, Ilona steadily intensified over the following days and achieved severe tropical cyclone status—having ten-minute sustained winds of at least —around 12:00UTC on 15December.

Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing {{what was going on in}} the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the <b>region.</b> <b>On</b> November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E
