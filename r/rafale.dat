5|$|AASM {{made its}} combat debut on April 20, 2008, during the War in Afghanistan when a <b>Rafale</b> fighter fired two {{in support of}} ground troops.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 2011, it was {{reported}} that a AASM missile fired from a Dassault <b>Rafale</b> was used to destroy a Libyan tank at a range of 55km.|$|E
5|$|While demonstrating {{excellent}} results, {{this campaign}} showed {{the need to}} change some of the aerodynamic features of the weapon. To compensate for delays in AASM deliveries in 2008 France ordered dual-mode (laser- and GPS/INS-guided) GBU-49 Enhanced Paveway II kits for integration with Mirage 2000D and <b>Rafale</b> fighter-bombers. The GPS/INS + IIR guided version completed its qualification tests on July 9, 2008 after three firings at the DGA's missile test range in Biscarosse. This 250kg IR version performed a night launch from a <b>Rafale</b> fighter-bomber at DGA's Biscarosse test range in December 2010.|$|E

50|$|A joint strike {{force of}} Air Force <b>Rafales</b> and Mirage 2000Ds and Navy <b>Rafales</b> and Super Etendards {{attacked}} anti-aircraft missile sites 20 km south of Sirte. A patrol of two French and four Qatari Mirage 2000-5s conducted air interdiction sorties.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2014, <b>Rafales</b> began flying {{reconnaissance}} missions over Iraq {{as part of}} Opération Chammal, France's {{contribution to}} the international effort to combat Islamic State (IS) militants. Six (later nine) <b>Rafales</b> were initially tasked with identifying IS positions in support of US airstrikes, flying from Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE. [...] On 18 September, <b>Rafales</b> joined American operations in conducting attacks, launching four strikes near the Northern Iraqi town of Zumar that destroyed a logistics depot and killed dozens of IS fighters.|$|R
5|$|In June 2015, {{a working}} group {{set up by the}} Finnish MoD {{proposed}} starting a program to replace the Finnish Air Force's current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault <b>Rafale,</b> Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35, and Saab JAS Gripen.|$|E
5|$|In Operation Deliberate Force, the NATO bombing {{campaign}} over Bosnia in 1995, six Jaguars, based in Italy, conducted 63 strike missions. The last Jaguars in French service were retired in 2005, being replaced {{in the ground}} attack roles by the Dassault <b>Rafale.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 24 March 2011 it was {{reported}} that an AASM missile fired from a Dassault <b>Rafale</b> was used to destroy a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light ground attack/trainer jet, the first Libyan warplane to challenge the no-fly zone during the 2011 Libyan civil war, on the runway just after the plane had landed at Misrata Airport.|$|E
50|$|On 21 August 2016, {{a strike}} group {{composed}} of 4 <b>Rafales</b> and 4 Mirage 2000D launched a multiple SCALP-EG cruise missile attack against Islamic State weapon storage site, firing 12 missiles. The <b>Rafales</b> were armed with two cruise missiles each, while the Mirages were armed with one cruise missile each.|$|R

5|$|In 1996, Russia {{submitted}} the Su-27M and Su-37 for South Korea's F-X programme, which sought a 40-aircraft {{replacement for the}} Republic of Korea Air Force's F-4D/Es, RF-4Cs and F-5E/Fs. The two Russian designs competed against the Dassault <b>Rafale,</b> Eurofighter Typhoon, and F-15K Slam Eagle. Sukhoi proposed a design which featured a phased-grid radar and thrust-vectoring engines, and offered full technology transfer as well as final assembly in South Korea. The US$5billion contract would have been partially financed through a debt-reduction deal on money Russia owed to South Korea. However, the Su-27M was eliminated early in the competition, which was won by the F-15K.|$|E
5|$|With {{the tender}} relaunched in 2007 as the F-X2 competition, the Brazilian Defence Ministry looked to {{purchase}} at least 36 aircraft– {{with a potential}} for 84 additional aircraft– to replace the country's A-1Ms, F-5BRs, and Mirage IIIs. Among the participants were the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16BR, JAS Gripen NG, Dassault <b>Rafale,</b> Eurofighter Typhoon and the modernized Su-35. Although the Brazilian government eliminated the Su-35 in 2008, Rosoboronexport subsequently offered to sell the country 120 aircraft with full technology transfer, as well as participation in the PAK FA programme. In December 2013, the Gripen NG light fighter was selected because of its low cost and the transfer of technology to the Brazilian industry.|$|E
5|$|In late 2014, Russia {{offered the}} Su-35 to Indonesia {{as the country}} sought to replace its ageing F-5E Tiger II fleet. The {{following}} year, the Indonesian Ministry of Defence selected the Su-35 ahead of the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault <b>Rafale,</b> F-16, and Saab JAS 39 Gripen; the Defence Ministry cited the Indonesian Air Force's familiarity with the Su-27SK and Su-30MK2 {{as the reason for}} the aircraft's selection. There were some initial reports that the country was to order a squadron of up to sixteen aircraft, but the number was later reduced to some ten aircraft. By mid-2017, negotiations between the two parties for the sale of the Su-35 had reached an advanced stage, with the Indonesian government later agreed in principle to conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Air {{operations}} were planned {{to focus on}} the region around Zintan and Misrata. Air force <b>Rafales</b> and Mirage 2000Ds and a joint patrol of Navy <b>Rafales</b> and Super Etendards bombed an ammunition dump at Gharyan, 100 km south of Tripoli. Mirage F1CRs conducted reconnaissance missions {{for the first time in}} the operation.|$|R
50|$|Two patrols of Air Force <b>Rafales</b> and Mirage 2000Ds and {{a patrol}} of Navy <b>Rafales</b> and Super Etendards {{attacked}} anti-aircraft missile sites 100 km south west of Tripoli. Two joint patrols of French and Qatari Mirage 2000-5s conducted air interdiction sorties. Mirage 2000Ds and Super Etendards bombed a military depot 30 km south of Tripoli.|$|R
50|$|The {{market was}} {{previously}} served by: Quebec <b>Rafales</b> of the IHL (1996-1998).|$|R
25|$|Eurofighter {{was one of}} the six {{aircraft}} {{competing for}} the Indian MRCA competition for 126 multi-role fighters. In April 2011, the Indian Air Force (IAF) shortlisted the Dassault <b>Rafale</b> and Eurofighter Typhoon for the US$10.4billion contract. On 31 January 2012, the IAF announced the <b>Rafale</b> as the preferred bidder in the competition.|$|E
25|$|The C.430 <b>Rafale</b> was a two-seat {{development}} of the single seat Caudron C.362, {{the winner of the}} 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe. Slightly larger and heavier, though with a lower wing loading, the <b>Rafale</b> was a low wing cantilever monoplane, wood framed and covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its one piece, single spar wing was strongly straight tapered to elliptical tips and was plywood covered with an outer layer of fabric. There were flaps inboard of the ailerons.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage 2000 {{is being}} {{replaced}} in French service by the Dassault <b>Rafale,</b> which became operational with the French Air Force in June 2006.|$|E
50|$|In August 2013, it was {{proposed}} that France may halve {{the number of}} <b>Rafales</b> to be delivered {{over the next six}} years for a total of 26 aircraft to be delivered during this period; foreign export procurements have been viewed as critical to maintain production under this proposal. While production would be slowed, France would still receive the same number of <b>Rafales</b> overall.|$|R
50|$|Initially it was 18 <b>Rafales</b> {{that were}} to be built and sent to India in fly away {{conditions}} by France. But, on the joint press statement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's with President François Hollande, during his visit of France, the PM said that India will purchase 36 <b>Rafales</b> directly from France. And the contract {{is said to be}} sealed soon.|$|R
50|$|After the season, the Knights {{moved from}} Atlanta to Quebec City {{and became the}} Quebec <b>Rafales.</b>|$|R
25|$|With {{a budget}} of 7 million euros, The Unknown Soldier holds {{the title of the}} most {{expensive}} film produced in the Finnish language. Producers pitched the film to investors with the script alone and funding for the film was fully secured in August 2015 with €5 million of the financing coming from private investors. Reportedly <b>Rafale</b> International, a defense aviation manufacturer whose Dassault <b>Rafale</b> fighter is one of the aircraft in consideration to replace the Finnish Air Force's fleet of F/A-18 Hornets, was the movie's main partner.|$|E
25|$|The Caudron C.430 <b>Rafale</b> was a fast, {{two seat}} French touring monoplane. Soon after its first flight in 1933 it set an {{international}} class speed record.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 2009, Brazilian Independence Day, it was {{announced}} Brazil would negotiate 36 Dassault <b>Rafale.</b> But the Defence Minister did not confirm the final decision.|$|E

50|$|In May 2015, Qatar ordered 160 Meteor {{missiles}} to equip the Dassault <b>Rafales</b> of the Qatar Emiri Air Force.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Rafale</b> had a fixed wide track, {{tailskid}} undercarriage. Its wheels were on vertical, slender aerofoil section {{legs from}} {{the wings and}} were largely enclosed within magnesium alloy fairings.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, it was {{reported}} that Switzerland was considering the Eurofighter, the <b>Rafale</b> and the Saab JAS 39 Gripen to replace its Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs. A one-month evaluation started in October 2008 at Emmen Airforce Base consisting of approximately 30 evaluation flights. On 30 November 2011 the Swiss Federal Council announced that it was planning to buy 22 Gripen NGs due to its lower acquisition and maintenance costs. A leaked Swiss Air Force evaluation report revealed that the <b>Rafale</b> won the competition on technical grounds and Dassault offered to lower the price for 18 Rafales.|$|E
25|$|The C.430 <b>Rafale</b> {{probably}} flew for {{the first}} time in the last week of March 1934, though the Flight article specifically refers to F-AMVB which alphabetically at least was the second of the type.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, <b>Rafales</b> {{operating}} from Charles de Gaulle struck targets {{associated with the}} Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} replace the elderly F1CRs of 2/33s, a number of <b>Rafales</b> were {{outfitted}} with an advanced reconnaissance pod. The <b>Rafale's</b> range, maneuverability and combat load is far superior to the F1CR that it replaces, {{as well as its}} reconnaissance capabilities: after the <b>Rafale's</b> pod has taken photographs, these can be almost instantly transmitted back to its base or where the imagery would be required if provisioned with compatible down link equipment. The French Air Force's last Mirage F1 fighters were retired from operational service on 13 June 2014. The last units in service, these being 11 single-seat Mirage F1CRs and three two-seat F1Bs were transferred to storage; six aircraft performed a final appearance in a flypast during Bastille Day celebrations over Paris prior to their disposal.|$|R
