In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E
5|$|However, despite Ohio's large {{presence}} in the iron and steel market, employment <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> declined in Ohio, generally attributed to weakening national economy. Between 1998 and 2005, the number of Ohio {{iron and steel industry}} workers decreased from 52,700 to 34,000. The Ohio Department of Development predicts the decreases will continue in coming years. The average annual salary for iron and steel industry workers in Ohio was $59,686, compared the national industry average of $53,352.|$|E

5|$|Commercial solar {{water heaters}} began {{appearing}} in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed attention {{as a result of}} the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> averaged 20% since 1999. Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154GW as of 2007.|$|E

The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%.

While abortion <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010â€“2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15â€“44, a total of 56 million abortions per year.

Death <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> dropped since the mid-twentieth century; in Sweden poisoning is common, though life-threatening poisonings have not been detected and there was no fatality reported over the 50 years from 1952 to 2002.

5|$|However, despite {{increased}} production, employment {{has been}} decreasing in Ohio's rubber and plastic industry. In 2000, Ohio employed around 92,000 rubber and plastics industry workers. By 2006, those <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> declined by about 26% to about 69,000 workers. The Ohio Bureau of Labor Market Information predicts that, from 2004 to 2014, {{there will be}} 11,200 less workers in Ohio's industry. They also predict that plastics employment in Ohio will decrease by 13.7%, and that rubber products employment will decrease by 20.7%.

5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
