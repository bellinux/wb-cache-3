25|$|Since narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{are usually}} built with smaller <b>radius</b> <b>curves,</b> smaller structure gauges, lighter rails, etc., {{they can be}} substantially less costly to build, equip, and operate than standard gauge or broad gauge railways, particularly in mountainous or difficult terrain. The lower costs of narrow-gauge railways mean they are often built to serve industries and communities where the traffic potential would not justify {{the cost of building}} a standard or broad gauge line.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many model and toy guises of the IC125. One {{of the first in}} the UK was by Hornby Railways, which {{launched}} its first model version in 1977. This model was supplied with an incorrect length Mk3 coach which was shortened to allow the model to reliably negotiate the smallest <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b> This was done by removing one of the 8 side windows rather than scaling the whole length. It was later released in InterCity 'Swallow' livery, Great Western green-and-white, Midland Mainline and Virgin Trains.|$|E

25|$|Railway {{tracks are}} laid upon land owned or leased by the railway company. Owing to the {{desirability}} of maintaining modest grades, rails will often be laid in circuitous routes in hilly or mountainous terrain. Route length and grade requirements can be reduced {{by the use of}} alternating cuttings, bridges and tunnels – all of which can greatly increase the capital expenditures required to develop a right of way, while significantly reducing operating costs and allowing higher speeds on longer <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b> In densely urbanized areas, railways are sometimes laid in tunnels to minimize the effects on existing properties.|$|E
500|$|Calthrop {{had been}} engaged in {{negotiations}} with the Indian government for concessions to build a railway from Barsi Road to Barsi since 1887. In 1895 negotiations reached a satisfactory conclusion, and Calthrop formed a new company to build the Barsi Light Railway, and employed himself as consulting engineer. The railway became a showcase for his ideas. Five 0-8-4T locomotives, with even distribution of axle load, were constructed to Calthrop's specification by Kitson & Co. The goods rolling stock was constructed on common [...] pressed steel underframes, reducing tare weight and maximising potential wagon loads. Calthrop recognised the importance of railways in warfare, and designed the rolling stock to facilitate the movement of troops and equipment. Rolling stock rode on pressed-steel Fox bogies, using the Timmis system of double coiled springs. The line was constructed with rail inclination, then a new idea, which involves tilting the rail a few degrees to make its surface more nearly parallel {{with that of the}} tyre. Inclination is now applied universally to railways. The rolling stock could accept [...] <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{preassembled}} track sections made by Märklin using their three-rail system. This trackwork is a little bulkier looking than true to scale, but it is considered quite trouble-free, and is preferred by many that are interested in reducing much of the operational problems that come with HO scale railroading. As with other preformed track, it is also available in several radius configurations. Generally speaking very sharp <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> are only suitable for single unit operation, such as trolley cars, or for short-coupled cars and locos such as found around industrial works. [...] Longer wheelbase trucks (bogies) and longer car and loco overhangs require the use of broader <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b> Today many six-axle diesels and full-length passenger cars will not run on curves less than [...] in radius.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} {{stability}} problem of {{continuous welded rail}} (short for CWR) on bridge in the small <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> section, a sleeper connector structure was proposed, {{which is used to}} connect sleepers together and strengthen the stability of CWR. A FEM model was established to study the effect of the CWR stability strengthening scheme. This study result shows that the integrity of the track structure and the stability of CWR in the small <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> section of which the radius is from 250 m to 600 m will be both improved by the strengthening scheme, and the larger the <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> is, the better the CWR stability improvement will be. In order to guarantee the strength of sleeper connector and connecting bolt, it is suggested that the sleeper connectors at beam gaps should not be connected, and small resistance fasteners should be used in strengthening area...|$|R

The following year a design for a [...] gauge Mallet locomotive was submitted in reply to an enquiry from the Government of Tasmania. This was followed with a submission for a Garratt based on, but a little heavier than, the New South Wales proposal. This proposal was accepted, and two locomotives were built in 1909, which became the K class. The K class had to cope with 99' <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> and 1 in 25 gradients.|$|E
2500|$|At 19.8 kilometres, {{the station}} at Kalpetran is finally reached. The actual site {{has only a}} few buildings, the main {{function}} of the station being to allow connections with the cable car linking the station to the mountain village of Embd. Behind the station, the railway line meets the Mattervispa again, and switches {{to the left side}} of the valley. The Kipfenbrücke located here has had to be rebuilt several times: the original 30 metre long steel truss structure was destroyed in 1945 by an avalanche. A subsequent temporary measure was replaced in 1947 by a steel fish belly girder bridge, which, in turn, was itself destroyed by an avalanche in 1999. A steel girder bridge erected as a replacement was replaced in autumn 2007 by a 146 metre long concrete bridge further downstream. [...] The latest bridge also serves the road to Kalpetran. With the opening of a new rail section here totalling 1.2km, the last 80 metre <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> remaining on the open line were eliminated.|$|E

40|$|This study studied {{an effect}} of a new guard rail on the {{stability}} of curve tracks with CWR and revealed a mechanism of the new guard rail for improving the stability of small <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> tracks with CWR and also analyze the degree of the new guard rail for enlarging the pave range of small <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> tracks with CWR. In order to achieve these, an improved load-deformation method for calculating the stability of tracks with Continuous Welded Rails (CWR) is suggested and verified. The {{results indicate that the}} improved load-deformation method not only has the same accuracy as the improved unified formula in specification, but also has the same clear and simple characteristics as the original load-deformation method. The mechanism of the new guard rail for improving the stability of small <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> tracks with CWR is that the CWR stability can be greatly improved by increasing the stiffness of the track framework under conditions of maintaining the same cross-sectional area of the rails. The CWR with the new guard rail can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 230 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be relaxed 23. 3 %. If combined with the roadbed strengthening measures, the new guard rail can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 140 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be further relaxed 53. 3 %...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{main purpose}} of the article is to {{determine}} the permissible speed of the air-cushioned tilting train in curved track and to justify the expediency of operating this type of rolling stock on the railways of Ukraine to increase the speed, improve the passenger comfort and save the energy due to more uniform high-speed train driving. Methodology. The determination of the maximum permissible speed of the tilted train in curved track involves the use of methods of linear and vector algebra and empirical formulas for applied scientific and technical research. The calculation of the maximum speed is based on the principle of calculating centrifugal force for the velocities that meet the safety criteria of movement on the horizontal unbalanced acceleration in the stable <b>radius</b> <b>curve.</b> Findings. The results of the calculations showed that in the 1000 m <b>radius</b> <b>curved</b> track section, provided the passenger comfort, the maximum permissible speed of the train without forced tilt is 132 km/h, and with the forced tilt – 189 km/h. The velocity gain in the curve is about 30 % and up to 10 % on the section (depending on the number of curves). Originality. The method of determining the permissible speed of the tilted train in curved track is improved, which consists in determining the permissible centrifugal force acting on the train in the stable <b>radius</b> <b>curve,</b> taking into account the passenger comfort conditions. Practical value. This method allows accurately determining the permissible speed on the condition of passenger comfort in the curved section and the required additional tilt angle of the train, depending on the speed, <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> and canting. Enhanced speed and comfort of passenger trains in the future will increase the demand for rail services among the population and strengthen the position of rail transport in Ukraine’s transport system...|$|R
