5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including <b>radiation</b> <b>sickness,</b> genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go {{all the way through the}} body. Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body.|$|E

5|$|A {{radiation}} accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing radiation. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of <b>radiation</b> <b>sickness</b> and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear regulatory agency, was notified when doctors came to suspect radiation injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner.

40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to {{radiation}} that is everywhere in the environment without their knowledge and the exposure to natural background radiation is an unavoidable event on earth. An in situ measurement of the indoor and outdoor background ionizing radiation in Life hospital and Rayfield diagnostic center, Bori of Rivers State, Nigeria was carried out using two radiation meters. Each of these hospitals was divided into 10 sampling points where five readings were taken {{in order to have}} a reliable data. The mean indoor and outdoor annual effective dose of Life hospital were 0. 93 ± 0. 13 mSv/yr and 0. 23 ± 0. 01 mSv/yr respectively; and that of Rayfield diagnostic center were 1. 22 ± 0. 10 mSv/yr and 0. 26 ± 0. 02 mSv/yr respectively. The radiation levels in both hospitals were found to be slightly higher than the safe limit. The reduction coefficient calculated from the dose equivalent exceeded the limit of 1. 5 at x-ray rooms of the two hospitals. These results of in-situ indoor and outdoor background radiation of the two hospitals in Bori show that the radiological operations did enhance the natural background radiation of the area. Therefore no immediate health hazard associated with radiation exposure in the area is expected but long term exposure could lead to <b>radiation</b> induced <b>sickness</b> and the result would serve as a baseline data for the study area...|$|R
25|$|In most of {{the acute}} {{exposure}} scenarios that lead to <b>radiation</b> <b>sickness,</b> {{the bulk of the}} radiation is external whole-body gamma, in which case the absorbed, equivalent and effective doses are all equal.

40|$|Background: Effect of {{ionizing}} radiation on cutaneous dendritic cells (cDC) {{is critical to}} its influence on immune status of the skin, which {{plays an important role}} in the progression and recovery of <b>radiation</b> skin <b>sickness.</b> This study was to study the influence of whole body irradiation (WBI) on the cDC. Methods: Density of epidermal and dermal DC was determined with a fluorescent microscopy and the DC numbers in lymph node were measured by flow cytometry. A FITC induced migration assay was also used to study the migration of DC. The expressions of cytokines and chemokines were evaluated by Realtime PCR, and the protein level of was measured by Western blot. Results: WBI caused depletion of cDC in epidermal as well as dermal and augmented FITC-induced migration of DC to the draining lymph node (LN). The number of DC migrated from ear explants to the CCL 19 -containing medium also increased after exposure to WBI. It was also found that WBI increased mRNA level of CCL 19 /CCL 21 as well as CCR 7 in LN and skin tissue. The expressions of TNFa, IL- 1 a, IL- 1 ß, and IL- 6 in skin tissues were also greatly induced by WBI in a dose dependent manner. Finally, we found that WBI induced translocation of nuclear factor &# 954;B (NF-&# 954;B) and that the radiation-induced migration of DC was blocked by NF-&# 954;B inhibitor or TLR 4 knockout. Conclusion: WBI caused cDC depletion through induction of DC migration to the draining LN, which might result from the activation of NF-&# 954;B and the induction of inflammatory microenvironment within the skin...|$|R
40|$|Extract of Adhatoda vasica (L) Nees leaves {{has been}} used for {{treatment}} of various diseases and disorders in Ayurved and Unani medicine. Modulatory effect of ethanolic extract of A. vasica (L) Nees against radiation-induced changes in terms of histological alterations in testis, reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), acid and alkaline phosphatases levels, and chromosomal alterations in Swiss albino mice was studied at various post-irradiation intervals between 1 and 30 days. Mice exposed to 8 Gy <b>radiation</b> showed radiation-induced <b>sickness</b> including marked changes in histology of testis and chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells with 100 % mortality within 22 days. When ethanolic leaf extract of A. vasica was given orally at a dose of 800 mg kg 1 body weight per mouse for 15 consecutive days and then exposed to radiation, death of Adhatoda-pretreated irradiated mice was reduced to 70 % at 30 days. The radiation dose reduction factor was 1. 43. There was significantly lesser degree of damage to testis tissue architecture and various cell populations including spermatogonia, spermatids and Leydig cells. Correspondingly, a significant decrease in the LPO and an increase in the GSH levels were observed in testis and liver of Adhatoda-pretreated irradiated mice. Similarly, a significant decrease in level of acid phosphatase and increase in level of alkaline phosphatase were observed. Adhatoda pretreatment significantly prevented radiation-induced chromosomal damage in bone marrow cells. The study suggests that Adhatoda plant extract has significant radioprotective effects on testis that warrants further mechanistic studies aimed at identifying the role of major ingredients in the extract...|$|R
25|$|Because of {{its high}} {{solubility}} in water, caesium chloride is highly mobile and can even diffuse through concrete. This is a drawback for its radioactive form which urges a search for more stable radioisotope materials. Commercial sources of radioactive caesium chloride are well sealed in a double steel enclosure. However, in the Goiânia accident in Brazil, such a source containing about 93gram of 137CsCl, was stolen from an abandoned hospital and forced open by two scavengers. The blue glow emitted in the dark by the radioactive caesium chloride attracted the thieves and their relatives who were unaware of the associated dangers and spread the powder. This resulted {{in one of the}} worst radiation spill accidents in which 4 people died within a month from the exposure, 20 showed signs of <b>radiation</b> <b>sickness,</b> 249 people were contaminated with radioactive caesium chloride, and about a thousand received a dose exceeding a yearly amount of background radiation. More than 110,000 people overwhelmed the local hospitals, and several city blocks had to be demolished in the cleanup operations.

25|$|Caesium-137 {{is also a}} {{particular}} threat because it behaves like potassium and is taken up by cells throughout the body. Additionally, it has a long, 30-year half-life.

Internal exposure to Cs-137, through ingestion or inhalation, allows the radioactive material to be distributed in the soft tissues, especially muscle tissue, exposing these tissues to the beta particles and gamma radiation and increasing cancer risk. Prussian blue helps the body excrete caesium-137.|$|E

25|$|X-ray photons carry {{enough energy}} to ionize atoms and disrupt {{molecular}} bonds. This makes it a type of ionizing radiation, and therefore harmful to living tissue.

25|$|Crew {{living on}} the International Space Station (ISS) are {{partially}} protected from the space environment by Earth's magnetic field, as the magnetosphere deflects solar wind around {{the earth and the}} ISS. Nevertheless, solar flares are powerful enough to warp and penetrate the magnetic defences, and so are still a hazard to the crew. The crew of Expedition 10 took shelter as a precaution in 2005 in a more heavily shielded part of the station designed for this purpose. However, beyond the limited protection of Earth's magnetosphere, interplanetary manned missions are much more vulnerable.
