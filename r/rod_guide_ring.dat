40|$|AbstractSafety <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> {{tubes are}} {{important}} components of fast reactor cores for ensuring safe reactor operation. Their failure or considerable changes of their size {{may lead to}} safety rod wedging that is unacceptable. Two guide tubes, one each from BN- 350 and BOR- 60, were examined post-irradiation to determine {{the reasons for their}} deformation and loss of functionality. These tubes were constructed from high-nickel alloy EP- 150 and austenitic 18 Cr 9 Ni, respectively. It is found that various forms of deformation of safety <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> tubes occur due to non-uniform swelling along the tube height, perimeter and across-wall thickness. The swelling gradients can lead to bowing and ovality, and can be accompanied by significant internal stresses within the tube material. The latter can lead to size reduction of guide tube dimension in some directions due to irradiation creep. High levels of swelling-induced residual stresses, in combination with a swelling-induced embrittlement of the tube material, can lead to the tube failure {{even in the absence of}} any external loading...|$|R

50|$|Spherical roller {{bearings}} consist of an inner ring with two raceways inclined {{at an angle}} to the bearing axis, an outer ring with a common spherical raceway, spherical rollers, cages and, in certain designs, also internal <b>guide</b> <b>rings</b> or center rings. The bearings can also be sealed.|$|R
30|$|During servo operation, {{the piston}} and piston rod are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the oil chambers of {{the upper and lower}} oil pads, which result from changes in the gap between the piston rod and seal oil edge. This ensures that the piston <b>rod,</b> <b>guide</b> sleeve, and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the piston <b>rod</b> and <b>guide</b> sleeve, and piston and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|R

50|$|Commonly, a breech-end {{extension}} tube, {{known as}} a bore <b>guide</b> or <b>rod</b> <b>guide,</b> is also {{used in conjunction with}} the cleaning rod to prevent cleaning solvent from spilling out into the receiver, and to keep the rod supported and centered inside the bore in order to minimize potential damage to riflings. Similarly, a muzzle guide or muzzle guard might be used if the cleaning rod is to be inserted from the muzzle end of the firearm {{in order to protect the}} crown of the muzzle from mechanical damage.|$|R

40|$|Modular pebble-bed {{nuclear reactor}} (MPBNR) {{technology}} is promising {{due to its}} attractive features such as high fuel performance and inherent safety. Particle motion of fuel and graphite pebbles is highly associated {{with the performance of}} pebbled-bed modular nuclear reactor. To understand the mechanism of pebble’s motion in the reactor, we numerically studied the influence of number ratio of fuel and graphite pebbles, funnel angle of the reactor, height of <b>guide</b> <b>ring</b> on the distribution of pebble position, and velocity by means of discrete element method (DEM) in a two-dimensional MPBNR. Velocity distributions at different areas of the reactor as well as mixing characteristics of fuel and graphite pebbles were investigated. Both fuel and graphite pebbles moved downward, and a uniform motion was formed in the column zone, while pebbles motion in the cone zone was accelerated due to the decrease of the cross sectional flow area. The number ratio of fuel and graphite pebbles and the height of <b>guide</b> <b>ring</b> had a minor influence on the velocity distribution of pebbles, while the variation of funnel angle had an obvious impact on the velocity distribution.

40|$|A clutch {{actuator}} {{is used in}} a vehicle to transmit movement and force from the clutch pedal to the release bearing of the clutch. A pneumatic {{clutch actuator}} consists of an anodised aluminium cylinder, inside of which a piston, with a rubber lip seal and a PTFE <b>guiding</b> <b>ring,</b> slides. The system is lubricated with silicone grease before assembly. A commercial clutch actuator of this type, has a service life of 3 million actuations and must function in a wide temperature range, from - 40 ºC to 140 ºC. In this thesis, the complex tribological system of pneumatic clutch actuators has been studied. Field worn actuators have been disassembled and investigated. A laboratory test method has been developed to understand the tribomechanisms present in pneumatic clutch actuators. The test method's capability of simulating the real contact has been verified, by the comparison with studied actuators from the field. The influence of contact parameters: temperature, load, lubrication and particle contamination, has been investigated. In addition, different anodised aluminium surfaces have been studied. The manufacturing method of the aluminium cylinder influences surface topography {{and structure of the}} oxide, resulting in different mechanical and frictional properties. The wear during tests with only silicone grease is reminiscent, but on a lower scale, to the wear during tests with a mixture of silicone grease and standard dust. The initially applied amount of silicone grease is not important, the friction seems to depend on the amount of silicone grease that is dragged into or pushed out from the contact area during testing. Silicone grease lubrication reduces wear of the lip seal. However, during some tests, an adhesive layer, composed of  grease residuals and some PTFE, was formed on the lip. A triple PTFE transfer, from <b>guiding</b> <b>ring</b> to aluminium surface, to lip seal, to aluminium surface, occurred. Such transfer of material from the PTFE <b>guiding</b> <b>ring</b> was detected from the unlubricated tests, and also from the silicone grease lubricated tests, i. e. silicone grease lubrication does not prevent PTFE material transfer...|$|R
