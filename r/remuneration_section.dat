500|$|Part V of the Act, {{sections}} 28 to 33, {{deals with}} trustees' <b>remuneration.</b> <b>Section</b> 28 states the default {{position is that}} trustees are entitled to remuneration if it says so in the trust instrument or if a trustee acts in a [...] "professional capacity". A trust can differ from this default, but the Act confirms the recent developments in the common law from the old default position that trustees were entitled to nothing unless it was explicitly stated that they were. Section 29 {{goes on to say}} that non-charitable professional trustees are entitled to [...] "reasonable remuneration" [...] which will be a sum that the court thinks is commensurate to the work done, along the principles of quantum meruit. This is automatic if the trustee is a corporation, but will require consent of all other trustees if the trustees are natural persons. Section 30 stipulates that rules on charitable trustee remuneration are to be found in a statutory instrument drawn up by the Secretary of State. Trustees will be reimbursed from the trust fund itself, as will be authorised agents, nominees and custodians who are properly appointed by the trustees all so long as the expenses and payable remuneration are incurred while conducting the affairs of the trust.|$|E
5000|$|With {{all this}} in mind, the Court turned to Beauregard's {{argument}} that Parliament cannot lower existing <b>remuneration.</b> <b>Section</b> 100 states that Parliament is responsible for judicial remuneration, and the question now was Parliament's limits in exercising this responsibility. Dickson started by saying that [...] "As a general observation, Canadian judges are Canadian citizens and must bear {{their fair share of}} the financial burden of administering the country." [...] Judges v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan (1937) had demonstrated that judges must pay taxes. The law at issue targeted judges only, but Dickson did not regard this as damaging to judicial independence. This financial obligation did not touch the true purpose of judicial independence, namely freedom from manipulation and the separation of powers. The law merely established a conventional form of pension, and did so along with a considerable raise in salaries. [...] Dickson then clarified Parliamentary power regarding remuneration is not absolute, but what should be guarded against was decisions with sinister motivations and discrimination against judges.|$|E

This background note explains the legislative basis, fixing and linking mechanisms for the allowance. Adjustments to the base salary since 1968 are provided in Table 1 and Graph 1. Background: Section 48 of the Constitution provides for the payment of Members of Parliament: Until the Parliament otherwise provides, each senator and {{each member of the}} House of Representatives shall receive an allowance of four hundred pounds a year, to be reckoned from the day on which he takes his seat. Since 1901, the Parliament has enacted legislation to define the parliamentary base salary for the purposes of Section 48 of the Constitution. The Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 defines a parliamentary allowance which is consistent with the arrangements whereby the Remuneration Tribunal determines the <b>remuneration</b> of parliamentarians. <b>Section</b> 8 provides that salaries and allowances are to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Section 8 A of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 allows the Governor-General to make regulations necessary to give effect to the Act. Remuneration and Allowances Regulations 2005 are now in force.
