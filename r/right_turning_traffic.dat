40|$|Intersections are {{typically}} associated with {{a higher level of}} crash risk than other types of facilities on the road network. Standard cross-road intersections are particularly hazardous because by their very design, drivers may travel through at speeds that are incompatible with human biomechanical tolerance should a crash occur. Further, drivers are exposed to dangerous conflict angles, which are likely to result in serious injury. This paper examines the effectiveness of two new intersection designs aimed at restricting potentially dangerous conflict angles while reducing driver speeds through the intersection. These designs, named the “Cut-Through” and the “Squircle”, incorporate key features of both signalised intersections and roundabouts. The intersections are controlled by signals similar to a signalised roundabout. Instead of a standard central island, <b>right</b> <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> (equivalent to left turns in jurisdictions that drive on the right) cut through the central island, thereby avoiding traffic interlocks and delays that can occur with the traditional signalised roundabout. Across two driving simulator studies, vehicle speed data were collected on approach to and through each of the proposed intersection designs. Performance was benchmarked against equivalent standard signalised cross-road intersections and standard non-signalised roundabouts. Notably, drivers reduced their speeds by approximately 30 – 40 % when negotiating both the Cut-Through and the Squircle compared to the standard signalised intersections. The safety potentials of the two new intersection designs are discussed within the guidelines of the Safe Systems principles...|$|E

50|$|There are 5 major {{at-grade}} and grade-separated junctions or junction sets on {{the middle}} section, including the end junctions i.e. Saki Vihar Road junction and LBS Marg junction, the details of which are given below: The Saki Vihar Road junction, {{also known as the}} L&T junction, is the first junction on Section 2 and is a staggered one connecting Section 1 with Section 2 via the Saki Vihar road. The JVLR from the Section 1 side (or Jogeshwari side) and from Vikhroli side join the Saki Vihar Road in a staggered manner as the L&T land intercepts the JVLR for 100 m length of initial portion of Section 2. At this location, the L&T flyover across Saki Vihar road connects Section 1 with Section 2 through L&T land. Also, the initial portion of the alignment from Saki Vihar road junction acts as slip roads to the flyover, serving the traffic dispersal from the Saki Vihar road. The at-grade improvements to this intersection were required for easy movement of Turing traffic from/to Saki Vihar road and the JVLR, and for through movement of Saki Vihar road traffic. The at-grade improvements such as auxiliary lanes for free left turning, storage lanes for <b>right</b> <b>turn</b> <b>traffic,</b> channelised islands for guiding the traffic etc. were built for better functioning of ground traffic movement. Also, improvements like widening of carriageway to suit the intersection requirements, median and footpath of the existing Saki Vihar road for 150 m length on either side near the intersection was also carried out under the intersection improvements.|$|R
50|$|The IIT Main Gate {{junction}} and the IIT Market junction {{are both}} 3-armed junctions; the minor arm {{is very small}} road leading to residential areas. Both IIT Main Gate junction and IIT Market junction are provided with traffic signals and the main intention of these signals was for safe crossing of the pedestrians. Since, the distance between IIT Main Gate, IIT Market Gate and Gandhi Nagar junctions is less and due to high traffic volume on Adi Shankaracharya Marg, traffic jams are common especially during peak hours. Grade separated pedestrian facilities (like footbridges) have been constructed to reduce the necessity of pedestrian traffic signals at these locations and lead to faster traffic flow on the JVLR. The LBS Marg junction, {{also known as the}} Gandhi Nagar junction, is the last junction on Section 2 and is a 4-legged one. LBS Marg from Mulund side and Vikhroli side join the JVLR. This junction is the crossing of two important arterial roads of Mumbai carrying long distance through traffic and also local traffic. A flyover across LBS Marg at this location, connects Section 2 with Section 3 of the JVLR. The at-grade improvements to this intersection were required for easy movement of Turing traffic from/to LBS Marg and the JVLR, and for through movement of LBS Marg traffic. The at-grade improvements such as auxiliary lanes for free left turning, storage lanes for <b>right</b> <b>turn</b> <b>traffic,</b> channelised islands for guiding the traffic etc. were built for better functioning of ground traffic movement.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The designing of bicycle lanes can be a complicated issue. Some bicycle lane treatments are meant to encourage cyclists to merge with traffic before the intersection, while some treatments channelize cyclists to merge with traffic in a predetermined location. Two intersections (Bizzell/George Bush Drive and Throckmorton/George Bush Drive) at the Texas A&M University were chosen to observe cyclist behavior. Both intersection approaches contained an island separating <b>right</b> <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> from straight and left turning traffic. However, the right turn lane at Bizzell begins at the island, while at Throckmorton the right turn lane is present throughout the approach to the intersection. Video cameras were used to record cyclists as they approached and traveled into the intersections. The distance from the intersection where a cyclist merged with motor vehicle traffic, the cyclist maneuvers as they entered the intersection, and the cyclist traffic control compliance was recorded. The motor vehicle volumes were also recorded to determine if they influenced cyclists' decisions to merge with traffic. Using the Chi Square test of independence, the collected behaviors were evaluated to determine if the behaviors were dependent upon the intersection location. Linear regression was used to determine the influence of motor vehicle volumes on cyclists and the test of proportions was used to decide if the proportions of behaviors were equal at both intersections. It was found that the intersection approach geometry, striping and lane configuration does influence cyclists to merge with traffic at different locations and motor vehicle volumes did not influence cyclists' decisions to merge with traffic. The proportions of inappropriate behaviors were different between the locations, while the traffic compliance rates were the same...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2008. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Henry X. Liu. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xix, 154 pages. Performance monitoring for arterial traffic control and management system {{is an area}} of emerging focus in the United States. To properly study traffic flow at signalized intersections, both arrival/departure traffic flow data and associated signal status data are required. Although many existing signal control systems are capable of generating data to support performance assessment, most do not make it "easy" for the managing agencies to prioritize improvements and plan for future needs. Indeed, the 2005 Traffic Signal Operation Self Assessment Survey indicated that the majority of agencies involved in the operation and maintenance of traffic signal systems do not monitor or archive traffic system performance data in an effort to improve their operation. Therefore, despite studies having shown that the benefits of investments in improved signal timing outweigh the costs by 40 : 1 or more, signal retiming is often not repeated frequently enough to account for rapidly changing traffic patterns, largely due to the expense of manual data collection and performance measurements. The need to address the above problems inspired this research. The goal is to develop a real-time arterial performance measurement system, which can automatically collect and archive high-resolution traffic signal data, and build a rich list of performance measures. The objectives of this doctoral research are two-fold: (1) to develop a system for high-resolution traffic signal data collection, archival, and preprocessing; and (2) to develop a set of methodologies that can measure traffic signal performance, including queue length, delay and level of service (LOS) for individual intersections and travel time and number of stops for an arterial corridor. In this research, a system for high resolution traffic signal data collection is successfully built. The system, named as SMART-SIGNAL (Systematic Monitoring of Arterial Road Traffic and Signals), is an arterial data collection and performance measurement system, which simultaneously collects "event-based" high-resolution traffic data from multiple intersections and generates arterial performance measures in real time. In the SMART-SIGNAL system, a complete history of traffic signal control, including all signal events such as vehicle actuations on detectors and signal phase changes, is archived and stored. Using the collected "event" data, mathematical models are built to calculate intersection and arterial performance measures. A time-dependent queue length estimation model is proposed that can handle long queues under both under-saturated and over-saturated conditions. The model examines the changes in signal detector's occupancy profile within a cycle, and derives queue length by identifying traffic flow pattern changes during the queue discharging process. A turning movement proportion estimation model is also offered in this thesis. Detector counts from surrounding intersections are used to calculate <b>right</b> <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> for the subject intersection. An innovative algorithm is proposed in this research for arterial performance measurement by tracing virtual probe vehicles from origin to destination. One of three maneuvers: acceleration, deceleration or no-speed-change, is selected based on the current traffic states of the virtual probe. The step-by-step maneuver calculation stops until the virtual probe "arrives" at the destination, and various arterial performance measures, including travel time, can thus be estimated. An interesting property of the proposed model is that travel time estimation errors can be self-corrected with the signal status data, because the differences between a virtual probe vehicle and a real probe can be reduced when both of them meet the red signal phase. The virtual probe mimics regular travel behaviors of arterial drivers and thus can be treated as a representative vehicle traversing the arterial. The SMART-SIGNAL data collection system has been installed on an 11 -intersections arterial corridor along France Avenue in Hennepin County, Minnesota since February 2007. Event-based signal data are being collected in a 24 / 7 mode and then immediately archived in the SMART-SIGNAL system, thus yielding a tremendous amount of field data available for research. The field study shows that the proposed mathematical models can generate accurate time-dependent queue lengths, travel times, numbers of stops, and other performance measures under various traffic conditions...|$|E

A traffic signal control method for six-phase intersection is proposed in this paper, aiming at reducing the average waiting time of vehicles.

This method takes into account not only the traffic condition of the current prevailing phase and the next phase, but also the traffic demand of the vehicle flow that <b>turn</b> <b>right,</b> non-motorized <b>traffic</b> flow and pedestrian. Taking the average waiting time of vehicles as the evaluation index, we make simulations on the control method proposed above.

2500|$|On roads with {{multiple}} lanes, <b>turning</b> <b>traffic</b> is generally expected {{to move to}} the lane closest to the direction they wish to <b>turn.</b> For example, <b>traffic</b> intending to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> will usually move to the rightmost lane before the intersection.

In certain parts of the world traffic will adapt to informal patterns that rise naturally rather than by force of authority; for example, [...] it is common for drivers to observe (and trust) the turn signals used by other drivers in order to make turns from other lanes. For example, if several vehicles on the right lane are all <b>turning</b> <b>right,</b> a vehicle may come from the next-to-right lane and <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> as well, doing so in parallel with the other right-turning vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{self-regulation}} of driving can assist older drivers to reduce their crash and injury risk, while maintaining some degree of mobility. Past research on self-regulation has relied on self-report methods. The present study used objective driving data to examine whether {{the degree to which}} older drivers report avoiding difficult driving situations corresponds to actual behaviour. Fifty-five drivers aged 75 years and older completed a questionnaire on their avoidance of four difficult driving situations (making <b>right</b> <b>turns</b> across <b>traffic,</b> driving on a freeway or high-speed highway, driving in peak hour traffic, and driving at night) and had their driving monitored using global positioning system (GPS) devices fitted to their vehicles. Their driving in the each of the situations was identified in the GPS data. The selfreport and GPS measurements did not correspond. For each difficult situation, self-reported avoidance had no relationship with objectively measured driving patterns. A majority of participants reported that they 'never' or 'rarely' avoided each situation but objective data were consistent with greater degrees of self-regulation. This suggests that many older drivers self-regulate more than they report. Furthermore, while past research has consistently found self-reported self-regulation to increase with age and to be higher for older female drivers, the degree of actual driving {{in each of the four}} difficult situations did not differ between participants aged 75 - 79 and those aged 80 and older or between male and female participants. Given the current finding of a discrepancy between subjective measurements of self-regulation and objective measurements of actual driving, future research may be needed to reassess common understandings about selfregulation that have been derived from the findings of self-report based studies.
