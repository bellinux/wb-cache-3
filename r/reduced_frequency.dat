25|$|The {{secondary}} chemicals {{produced by}} endophytic fungi when {{associated with their}} host plants can be very harmful to mammals including livestock and humans, causing more than 600 million dollars in losses due to dead livestock every year. For example, the ergot alkaloids produced by Claviceps spp. have been dangerous contaminants of rye crops for centuries. When not lethal, defense chemicals produced by fungal endophytes may lead to lower productivity in cows and other livestock feeding on infected forage. Reduced nutritional quality of infected plant tissue also lowers the performance of farm animals, compounding the effect of reduced feed uptake when provided with infected plant matter. <b>Reduced</b> <b>frequency</b> of pregnancy and birth has also been reported in cattle and horses fed with infected forage. Consequently, the dairy and meat-production industries must endure substantial economic losses.|$|E

40|$|Anne Szarewski, 1 Cecilia Moeller 2 1 Centre for Cancer Prevention, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom; 2 Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Global Market Research General Medicine, Berlin, Germany Background: Monthly {{bleeding}} {{can have}} a negative impact on daily life and, given the choice, many women would <b>reduce</b> the <b>frequency</b> of bleeding. While some women choose to occasionally postpone or <b>reduce</b> bleeding <b>frequency</b> with an oral contraceptive (OC), most women have no or limited experience of regularly <b>reducing</b> the <b>frequency</b> of scheduled bleeding with OCs, ie, the extended OC regimen. Study design: An online survey of 4039 women aged 15 – 49 years who were currently using, had used, or would consider using any form of hormonal contraception was conducted in Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, UK, and USA to assess awareness of and the reasons for and against <b>reducing</b> bleeding <b>frequency.</b> Results: Overall, 51. 1 % and 30. 7 % of women surveyed were aware that they could occasionally or regularly <b>reduce</b> bleeding <b>frequency</b> with an OC. Moreover, 27. 6 % and 9. 9 % of previous/current OC users had occasionally or regularly <b>reduced</b> bleeding <b>frequency</b> with an OC. The main reasons for <b>reducing</b> bleeding <b>frequency</b> were convenience, physician recommendations, special events, and relief of problems associated with bleeding. Many women mistakenly believed that <b>reducing</b> bleeding <b>frequency</b> would have a negative health impact. Conclusion: Additional efforts are needed to educate women about the possibility and potential health benefits of <b>reducing</b> bleeding <b>frequency</b> and to dispel misconceptions about the use of extended OC regimens.

40|$|The {{generation}} of blade passing frequency noise due to rotor wakes {{interaction with the}} downstream stator is examined using a recent model for the unsteady aerodynamic forces developed by Goldstein and Atassi. The effects of blade geometry and loading are investigated.

It is also shown that for the same loading a higher angle of attack generates more noise particularly at higher <b>reduced</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The noise level shows a quasi-periodic pattern with pronounced minima and maxima as the frequency increases.

This study evaluates the efficacy of three techniques, namely mirrored equalization, frequency spectrum sharing and stereo panning, against their variations to confirm the veracity of accepted practice. Mirrored equalisation involves boosting one instrument and cutting the other at the same frequency. Frequency spectrum sharing involves low pass filtering one instrument and high pass filtering the other. Panning involves placing two competing instruments at different pan positions. Test subjects used eight tools comprising a single unlabeled slider to <b>reduce</b> <b>frequency</b> masking in several two instrument scenarios. Satisfaction values were recorded.

40|$|Bio-inspired ” wing sections, so {{aptly named}} because their profile {{is defined by}} {{corrugated}} sections observed from actual insect species, have attracted more and more attentions in aircraft wing design. Existing literature has shown that corrugated airfoils, {{as well as their}} profiled counterparts, while possessing an unconventional shape, show very little contribution in drag when compared to more technical airfoils such as a flat plate and a cambered conventional airfoil with respect to cruising flight of fixed-wing aircraft. In addition, the corrugated airfoils were shown to delay stall as well provide an increase in translator lift. With this in mind, this study presents a series of computations using two bio-inspired airfoils and two technical airfoils in a flapping motion for various <b>reduced</b> <b>frequencies</b> and Strouhal numbers. We find that for certain values of <b>reduced</b> <b>frequencies</b> and Strouhal numbers that the wake shows no appreciable difference between the four different airfoils.
