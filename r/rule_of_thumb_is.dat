5|$|A simple <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> {{that for}} {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air {{flows from the}} center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is {{in the opposite direction}} of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|The mane of {{the adult}} male lion, unique among cats, {{is one of the}} most {{distinctive}} characteristics of the species. Although having a ruff is not so unusual for a lioness, in rare cases, a female lion can have a mane. The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and testosterone production; the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favours males with the densest, darkest mane. Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male–male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of}} these advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E

5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E

25|$|If direct flash must be used, a good <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> to {{separate}} the flash from the lens by 1/20 of {{the distance of the}} camera to the subject.

25|$|The rate {{of aging}} of class 2 {{capacitors}} mainly {{depends on the}} materials used. A <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is,</b> the higher the temperature dependence of the ceramic, the higher the aging percentage. The typical aging of X7R ceramic capacitors is about 2.5% per decade The aging rate of Z5U ceramic capacitors is significantly higher and can be up to 7% per decade.|$|E
25|$|For {{a digital}} oscilloscope, a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> that the {{continuous}} sampling rate should be {{ten times the}} highest frequency desired to resolve; for example a 20megasample/second rate would be applicable for measuring signals up to about 2megahertz. This allows the anti-aliasing filter to be designed with a 3dB down point of 2MHz and an effective cutoff at 10MHz (the Nyquist frequency), avoiding the artifacts of a very steep ("brick-wall") filter.|$|E
40|$|Water {{treatment}} chemists {{have used}} simple <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> and indices {{since the early}} days of water treatment. The rules and indices are used to predict scale formation and in many cases, to determine the maximum concentration ratio for a tower’s operation, and the control pH. Indices and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>are</b> a way to estimate scale prediction when more rigorous, and accurate, methods are not available or practical. The availability of high powered Pentium class calculation power, and ion association model software for water chemistry modeling and prediction, have made more precise calculations economical for even the smallest water treater. This paper reviews common water treatment <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb,</b> their origin, and compares them to ion association model saturation indices.

25|$|The {{amount of}} current an {{alkaline}} battery can deliver is roughly proportional to its physical size. This {{is a result}} of decreasing internal resistance as the internal surface area of the cell increases. A <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> that an AA alkaline battery can deliver 700 mA without any significant heating. Larger cells, such as C and D cells, can deliver more current. Applications requiring currents of several amperes, such as powerful flashlights and portable stereos, will require D-sized cells to handle the increased load.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to have added tone chords {{with more than one}} added note. The most commonly encountered of these are 6/9 chords, which are basic triads with the 6th and 2nd notes of the scale added. These can be confusing because of the use of 9, yet the chord does not include the 7th. A good <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> that if any added note is less than 7, then no 7th is implied, even if there are some notes shown as greater than 7.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal cancers are {{typically}} carcinomas {{that arise from}} the epithelium, or surface lining, of the esophagus.

A <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> that a cancer in the upper two-thirds is likely to be ESCC and one in the lower one-third EAC.|$|E
40|$|Forecasters often develop <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> for {{adjusting}} model guidance. Ideally, before use, these <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> should <b>be</b> validated {{through a}} careful comparison of model forecasts and observations {{over a large}} sample. Practically, such evaluation studies are difficult to perform because forecast models are continually being changed, and a hypothesized <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> may only <b>be</b> applicable to a particular forecast model configuration. A particular <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>was</b> examined here: dprog/dt. Given a set of lagged forecasts from the same model all verifying at the same time, this <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> suggests that if the forecasts show a trend, this trend is {{more likely than not}} to continue and thus provide useful information for correcting the most recent forecast. Forecasters may also note the amount of continuity of forecasts to estimate the magnitude of the error in the most recent forecast. Statistical evaluation <b>of</b> this <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>was</b> made possible here using a dataset of forecasts from a ‘‘frozen’’ model. A 23 -yr record of forecasts was generated from a T 62 version of the medium-range forecast model used at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Forecasts were initialized from reanalysis data, and January–March forecasts were examined for selected locations. The rule dprog/dt was evaluated with 850 -hPa temperature forecasts. A total of 2070 sample days were used in the evaluation. Extrapolation of forecast trends was shown to have little forecast value. Also, there was only a small amount of information on forecast accuracy from the amount of discrepancy between short-term lagged forecasts. The lack of validity <b>of</b> this <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> suggest that others should also be carefully scrutinized before use. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{discriminant}} analysis, {{the correlations}} between the variables and the discriminant functions-structure coefficients-are used in interpretation. <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>are</b> used to set a cutoff value because there are no formulas for the standard error of structure coefficients.

25|$|The test {{measures}} {{the concentration of}} specific IgE antibodies in the blood. Quantitative IgE test results increase the possibility of ranking how different substances may affect symptoms. A <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> that the higher the IgE antibody value, the greater the likelihood of symptoms. Allergens found at low levels that today do not result in symptoms can nevertheless help predict future symptom development. The quantitative allergy blood result can help determine what a patient is allergic to, help predict and follow the disease development, estimate {{the risk of a}} severe reaction, and explain cross-reactivity.|$|E
25|$|In general, marine aquariums {{have more}} complex {{filtration}} requirements than most freshwater aquariums. The various components frequently include {{wet and dry}} filters and protein skimmers. Protein skimmers are devices that remove organic compounds prior to their degradation, and are very useful in marine aquariums. Protein skimming is also used in the popular Berlin method that relies on live rock and periodic partial water changes to degrade and remove waste products. The Berlin method requires large amounts of live rock in the aquarium. The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> 1/2–1nbsp&lb. per 1 US gallon (0.2–0.4nbsp&kg per 4 liters).|$|E
25|$|The genders of nouns are {{masculine}} and feminine. A rough <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> {{that almost all}} masculine nouns in nominative case end in -s and most feminine – in -(i)a or -ė. There are no strict rules governing the gender. For example, upė – river, is feminine, but upelis – rivulet, is masculine. There is no neuter gender ("it gender"), {{but there are a}} few words that can be applied to both genders equally. They mostly describe people, have negative connotations, and end in -a, for example vė́pla – dummy, el̃geta – beggar, naktìbalda – night-lumberer, a person who does not sleep at night, but mėmė̃ – gawk.|$|E

25|$|Most years, natural pests keep weevil {{populations in}} check - parasites {{sometimes}} destroy {{more than half}} the pupae populations. It has been noted that parasite control may fail every several years. There are also chemical controls available {{that can be used to}} eliminate adults and larvae. One should apply contact or stomach insecticides as soon as the first adult feeding spots are noticed on host leaves. A <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> to apply the insecticide when feeding damage accumulates to 10% or more throughout foliage. Since the spring adults feed and move during April to early June, a second application may be needed. Systemics are used to combat larvae. It is best to apply systemics when the eggs have just been laid or while larval mines are green in color.|$|E
25|$|The same is true, up to a point, of the {{chemical}} reactions of living things. They are usually catalyzed by enzymes which change reaction rates, but with no variation in catalytic action, the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>is</b> still mostly applicable. In the case of bacteria and fungi, the reactions needed to feed and reproduce speed up at higher temperatures, {{up to the point}} that the proteins and other compounds in their cells themselves begin to break down, or denature, so quickly that they cannot be replaced. This is why high temperatures kill bacteria and other micro-organisms: 'tissue' breakdown reactions reach such rates that they cannot be compensated for and the cell dies. On the other hand, 'elevated' temperatures short of these result in increased growth and reproduction; if the organism is harmful, perhaps to dangerous levels.|$|E
