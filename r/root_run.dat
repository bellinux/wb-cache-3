50|$|Making {{a keyhole}} welds: An {{outstanding}} characteristics of plasma arc welding, owing to exceptional penetrating power of plasma jet, {{is its ability}} to produce keyhole welds in work piece having thickness from 2.5 mm to 25 mm. A keyhole effect is achieved through right selection of current, nozzle orifice diameter and travel speed, which create a forceful plasma jet to penetrate completely through the work piece. Plasma jet in no case should expel the molten metal from the joint. The major advantages of keyhole technique are the ability to penetrate rapidly through relatively thick root sections and to produce a uniform under bead without mechanical backing. Also, the ratio of the depth of penetration to the width of the weld is much higher, resulting narrower weld and heat-affected zone.As the weld progresses, base metal ahead the keyhole melts, flow around the same solidifies and forms the weld bead. Key holing aids deep penetration at faster speeds and produces high quality bead. While welding thicker pieces, in laying others than <b>root</b> <b>run,</b> and using filler metal, the force of plasma jet is reduced by suitably controlling the amount of orifice gas.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{high-strength}} steels in {{the manufacture}} of energy pipelines, coupled with the transition to larger pipe diameters and greater wall thicknesses, has led to an increased potential for cracking including hydrogen assisted cracking of energy pipelines due to higher constraint induced stresses. In the present study, {{a modified version of the}} Welding Institute of Canada (MWIC) restraint test was used to simulate the constraint conditions of full-scale girth welds on energy pipelines, allowing the influence of welding process parameters on crack formation to be assessed. MWIC test samples of X 70 grade high-strength low alloy pipeline steel were manually welded using two different welding processes, namely shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) and modified short-arc welding (MSAW). Residual strains, and hence stresses, in these samples were analysed quantitatively using neutron diffraction technique. Overall, results indicate that the modified WIC restraint test produces significant residual stresses and so is effective in constraining the <b>root</b> <b>run</b> and in consequence studying the hydrogen assisted cracking of high-strength pipeline steels...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Glass lined {{reactor vessel}} for mixing and storage {{has a unique}} {{advantage}} of higher corrosion resistance, retention of product flavour and purity, improved heat transfer and less frequent cleaning. Welding close to the glass-lined surface is at times the unavoidable need. However, such needs are to be dealt critically as {{the rise in the}} temperature of the glass-lined surface can lead to a failure of glass-lining. This failure results in considerable delay as rework in lining the glass takes 5 - 7 days and it involves considerable extra cost of reworking. The glass lined reactor vessels are provided with jacket for thermal insulation. The jacket is welded to main vessel by a closure ring. CO 2 welding in the <b>root</b> <b>run</b> and Sub-merged Arc Welding (SAW) process for subsequent passes. The cooling time of 15 to 20 minutes is provided between the successive SAW passes so that the shell surface cools down and temperature does not exceed the failure limit of glass-lining. The temperature measurements were initially measured with infrared pyrometer and Results are compared with thermal analysis by FEA. We see in the final pass of SAW process the temperature exceeds 100 ˚C though the cooling time of 15 - 20 minutes is provided between the successive passes and temperature does not exceeds the failure limit of 150 ˚C as well as the 3 - 4 ˚C/min temperature difference in heating and cooling rates...|$|E
40|$|Plain C-Mn steels such as SA- 516 Grade 65 {{are used}} as steam lines to {{transport}} high temperature steam under pressure. Plain carbon steels that are in service at elevated temperatures (typically 400 - 450 °C) for prolonged periods of time (typically in excess of 20 years) may experience an undesirable microstructural change {{in the form of}} secondary graphitization. Secondary graphitization of carbon steels is classically defined as the decomposition of cementite into carbon (present as the graphite phase) and iron (ferrite). Many cases have been documented where the decomposition reaction occurs more readily in a region closely associated to welds. The resultant graphite {{is often referred to as}} Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) graphite. This study aimed to evaluate whether or not it would be possible to weld on graphitized material and if so, to recommend viable repair procedures. In addition to this, it was critical to study the effects of HAZ graphite on the mechanical properties of plain C-Mn steels after in-service exposure of approximately 35 years at 420 °C. Additional work was also performed that supplemented the tests necessary to qualify a procedure qualification record (PQR) in the form of several prolonged heat treatments and detailed metallography. This was done in an effort to understand the process of graphitization and the subsequent effects that its formation in the HAZ would have on the mechanical properties of not only a single sample, but also on welded joints with varying degrees of graphitization. It was concluded that the HAZ graphite had no effect on the tensile strength, impact toughness, hardness or ductility as characterised by the total elongation. Several tensile tests failed through the graphite plane associated with the HAZ. The samples that failed through the graphitized HAZ displayed a tensile strength, yield strength and total elongation similar to material that failed in the base material (away from the graphitized HAZ). However, failure in the graphitized HAZ resulted in a decrease in reduction in area from 72 % to 44 %. In spite of the change in reduction in area, the total elongation of samples that exhibited failure in the graphitized heat affected zone was acceptable. It was concluded that it is possible to perform repair welding on graphitized material using conventional welding procedures. Based on a procedure that used GTAW to perform the <b>root</b> <b>run,</b> followed by SMAW to fill and cap the joint, two PQRs were produced for graphitized plain carbon steel welding. A number of repair techniques were considered, of which the most viable that was recommended was to wrap the graphitized joints that are at highest risk of failing with a reinforcing metal band and to fillet weld the band in place. It was concluded that the presence of HAZ graphite was unlikely to affect the capacity of the steam line to resist plastic collapse. Future work on the influence of the presence of heat affected zone graphite on other failure mechanisms (such as thermal fatigue, mechanical fatigue and creep) is recommended.

40|$|The garden, {{named after}} the {{founding}} Director of the Tussock Grasslands and Mountain Lands Institute, {{is intended to be}} educational. From the early 1970 s, a small garden plot provided a touch of character to the original Institute building, but it was in 1979 that planning began to really make headway. Landscape students at the College carried out design projects, ideas were selected and developed by Landscape architecture staff in the Department of Horticulture, Landscape and Parks, and the College approved the proposals. Construction was completed in time for spring plantings in the same year. The garden is a collection of plants to provide not only an atmosphere of natural grassland and mountain herb field, but also to attract attention to the plants that make up those associations. Because many plants are small and rather hidden among the large dominant species, a sense of atmosphere ('being among the tussocks') is of itself unlikely {{to draw attention to the}} fascinating denizens of the nooks and crannies. As has always been true, many people climb mountains and tramp through the open country without ever putting their noses to the carpet of plants at their feet. In our educational garden, the beds are therefore raised high, and no point is far from the pathway. In addition, seating enables you to view the plants at eye level. Many alpine plants demand a good supply of moisture and yet cannot withstand 'wet feet'. On mountain slopes, sub-surface water is always on the move down the slope, and so the plant is supplied without any pooling effects around its roots. In this raised garden, good drainage is provided to achieve this. There are heavy layers of gravel below the soil and a gritty mix throughout the soil. The large rocks in the garden are greywacke, and were selected from an alpine area for their form and lichen covering. The rocks create a focal point and are intended to give a sense of 'altitude' within the garden. In the centre bed, rock scree is spread over the surface to create a pavement of broken stone, and at the same time, a mulch giving a cool <b>root</b> <b>run.</b> Plant distributions are in a radial pattern around the focal rocks. Like the spokes of a wheel, they extend across pathways to the outer beds. There are seven groupings, representing the geographic spread of seven regions of the New Zealand native grassland flora. The regions and a diagram of their location in the garden are listed on page 36. Typical plants of each region were sought, and especially those that help to make the regions distinctive. The collection therefore, includes the physiognomic dominants - the larger plants that confer on a vegetation its basic form and appearance. A tall tussock grassland is very different from a short tussock grassland, although some plant species may be common to each. The same species of tussocks and mountain daisies, for example, may therefore be found growing in different regional areas in the garden. The inclusion of shrubs and small trees is a recognition that grasslands and herb fields are frequently integrated with other vegetation types. The woody species furthermore, add greatly to the landscaping use of texture, form and height within the garden. Below the vegetation canopy are the less obvious plants - diverse in their growth form and habits - cushion plants, herbs, and mats. Like all gardens, ours requires regular weeding and care is necessary that some alpine plants themselves do not become weeds by outgrowing the less vigorous species. In the summer months, regular nightly watering is controlled by an automatic sprinkler system. Line drawings by Pat Prendergast are intended as impressions of plants in the garden and should not be used elsewhere for reliable species identifications. Many of the original sketches were made in the garden itself, as plants flowered and attracted attention during the succession of seasonal changes. Others were done in the field, but illustrate plants included in the garden. The text has been written by Joy Talbot, a botanist. The emphasis is on relationships - the meanings behind the names, the natural habitats of plants (abbreviated as 'Ha' in the text) and geographic distributions (abbreviated as 'Di' in the text). The relationships between genera and the families in which they are grouped is alphabetically arranged in the annotated index. To find information on the genus of an illustrated plant, first look alphabetically for the family name. For example, to find the meaning and relationships of Celmisia, look under the family name Compositae (Daisy family), shown with the illustration for any of the Celmisia species...|$|E
