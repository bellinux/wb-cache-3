5|$|The {{greens are}} edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources {{suggest that the}} greens contain toxic alkaloids. When used for this purpose, they are {{harvested}} young in high-density plantings, before significant <b>root</b> <b>development,</b> and typically used stir-fried, or in salads. Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{addition}} of fungal exudates alone partially mimicked {{the effect of the}} mantle in terms of root proliferation, root hair development and dichotomous branching. Some of these exudates act synergistically upon hyphal morphology, as with rutin (a flavonol) and zeatin (a cytokinin). However, some other metabolites act antagonistically, demonstrated by <b>root</b> <b>development</b> stemming from the release of hypaphorine and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). IAA must be tightly regulated in ectomycorrhizal symbioses due to its ability to inhibit <b>root</b> <b>development</b> above certain concentrations.|$|E

40|$|The <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> is {{controlled}} by diverse factors such as fate-determining developmental cues, auxin-related environmental factors, and hormones. In particular, the soil environmental factors are important as they maximize their absorption by modulating <b>root</b> hair <b>development.</b> These environmental factors affect the root hair developmental process by making use of diverse hormones. These hormonal factors {{interact with each other}} to modulate <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> in which auxin appears to form the most intensive networks with the pathways from environmental factors and hormones. Moreover, auxin action for <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> is genetically located immediately upstream of the root hair-morphogenetic genes.

Germination is slow, taking {{four to six}} weeks, and it often is {{difficult}} because of furanocoumarins in its seed coat.

25|$|Phosphates are {{substances}} that contain phosphorus, which stimulates <b>root</b> <b>development</b> in young plants {{and is therefore}} particularly valuable for root crops. It also increases yields and speeds up plant growth generally. Phosphates are not easily lost from soil, but they mostly occur in very stable forms that are not liberated quickly enough by natural processes, so fertilisation is necessary. Traditionally, phosphate-bearing materials added to soil include bonemeal, powdered slag, and seaweed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) roots exude {{a potent}} bioherbicide— sorgoleone. Previous work {{indicates}} that sorgoleone {{is produced in}} living root hairs. We have developed a mist system that resulted in abundant production of root hairs exuding sorgoleone and a mat system that significantly inhibited <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> and consequently sorgoleone production. Applying AgC (an ethylene action inhibitor) at 1. 2 mM to the seedlings grown in the mist system also inhibited root hair formation and elongation. Hypoxic conditions in the mist system {{did not result in}} the inhibition of root hair growth as compared to the standard air atmosphere (20. 8 % O 2). Applying ethephon (an ethylene-releasing agent) at 0. 031 mM to the roots of seedlings grown in the mat system with water running at 1 ml/min reversed the inhibition of <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> by water movement. These results indicate that either water movement or ethylene can be utilized to manipulate <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> and sorgoleone production in sorghum seedlings. It is hypothesized that water movement reduced the local ethylene concentration on the root surface and consequently inhibited <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> of sorghum seedlings grown in the mat system...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of different waterlogging regimes on growth, yield and <b>roots</b> <b>development</b> in three fiber crops. Three fiber crops kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.), roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) and jute (Corchorus olitorius L.) were subjected to waterlogging for 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 days, as well as a well-drained subject (control). The waterlogging regimes had a significant effect on plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, biomass production, root growth and aerenchyma tissue formation. The crops subjected to waterlogging for longer periods were more affected in their growth characteristics: H. cannabinus had a higher plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, biomass production and root growth less than H. sabdariffa and C. olitorius. Aerenchyma tissue developed in adventitious roots of three fiber crops species. The fiber crops subjected to waterlogging regimes decreased fiber yield by 11. 9 - 51. 2 % compared to the control. H. cannabinus produced the highest fiber yield after 45 days of waterlogging duration. This results is due to the higher growth and <b>roots</b> <b>development</b> of H. cannabinus than the other two fiber crops...|$|R
2500|$|Auxins are {{compounds}} that positively influence cell enlargement, bud formation and root initiation. They also promote {{the production of}} other hormones and in conjunction with cytokinins, they control the growth of stems, roots, and fruits, and convert stems into flowers. [...] Auxins were the first class of growth regulators discovered. They affect cell elongation by altering cell wall plasticity. They stimulate cambium, a subtype of meristem cells, to divide and in stems cause secondary xylem to differentiate. Auxins act to inhibit the growth of buds lower down the stems (apical dominance), and also to promote lateral and adventitious <b>root</b> <b>development</b> and growth. [...] Leaf abscission is initiated by the growing point of a plant ceasing to produce auxins. [...] Auxins in seeds regulate specific protein synthesis, as they develop within the flower after pollination, causing the flower to develop a fruit to contain the developing seeds. Auxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, synthetic auxin herbicides including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have been developed and used for weed control. Auxins, especially 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking cuttings of plants. [...] The most common auxin found in plants is indole-3-acetic acid or IAA. The correlation of auxins and cytokinins in the plants is a constant (A/C = const.).|$|E

40|$|Root hairs {{emerge from}} {{epidermal}} root cells (trichoblasts) and differentiate by highly localized tip growth. Microtubules (MTs) {{are essential for}} establishing and maintaining the growth polarity of root hairs. The current knowledge about {{the configuration of the}} MT cytoskeleton during <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> is largely based on experiments on fixed material, and reorganization and in vivo dynamics of MTs during <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> is at present unclear. This in vivo study provides new insights into the mechanisms of MT (re) organization during <b>root</b> hair <b>development</b> in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Expression of a binding site of the MT-associated protein- 4 tagged with green fluorescent protein enabled imaging of MT nucleation, growth, and shortening and revealed distinct MT configurations. Depending on the dynamics of the different MT populations during <b>root</b> hair <b>development,</b> either repeated two-dimensional (x, y, t) or repeated three-dimensional (x, y, z, t) scanning was performed. Furthermore, a new image evaluation tool was developed to reveal important data on MT instability.

The proliferative capacity was tested on leaf and shoots explants, cultivated on Murashige-Skoog basal medium, testing two auxins: 2. 4 diclorphenoxiacetic acid (2, 4 D) and indolylacetic acid (IAA) in combination with a cytokinine: kinetine (K). The biomass accumulation was measured by regular weighing on analytical balance. Regenerative capacity was evaluated on shoots explants, cultivated on different inductive variants of MS medium.
