5|$|The breed {{is quick}} to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct {{training}} can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> keep them healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the match itself came the opening {{ceremony}} for the final. The ceremony began with 64 members of the Rustavi Ensemble dance group performing a choreographed <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> {{a variation of the}} UEFA Champions League Anthem. At the culmination of the routine, the players emerged from the tunnel, accompanied by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli singing Il Gladiatore – a song based on Earth from the soundtrack to the film Gladiator – before Bocelli sang supporting vocals to the UEFA Champions League Anthem. Before they emerged from their dressing room, manager Pep Guardiola played the Barcelona team a specially commissioned seven-minute film showing their best moments from the season interspersed with clips from the film Gladiator. The film culminated with the late Luciano Pavarotti's version of Nessun Dorma, and it left several of the players in tears. With his players motivated for the game, Guardiola said nothing as they emerged into the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} finals, Liukin {{displayed}} a beautiful <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> earn a surprising bronze medal on floor exercise {{with a score}} of 15.425, behind Shawn Johnson, with 15.500, and Romanian Sandra Izbasa, with 15.650. On uneven bars, Liukin and China's He Kexin both posted final marks of 16.725 and earned identical A- and B-panel scores of 7.70 and 9.025, respectively. However, He Kexin won the gold medal, and Liukin was awarded the silver, after a tie-breaking calculation that took into account individual marks given by judges on the B-panel. In the balance beam final, Liukin scored 16.025 to claim silver behind Shawn Johnson's 16.225. With her fifth Beijing medal, Liukin tied Mary Lou Retton and Shannon Miller for the most gymnastics medals won by an American in a single Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E

25|$|However, {{even with}} the aid of a debugger, {{locating}} bugs is something of an art. It is not uncommon for a bug in one section of a program to cause failures in a completely different section, thus making it especially difficult to track (for example, an error in a graphics rendering routine causing a file I/O <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> fail), in an apparently unrelated part of the system.|$|E

25|$|Griswold & Nissen worked {{together}} to develop the first prototype trampoline. Later {{they set up a}} company, the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline & Tumbling Company, to manufacture trampolines. However, initially sales were slow and Griswold sold out as his entertainment career was starting to thrive. In 1945, he found that he had to limit his immersion in water for health reasons and so changed his <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> use a trampoline disguised as a swimming pool in his diving act. This allowed him to play a wider variety of venues.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, “escape jumps” propel the ant {{vertically}} and are {{proved to be}} intentional because of the behaviors that precede the jump. Patek et al. observed that before an “escape jump,” the ant will orient its antennae and head perpendicularly to the intruder. Additionally it will sway its entire body and then lift one leg vertically. This is quite an elaborate <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> prepare to propel itself 7cm off of the ground. The reason behind this maneuver {{is to be able}} to grab onto vegetation usually located around their nests in order to provide a form of escape.|$|E

25|$|Potassium bromide {{is used in}} {{veterinary}} medicine to treat epilepsy in dogs, either as first-line treatment or in addition to phenobarbital, when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital alone. Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a substantial risk of causing lung inflammation (pneumonitis) in them. The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories are able {{as a matter of}} <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do not measure bromide as a routine test.|$|E
25|$|Patrice Mangin, the Swiss {{pathologist}} {{who headed}} the team that volunteered to examine Al Salami's body, {{said that it was}} <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> remove some organs before autopsy - those that decay rapidly. Some family members had expressed concerns that the bodies had been returned to them missing the brain, liver, kidney heart and other organs. But, Mangin said that the US authorities had kept the organs of Al-Salami's throat, that is, the larynx, hyoid bone and thyroid. His team could not state an opinion as to whether the man had hanged himself without reviewing these, as they may have revealed another cause of asphyxiation. Despite his repeated requests, the US government never provided these organs.|$|E
25|$|Temple {{had already}} {{appeared}} in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer! After Robinson {{was signed by}} 20th Century Fox, {{it was decided that}} he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film.|$|E
50|$|Calendar {{times are}} 64-bit signed numbers with units of microseconds. The epoch for {{calendar}} times is midnight, January 1, 1970, Greenwich Mean Time.

25|$|The {{future of}} the Islands' 11th BAC was earlier foretold, as their OC Captain (later Major, DSO) MacKinnon, after arrival in England, was almost {{immediately}} transferred to the 3rd Divisional Artillery 9th Brigade CFA, and on promotion he assumed command of 36th (Sydney) Howitzer Battery. Standing in England, leaving for France, having reorganized, the 11th BAC personnel were placed on active service on 15 July 1916, as a CEF unit. Having to absorb three Field BACs and a Howitzer BAC, the 3rd DAC would take on additional authorized ammunition wagons, horses and personnel, needing howitzer battery support capability, and excess to establishment personnel would be moved as artilleryman {{to any of the}} sixteen gun batteries, of the Division. This ‘internal’ reassignment of BAC artilleryman was consistent with past practices, as since 1906, it was an established <b>routine</b> <b>to</b> consider ‘ammunition column’ personnel, as a manning reserve and a source of timely replacements for ‘casualties’ in their brigade's batteries.|$|E
