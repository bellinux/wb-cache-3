5|$|Critics {{praised the}} film's hard-line look at racism and Fuller's use of melodrama and metaphors {{to present his}} argument, and its {{somewhat}} disheartening ending that leaves the impression that while <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> learned, it cannot be cured. Reviewers consistently questioned the film's lack of wide release in the United States when it was completed and applauded its belated release by Criterion.|$|E
25|$|Aversive <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} {{implicit}} {{racism in}} which a person's unconscious negative evaluations of racial or ethnic minorities are realized by a persistent avoidance of interaction with other racial and ethnic groups. As opposed to traditional, overt racism, which is characterized by overt hatred for and explicit discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, aversive <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> characterized by more complex, ambivalent expressions and attitudes. Aversive <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> similar in implications {{to the concept of}} symbolic or modern racism (described below), which is also a form of implicit, unconscious, or covert attitude which results in unconscious forms of discrimination.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{symbolic}} <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> conceptualized as a “blend” of anti-Blacks affect with traditional American values, it has been presenting an independent explanatory power explaining White's racial policy attitudes even when controlled for other items (different from those used in its scale) measuring either racism or traditional/conservative values.|$|E
50|$|While {{symbolic}} <b>racism</b> <b>was</b> originally {{conceptualized as}} a prejudice specifically against {{blacks in the}} United States due to their violation of cherished values, scholars have expanded the concept to apply it to other groups and other locales. In the United States, {{research has been conducted}} on symbolic racism as it relates to Latinos and Asians, as well as modern sexism, anti-fat bias, and heterosexism. For example, Mingying Fu conducted an experiment in which symbolic <b>racism</b> <b>was</b> shown to influence attitudes toward outgroup members and racial policies. In addition, Fu found that symbolic <b>racism</b> <b>was</b> the strongest predictor of white as well as Asian and Latino opposition to affirmative action after controlling for biological racism and ideology.|$|R

25|$|Cultural <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} to {{describe}} and explain new racial ideologies and practices that have emerged since World War II. It {{can be defined as}} societal beliefs and customs that promote the assumption that the products of a given culture, including the language and traditions of that culture are superior to those of other cultures. It shares a great deal with xenophobia, which is often characterised by fear of, or aggression toward, members of an outgroup by members of an ingroup.|$|E
25|$|A few {{critics have}} found what they {{consider}} to be racial elements in the story, generally based upon their views of how Tolkien's imagery depicts good and evil, characters' race (e.g. Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, Southron, Númenórean, Orc); and that the character's race is seen as determining their behaviour. Counter-arguments note that race-focused critiques often omit relevant textual evidence to the contrary, cite imagery from adaptations rather than the work itself; ignore the absence of evidence of racist attitudes or events in the author's personal life, and claim that the perception of <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> itself a marginal view.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether experiences of racist events {{were related to}} psychological distress, negative health behaviors, and health problems. Participants were 71 African American women (mean age 44. 4) who were recruited from an urban cancer-screening clinic {{as part of a}} larger longitudinal study on familial risk of breast cancer. Participants completed three study assessments, approximately one month apart, and data were collected via self-report. Correlational analyses revealed that past year and lifetime <b>racism</b> <b>were</b> both related to psychological distress. Among smokers and drinkers, past year <b>racism</b> <b>was</b> positively correlated with number of cigarettes and drinks consumed. Lifetime <b>racism</b> <b>was</b> negatively related to perceived health, and positively related to lifetime history of physical disease and frequency of recent common colds. Analyses using a general linear model revealed that these relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables. In addition, demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism. The results suggest that <b>racism</b> can <b>be</b> detrimental to African American's well being and should be investigated in health disparities research...|$|R
25|$|Sears' {{theory of}} {{symbolic}} racism was {{developed during the}} decade of 1970 and further refined. His theory has been developed and used {{in the analysis of}} new forms of racism in the United States that emerged especially after the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s. According to Sears' theory of symbolic racism, a subtle form of racism replaced the Jim Crow or “old-fashioned” racism. Instead of the open prejudice, based on beliefs in the biological inferiority of Blacks and support for formal segregation and discrimination, the symbolic <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> a more abstract set of beliefs comprising a “blend” of primitive anti-Black affect with traditional American moral values.|$|E
25|$|Connerly's {{opposition}} {{to affirmative action}} has generated both opposition and support. Connerly believes affirmative action {{is a form of}} racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether perceived {{individual and group}} <b>racism</b> <b>were</b> associated with problematic drinking patterns among urban African American women. In this cross-sectional survey, 139 African American women aged 21 to 49 years who consumed alcohol at least once per month were recruited from and interviewed at varied community sites in Central Harlem, New York City. Drinking patterns were assessed with the CAGE, a commonly used four-item screening measure. Frequent heavy drinking was measured with a single item used in the Centers for Disease Control Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The results showed that, controlling for household income and education level, individual <b>racism</b> <b>was</b> associated with drinking patterns suggestive of alcohol dependence but not frequent heavy drinking. Group <b>racism</b> <b>was</b> not associated with either outcome. The results replicate and extend findings in previous studies and contribute to building literature {{on the effects of}} racism on health-damaging behaviors...|$|R

500|$|Walker {{insists that}} Angelou's {{treatment}} of <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> what gives her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores {{one of their}} central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. For example, in Angelou's depiction of the [...] "powhitetrash" [...] incident, Maya reacts with rage, indignation, humiliation, and helplessness, but Momma teaches her how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing with racism, {{and that it is}} an effective basis for actively protesting and combating racism. Walker calls Momma's way a [...] "strategy of subtle resistance" [...] and McPherson calls it [...] "the dignified course of silent endurance".|$|E
500|$|White Dog is a 1982 American drama film, which Samuel Fuller {{directed}} from {{a screenplay}} he and Curtis Hanson had dramatized, which, in turn, they based loosely on Romain Gary's 1970 {{novel of the}} same title. The film depicts the struggle of a dog trainer named Keys (Paul Winfield), who is black, trying to retrain a stray dog found by a young actress (Kristy McNichol), that is a [...] "white dog"--a dog trained to make vicious attacks upon, and to murder, any black person. Fuller uses the film as a platform to deliver an anti-racist message as it examines {{the question of whether}} <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> a treatable problem or an incurable condition.|$|E

500|$|King {{was arrested}} and jailed early in the campaign—his 13th arrest out of 29. From his cell, he {{composed}} the now-famous Letter from Birmingham Jail which responds to calls on the movement to pursue legal channels for social change. King argues that the crisis of <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: [...] "We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed." [...] He {{points out that the}} Boston Tea Party, a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, [...] "everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal'."

500|$|White Dog is a [...] "blunt, highly {{cinematic}} parable {{about race}} relations" [...] that questions whether <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> a curable mental illness or learned behavior, {{or if it}} is an untreatable disease. The unnamed white German Shepherd is the metaphor of racism, with his radically contrasting moments of innocent, typical dog behavior when not around black persons, and his snarling viciousness when he sees a target. Paul Winfield's character Keys, who believes he can help the dog unlearn this behavior, represents the view that racism can be unlearned. Keys's attempts to reprogram the dog become a [...] "bold literalization of the race war," [...] and as the film progresses Keys becomes obsessed with the idea that he can cure the dog. Much like Captain Ahab, he declares that if he fails with this dog, he will find another and another until he succeeds. Keys's counterpart, Carruthers, a white trainer, believes the dog is irredeemable and should be killed, representing the view that racism cannot be cured.|$|E
500|$|Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying {{her hands}} in the dog's fur and his normal loving {{behavior}} when alone with her provides a stark image of [...] "how hatred can be familiar, reassuringly close." [...] J. Hoberman argues that the film [...] "naturalizes racism in an unnatural way" [...] in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that <b>racism</b> <b>is</b> something that is learned, but that once learned is a [...] "poison" [...] that can never truly [...] "be banished from those it infects." [...] But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects.|$|E
