The poachers are revealed to be Greenpeace activists, who prove that Dr. Bushwell is actually a chimp slave master, exploiting their labor at a nearby diamond mine. Worried that the Simpsons will report her to the authorities, Dr. Bushwell offers everyone diamonds as a bribe - which all the Simpsons except Lisa happily accept. On the plane <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Springfield, it is revealed that their former tour guide, Kitenge, is {{now president of the}} country, with the former president now the Simpsons' flight attendant.|$|E
5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Emerald City.|$|E

5|$|In 1452, Turkish cavalry {{forces had}} begun raiding Albanian territories in the East, a common Ottoman tactic to weaken an enemy before {{beginning}} a full-scale invasion. On 23 April, Raimon d'Ortafà, Alfonso's governor in Albania, {{feared that the}} Turkish invasion would force many of the Albanians to turn to Islam and sent letters to Alfonso for aid. Mehmed, believing that the misunderstandings between the Albanian leaders was at its most critical point, ordered a force of 25,000-27,000 inexperienced men. His reasoning was that these could weaken Albanian forces enough {{so that he could}} then launch a concerted invasion. The force was under the main command of Tahip Pasha. Tahip would split his forces into two parts, one under his command, and the other under his subordinate, Hamza Pasha. Mehmed had been tied up in war in the East so he let Hamza <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the West.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E

Passengers {{arriving at}} the SkyPier board buses to the terminal and arriving air passengers board ferries at the pier for their <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the PRD. Passengers travelling both directions can bypass custom and immigration formalities, which reduces transit time. Four ports – Shekou, Shenzhen, Macau and Humen (Dongguan) – were initially served. As of August 2007, SkyPier serves Shenzhen's Shekou and Fuyong, Dongguan's Humen, Macau, Zhongshan and Zhuhai.

She married him in 2004 after the Athens Paralympics. She had problems selecting a wedding dress because some interfered with her ability to roll in her wheel chair. She got married in the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in 2005. She stood up from her wheelchair {{in order to take}} her vows. The ceremony was attended by a number of high-ranking political figures. She had her son after the 2008 Beijing Paralympics.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{the wreck}} of a ship was found in Red Bay. She is {{believed}} to be the Spanish Basque galleon San Juan, a three-masted, 27.1m (90ft) long, 250–300-ton vessel that was lost in 1565. San Juan, carrying a cargo of nearly 1,000 barrels of whale oil, was wrecked by an autumn storm. She grounded stern first on the northern side of Saddle Island, struck the bottom several times and split her keel open before sinking 30 yards from shore. Her captain, Joanes de Portu, and crew were able to save the sails, rigging, some provisions, and about half the whale oil. The crew took to the boats and hailed another ship for a <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Spain. The following year de Portu salvaged more of the wreck before she finally sank out of sight. Three more wrecks have been found in Red Bay, the last in 2004. The charred hull fragments of the second ship, found in 1983, strongly suggest the ship sank because of a fire.|$|E

500|$|Astana {{moved to}} the head of the main peloton after the second climb of the day. Although Dumoulin was still in the group, he had lost most of his teammates. Astana then {{attacked}} with [...] remaining on the third climb: Mikel Landa attacked first; Aru followed him and was joined by Quintana and Rafał Majka. Dumoulin was dropped but was then able to <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the group. By this point the group contained just eight riders: Landa, Aru, Quintana, Majka, Dumoulin, Rodríguez, Chaves and Mikel Nieve (Sky). Towards the summit, Dumoulin and Nieve were dropped. Dumoulin attempted to <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the group on the descent and flat; Aru, however, had three teammates in the group (Luis León Sánchez and Andrey Zeits had dropped back from the early breakaway) and they were able to defend their lead. On the final climb, Quintana and Majka attacked and gained over a minute's lead ahead of the rest of the group; they were assisted by Andrey Amador, Quintana's teammate, who had also been in the breakaway. Rodríguez rode hard at the front of the group to defend his overall position. Quintana and Majka finished around 50" [...] ahead of Rodríguez, Aru and Chaves. Dumoulin finished nearly four minutes further back. Aru therefore moved into the race lead, with Rodríguez in second and Majka third. Dumoulin dropped to sixth place.|$|E

In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Odin is a [...] "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E

It states: [...] "Willie Stone is only six years old, but he yearns to be a fireman. He is much impressed with the parade of firemen he sees in his hometown, so much so in fact that he basely deserts his sister on the streets to follow the 'smoke eaters.' But Willie is only a little boy, and despite his enthusiasm, he is soon weary and footsore. His plight, added to his tears, attracts {{the attention of a}} kindly fireman who is driving with his engine back to quarters. The lad's discomfort is soon forgotten, for the fireman gives him a <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the engine house. There Willie gravely applies to the captain for a position on the uniformed force, and is jokingly accepted. But he does not see the humor in it and follows the other men to the bunkroom, where he takes part in their sports." ...|$|E

He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race. To the delight of the crowd, winner Rutherford gave him a <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the pits. He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year.

[...] Meanwhile, there were discussions about a role on Lost, but Bell turned down the role of Charlotte Staples Lewis. Bell portrayed Elle Bishop on Heroes, a [...] "mysterious young lady" [...] with an [...] "awesome power". She did not have to audition for the role of Elle, who made her first appearance in an October 2007 episode, and appeared in at least thirteen episodes during the run of the series. The casting of Bell, Heroes creator Tim Kring explained, [...] "was not easy to pull off", but because of the large ensemble cast of the series and multiple story arcs, [...] "we found a way to jump into a small window in [...] schedule." [...] Bell lent her voice to the CW series Gossip Girl: she voiced the title character in every episode of the series, appearing in person only for a surprise cameo in the final episode, portraying herself.|$|E
