Deploying pest-resistant planting stock {{as a basis for}} managing these pests has not been considered until recently, however. We review evidence for the existence of resistance to <b>shoot</b> <b>borers</b> in Meliaceae, with particular emphasis on research in Costa Rica on resistance to Hypsipyla grandelia in big-leaf mahogany and Spanish cedar. This research has shown appreciable genetic variation in resistance to attack by <b>shoot</b> <b>borers</b> in these tree species.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Four okra {{varieties}} viz., Arka Anamika, Salkeerthy, Sel 2 and KL 9 of cultivated species Abelmoschus esculentus, and two varieties viz., Susthira and AC 5 of semi-domesticated species Abelmoschus caillei were crossed in {{all possible}} combinations. The parents and hybrids were evaluated for resistance against fruit and <b>shoot</b> <b>borer,</b> Earias vittella Fab. Differential response to fruit and <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> infestation {{was observed in}} all genotypes. The study revealed that the parents AC 5 and KL 9 are the potential donors of <b>shoot</b> and fruit <b>borer</b> resistance. Selection of genotypes with short growth habit, short flowering period and short fruit length will help to minimize the <b>shoot</b> and fruit <b>borer</b> infestation. Arka Anamika {{was identified as a}} good donor parent in breeding for fruit number, fruit weight and fruit length.

25|$|When {{fruit and}} <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> larvae feed on Bt brinjal plants, they ingest the Bt protein Cry1Ac along with plant tissue.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Infestations of {{the western}} pine <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> (Eucosma sonomana Kearfott) in young stands of ponderosa pine (Pinusponderosa Lawson), were {{surveyed}} on the Deschutes National Forest. Elevation, slope, aspect, tree height, tree diameter, number of shoots in the terminal whorl, stand density, stand age and plant association for each stand were used in general multiple regression and logistic regression analyses to predict the percentage of infested terminal shoots. Using general multiple regression, taking the arcsin(square root(proportion of infested trees)), the models that were selected as the best predictors included (1) diameter, trees/hectare and elevation (R 2 = 0. 62) and (2) number of shoots in the terminal whorl and stand age (R 2 = 0. 62). Using logistic regression, the best model included number of shoots in the terminal whorl and stand age. Values for these stand characteristics {{can be used with}} the appropriate equation to estimate the percentage of terminal whorls damaged by <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> in a given stand.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{mahogany}} <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> Hypsipyla grandella Zeller is {{an important}} economic pest in all American tropical forests, because it prevents monoculture of valuable timber trees species like mahogany and cedar. The <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> damages several tree structures, especially the apical shoots, impairing {{the formation of the}} commercial stem. This pest can attack the plants during the year and one larva per plant is enough to cause significant damage. In infested areas, the attack can reach up to 100 % of the trees. The Australian cedar and African mahogany have been cultivated in Brazil for timber production, because they are considered resistant to H. grandella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) attack. However, in this work we report {{for the first time the}} H. grandella attack to African mahogany Khaya ivorensis...|$|R

40|$|Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) {{is a very}} {{important}} source of income for more than 200, 000 farmer households in Vietnam. The present cashew productivity in Vietnam is low and unstable, and pest damage is partly responsible for this. Cashew farmers rely on pesticides to minimize the damage, resulting in adverse impacts on farm environment and farmers’ health. Weaver ants (Oecophylla spp) are effective biocontrol agents of a range of cashew insect pests in several cashew-growing countries, and these ants are widely distributed in Vietnam. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the potential of weaver ants in cashew orchards in Vietnam. Field surveys and field experiment were conducted in five cashew orchards from July 2006 to January 2008 in Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, and Ba Ria Vung Tau provinces, Vietnam. Based on the field surveys, the most important pests that damage flushing foliar and floral shoots and young cashew fruits and nuts were mosquito bugs, brown <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> blue <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> and fruit-nut borers. The damage caused by each of these pests was significantly lower on trees with weaver ants compared with trees without the ants, showing that the ants were able to keep these pest damages under the control threshold. Regular monitoring of the field experiment showed that weaver ants were similar to insecticides for controlling mosquito bugs, blue <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> fruit-nut borers, leaf rollers, and leaf miners. Aphids did not become major pests in plot with weaver ants. To manage insect pest assemblage in cashew orchards, an integrated pest management using weaver ants as a major component is discussed...|$|R

5000|$|As a timber, both Swietenia macrophylla and Swietenia mahogoni {{are both}} grown in {{plantations}} in several Asian {{countries such as}} Fiji, Indonesia, India, and Bangladesh and this plantation mahogany timber is {{the main source of}} the world's current supply of [...] "genuine mahogany", due to cultivation and trade of it in its native locations being restricted by the Convention On International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna CITES since the late 1990s. Trade in Swietenia grown and harvested in these non-native locations is not restricted. Species of this genus are only occasionally plantation-grown in Central America, in spite of the good growing conditions and high price of the wood, due to the ubiquitous presence of the mahogany <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> moth (also known as the cedar tip moth), Hypsipyla grandella, which damages the form of the tree by killing the terminal shoot, causing excessive branching.

40|$|Swietenia macrophylla King (Meliaceae: Swietenioideae) {{provides}} one of {{the premier}} timbers of the world. The mahogany <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> Hypsipyla robusta Moore (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is an economically important pest of S. macrophylla throughout Asia, Africa and the Pacific. No viable method of controlling this pest is known. Previous observations have suggested that the presence of overhead shade may reduce attack by H. robusta, but this has not been investigated experimentally. This research was therefore designed to assess the influence of light availability on shoot-borer attack on S. macrophylla, by establishing seedlings under three different artificial shade regimes, then using these seedlings to test oviposition preference of adult moths, neonate larval survival and growth and development of <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> larvae. Oviposition preference of <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> moths was tested on leaves from seedlings grown under artificial shade for 63 weeks. A significant difference in choice was recorded between treatments, with 27. 4 ± 1. 5 eggs laid under high shade and 87. 1 ± 1. 8 under low shade. Neonate larval survival on early flushing leaflets of S. macrophylla did not differ significantly between shade treatments. Larval growth rate, estimated by measuring daily frass width, was significantly higher for those larvae fed on seedlings from the high and medium shade treatments (0. 1 mm/day), than the low shade treatment (0. 06 mm/day). In laboratory-reared larvae, the total mass of frass produced was significantly higher in the high shade treatment (0. 4 g) than under the low shade treatment (0. 2 g). Longer tunnel lengths were bored by larvae in plants grown under high shade (12. 0 ± 2. 4 cm) than under low shade (7. 07 ± 1. 9 cm). However, pupal mass under low shade was 48...|$|R
