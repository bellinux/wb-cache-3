2500|$|While {{half-wave}} and {{full-wave rectification}} deliver unidirectional current, neither produces a constant voltage. There {{is a large}} AC ripple voltage component at the source frequency for a half-wave rectifier, and twice the source frequency for a full-wave rectifier. [...] Ripple voltage is usually specified peak-to-peak. Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter. In its simplest form this can be just a capacitor (also called a <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> or smoothing capacitor), choke, resistor, zener diode & resistor, or voltage regulator placed at {{the output of the}} rectifier. [...] In practice, most smoothing filters utilize multiple components to efficiently reduce ripple voltage to a level tolerable by the circuit.|$|E

50|$|A <b>reservoir</b> <b>{{capacitor}}</b> is {{a capacitor}} {{that is used}} to smooth the pulsating DC from an AC rectifier. The <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> releases its stored energy during the part of the AC cycle when the AC source does not supply any power, that is, when the AC source changes its phase resulting in change in 'direction of flow of current'. The change in 'direction of flow of current' of the AC source takes a very small amount of time. In this short gap of time, the continuous flow of current gradually moves to the state when it ceases. Using a <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor,</b> we fill this gap; since the capacitor releases its stored energy (gets discharged) in that gap of time. This allows the load to be powered at all times without any interruption.|$|E
50|$|Filter {{capacitors}} are not {{the same}} as <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitors,</b> the tasks the two perform are different, albeit related.|$|R
25|$|<b>Reservoir</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are used}} in power {{supplies}} where they smooth the output of a full or half wave rectifier. They {{can also be used}} in charge pump circuits as the energy storage element in the generation of higher voltages than the input voltage.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of silicon nitride deposition condition on {{parameters of the}} obtained films has been investigated. It {{has been found that}} the deposition rate of silicon nitride films decreases with deposition temperature decreasing, {{and at the same time}} the within wafer thickness uniformity improves. It allows performing the reproducible deposition of silicon nitride films with thickness of less than 10 nm. It has been found that in order to decrease the oxidation depth of silicon nitride, it is appropriate to carry out the oxidation under 850 — 900 °C. The developed process of silicon nitride deposition made it possible to obtain <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitors</b> with specific capacitance of 3, 8 — 3, 9 fF/μm 2 at film thickness of 7, 0 nm...|$|R
50|$|More complex {{arrangements}} are possible; the filter {{can be an}} LC ladder rather than a simple choke or the filter and the <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> can both be used to gain the benefits of both. The most commonly seen of these is a low-pass Π-filter consisting of a <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> followed by a series choke followed by a further shunt capacitor. However, use of chokes is deprecated in contemporary designs for economic reasons. A more common solution where good ripple rejection is required {{is to use a}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> to reduce the ripple to something manageable and then pass through a voltage regulator circuit. The regulator circuit, as well as regulating the output, will incidentally filter out nearly all of the ripple as long as the minimum level of the ripple waveform does not go below the voltage being regulated to.|$|E
50|$|A more usual {{alternative}} to a filter, and essential if the DC load requires very low ripple voltage, is to follow the <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> with an active voltage regulator circuit. The <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> must {{be large enough to}} prevent the troughs of the ripple dropping below the minimum voltage required by the regulator to produce the required output voltage. The regulator serves both to significantly reduce the ripple and to deal with variations in supply and load characteristics. It would be possible to use a smaller <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> (these can be large on high-current power supplies) and then apply some filtering as well as the regulator, {{but this is not a}} common strategy. The extreme of this approach is to dispense with the <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> altogether and put the rectified waveform straight into a choke-input filter. The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother and consequently the rectifier no longer has to deal with the current as a large current pulse, but instead the current delivery is spread over the entire cycle. The disadvantage, apart from extra size and weight, is that the voltage output is much lower - approximately the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak.|$|E
50|$|These {{circuits}} {{are very}} frequently fed from transformers, and have significant resistance. Transformer resistance modifies the <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> waveform, changes the peak voltage, and introduces regulation issues.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a fluidic capacitor-based reagent storage and delivery {{system that is}} self-contained and self-powered, potentially applicable to highly portable devices for on-site use. Solutions are stored under pressure in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane mounted <b>reservoirs</b> (fluidic <b>capacitors)</b> in a charged state, and by releasing the stored pressure, the solution is self-powered to flow and fully discharge within 4 min. The leakage of pressure from the capacitors over time has been reduced by sealing the surface with paraffin wax, where the capacitors remain charged for up to 6 days with 85 % of original volume preserved...|$|R
30|$|In each {{converter}} station, {{the converter}} {{is the type}} of three-level neutral point clamped (NPC); a three-phase smoothing converter reactor is placed between the converter and a converter transformer. The converter transformer is Yn/Y connection type where the Y winding is connected to the reactor, resulting in decoupling the ac system from the triple harmonics produced by the converter. The ac shunt passive filter group is located between the converter transformer and the converter reactor, comprised of a high-pass filter to filter out the harmonics at frequencies higher than the carrier frequency and a double tuned filter to filter 5 th and the harmonic at twice carrier frequency of the VSC. The dc-side of the VSC uses <b>reservoir</b> dc <b>capacitors</b> to equalize dc voltage, enhance the system dynamics and reduce the dc-side voltage ripple. The dc-side filter circuit consists of the 3 rd order tuned filters and dc-smoothing reactors.|$|R
50|$|The {{component}} {{value for}} the inductor can be estimated as an inductance that resonates the smoothing capacitor(s) at or below one tenth of the minimum AC frequency in the power supplied to the filter (100 Hz from a full-wave rectifier {{in a region where}} the power supply is 50Hz). Thus if <b>reservoir</b> and smoothing <b>capacitors</b> of 2200 microfarads are used, a suitable minimum {{value for the}} inductor would be that which resonates 2200 microfarads (μF) to 10 Hz, i.e. 115 mH. A larger value is preferable provided the inductor can carry the required supply current.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} inrush-current limiting system, {{used in many}} {{consumer electronics}} devices, is a NTC resistor. When cold, its high resistance allows a small current to pre-charge the <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor.</b> After it warms up, its low resistance more efficiently passes the working current.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{regulated}} supplies mostly use a transformer, {{silicon diode}} bridge recitfier, <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> and voltage regulator IC. There are variations on this theme, such as supplies with multiple voltage lines, variable regulators, power control lines, discrete circuits and so on. Switched mode regulator supplies also include an inductor.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{approach}} to reducing ripple {{is to use}} a series choke. A choke has a filtering action and consequently produces a smoother waveform with less high-order harmonics. Against this, the DC output is close to the average input voltage as opposed to the higher voltage with the <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> which is close to the peak input voltage. With suitable approximations, the ripple factor is given by: ...|$|E
50|$|A typical {{capacitor}} input filter {{consists of}} a filter or <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> C1, connected across the rectifier output, an inductor L, in series and another filter or smoothing capacitor, C2, connected across the load, RL. A filter of this sort is designed for use at a particular frequency, generally fixed by the AC line frequency and rectifier configuration. When used in this service, filter performance is often characterized by its regulation and ripple.|$|E
50|$|In both {{old and new}} designs, even mostly directly-coupled {{operational}} amplifier circuits, feedback through the power supply rails can generate ultrasonic oscillations that vary in amplitude at a low frequency (squegging) due to the power supply voltage sagging as oscillations build up (the long time constant coming from the power supply <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor)</b> {{in such a way}} that the low frequency is audible even though the high frequency fundamental is not. Such problems can be difficult to diagnose.|$|E
50|$|While {{half-wave}} and {{full-wave rectification}} can deliver unidirectional current, neither produces a constant voltage. Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter. In its simplest form {{this can be}} just a <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> or smoothing capacitor, placed at the DC output of the rectifier. There is still an AC ripple voltage component at the power supply frequency for a half-wave rectifier, twice that for full-wave, where the voltage is not completely smoothed.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{electronic}} items function using a DC voltage, so the PDC waveform must {{usually be}} smoothed before use. A <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> converts the PDC wave into a DC waveform with some superimposed ripple. When the PDC voltage is initially applied, it charges the capacitor, which {{acts as a}} short term storage device to keep the output at an acceptable level while the PDC waveform is at a low voltage. Voltage regulation is often also applied using either linear or switching regulation.|$|E
50|$|To {{further reduce}} ripple, a capacitor-input filter can be used. This {{complements}} the <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> with a choke (inductor) {{and a second}} filter capacitor, so that a steadier DC output can be obtained across the terminals of the filter capacitor. The choke presents a high impedance to the ripple current. For use at power-line frequencies inductors require cores of iron or other magnetic materials, and add weight and size. Their use in power supplies for electronic equipment has therefore dwindled in favour of semiconductor circuits such as voltage regulators.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{application}} of inrush current limiters {{is in the}} input stage of non-power factor corrected switching supplies, to reduce the initial surge of current from the line input to the <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The most popular application is the inrush protection of the AC current in switching power supplies (SPS). The primary reason for having surge current suppression in a SPS {{is to protect the}} diode bridge rectifier as the input or charging capacitor is initially charged. This capacitor draws significant current during the first half AC cycle and can subject the components in line with the capacitor to excessive current. The initial equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the capacitor provides very little protection for the diode bridge rectifier.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of this capacitor, {{known as a}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> (or smoothing capacitor) is to lessen the variation in (or 'smooth') the rectified AC output voltage waveform from the bridge. There is still some variation, known as ripple. One explanation of 'smoothing' is that the capacitor provides {{a low impedance path}} to the AC component of the output, reducing the AC voltage across, and AC current through, the resistive load. In less technical terms, any drop in the output voltage and current of the bridge tends to be cancelled by loss of charge in the capacitor. This charge flows out as additional current through the load. Thus the change of load current and voltage is reduced relative to what would occur without the capacitor. Increases of voltage correspondingly store excess charge in the capacitor, thus moderating the change in output voltage / current.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes a}} power extraction circuit designed to interface to a vibrational energy harvester. Vibrational energy harvesters produce an AC voltage {{and therefore a}} power processing circuit is needed to convert the AC voltage into a DC voltage of an appropriate level for supplying a low power load. The power conversion circuitry must also present the correct electrical impedance to the generator to maximize its power output. The buck-boost topology is chosen for the extraction circuit, its operating point in to discontinuous mode. A <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> is present to store the extracted energy. An implementation of the design was simulated using a standard 80 V CMOS process, and efficiencies of over 60 % are demonstrated. With suitable control, the input impedance of the circuit is indeed resistive as well as variable and thus well suited as a load for powerMEMS generators...|$|E
40|$|There face {{challenges}} to build power management circuit for microscale electrostatic vibration energy harvesting. Small capacitance variation limited by standard fabrication {{process is a}} common obstacle to obtain suﬃcient transduction for power conversion. The electronic circuit encounters an issue of compatibility to MEMS integration based on available techniques. A key function of the built interface circuit is able to drive and to power the whole system with only power extracted from ambient vibration. Thus, the energy harvesting system becomes completely autonomous without using any extra suppliers or biases. This work is to build an ASIC interface circuit for the MEMS electrostatic energy harvester where range of transducer capacitance is below∼ 10 pF. The designed circuit is therefore proper for typical comb-drive overlapping capacitive transducers. The circuit topology consists of three main elements: double charge pump, ﬂyback path and controlling switch. Among them, the switch plays an extremely important role to control the harvesting system. Optimization of switching sequence has signiﬁcant eﬀect on harvested power from electrostatic transducer. A control circuit is proposed to detect moments and then to turn on/oﬀ switch optimally. As a result, the designed circuit is automatic to control the switch during vibration cycles. To be the selfsustaining system, the circuit draws obtained energy stored in <b>reservoir</b> <b>capacitor</b> to power the entire interface circuit. With the current topology including clocking, a net energy of 7. 97 nJ is achieved during 1 second when capacitance variation of the transducer has Cmin = 2. 156 pF and Cmax = 8. 624 pF. Alternatively, a voltage-quadrupler circuit topology {{is designed to be}} adaptive to the comb-drive overlapping capacitive transducers. A major advantage of this self-sustaining conﬁguration is that by integration of transducer to series-connected rectiﬁer-capacitor combination, output voltage is boosted to inﬁnite value in principle. For example, with an initial voltage 3 V applied for transducer with nominal capacitance of 30 pF, the obtained voltage ramps up to about 14 V after only 40 ms...|$|E
