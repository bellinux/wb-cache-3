40|$|Abstract — Bluetooth {{is widely}} used {{technology}} in today’s mobile phones. It enables a device to communicate wirelessly without being in line of site of other device, but Bluetooth has its own shortcomings {{such as it is}} applicable between only two Bluetooth enabled mobile phones at a time and it is limited by range So to overcome these disadvantages we propose a new system BlueBooster system. This BlueBooster system will extend physical range of Bluetooth without using any external hardware. Also by using this BlueBooster system, more than two devices can communicate with each other which forms a network of devices.

40|$|Due {{to climate}} warming, many plant species shift ranges towards higher latitudes. Plants can {{disperse}} faster than most soil biota, however, {{little is known}} about how range-expanding plants in the new range will establish interactions with the resident soil food web. In this paper we examine how the soil nematode community from the new range responds to range-expanding plant species compared to related natives. We focused on nematodes, because they are important components in various trophic levels of the soil food web, some feeding on plant roots, others on microbes or on invertebrates. We expected that range expanding plant species have fewer root-feeding nematodes, as predicted by enemy release hypothesis. We therefore expected that <b>range</b> <b>expanders</b> affect the taxonomic and functional composition of the nematode community, but that these effects would diminish with increasing trophic position of nematodes in the soil food web. We exposed six <b>range</b> <b>expanders</b> (including three intercontinental exotics) and nine related native plant species to soil from the invaded range and show that <b>range</b> <b>expanders</b> on average had fewer root-feeding nematodes per unit root biomass than related natives. The <b>range</b> <b>expanders</b> showed resistance against rather than tolerance for root-feeding nematodes from the new range. On the other hand, the overall taxonomic and functional nematode community composition was influenced by plant species rather than by plant origin. The plant identity effects declined with trophic position of nematodes in the soil food web, as plant feeders were influenced more than other feeding guilds. We conclude that range-expanding plant species can have fewer root-feeding nematodes per unit root biomass than related natives, but that the taxonomic and functional nematode community composition is determined more by plant identity than by plant origin. Plant species identity effects decreased with trophic position of nematodes in the soil food web. ...|$|R

However, {{little is known}} about the factors that influence the future performance of range-expanding species in their new habitats. Here we show that range-expanding plant species from a riverine area were better defended against shoot and root enemies than were related native plant species growing in the same area. We grew fifteen plant species with and without non-coevolved polyphagous locusts and cosmopolitan, polyphagous aphids. Contrary to our expectations, the locusts performed more poorly on the range-expanding plant species than on the congeneric native plant species, whereas the aphids showed no difference. The shoot herbivores reduced the biomass of the native plants more than they did that of the congeneric <b>range</b> <b>expanders.</b> Also, the range-expanding plants developed fewer pathogenic effects 4, 5 in their root-zone soil than did the related native species. Current predictions forecast biodiversity loss due to limitations in the ability of species to adjust to climate warming conditions in their range 6, 7, 8. Our results strongly suggest that the plants that shift ranges towards higher latitudes and altitudes may include potential invaders, as the successful <b>range</b> <b>expanders</b> may experience less control by above-ground or below-ground enemies than the natives. ...|$|R

Using an ecological and metabolomics approach, we compared the insect performance of a generalist and specialist herbivore and a parasitoid, as well as plant defence traits, among native, exotic invasive and exotic non-invasive populations of the Turkish rocket, Bunias orientalis, a range-expanding species across parts of Eurasia. In the glasshouse, the generalist herbivore, Mamestra brassicae, and its parasitoid, Microplitis mediator, performed better on non-native than on native plant populations. Insect performance did not differ between the two non-native origins. By contrast, the specialist herbivore, Pieris brassicae, developed poorly on all populations. Differences in trichome densities and in the metabolome, particularly in the family-specific secondary metabolites (i. e. glucosinolates), may explain population-related variation in the performance of the generalist herbivore and its parasitoid. Total glucosinolate concentrations were significantly induced by herbivory, particularly in native populations. Native populations of B. orientalis are generally better defended than non-native populations. The role of insect herbivores and dietary specialization as a selection force on defence traits in the range-expanding B. orientalis is discussed...|$|R

After preliminary preparation, the sample is treated with ascorbic acid in hydrochloric acid to release and reduce protein-bound iron, then singly dialyzed into an acetate buffer and reacted with 4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (bathophenanthroline) to form a pink color proportionate {{to the amount of}} iron present.

In suspected cases of familial hyperlipoproteinemia, clinical laboratory determinations include-besides the appearance of a fasting serum specimen-serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, and in certain cases lipo-protein electrophoresis to assist in clinical diagnosis of the various Frederickson et al. types () of familial hyperlipoproteinemia. Several accurate manual and semiautomated techniques are avail-able for measurement of serum triglycerides (3 - 5), but these are rather complex and depend on accurate timing of the steps involved in the determination. In an attempt to find a relatively simple and inexpensive method to cope with small batches of triglycerides, I tried a method (6) based on a modification of the phenylhydrazine and potassium ferricyanide method, in which a red dye is pro-duced, but without success, owing to the instability and doubtful purity of the phenylhydrazine reagent.

Sensitivity and accuracy in the physiological range are increased {{by the use of}} ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. Results correlate well with an established manual procedure and there is no inter-ference from magnesiumor phosphate. A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFICULTY in estimating calcium in serum by photometry arises {{from the fact that the}} normal range is narrow rela-tive to the concentration of calcium. In the cases of sodium and chloride which also possess narrow normal ranges, the automation problem has been approached in two different ways. For sodium the Technicon Flame Photometer incorporates an electrical <b>range</b> <b>expander.</b> In the Technicon N 3 a methodology for serum chloride the reagent contains mercuric nitrate which removes a certain amount of chloride from the reaction so that the calibration curve does not pass through the origin. In the present method, a similar effect is achieved for serum calcium by the addition of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) to one of the reagents. Glyoxal-bis-(2 -hydroxyanil) (GBHA) was used by Skerry in the estimation of calcium in serum by titration with EDTA (1). Mager and Farese (2) used it in the direct photometric analysis of serum calcium, a method which was adapted to the AutoAnalyzer by Farese et al (3).

40|$|Current {{predictions}} on species {{responses to}} climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions. We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions {{and use it to}} argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of range-expanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of <b>range</b> <b>expanders</b> different from that of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that under climate change, results of altered species interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these possibilities into account will provide a new perspective on predicting species distribution under climate change. ...|$|R
40|$|The current {{distribution}} of climatic conditions will be rearranged on the globe. To survive, species {{will have to}} keep pace with climates as they move. Mountains are among the most affected regions owing to both climate and land-use change. Here, we explore the effects of climate change in the vertebrate food web of the Pyrenees. We investigate elevation range expansions between two time-periods illustrative of warming conditions, to assess: (i) the taxonomic composition of range expanders; (ii) changes in food web properties such as the distribution of links per species and community size-structure; and (iii) what are the specific traits of <b>range</b> <b>expanders</b> that set them apart from the other species in the community-in particular, body mass, diet generalism, vulnerability and trophic position within the food web. We found an upward expansion of species at all elevations, which was not even for all taxonomic groups and trophic positions. At low and intermediate elevations, predator : prey mass ratios were significantly reduced. Expanders were larger, had fewer predators and were, in general, more specialists. Our study shows that elevation range expansions as climate warms have important and predictable impacts on the structure and size distribution of food webs across space. Miguel Lurgi, Bernat C.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of studies reports plant range expansions to higher latitudes and altitudes in response to global warming. However, consequences for interactions with other species in the novel ranges are poorly understood. Here, we examine how range-expanding plant species interact with root-feeding nematodes from the new range. Root-feeding nematodes are ubiquitous belowground herbivores that may impact the structure and composition of natural vegetation. Because of their ecological novelty, we hypothesized that range-expanding plant species will be less suitable hosts for root-feeding nematodes than native congeneric plant species. In greenhouse and lab trials we compared nematode preference and performance of two root-feeding nematode species between range-expanding plant species and their congeneric natives. In order to understand differences in nematode preferences, we compared root volatile profiles of all <b>range</b> <b>expanders</b> and congeneric natives. Nematode preferences and performances differed substantially among the pairs of range-expanders and natives. The range-expander that had the most unique volatile profile compared to its related native was unattractive and a poor host for nematodes. Other range-expanding plant species that differed less in root chemistry from native congeners, also differed less in nematode attraction and performance. We conclude that the three climate-driven range-expanding plant species studied varied considerably in their chemical novelty compared to their congeneric natives, and therefore affected native root-feeding nematodes in species-specific ways. Our data suggest that through variation in chemical novelty, range-expanding plant species may vary in their impacts on belowground herbivores in the new range...|$|R
40|$|The {{climate is}} {{changing}} and temperatures are predicted to further {{increase in the}} future. Species respond to these changes by either adapting to the local warmer conditions and/or range shifting to higher latitudes. Some of these successful range shifting plants can become invasive in their new range. Therefore, there is a conceptual analogy of successful range shifts and biological invasions originating from other continents. Intra-continental plant species shift their ranges within the same contiguous land mass from which they originate. Inter-continental species originate from other continents from {{where they have been}} introduced before expanding in their new range. The aim of this thesis is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the plant-insect interactions that may contribute to the success of exotic plants that have expanded their ranges due to climate warming. More specifically I aimed to clarify whether climate warming-induced range expanding exotic plants are less suitable than native congener plants and whether these plants suffer less from aboveground enemies than native congener plants. In addition, I investigated if inter –and intra-continental exotic plant species differed in their suitability and if they responded differently to potential aboveground enemies. In the first greenhouse experiment, I tested the hypothesis that inter- and intra-continental exotic plants and phylogenetically related native plants from the same habitat do not respond differently to two aboveground polyphagous herbivores. Further I tested if intra- and inter-continental exotic plants experience less negative soil feedback than related native plants. I grew fifteen plant species with and without naive polyphagous locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) and cosmopolitan aphids (Myzus persicae) and exposed all plants to soils from their invaded range in order to test the feedback from the soil community to plant biomass production. My results show that that both inter –and intra-continental exotic plants on average were better defended against aboveground and belowground enemies than related native plant species. This suggests that successful range expanding plants may include species with invasive properties. Exotic plants have been shown to have neutral to positive soil feedbacks, while native plants experience negative effects from their soil biota. Belowground interactions can influence aboveground interactions and may change the relationships between exotic plants and their enemies. I examined how the performance of the two aboveground polyphagous herbivores S. gregaria and M. persicae species was influenced by feedback interactions between the plants and their soil biota and compared these responses in intra- and inter-continental exotic and related native plants. Locust mass was negatively affected by the plant specific soil community and larger on native than on exotic plants. Locust survival was also higher on native plants, but not affected by soil type. There were no differences between inter –and intra-continental plants. Aphid population size was not affected by soil type, but was highest on the intra-continental <b>range</b> <b>expander.</b> The body size of M. persicae was larger on control than on soils with specific plant communities and not affected by plant origin. One way of measuring the release of exotic plants from natural enemies is by comparing their herbivore loads with related plants that are native in the invaded range. These loads can be influenced by top down control of insect predators and parasitoids. In the field, I examined herbivore loads and predator pressure on two exotic (inter-continental and intra-continental) and two related native plant species. I found smaller herbivore loads on the exotic plant species than on the related native plants. Moreover, the herbivores on the exotic plants had a higher predator pressure than herbivores on the phylogenetically related native plants. These results imply that both types of exotic plants have a double advantage: enhanced bottom-up and top-down control of herbivores. Finally, I set up a field experiment to test the effect of herbivory on communities of exotic and native plants. I created ten communities with six exotic plant species and their phylogenetically related native species that co-occur in the same riverine habitat. Half of the communities were exposed to herbivory and the other half was grown in a herbivory-free environment. This study was done in order to test if exotic plants may dominate invaded plant communities exposed to aboveground herbivory and if this advantage of the exotic plants under herbivory would disappear when all plants were free of herbivores. Herbivory reduced aboveground plant biomass by almost half. However, exotic plants did not become the exclusive dominants in these communities, as some native species were well protected against aboveground herbivory as well. Plant species varied considerably in their responses to herbivory resulting in changes in community ranking. Interestingly, the proportional biomass contributions to the community were similar for exotic and native plant species and also not different between inter –and intra-continental plants. I conclude that release from aboveground enemies is not the only factor explaining the invasive success of intra- and inter-continental exotic plant species. In conclusion, climate warming-induced range expanding plant species originating from the same continent may possess invasive properties comparable to introduced inter-continental exotic plants. In the greenhouse and in the field, both inter- and intra-continental exotic plant species were more resistant against aboveground herbivores than native plants. In the greenhouse, the exotic plants suffered less from herbivory than related natives, although this did not result in their absolute dominance in the field when exposed to herbivory. Therefore, aboveground enemy exposure is not the only factor predicting the invasive success of intra- and inter-continental exotic plant species...|$|E
40|$|Burning {{of fossil}} fuels has raised the level of {{atmospheric}} carbon dioxide, which contributes to global climate warming. As a result the mean earth surface temperature has increased faster in the past decades {{than in the previous}} thousands of years before. This rapid climate warming together with habitat fragmentation and other land use changes puts a major pressure on many plants and animals. They should either adapt to the warmer climate conditions or disperse in order to keep up with their optimal climatic conditions. Range expansion brings new interactions within the ecosystem in the new range. This can lead to potential benefits, for example range shifting species that do not encounter natural enemies in the new range might become invasive. Although invasive species are a well-studied phenomenon, there is relatively little known about the general mechanisms of biological invasions under climate change. In this thesis I focus on plant species that expand range due to current climate warming. I examined how these range-expanding plants interact with aboveground herbivorous insects and - mostly - how they establish belowground interactions with components of the soil food web. I examined how these interactions in the new range {{may play a role in}} the successful establishment of climate change induced range-expanding plants in plant communities of the new range. The focus of my study was on riverine (riparian) areas along the great rivers in the Netherlands, which are well connected with southern Europe by the Rhine and Rhine-Danube canal.                      In the first experiment we examined exotic plant exposure to aboveground and belowground enemies. We used plants that originated from Eurasia (intra-continental <b>range</b> <b>expanders)</b> and plants that originated from other continents (inter-continental <b>range</b> <b>expanders).</b> We compared these exotic plants with phylogenetically related natives. We grew the plants with and without non-coevolved polyphagous (generalist) herbivores, a locust Schistocerca gregaria and an aphid Myzus persicae. We also exposed all plants to a general soil community from the invaded range and compared their plant-soil feedback responses. Then I tested how individual plants responded to aboveground and belowground plant enemies and I compared this to their combined effects. I also tested whether the strength of aboveground control by generalist shoot-feeding insects was indicative of the strength of belowground control by plant-soil feedback.             In the next study I examined how the soil nematode community from the new range responds to exotic plant species compared to related native plants species. As a follow up, I determined the rhizosphere community composition of bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and fusaria. All groups of microbes were analyzed qualitatively and the non-mycorrhizal fungal biomass and fusaria were also analyzed quantitatively. I tested the hypothesis that range-expanding plant species have a different rhizosphere microbial community composition than natives.             Finally, I compared the early establishment of range-expanding exotics and phylogenetically related plant species that are native in the invaded habitats. In a greenhouse I grew five range-expanding plant species and five related natives in sterilized and non-sterile inoculated soils from the new range, both alone and with a background community of plant species present in the invaded habitat. In the field, I grew the same plants species in artificially created sparse and dense plant communities. I tested whether range-expanding exotic plant species establish better under competition with native vegetation than phylogenetically related natives, because exotics may benefit from less negative interactions with the soil community compared to natives...|$|R
40|$|Climate change enables range {{expansions}} of plants, {{animals and}} microbes to higher altitudes and latitudes. Plants {{may benefit from}} range expansion when they escape from natural enemies. However, range expansion becomes a disadvantage when plants become disconnected from organisms that control enemies in the new range. Here, we examined nematode control in the root zone of range-expanding plant species and congeneric natives. In a greenhouse, we determined bottom-up (by the plants) and top-down (by natural enemies of the nematodes) control of two root-feeding nematode species (Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus and Meloidogyne hapla) in the rhizospheres of two range-expanding plant species, Centaurea stoebe and Geranium pyrenaicum, and two congeneric natives, Centaurea jacea and Geranium molle. Pots with plants growing in sterilized soil were inoculated with either a microbial soil community from the newly colonized natural habitat, a mixture of native microbial nematode antagonists, {{or a combination of}} these two communities. We tested the hypotheses that bottom-up control of root-feeding nematodes would be strongest in the root zone of <b>range</b> <b>expanders</b> and that top-down control would be strongest in the root zone of native plant species. We observed profound intra- and interspecific differences in bottom-up and top-down control among all four plant species. Bottom-up control by the range-expanding plant species was either strong or weak. Top-down control by microbes was strongest in native Centaurea. The addition of a mixture of both microbial communities reduced control of M. hapla in the root zones of the native plant species, and enhanced its control in the root zones of range-expanding plant species. We conclude that there was species-specific bottom-up and top-down control of root-feeding nematodes among the four plant species tested. Range-expanding plant species influenced their microbial rhizosphere community differently compared to native plant species, but top-down control in the root zone of natives was not systematically superior to that of range-shifting plant species...|$|R

40|$|A thermo-economic {{model has}} been built and {{validated}} for prediction of project economics of Enhanced Geothermal Projects. The thermo-economic model calculates and iteratively optimizes the LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) for a prospective EGS (Enhanced Geothermal) site. It {{takes into account the}} local subsurface temperature gradient, the cost of drilling and reservoir creation, stimulation and power plant configuration. It calculates and optimizes the power plant configuration vs. well depth. Thus outputs from the model include optimal well depth and power plant configuration for the lowest LCOE. The main focus of this final report was to experimentally validate the thermodynamic properties that formed the basis of the thermo-economic model built in Phase 2, and thus build confidence that the predictions of the model could be used reliably for process downselection and preliminary design at a given set of geothermal (and/or waste heat) boundary conditions. The fluid and cycle downselected was based on a new proprietary fluid from a vendor in a supercritical ORC cycle at a resource condition of 200 �C inlet temperature. The team devised and executed a series of experiments to prove the suitability of the new fluid in realistic ORC cycle conditions. Furthermore, the team performed a preliminary design study for a MW-scale turbo expander that would be used for a supercritical ORC cycle with this new fluid. The following summarizes the main findings in the investigative campaign that was undertaken: 1. Chemical compatibility of the new fluid with common seal/gasket/Oring materials was found to be problematic. Neoprene, Viton, and silicone materials were found to be incompatible, suffering chemical decomposition, swelling and/or compression set issues. Of the materials tested, only TEFLON was found to be compatible under actual ORC temperature and pressure conditions. 2. Thermal stability of the new fluid at 200 �C and 40 bar was found to be acceptable after 399 hours of exposure?only 3 % of the initial charge degraded into by products. The main degradation products being an isomer and a dimer. 3. In a comparative experiment between R 245 fa and the new fluid under subcritical conditions, {{it was found that the}} new fluid operated at 1 bar lower than R 245 fa for the same power output, which was also predicted in the Aspen HSYSY model. As a drop-in replacement fluid for R 245 fa, this new fluid was found to be at least as good as R 245 fa in terms of performance and stability. Further optimization of the subcritical cycle may lead to a significant improvement in performance for the new fluid. 4. For supercritical conditions, the experiment found a good match between the measured and model predicted state point property data and duties from the energy balance. The largest percent differences occurred with densities and evaporator duty (see Figure 78). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the state point model was experimentally validated with a realistic ORC system. 5. The team also undertook a preliminary turbo-expander design study for a supercritical ORC cycle with the new working fluid. Variants of radial and axial turbo expander geometries went through preliminary design and rough costing. It was found that at 15 MWe or higher power rating, a multi-stage axial turbine is most suitable providing the best performance and cost. However, at lower power ratings in the 5 MWe <b>range,</b> the <b>expander</b> technology to be chosen depends on the application of the power block. For EGS power blocks, it is most optimal to use multi-stage axial machines. In conclusion, the predictions of the LCOE model that showed a supercritical cycle based on the new fluid to be most advantageous for geothermal power production at a resource temperature of ~ 200 C have been experimentally validated. It was found that the cycle based on the new fluid is lower in LCOE and higher in net power output (for the same boundary conditions). The project, therefore has found a new optimal configuration for low temperature geothermal power production in the form of a supercritical ORC cycle based on a new vendor fluid...|$|R
