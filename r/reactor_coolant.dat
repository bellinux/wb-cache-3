5|$|Ikata is {{the site}} of Shikoku's only nuclear power plant. The Ikata Nuclear Power Plant has two Mitsubishi 538 MWe Pressurized Water Reactor units with the Two <b>Reactor</b> <b>Coolant</b> Loop design (similar to the {{original}} Westinghouse design at Prairie Island, Kewaunee, and Point Beach plants) and one Mitsubishi Pressurized Water Reactor unit with the Three <b>Reactor</b> <b>Coolant</b> Loop design (similar to the Westinghouse Surry, North Anna, and Robinson plants). Units 1 and 2 started up on September 30, 1977 and March 19, 1981 respectively. Unit 3 is a three loop PWR rated at 846 MWe that started up on December 15, 1994.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
5|$|In {{the short}} time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford {{engineers}} produced many significant technological advances. As {{no one had ever}} built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, DuPont engineers installed ammonia-based refrigeration systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lithium-6 {{is valued}} {{as a source}} {{material}} for tritium production and as a neutron absorber in nuclear fusion. Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons. Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>coolants.</b>|$|R

5|$|The film Dr. No was {{released}} in 1962, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and directed by Terence Young. It was the first Bond film in the Eon Productions series; Sean Connery portrayed Bond, with Joseph Wiseman as Doctor No and Ursula Andress as Honeychile Rider. Although the story follows the same general storyline, there are some changes: the film shows No to be an operative of the fictional crime organisation SPECTRE and his island fortress is nuclear-powered; No is killed not by the mountain of guano, but by drowning in <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant.</b> The novel was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in May 2008. The actor Toby Stephens played Bond, while No was played by David Suchet.|$|E
5|$|During the series' fifty-year history {{only a few}} of {{the films}} have {{remained}} substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a giant squid, and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{accidents}} was the Three Mile Island incident in Middleton, Pennsylvania in 1979. Believed today to have been caused mostly by human error, a partial-meltdown occurred when a valve was left open, letting out substantial amounts of <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 1989, an {{impeller}} blade {{on one of}} the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps in Unit 3 broke at a weld, causing a large amount of metal debris to flow throughout the primary loop. As a result, the reactor was shut down for a considerable length of time.|$|E

25|$|A {{molten salt}} reactor (MSR) is {{a class of}} {{generation}} IV nuclear fission reactor in which the primary nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant,</b> or even the fuel itself, is a molten salt mixture. MSRs can run at higher temperatures than water-cooled reactors for a higher thermodynamic efficiency, while staying at low vapour pressure.|$|E
25|$|After almost 80minutes of slow {{temperature}} rise, {{the primary}} loop's four main <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps began to cavitate as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, {{and it was}} believed that natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. About 130minutes after the first malfunction, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the Zircaloy nuclear fuel rod cladding, yielding zirconium dioxide, hydrogen, and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant,</b> and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|The release {{occurred}} when the cladding was damaged while the pilot-operated relief valve was still stuck open. Fission products were released into the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant.</b> Since the pilot-operated relief valve was stuck open {{and the loss of}} coolant accident was still in progress, primary coolant with fission products and/or fuel was released, and ultimately ended up in the auxiliary building. The auxiliary building was outside the containment boundary.|$|E

25|$|With {{the steam}} {{generators}} no longer receiving feedwater, heat and pressure {{increased in the}} <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> system, causing the reactor to perform an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Within eight seconds, control rods were inserted into the core to halt the nuclear chain reaction. The reactor continued to generate decay heat and, because steam was no longer {{being used by the}} turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.|$|E
25|$|The nuclear {{steam supply}} for each unit was {{designed}} and supplied by Combustion Engineering, designated the System 80 standard design–a predecessor of the newer standard System 80+ design. Each primary system originally supplied 3.817GW of thermal power to the secondary (steam) side of each plant. The design is a so-called 2×4, with each of four main <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps circulating more than 111,000 gallons per minute of primary-side water through 2 large steam generators.|$|E
25|$|A nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> — usually {{water but}} {{sometimes}} a gas or a liquid metal (like liquid sodium) or molten salt — is circulated past the reactor core {{to absorb the}} heat that it generates. The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the turbines, like the pressurized water reactor. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the reactor core; for example the boiling water reactor.|$|E
40|$|Magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) {{principle}} {{is an important}} interdisciplinary field. One {{of the most important}} applications of this effect is pumping of materials that are hard to pump using conventional pumps. In this work, the progress achieved in this field is surveyed and organized according to the type of application. The literature of the past 27  years is searched for the major developments of MHD applications. MHD seawater thrusters are promising for a variety of applications requiring high flow rates and velocity. MHD molten metal pump is important replacement to conventional pumps because their moving parts cannot stand the molten metal temperature. MHD molten salt pump is used for nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>coolants</b> due to its no-moving-parts feature. Nanofluid MHD pumping is a promising technology especially for bioapplications. Advantages of MHD include silence due to no-moving-parts propulsion.

50|$|The Jules Horowitz Reactor is a {{materials}} testing reactor, with a {{power output}} of approximately 100 megawatts. It has a planned service lifespan of around 50 years, and {{is designed to be}} adaptable for a variety of research uses by nuclear utilities, nuclear steam system suppliers, nuclear fuel manufacturers, research organisations and safety authorities. The reactor's versatile modular design allows it to accommodate up to 20 simultaneous experiments. Its instrumentation allows previously unavailable real-time analysis to be performed. Its primary uses will be research into the performance of nuclear fuel at existing reactors, testing of materials used in reactors, testing designs for fuel for future reactors and the production of radioisotopes for use in medicine. The reactor is intended to produce radioisotopes in coordination with existing production facilities at Petten in the Netherlands. The <b>reactor's</b> <b>coolant</b> flow is ascending, in the order of nearly 2.36 m3/s, with maximum pressure in the order of 1.0-1.5 MPa, depending on the required flow and the core head loss.|$|R
50|$|In US nuclear {{submarine}} propulsion, full speed is 50% reactor power. Flank speed is 100% power, although limits may {{be reached for}} the propulsion turbine first stage pressure or for reactor thermal power (in MW) (depending upon {{the specifics of the}} individual propulsion plant) before 100% reactor power is reached. In addition, for flank speed, the <b>reactor's</b> main <b>coolant</b> pumps must also be shifted into fast speed.|$|R
25|$|The {{accident}} {{began with}} {{failures in the}} non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> to escape. The mechanical failures were compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident due to inadequate training and human factors, such as human-computer interaction design oversights relating to ambiguous control room indicators in the power plant's user interface. In particular, a hidden indicator light led to an operator manually overriding the automatic emergency cooling system of the reactor because the operator mistakenly believed that {{there was too much}} coolant water present in the reactor and causing the steam pressure release.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 2012, the Byron Unit 2 {{was shut}} down and {{depressurized}} after a failed insulator in the plant's switchyard caused the loss of one phase to the plant's startup transformers. This caused low voltage conditions on the plant's emergency power buses and also {{for two of the}} <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps to trip which caused the plant to shut down. The trip of the plant then caused the other two <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps to trip (as they had been receiving power directly from the main generator) and natural circulation had to be used during the shutdown. When operators discovered the loss of the single phase, they manually tripped the breaker feeding the startup transformers, allowing the emergency diesel generators to start and restore normal voltages to the safety buses. Steam was vented from the non-radioactive, secondary side of the plant to aid in the cooling process while the turbines remained offline. A small amount of radioactive tritium was released into the local environment during the initial venting procedure, but was deemed no threat to the public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A similar insulator failure occurred at Unit 1 on February 29 again affecting the unit's startup transformers. In this case the breaker feeding the transformers tripped automatically and the emergency diesel generators immediately started up to restore power to the safety buses. Additionally, all of the non-safety power generation buses transferred to the unit auxiliary transformers, which receive power from the plant's turbine generator, preventing a trip of the plant. After this second failed insulator event, Exelon took both units offline and replaced all of the insulators in the plant's switchyard.|$|E
25|$|In PWRs reactor {{power can}} be viewed as {{following}} steam (turbine) demand due to the reactivity feedback of the temperature change caused by increased or decreased steam flow. (See: Negative temperature coefficient.) Boron and control rods are used to maintain primary system temperature at the desired point. In order to decrease power, the operator throttles shut turbine inlet valves. This would result in less steam being drawn from the steam generators. This results in the primary loop increasing in temperature. The higher temperature causes the density of the primary <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> water to decrease, allowing higher neutron speeds, thus less fission and decreased power output. This decrease of power will eventually result in primary system temperature returning to its previous steady-state value. The operator can control the steady state operating temperature by addition of boric acid and/or movement of control rods.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{circulation}} was {{a necessary}} ability considered for the <b>reactor.</b> As <b>coolant</b> lithium-6 was chosen based on temperature requirement and its boiling point (1615 K=1342 °C) being higher than either Sodium (882 °C) or Potassium (757 °C). Another reason is the generation of Helium gas by reaction (n, α) as well as serving as a neutron absorber. This required the ability to remove and extract Helium.|$|R
50|$|From the <b>reactor,</b> the <b>coolant</b> flow is {{distributed}} to {{three of four}} identical heat exchanger and circulation pump combinations, each located in a separate cell adjacent to the reactor and storage pools. Each cell also contains a letdown valve that controls the primary coolant pressure. A secondary coolant system removes heat from the primary system and transfers it to the atmosphere by passing water over a four-cell induced-draft cooling tower.|$|R
