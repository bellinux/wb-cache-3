40|$|ABSTRACT—Ritualized {{behavior}} {{is characteristic of}} obses-sive-compulsive disorder (OCD), {{but it is also}} observed in other, nonclinical contexts such as children’s routines and cultural ceremonies. Such behaviors are best understood with reference to a set of human vigilance–precaution systems in charge of monitoring potential danger and motivating the organism toward appropriate precautions. <b>Ritualized</b> <b>behavior</b> focuses attention on low-level repre-sentations of actions, probably leading to some measure of intrusion suppression.

40|$|Humans {{throughout}} history and across cultures have disposed of dead bodies without just abandoning them. Frequently, these disposals have involved specific ritualized actions. In the majority. of cases {{the disposal of}} corpses involves religious ritualized actions. In this thesis, I argue that the strong tendency and perhaps even compulsion to dispose of dead bodies in ritualized ways generally, and religious ritualized ways specifically, occurs {{as a consequence of}} the evolved cognitive architecture ofhuman minds. By examining the archival records on the paleontological, archaeological, ethnographic and historical evidence of early disposal behavior by humans, as well as looking closely at early Indian Buddhist practices, and paying attention to modem Buddhist mortuary rites, I attempt to make the case, from the perspective of cognitive and evolutionary psychology, that several mental systems seem to be activated by dead bodies and that the aCtivation of the cognitive systems leads to humans perfonning religiously <b>ritualized</b> <b>behaviors</b> cross-culturally. These same mental systems, moreover, constrain the variation of mortuary rituals seen in various cultures. In pursuit of a scientific explanation ofwhy it is that humans dispose of dead bodies in the various ways that they do, I have gone beyond examining textual evide. nce by devising instruments to measure individual responses to dead bodies, and to theorize that specific cognitive systems are activated by such stimuli. I examine closely the data generated by the experimental studies and suggest a way of modeling the systems involved. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this course}} is to offer {{students}} {{a look at how}} anthropologists approach the study of Japan through the topics of ritual and pandemonium. Ritual is often thought of in religious contexts, but in fact humans engage in rituals all the time. For example, we speak of morning or bedtime “rituals. ” On the other hand, we might think of pandemonium as the antithesis of ritual —the constant threat of chaos that lingers beneath our rules, customs, and patterns of behavior. Moreover, within the constantly evolving forms of what social theorists have labeled “modernity” <b>ritualized</b> <b>behaviors</b> appear, disappear, and transform, thus the potential for pandemonium is never far away. In this course we will use anthropological concepts and theories to examine cultures and behaviors in the modern nation of Japan through the conceptual lenses of ritual and pandemonium. Through readings, films, and discussions we will focus on several areas of modern Japanese life, including: customs, traditions, and expectations; mischief and play; family; community and nation; and the environment. Students will learn to think critically about these topics and to convey their thinking through class discussions, written papers, and oral presentations.

This paper argues that, in the context of recent theoretical developments in anthropology and cognitive psychology, Thorstein Veblen's work on the place of science in modern societies can provide a theoretical framework to study public misgiving toward embryology in the United States. It is argued that combining insights regarding human cognitive predisposition toward ritualization offered by Veblen with evolutionary theory on hazard-precaution systems and religious cognition may shed some light on the "peculiarity" of the initial public responses to embryology. Ultimately, this paper contends that understanding that initial reactions to embryology may follow a cognitive path of least resistance signifies that assessing the legitimacy of embryology will necessitate a deliberate effort toward instrumental thinking that may go against human cognitive predispositions. cognitive systems, embryology, institutionalism, <b>ritualized</b> <b>behavior,...</b>|$|E

From January 1991 to June 1993, we observed 54 coyotes (Canis latrans) for 2507 h in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, during which we observed 112 instances of territory defense. The identity of the coyotes involved in challenging and evicting intruding animals was known. Alpha coyotes {{were most likely to}} be involved in territorial evictions of intruding animals, followed by beta individuals; pups participated little in territory defense. Coyotes evicting intruders generally had a numerical advantage when challenging the intruders. Territory-defense rates were highest during and immediately after the breeding season and during the time of pup emergence from the den. All chases of intruders ended at the boundary of the resident coyote pack’s territory. Physical contact between the intruding animal and resident pack members occurred with no intruders being killed or seriously injured. Physical contact consisted of fighting and <b>ritualized</b> <b>behaviors,</b> with only a few instances in which fighting led to blood being drawn or minor injuries to the intruder. Most encounters resulted in a hasty retreat from the area by the intruder(s). While indirect means of territory maintenance (i. e., howling and scent-marking) were utilized by resident packs, trespassing still occurred and direct confrontation was needed to enforce boundaries and assert occupancy against other resident packs, as well as against lone intruders seeking territory vacancies. Territoriality was advantageous in that territory holders generally had higher survival rates (except pups), contributed all the reproductive effort to the population, and had greater access to food resources. In contrast, non-territorial animals had lower survival rates, did not breed, and had reduced access to food (ungulate carcasses) during winter...|$|R

40|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder with the pathology of α-synuclein aggregation in Lewy bodies. Currently, there is no available therapy that arrests the progression of the disease. Therefore, the need of animal models to follow α-synuclein aggregation is crucial. Drosophila melanogaster {{has been researched extensively}} as a good genetic model for the disease, with a cognitive phenotype of defective climbing ability. The assay for climbing ability has been demonstrated as an effective tool for screening new therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease. However, due to the assay's many limitations, there is a clear need to develop a better behavioral test. Courtship, a stereotyped, <b>ritualized</b> <b>behavior</b> of Drosophila, involves complex motor and sensory functions in both sexes, which are controlled by large number of neurons; hence, behavior observed during courtship should be sensitive to disease processes in the nervous system. We used a series of traits commonly observed in courtship and an additional behavioral trait—nonsexual encounters—and analyzed them using a data mining tool. We found defective behavior of the Parkinson's model male flies that were tested with virgin females, visible at a much younger age than the climbing defects. We conclude that this is an improved behavioral assay for Parkinson's model flies...|$|E
