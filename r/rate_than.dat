5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{fluctuations in}} the decades immediately after the independence of India, the economies of South Indian states have registered growth {{higher than the national}} average over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some of the socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region as it does the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years.

The data show that education does make a difference. College-educated young blacks have higher employment <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> less-educated blacks.

5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> endometrial biopsy.|$|E

As Stegosaurus was larger than Kentrosaurus, this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Most bats are homeothermic, the {{exception}} being the Vespertilionidae, the Rhinolophidae and the Miniopteridae which extensively use heterothermy. Compared to other mammals, bats {{have a high}} thermal conductivity. Body heat is mainly lost through the wings as they are filled with blood vessels, {{but they may be}} used as an insulator while resting. By wrapping their wings around themselves, they can trap a layer of still air around themselves. Smaller bats generally have a higher metabolic <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> larger bats, and so need to consume more food in order to maintain homeothermy.|$|E

At the Mile Post, Oxford had cut the lead to half a length, but were forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision with river traffic.|$|E
5|$|Pairs may {{breed in}} {{isolation}} or in loose colonies, and will readily use nest boxes. In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types, but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete, perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1.5°C warmer than their wooden counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream {{at a much higher}} <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> normal tissue would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into {{the area of the}} hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.|$|E
