40|$|High {{intensity}} {{discharge lamps}} are typically operated at low frequency {{to avoid damage}} from acoustic resonance. Accordingly, an electronic ballast normally comprises a buck converter to control the lamp current magnitude and a full-bridge to commutate the lamp current at a low frequency. In such a system, the negative dynamic lamp characteristic may interact with the power electronic driver may give a poorly damped response, sometimes resulting in an oscillatory lamp current. Furthermore, lamp aging and reduced power mode operation both tend to increase <b>re-ignition</b> <b>voltage</b> overshoot, which in turn may lead to reduced lifetime, or prematurely extinguishing lamps. In the present paper, a procedure for obtaining the small-signal dynamic characteristics of metal halide lamps is proposed. Using this dynamic model, the lamp-ballast interaction is simulated and analyzed. A fuzzy-logic control method is presented to cope with nonlinear behavior and improve the lamp-ballast performance. The simulation results are verified with practical measurements on a laboratory prototyp...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Capacitive current {{interruption}} with air-break disconnectors in a high-voltage {{network is}} an interactive event between circuit and arc {{with a variety}} of interruptions and re-ignitions. In order to investigate this transient phenomenon, a series of interruption tests was performed at KEMA High Power Laboratory. In this paper, a brief analysis of the interruption process is presented and is compared with experimental data from the test. Typical wave shapes of voltages across the capacitances, disconnector and current through the disconnector are given. <b>Re-ignition</b> <b>voltage</b> and energy input to the arc on re-ignition are also investigated. Comparison shows that the test data are in good agreement with simulation. It is concluded that besides higher interruption current and higher power supply level, a lower ratio between source side and load side capacitance leads to more severe interruption and longer arc duration. In the end, the actual status of IEC recommendations on testing, that has taken into account this arc-circuit interaction, will be discussed.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to find a}} {{correlation}} between contact gap length and switching be-havior of a vacuum circuit breaker. A large number of interruption experiments was executed in a vacuum chamber with butt type contacts made of Cu, CuCr 50 / 50 and AgWC. The currents to be interrupted varied from 2. 5 to 32 kA. The rate of change of current and recovery voltage were kept at a fixed value at current zero. Many re-ignitions of the dielectric type, scattered over a wide range of re-ignition voltages, were observed and {{only a few of the}} thermal type. The total amount of energy dissipated in the vacuum chamber appears to be determinative for the type of re-ignition. On Cu severe anode spot melting was found, whereas CuCr and AgWC suffered little anode melting. The wide range of <b>re-ignition</b> <b>voltage</b> values found shows that a straight correlation with the contact gap length can not be defined. At 5 to 10 ps after current zero a 'second ' post arc current did appear. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{explores the}} role of PTFE ablation in enhancing current interruption for various background gases in high voltage circuit breakers. An assessment of the current interruption capability {{has been made in}} terms of the arcing duration and the contact gap length at which critical arc extinction is achieved. These observations are supported by measurements of the magnitude of extinction and <b>re-ignition</b> <b>voltage</b> peaks. Most previous and other current experimental work on gas filled circuit breaker design follows conventional wisdom in investigating arcing behaviours at elevated gas pressures (usually up to 6 bar). But in this work we concentrate on the effects of using low gas pressures (less than 1 bar) {{in the presence of a}} close-fitting shield of ablatant polymer material (PTFE) that surrounds the electrode assembly of an experimental high power circuit breaker. We demonstrate that for several different gases, arc extinction capability compares well under these conditions with SF 6, suggesting that SF 6 could be replaced entirely in this novel system by more environmentally friendly gases. Moreover, the critical contact gap lengths at extinction are only slightly greater than when using SF 6 at 6 bar. Weight loss measurements from the ablatant shield suggest that a chemical puffer action is the most likely mechanism for achieving the observed arc extinctions in this system...|$|E
40|$|The {{re-ignition}} characteristics (variation of <b>re-ignition</b> <b>voltage</b> {{with time}} after current zero) of short alternating current arcs between plane brass electrodes in air were studied by observing the average re-ignition voltages {{on the screen}} of a cathode-ray oscilloscope and controlling the rates of rise of voltage by varying the shunting capacitance and hence the natural period of oscillation of the reactors used to limit the current. The shape of these characteristics and the effects on them of varying the electrode separation, air pressure, and current strength were determined. The results show that short arc spaces recover dielectric strength in two distinct stages. The first stage agrees in shape and magnitude with a previously developed theory that all voltage is concentrated across a partially deionized space charge layer which increases its breakdown voltage with diminishing density of ionization in the field-tree space. The second stage appears to follow complete deionization by the electric field due to displacement of the field-free region by the space charge layer, its magnitude and shape appearing to be due simply to increase in gas density due to cooling. Temperatures calculated from this second stage and ion densities determined from the first stage {{by means of the}} space charge equation and an extrapolation of the temperature curve are consistent with recent measurements of arc value by other methods. Analysis or the decrease with time of the apparent ion density shows that diffusion alone is adequate to explain the results and that volume recombination is not. The effects on the characteristics of variations in the parameters investigated are found to be in accord with previous results and with the theory if deionization mainly by diffusion be assumed. </p...|$|E
