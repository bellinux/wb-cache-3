25|$|Alcohol's {{rewarding}} {{and reinforcing}} (i.e., addictive) properties are mediated through {{its effects on}} dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic <b>reward</b> <b>pathway,</b> which connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). One of alcohol's primary effects is the allosteric inhibition of NMDA receptors and facilitation of GABAA receptors (e.g., enhanced GABAA receptor-mediated chloride flux through allosteric regulation of the receptor). At high doses, ethanol inhibits most ligand gated ion channels and voltage gated ion channels in neurons as well. Alcohol inhibits sodium-potassium pumps in the cerebellum and this is likely how it impairs cerebellar computation and body co-ordination.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{of abuse}} {{typically}} affect the mesolimbic system, or more specifically, the <b>reward</b> <b>pathway</b> {{of the nervous}} system. Amongst the common drugs of abuse, nicotine {{is one of the}} strongest agonists at the nicotinic cholinergic synapse. Nicotine, competing with acetylcholine (ACh), acts through the nonsynaptic, preterminal, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) to initiate a membrane potential change and propagate an intracellular Ca2+ signal, thus encouraging the release of neurotransmitters. The specific and characteristic role of calcium current mediated nAChR activity has a different voltage-dependence than other Ca2+ permeable ion channels, as well as different temporal and spatial distribution and as a result, the nonsynaptic nAChR activity enhances the induction of synaptic potentiation, promoting the learning of substance dependence.|$|E
25|$|The North American microtine rodent's (vole) {{complex social}} {{structure}} and social behavior has provided unique opportunities {{to study the}} underlying neural bases for monogamy and social attachment. Data from studies using the Microtis ochrogaster or prairie vole indicate that the neuroendocrine hormones, oxytocin (in female prairie voles) and vasopressin (in male prairie voles) {{play a central role}} in the development of affiliative connections during mating. The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of oxytocin and vasopressin have been shown to promote affiliative behavior in the prairie vole but not in similar, but non-monogamous montane voles. This difference in neuropeptide effect is attributed to the location, density, and distribution of OT and AVP receptors. Only in the prairie voles are OT and AVP receptors located along the mesolimbic dopamine <b>reward</b> <b>pathway,</b> presumably conditioning the voles to their mates odor while consolidating the social memory of the mating episode. This finding highlights the role of genetic evolution in altering the neuroanatomical distribution of receptors, resulting in certain neural circuits becoming sensitive to changes in neuropeptides.|$|E

40|$|The {{consumption}} of glucose can enhance executive control by increasing blood glucose and providing energy for brain processes. However, a glucose mouth rinse also positively affects executive {{control in the}} absence of an effect on blood glucose. This observation suggests that glucose can enhance executive control via another mechanism, perhaps by increasing cortical activation in motivational <b>reward</b> <b>pathways.</b> This hypothesis was examined in the current study by having participants consume fructose, glucose or a placebo 10 minutes before solving word anagrams. Fructose was used because it does not affect blood glucose levels, inhibits cortical responding, and cannot entrain a taste preference post-ingestion. The latter evidences that fructose differs from glucose in its ability to elicit activation in motivational <b>reward</b> <b>pathways.</b> It was observed that consuming fructose and glucose resulted in the resolution of more anagrams than the placebo. These results suggest that at least some of the effects of glucose and fructose on problem solving operate through a common peripheral mechanism that is independent of motivational <b>reward</b> <b>pathways.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) {{provided}} {{the first evidence}} for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In their research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006, they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic <b>reward</b> <b>pathway,</b> a primitive {{part of the brain}} that usually responds to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable. One brain region, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain, contributes to learning altruistic behavior, especially in those with trait empathy. The same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding.|$|E

2500|$|Dopamine is {{the primary}} {{neurotransmitter}} involved in the <b>reward</b> <b>pathway</b> in the brain. Thus, drugs that increase dopamine signaling may produce euphoric effects. Many recreational drugs, such as cocaine and substituted amphetamines, inhibit the dopamine transporter (DAT), the protein responsible for removing dopamine from the neural synapse. When DAT activity is blocked, the synapse floods with dopamine and increases dopaminergic signaling. When this occurs, particularly in the nucleus accumbens, increased D1 and decreased D2 receptor signaling mediates the [...] "rewarding" [...] stimulus of drug intake.|$|E
50|$|The {{islands of}} Calleja are {{directly}} connected {{with some of}} the major reward centers of the brain. By receiving dopamine inputs from the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area, the islands become one of the many regions that process the rewarding feelings associated with this neurotransmitter. The interactions of the islands with the amygdala aid in processing how the body remembers the feelings associated with the release of dopamine. Opioids and amphetamines take advantage of the <b>reward</b> <b>pathways</b> in that they influence greater releases of dopamine and other neurotransmitters that reinforce the feelings associated with the administration and effects of the drugs. The islands of Calleja become more involved with substances administered through the nose, due to the island's involvement in both olfaction and the <b>reward</b> <b>pathways.</b>|$|R

Nicotine is a highly addictive substance which works on the dopaminergic <b>reward</b> <b>pathways</b> of the brain. In this thesis we will explore the interaction and link between nicotine action in the VTA and endocannabinoid modulation of this action, and how this relates to addition. There is also some evidence that suggests that nicotine may facilitate certain aspects of cognition such as attention, while evidence suggests that cannabinoids impede it. We will therefore further explore if there is a relation between these two with respect to attention, and whether nicotine’s action on attention is related to its addictive potential...|$|R

40|$|Many {{elements}} of animal behaviour are organised by an innate reward-seeking drive stemming from neurobiological reward systems. The behavioural concept of reward and its neurobiological substrates was initially developed in mammalian systems, {{and there it}} has become clear that several novel social behaviours evolved through the co-option of <b>reward</b> <b>pathways.</b> Only more recently has reward been explored in insects. In this review, we consider current knowledge about <b>reward</b> <b>pathways</b> in the two predominant insect models: Drosophila melanogaster and the honey bee Apis mellifera. These two models are phylogenetically distantly related and have vastly different ecologies: fruit flies are mostly solitary while honey bees live in complex societies involving social foraging and brood care. Initially, it was assumed the reward system was essentially similar between these two organisms, but more recent studies have appeared to highlight quite significant differences. Here, we critically evaluate apparent differences in the neurobiology of the reward system between these organisms. We discuss which differences may be real and which may be reflective of the very different modes of analysis applied in these two models. Finally, we discuss how modification of reward systems might have contributed to social evolution in insects. 38 page(s...|$|R
