40|$|The genetic {{relationships}} between two Finno-Ugric-speaking populations, the Finns and the Finnish Saami (Lapps), were studied by using PCR for six nuclear-DNA marker loci, mitochondrial restriction-site polymorphism, and sequence variation of a 360 -bp {{segment of the}} mitochondrial control region. The allele frequencies {{of each of the}} nuclear-DNA marker loci and the frequencies of mtDNA restriction haplotypes were significantly different between the populations. The Saami showed exceptionally low variation in their mtDNA restriction sites. The 9 -bp deletion common in East Asian populations was not observed, nor did the haplotype data fit into the haplogroup categorization of Torroni et al. The average number of nucleotide substitutions from the mtDNA haplotype data indicated that the Finnish Saami may be closer to the Finns than to the other <b>reference</b> <b>populations,</b> whereas nuclear DNA suggested that the Finns are more closely related to the European <b>reference</b> <b>populations</b> than to the Finnish Saami. The similarity of the Finns to the other Europeans was even more pronounced according to the sequence data.

The Finnish Saami are distinct from other Circumarctic populations, although two of the lineages found among the Saami showed closer relationship to the Circumarctic than to the European lineages.

Hybridization and admixture patterns were assessed in a contact zone and <b>reference</b> <b>populations</b> of European pine species using sequence data from 26 nuclear genes and a species-diagnostic cpDNA marker. <b>Reference</b> <b>populations</b> formed three distinct genetic clusters comprising Pinus sylvestris, Pinus mugo/Pinus uliginosa, and Pinus uncinata.

Based on phenotypic characteristics and molecular data, we identified five groups of individuals in the contact zone in Poland, comprising forms of the parental species and intermediates that were most probably the result of interspecific crosses. A combination of nuclear gene sequence data and a diagnostic organelle marker were used to show that hybridization is frequent in the contact zone and results in hybrid trees with distinct phenotypic identity. The influence of selection in maintaining hybrid phenotypes in environments unsuited to parental species was inferred from nucleotide polymorphism data. A lack of admixture in <b>reference</b> <b>populations</b> suggests that hybridization has not occurred during post-glacial migration and so the contact zone represents a distinct, active example of ongoing evolution.

40|$|In {{the search}} for common genetic {{variants}} that contribute to prevalent human diseases, patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among linked markers should be considered when selecting SNPs. Genotyping efficiency can be increased by choosing tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) in LD with other SNPs. However, {{it remains to be}} seen whether tagSNPs defined in one population efficiently capture LD in other populations; that is, how portable tagSNPs are. Indeed, tagSNP portability is a challenge for the applicability of HapMap results. We analyzed 144 SNPs in a 1 -Mb region of chromosome 22 in 1055 individuals from 38 worldwide populations, classified into seven continental groups. We measured tagSNP portability by choosing three <b>reference</b> <b>populations</b> (to approximate the three HapMap populations), defining tagSNPs, and applying them to other populations independently on the availability of information on the tagSNPs in the compared population. We found that tagSNPs are highly informative in other populations within each continental group. Moreover, tagSNPs defined in Europeans are often efficient for Middle Eastern and Central/South Asian populations. TagSNPs defined in the three <b>reference</b> <b>populations</b> are also efficient for more distant and differentiated populations (Oceania, Americas), in which the impact of their special demographic history on the genetic structure does not interfere with successfully detecting the most common haplotype variation.

The respective rates in 2013 were IOTF (24. 8 %), WHO (22. 9 %), AGA (18. 2 %), and KiGGS (11. 7 %). Obesity prevalence in 2000 was the highest according to WHO (7. 9 %), followed by AGA (4. 5 %), IOTF (3. 1 %), and KiGGS (1. 8 %).

Populations from three Superfund sites (New Bedford Harbor, MA, Newark Bay, NJ, and Elizabeth River, VA) have independently evolved adaptive resistance to chemical pollutants. In these polluted populations, natural selection likely has altered allele frequencies of loci that affect fitness or that {{are linked to}} these loci. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify loci that exhibit non-neutral behavior in the F. heteroclitus genome in polluted <b>populations</b> versus clean <b>reference</b> <b>populations.</b> Results To detect signatures of natural selection and thus identify genetic bases for adaptation to anthropogenic stressors, we examined allele frequencies for many hundreds of amplified fragment length polymorphism markers among populations of F. heteroclitus. Specifically, we contrasted populations from three Superfund sites (New Bedford Harbor, MA, Newark Bay, NJ, and Elizabeth River, VA) to clean <b>reference</b> <b>populations</b> flanking the polluted sites. When empirical F ST values were compared to a simulated distribution of F ST values, 24 distinct outlier loci were identified among pairwise comparisons of pollutant impacted F. heteroclitus populations and both surrounding <b>reference</b> <b>populations.</b> Upon removal of all outlier loci, there was a strong correlation (R 2 = 0. 79, p 2 = 0. 092, p = 0. 0721). Two outlier loci were shared between New Bedford Harbor and Elizabeth River populations, and two different loci were shared between Newark Bay and Elizabeth River populations. Conclusion In total, 1 % to 6 % of loci are implicated as being under selection or linked to areas of the genome under selection in three F. heteroclitus populations that reside in polluted estuaries. Shared loci among polluted sites indicate that selection may be acting on multiple loci involved in adaptation, and loci shared between polluted sites potentially are involved in a generalized adaptive response. </p...|$|R
