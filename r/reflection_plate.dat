40|$|Summary. Pitching-moment {{derivatives}} {{have been}} measured, using a free-oscillation technique, {{for a series}} of thin tapered wings with both streamwise and raked tips. Wings of three aspect ratios (A. R. = 2. 74, 2. 00 and 1 - 25) were tested with three positions of the pitching axis (h = 0 " 4, 0 - 5 and 0. 6). The Mach number ranged from 1. 38 to 2. 47 and the Reynolds number and frequency parameter were less than 1. 6 x 106 and 0. 03 respectively. Tunnel boundary-layer effects were avoided by the use of <b>reflection</b> <b>plates.</b> A smaller test programme was also carried out on the effects of a body (non-oscillating) in close proximity to the wing with two alternative nose shapes. The theory predicted the trends of the derivative variation with Mach number. The numerical agreement was much improved when allowances were made in the theory for finite thickness of the wings. The effect of the body on the derivatives was very small; the only significant difference found was in the stiffness derivative ath = 0. 4. 1. Introduction.

40|$|Wave filters may be {{employed}} in laboratory facilities to attenuate oscillatory surface waves reflected from a test model, or {{to improve the quality}} of generated waves. When used for these purposes, they are placed between the generator and the test model, usually quite close to the generator. The studies reported herein consisted of experimental tests of the attenuation and <b>reflection</b> characteristics of <b>plate</b> and wire-mesh filters. The results indicated that high attenuations can be achieved with either type filter without serious reflections. The attenuation and reflection depend, in addition to other factors, upon the plate spacing of plate type filters and the porosity of wire-mesh filters. Very dense or closely spaced filters produced high attenuations and high reflections. The best over-all performance was obtained by plate spacings or porosities selected to utilizee a filter length equal to or in excess of the wave length. <b>Reflection</b> produced by <b>plate</b> filters depended, to a considerable extent, on the blockage or reduction in cross-section of the channel, as well as on the ratio of wave length to filter length. <b>Reflections</b> from <b>plate</b> filters were reduced when the filter was constructed of plates of various lengths. The experimental results were compared with available theory. Very good agreement was obtained with the plate-type filter when the spacing was not too small. Brief comparisons between the data on wire-mesh filters and two suggested theories were not successful. The majority of the filter tests were conducted in a relatively small wave channel. limited tests were conducted on wire-mesh filters in a large channel; a comparison of data from the two sources indicated that porosity was not the sole factor affecting the attenuation and that the resistance of the wire mesh probably varied as a function of Reynolds number.

The porous element shows higher detection sensitivity in initial experiments with a coating of silane molecules. The TAS (Te₂As₃Se₅) infrared glass, used as optical sensor in many fields of applications (medicine, environment, etc), exhibits poor mechanical properties rapidly that enable it to be used. Its mechanical properties have been investigated as a function of time and environment. From a general observation, air and vacuum have dramatic effects on TAS fibers tensile strength. When ageing under static stress, they exhibit an increase of tensile strength. The structural relaxation phenomenon is hypothesized to explain these results. The coordination number,, which is a rough measure of the network rigidity, has an influence on the TAS mechanical properties. It is shown that the TAS glass exhibits photosensitive effects. This effect seems to be only a surface effect, not a volume effect in the sense that light has no influence on the kinetic of a stress relaxation experiment. Due to their low glass transition temperature, TAS fibers exhibit viscoelastic behavior at room temperature.

Since sharp edges of such plates (wedges) are always truncated before x= 0, the real reflection coefficients are relatively high, therefore the application of a small amount of damping is required to achieve large reductions in vibration amplitude. This paper presents a numerical model of a plate incorporating an acoustic black hole wedge, with predictions for vibration amplitudes. These are compared to equivalent experimental measurements for a range of applied damping layers. It is concluded that the above-mentioned power-law wedges can be used as effective vibration dampers in plate structures over a wide frequency range of interest. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
