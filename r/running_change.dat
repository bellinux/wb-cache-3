25|$|The SV8 was the {{mid-range}} sports variant, and was {{priced from}} A$41,990. Early VZ {{versions of the}} SV8 continued with the VY SV8 theme, being essentially an Executive with a V8 engine, rear spoiler, unique 17inch alloy wheels and SV6 tail lights. This specification was later upgraded as a <b>running</b> <b>change</b> to match the equipment levels and appearance of the SV6, which remained a step down from the SS.|$|E
25|$|The two {{entry level}} engines were revised – the 1.3 L {{received}} {{the latest version}} of the Kent/Valencia family – the Endura-E from the recently launched Mk IV Fiesta and Ka, whilst the 1.4L CVH was replaced by the updated CVH-PTE unit. There were no changes to either the venerable 1.8 diesel or the 1.6/1.8 Zetec units at the top end of the range. The improved iB5 version of the venerable BC-series transmission was also later introduced as a <b>running</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the first}} Escort (which was {{developed}} by Ford of Britain), the second generation was developed jointly between the UK and Ford of Germany. Codenamed [...] "Brenda" [...] during its development, it used the same mechanical components as the Mark I. The 940cc engine was still offered in Italy where the smaller engine attracted tax advantages, but in the other larger European markets in Europe it was unavailable. The estate and van versions used the same panelwork as the Mark I, but with the Mark II front end and interior. The car used a revised underbody, which had been introduced as a <b>running</b> <b>change</b> during {{the last six months}} production of the Mark I. Rear suspension still sat on leaf springs though some contemporaries such as the Hillman Avenger had moved on to coil springs. The car came in for criticism for its lack of oddments space, with a glove compartment only available on higher end models, and its stalk-mounted horn.|$|E
50|$|The Ramcharger {{continued}} to be sold in Mexico and Canada until 1996, with minor <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> from the last version sold in the U.S. in 1994.|$|R
5000|$|The Shuttle {{was subject}} to several minor facelifts and <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> over its {{production}} run. In the middle of 1983, a centre front seat was added. This consisted of two outer bucket seats and a centre bench seat, giving {{the impression of a}} single bench.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} festival, Witnness, {{sponsored by}} Guinness, {{took place during}} the start of August with notable headliners, including Oasis, The Foo Fighters and Green Day. In its second and third year, <b>running</b> <b>changed</b> its dates to the second weekend of July. In 2008 Oxegen became a three-day festival.|$|R
2500|$|VSC was not {{available}} across the range until August 2007, where it became standard on all variants. In May 2008, the Grande variant received a change in specification to {{the same set of}} alloy wheels as the [...] "Sportivo" [...] variant, as opposed to the previous style shared with the [...] "Ateva" [...] grade. Toyota released the [...] "Ateva L" [...] {{at the same time as}} this <b>running</b> <b>change.</b> The limited edition [...] "Ateva L" [...] added a rear lip spoiler, [...] "Sportivo" [...] alloy wheels, and leather trim. A second limited edition XV40, the [...] "Touring" [...] was launched in April 2009 based on and priced identically to the automatic transmission-equipped [...] "Altise". The [...] "Touring" [...] added 17-inch alloy wheels, the [...] "Sportivo" [...] grille, a chrome exhaust outlet, front fog lamps, a six-disc CD changer, dual zone climate control air conditioning, and a leather steering wheel, handbrake and gear selection lever.|$|E
2500|$|The 1966 lineup {{remained}} essentially unchanged from 1965. One {{change of}} note {{was a new}} four-speed synchromesh transmission using the standard Saginaw gear set with 3.11:1 first gear ratio used by other GM 6-cylinder vehicles. The steering column was changed to a two-piece design with universal joint, lessening the danger of intrusion during a front-end collision (actually a mid-1965 <b>running</b> <b>change).</b> [...] A plastic air dam was installed below the front valence panel to conceal the front suspension and underbody, and lessen crosswind sensitivity. In front, The [...] "lock door" [...] emblem (covering the lockset for the trunk lock) was changed from red to blue and featured a shorter bar. Air conditioned cars received a new condenser that was mounted {{in front of the}} engine, eliminating previous efficient but huge, awkward condenser that was mounted atop the engine, requiring its removal out of the way for most underhood servicing. The Corvair script nameplate was moved from atop the trunk lid to a position next to the driver's side headlight bezel. Sales began a decline as a result of Nader's book and the new Mustang that offered V8s up to [...] compared to Corvair's [...] top powertrain. and rumors of the upcoming [...] "Panther'-the code name for the forthcoming Camaro, slated as a direct competitor for the Mustang. A decision was made to discontinue further development of the Corvair. Production for the model year was down to 103,743.|$|E
5000|$|Piledriver was {{released}} in the Armin Zola wave of the Return of Marvel Legends line as a <b>running</b> <b>change</b> variant to Thunderball.|$|E
50|$|Further <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> {{concerned}} the rear styling. For the initial 1984 production run the rear numberplate was located above the bumper, however for 1985 and 1986 the plate was relocated to below the bumper, {{in the manner}} of the Japanese domestic market Galant models. New taillights were fitted for 1987, the rear numberplate reverting to its original place above the bumper.|$|R
5000|$|Packard {{did not use}} yearly {{model changes}} in these years. A new series {{appeared}} when management felt that there were enough <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> made. Therefore, the Light Eight was introduced during January 1932, together with the new V-12 (called [...] "Twin Six" [...] {{in its first year}} to honor the pioneer Packard model built from 1915 to 1923). Standard Eights and Super Eights followed in June 1932.|$|R
500|$|Like the VZ model before it, Holden {{with the}} VE have {{continued}} to moderate the long-standing tradition of implementing substantial updates marked by the frequent use of new model designations (such and VT, VX, and VY) successively interspersed with [...] "Series II" [...] and occasional [...] "Series III" [...] revisions. Holden have instead implemented a series of <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> over VE's lifetime, signified by the model year (MY): ...|$|R

5000|$|The squarish-looking Hackney {{bodies were}} of sheet steel; a <b>running</b> <b>change</b> added small fins atop the rear fenders on later models. Standard factory colors were red with white trim and wheels.|$|E
5000|$|... 1986: Introduced as a <b>running</b> <b>change</b> {{late in the}} 1985 model year, a CHMSL/third {{brake light}} was added to all {{versions}} of the Grand Marquis (and all American-market cars). Multi-port fuel injection is introduced on the 5.0 L engines to replace the older throttle body injection systems.|$|E
40|$|The {{decay rate}} of neutrinoless double beta (0 νββ) decay {{contains}} terms from heavy particle exchange, {{which lead to}} dimension- 9 (d= 9) six fermion operators at low energies. Limits on the coefficients of these operators have been derived previously neglecting {{the running of the}} operators between the high-scale, where they are generated, and the energy scale of double beta decay, where they are measured. Here we calculate the leading order QCD corrections to all possible d= 9 operators contributing to the 0 νββ amplitude and use RGE running to calculate 1 -loop improved limits. Numerically, QCD <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> limits by factors of the order of or larger than typical uncertainties in nuclear matrix element calculations. For some specific cases, operator mixing in the <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> limits even by up to two orders of magnitude. Our results can be straightforwardly combined with new experimental limits or improved nuclear matrix element calculations to re-derive updated limits on all short-range contributions to 0 νββ decay.

5000|$|... 1974 {{finally saw}} the {{introduction}} of a proper Ventora Estate, along with <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> {{for the rest of the}} range. For some markets there was also a smaller 2.8-litre version of the big six available in the Ventora and Victor 3300 SL Estate; with more weight and less power than the four-cylinder, as well as higher fuel consumption, the extra cost was hard to justify and it soon disappeared from price lists along with the Ventora 3.3 litre.|$|R

50|$|Several trim {{levels were}} offered, GL, GLX, GSR, Super Saloon and SE. The top SE {{versions}} notably featured 'Sigma' branded alloy wheels, digital instrumentation, climate controlled air conditioning, cruise control, speed-dependent intermittent wipers and a salmon-brown coloured interior treatment, the treatment changing deep red colour as a <b>running</b> <b>change</b> in 1985 on this model.|$|E

2500|$|However, the car {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} the motoring press at launch due to its suspension, with positive camber on the front wheels and negative camber at the rear, giving rise to the Mark III's infamous [...] "knock-kneed" [...] stance. The Mark III soon {{had a reputation for}} a harsh, unforgiving ride. In 1983 the revised suspension mounts from the Escort-based Orion and the larger Sierra steering rack were introduced as <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> for the 1984 model year which also coincided with a minor update for it including a new Escort badge at the rear.|$|R

50|$|The B20 {{displaced}} 2.0 L (1986 cc/121 in³) and {{was produced}} from 1969 to 1981. All B20 engines displace 1986 cc via an 88.9 mm bore X 80 mm stroke on 105/108mm split bore centers (2&3 are wider apart than 1&2 and 3&4). The b20 engine was used from 1969 to 1981 in the Volvo 120, 1800, 140, C202 and 240 series, {{and also in}} the Haubits 77 Bofors howitzer. The design is virtually identical to the predecessor B18, simply with an enlarged 88.9mm (3.5") bore, thus most parts are functionally interchangeable, albeit with <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> to the manufacture & design of components.|$|R

In another change, the All American featured an all-new lineup of engines and transmissions.|$|E
5000|$|From 1967 to 1981, the Borg-Warner 35 {{transmission}} {{was also}} used in the 6-cylinder Australian Chryslers, Valiants and Chargers. The specification-change from the Torqueflite automatic transmission to the Borg-Warner 35 transmission was due a requirement for more local content. The Borg-Warner 35 transmission was used behind the Hemi 6 engines.Later production models made a <b>running</b> <b>change</b> to the Borg-Warner 40 and 50 Series units to fall into product supply lines as with Ford Australia ...|$|E
5000|$|This economy-orientated {{version of}} the Hemi 6 was {{released}} as a <b>running</b> <b>change</b> in early 1971 as the base model engine in the VH Valiant. This engine shares the same stroke length as the other engines but has a smaller bore size of 3.52 in and lower compression ratio of 8.0:1.

25|$|The EL {{introduced}} {{only minor}} <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> to the Falcon's base model straight-six engine, {{when compared to}} the radical overhaul presented by the EF. The coil-pack ignition system introduced in the EF was rolled back to the distributor-style ignition from the ED Falcon due to reliability problems. A divided air induction pipe which led to the throttle was replaced with a single, wider pipe. Engine output remained unchanged at 157kilowatts (211hp) and 357newton metres (263ft·lbf). In October 1997, the V8 engine fitted to the XR8 sports model was upgraded from 170kilowatts (228hp) to 185 (248hp). Torque figures were also upped from 398newton metres (294ft·lbf) to 402 (296ft·lbf).|$|R
50|$|During this generation, {{a number}} of <b>running</b> <b>changes</b> were made to {{accommodate}} changing federal safety regulations. For 1966, seat belts became standard equipment for all seats (front and rear). For 1967, the changes were more extensive, as the Country Squire redesigned the steering wheel (with a large, padded hub in the center) fitted to an energy-absorbing steering column,28 padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors. To ensure that the 4300-lb Country Squire {{would not be the}} victim of brake failure, another mandate required the introduction of a dual-chamber master cylinder (on the Country Squire and all other 1968 vehicles).|$|R
