30|$|Let F be the 2 D {{conventional}} image (reconstructed by the polar-format algorithm). Since {{we assume}} that the field to be imaged has a sparse structure (strong scatterers on a background of weak reflectivities), <b>range</b> <b>lines,</b> having much higher reflectivity values than the others, are likely to contain strong scatterers (belonging to moving and/or stationary objects). To find the <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> with strong scatterers, we first calculate the mean and standard deviation of reflectivities throughout the conventional image. The <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> in the image domain having at least one pixel with a reflectivity greater than the mean plus one standard deviation are selected as potential <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> including objects. To decide which of these <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> include moving objects, we use the idea of [20] which is based on the mapdrift autofocus technique [21]. First, two images are reconstructed from data corresponding to each of the two half apertures. While stationary objects lie in the same position in both images, moving objects will not appear in the same position since phase errors caused by moving objects will be different for each sub-aperture data. Therefore, if we compute the correlation coefficient for these <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> between the two sub-aperture images, we obtain small correlation coefficients for <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> including moving objects. Consequently, <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> having a correlation coefficient less than a pre-determined threshold are declared to be <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> with potential moving objects, i.e., the ROI. We have empirically chosen this threshold to be 0.7. When one is not sure how to choose this threshold, using a large value erring on the side of declaring more <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> as potentially containing moving objects would be the safe approach with a less reduction in computational cost with respect to the original version of our approach.|$|R
50|$|<b>Range</b> <b>Line</b> Road is {{the main}} {{commercial}} thoroughfare for Joplin, Missouri. The southern portion of <b>Range</b> <b>Line</b> is where most of Joplin's hotels are located, {{this is known as}} the hotel district. The hotel district is also home to many national chain restaurants, as well as a few retail stores. North of 32nd street you run into the main commercial district of Joplin, also known as the <b>Range</b> <b>Line</b> retail district. Along the retail district you can find many national chain stores as well as local merchants. On the northern end of <b>Range</b> <b>Line</b> is Northpark Mall, the regions largest shopping mall. Many national chain stores are in Northpark Mall, as well as the area surrounding the mall. As <b>Range</b> <b>Line</b> runs north of the mall it eventually runs into Webb City, Missouri and becomes Madison Avenue.|$|R
5000|$|Range {{roads are}} {{commonly}} numbered in one-mile (1.6-km) increments west {{from the east}} <b>range</b> <b>line</b> of a given township. The range roads form {{the east and west}} boundaries (known as Section Lines) of the 1 mile x 1 mile square sections - 36 of which comprise a township (e.g. Range Road 12-2 would be between the second and third sections west of <b>Range</b> <b>line</b> 12, <b>Range</b> Road 6-0 is on <b>Range</b> <b>line</b> 6). In many counties, the dash between the <b>range</b> <b>line</b> number and the section line number is eliminated (Range Road 15-1 (151) might be called [...] "Range Road one-fifty-one"). Where a township road offset from a section line, it is often appended with a letter (Range Road 11-1A is just west of the first section <b>line</b> west of <b>Range</b> <b>line</b> 11). This system is useful for finding farmsteads (assuming one knows the legal address of the parcel).|$|R

30|$|The {{procedure}} {{of this method}} is as follows. It starts with the conventional SAR processing procedure to obtain a nonstationary signal from the vibrating target. First, the returned SAR signals are demodulated. Second, range compression is acted on the demodulated SAR echoes, followed by an application of range cell migration correction to <b>range</b> <b>lines.</b> Hence, the signal from a vibrating target is focused on a <b>range</b> <b>line.</b> Since small vibrations modulate the phase in radar echoes, we extract the phase history of each <b>range</b> <b>line</b> containing vibrating objects and also analyze the restrictive condition of phase ambiguity. Next, by performing the wavelet transform, the vibration displacement is acquired and vibration amplitudes and frequencies of each target are estimated quantitatively. The influence of noises {{on the performance of}} the proposed approach is also discussed. The method is capable of extracting vibration signatures in the case where the airborne radar moves along the desirable or undesirable trajectory. Finally, the simulation is given and this method has been compared with other radar-based vibration estimation method. The results illustrate the superior of this method.|$|R

2500|$|The {{surveying}} of any regional area, {{such as a}} {{state or}} two, is a multi-step process. First, two controlling survey lines are established: a baseline, which runs east-west and a principal meridian, which runs north-south (Fig. 1). [...] The locations of the two are determined by a previously chosen initial point, where they originate and thus intersect. [...] Next, at a defined distance interval, commonly 24 or [...] depending on the year and location, standard parallels of latitude are established parallel to the baseline. [...] The meridian, baseline and standard parallels thus established form a lattice upon which all further surveying is then based. [...] Subsequent work divides the land into survey townships of roughly 36 square miles (~93km2) or 6 miles (~9.7km) on each side. This {{is done by the}} establishment of township and <b>range</b> <b>lines.</b> Township lines run parallel to the baseline (east-west), while <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> are true meridians and thus run north-south; each are established at six mile (10km) intervals. [...] Lastly, townships are subdivided into 36 sections of approximately one square mile (640 acres, ~2.6km2) and sections into four quarter-sections of 0.25 square mile (160 acres, ~0.65km2) each. [...] (See [...] ). The intersection of a township line (or baseline) with a <b>range</b> <b>line</b> (or principal meridian) constitutes a township corner, of a section line with any other type of line a section corner, and a point halfway between any two section corners a quarter corner. [...] The federal government typically surveyed only to this quarter-section level, the subdivision of smaller parcels being carried out subsequently by private surveyors after original sale.|$|R
