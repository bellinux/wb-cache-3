40|$|An {{investigation}} of approximately 4, 000 {{buildings in the}} hot-humid climate locations of the United States where the potential for decay of hygroscopic building materials or corrosion of metals is moderate-to-severe found that redundant moisture barriers are necessary to accommodate statistically probable water leakage in building envelopes. Conversely, the research found that reliance on surfice barrier cladding designs without redundant moisture barriers can lead to water-related problems of rot, corrosion and deterioration. Exterior wall designs that incorporate drainage planes (vented wall designs), <b>rain</b> <b>screens</b> with drainage planes (pressureequalized or ventilated designs), and mass storage systems are better alternatives for building designers to consider in hot-humid climate locations. These failure mechanisms that are prevalent in surface barrier systems are demonstrated from the field research.

50|$|A rainscreen is an {{exterior}} wall detail where the siding (wall cladding) stands {{off from the}} moisture-resistant surface of an air barrier applied to the sheathing (sheeting) to create a capillary break and to allow drainage and evaporation. The <b>rain</b> <b>screen</b> is the siding itself but the term rainscreen implies a system of building. Ideally the <b>rain</b> <b>screen</b> prevents the wall air/moisture barrier on sheathing from getting wet. In some cases a rainscreen wall is called a pressure-equalized rainscreen wall where the ventilation openings are large enough for the air pressure to nearly equalize {{on both sides of}} the <b>rain</b> <b>screen,</b> but this name has been criticized as being redundant and is only useful to scientists and engineers.|$|E

But in the meantime the Scottish Rifles and the Rifle Brigade had moved along the banks to the drift. Although usually almost dry, the water was now coming down it breast-deep. Two gallant fellows went across, and when they found the line of shallow water they returned and guided their comrades over.

50|$|A variant on masonry veneer is the <b>rain</b> <b>screen</b> veneer. Rain screens are {{ventilated}} {{at the top}} {{and bottom}} of the cavity to prevent wind-driven rain from being driven into the building by unbalanced pressure. Such systems are typically encountered in areas where blowing rain is a significant concern.|$|E
40|$|Wind-induced {{pressure}} {{differences over}} <b>rain</b> <b>screens</b> {{are determined by}} the external pressures and the pressures inside the cavity. Minimizing this pressure difference decreases the risk of water leakage and also helps to minimize the local loads on the façade elements. Current rules to determine the wind loads on such structures are based on very little experimental evidence. Some guidance using very crude rules is given in EN 1991 - 1 - 4 [1]. A full scale measurement has been set up on a 158 m high residential building situated in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The façade is clad with slabs of natural stone, which typically have a size of 1 m 2 each. The openings between the elements are about 10 mm wide and the air cavity has a depth of (nominally) 20 mm. At a height of approximately 120 m above the ground, the façade elements have been equipped with 40 pressure transducers: 20 for the external pressure and 20 for the cavity pressure. From this experiment pressure equalization coefficients per pressure tap have been derived, which are defined as the maximum peak differential pressure coefficients divided by the maximum peak external pressure coefficients. Also wind direction dependent values have been derived. For overpressure, a pressure equalization coefficient of 0. 6 has been found, which is comparable to the ratio EN 1991 - 1 - 4 gives for the net pressure coefficient of an permeable façade (cp,net= 2 / 3 cpe). For underpressure, values in the same order of magnitude have been found, with a maximum value of 0. 8 in the middle zone. One value above 1 has been found, which lies in a corner zone (ceq= 1. 1). The measured pressure equalization coefficients for underpressure are higher than the net pressure coefficients in EN 1991 - 1 - 4 for permeable facades (cp,net= 1 / 3 cpe) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{precipitation}} radar (PR) {{on board}} the TRMM satellite provides definitive measurements of the 3 D structure of precipitation. However, its narrow swath (215 km) limits {{the use of this}} dataset. On the other hand, TMI and SSM/I provide wider swath coverage (760 km for TMI and 1400 km SSM/I) and higher sampling frequency. Thus, combining the higher accuracy of PR with the better spatial coverage and sampling frequency of TMI and SSM/I would be of great value in a number of applications in meteorology, hydrology, and water resources. One approach to do this is using PR to calibrate the passive microwaves (PM) data. Relationship between PR and PM may vary from one rainfall regime to another and from one season to another within the same regime. The goal of this research is to develop a PR-calibrated TMI (PR-TMI) overland rain retrieval algorithm, investigate its regional and seasonal differences, and explore possibilities of extending the PR-TMI algorithm to SSM/I calibration. Application of the PR-TMI algorithm to SSM/I is particularly important because SSM/I has long historical data going back to 1987 and better sampling due to the more frequent overpasses and wider swath. The PR-TMI algorithm developed here consists of <b>rain</b> <b>screening,</b> convective/stratiform <b>rain</b> classification, and non-linear (linear) regressions for stratiform (convective) rain retrievals. Four geographic regions from Central Africa (AFC), Amazon (AMZ), continental US (USA), and South Asia (SAS) are selected for these investigations. The algorithm developed here outperformed the TRMM- 2 A 12 V 6 product with significant decrease in both random and systematic errors. Regional calibration performs slightly better than the global calibration. However, the differences are not significant particularly for AFC, AMZ and USA regions. Comparisons of individual season calibrations with the annual calibration did not show significant differences either. However, it was observed that the performance of the PM algorithm varies among the different seasons. Comparison of the current SSM/I rain estimates with that of GPROF has shown that the current algorithm performs better with very significant reduction in bias and random errors. ...|$|R

Built upon a non-linear generative model of <b>rain</b> image, namely <b>screen</b> blend model, we propose a dictionary learning based algorithm for single image de-raining. The basic idea is to sparsely approximate the patches of two layers by very high discrim-inative codes over a learned dictionary with strong mutual exclusivity property. Such discriminative sparse codes lead to accurate separation of two layers from their non-linear composite. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the existing single image de-raining methods on tested rain images. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to obtain}} the rate of {{rainfall}} (RR) over ocean areas using satellite data by establishing the relationship between Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) microwave brightness temperature (Tbs) data and island rain gauge rainfall. This study applied a rain identification technique developed by Grody et al. (1999) using AMSU-A data accepted to <b>screen</b> <b>rain</b> events over ocean areas. Using rain gauge data of Sakishima-shoto in Japan as a ground truth, validation of rain identification was conducted every May and June from 1999 to 2001. Including times of both rainfall and no rainfall, the overall rates of successful recognition were 87. 3 %, 87 %, and 89 % for 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. As for quantitative validation, the coefficient of determination was 0. 72. To obtain further precipitation observations, another rainfall estimation retrieved by the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) data onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was compared with the AMSU-A data. The results displayed solid agreement in rainfall patterns and rain distribution. Additionally, when the AMSU-A RRs were multiplied {{by a factor of}} approximately 1. 5 (particularly for heavy rainfalls), the intensities of the AMSU-A RRs roughly equaled those of the TMI RRs.
