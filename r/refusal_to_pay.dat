5|$|Culverhouse was {{initially}} lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but eventually {{came to be}} blamed for the team's struggles. His <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Doug Williams at a salary level {{comparable to that of}} the league's top quarterbacks insulted fans, and was seen as the beginning of the team's decline during the 1980s. It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding a winning team, {{as long as it was}} financially profitable. The Buccaneers' NFL-record streak of fourteen consecutive losing seasons cemented this perception, although Culverhouse did make several notable attempts to improve the team.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey {{submitted}} to John in 1206, and his lands {{were returned to}} him. But in 1207 Geoffrey led the clergy of England in their <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> royal taxation and was forced into exile. Geoffrey excommunicated anyone who attempted to collect the tax in his archdiocese, but the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates in retaliation. Geoffrey once again secured the support of Pope Innocent, who ordered John to restore Geoffrey's possessions, {{but in the meantime}} the archbishop had fled to France. A medieval chronicler, Geoffrey of Coldingham, stated that the English church considered Geoffrey a martyr because of this stand against King John.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} initially {{started with}} Vlad's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the jizya (tax on non-Muslims) to the Sultan and intensified when Vlad Ţepeş invaded Bulgaria and impaled over 23,000 Turks. Mehmed then raised a great army {{with the objective}} to conquer Wallachia and annex it to his empire. The two leaders fought a series of skirmishes, the most notable one being the Night Attack where Vlad Ţepeş attacked the Turkish camp in the night {{in an attempt to}} kill Mehmed.|$|E

He selected John Hampden as the defendant in respect of the round sum of one pound assessed upon him at Stoke Mandeville. (The case {{did not mention the}} Great Kimble assessment). Judgment was given for the King but only by a majority decision of seven judges to five, which was seen {{throughout the}} country as a moral defeat for the King and was followed by more <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{buildings}} and land were auctioned off in July 1843 and purchased for £5,100 by W. G. Hicks, an ironmonger. The property {{consisted of the}} keeper's house, the canteen (known as a suttling house), the Admiralty section, the chapel, a three-story brick building and eight brick houses, all closed off from Borough High Street by iron gates. Imprisonment for debt was finally outlawed in England in 1869, except in cases of fraud or <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> and in the 1870s the Home Office demolished most of the prison buildings, though in 1955 parts of it were still in use by George Harding & Sons, hardware merchants.|$|E

On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city. Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks. Christine Todd Whitman, administrator of the EPA {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe. Mayor Giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater Wall Street area.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Alberto {{acted as}} the royal yacht for King Victor Emmanuel III when he {{attended}} the coronation ceremony for King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in 1902. Victor Emmanuel invited Guglielmo Marconi to accompany him and conduct radio experiments en route. When the coronation was delayed by Edward's illness, the ship took Victor Emmanuel to meetings with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in Kronstadt. She then ferried Marconi across the Atlantic to Nova Scotia for experiments transmitting radio messages across the ocean. After 15 December, when Marconi successfully transmitted messages from Canada to England, Carlo Alberto was sent to Venezuelan waters during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03, when an international force of British, German, and Italian warships blockaded Venezuela over the country's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> foreign debts. From 1907 to 1910 she served as a gunnery and torpedo training ship.|$|E
50|$|The Tyrone Central Civil Resistance Committee {{organised}} {{a meeting}} in Omagh on 17 October 1971, chaired by Frank McManus. With more than 40,000 households on rent-and-rate strike, primarily Council tenants, and with further <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> money collected by the local state, Local Government virtually ground to a halt. As opposition councillors and businessmen withdrew from the councils and commissions, Newry, Strabane, Coalisland and other smaller towns were left with no town councils and the Government stepped in with the Payment for Debt (Emergency Powers) Act according to which anyone who owed money to the State and who refused <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> was <b>to</b> have their debts paid by way of deductions from their State entitlements.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{forms of}} civil disobedience, such as illegal boycotts, <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes, draft dodging, {{distributed}} denial-of-service attacks, and sit-ins, {{make it more}} difficult for a system to function. In this way, they might be considered coercive. Brownlee notes that [...] "although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue, nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table." [...] The Plowshares organization temporarily closed GCSB Waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes.|$|R
5000|$|To {{counter the}} effects of adverse selection, {{insurers}} may offer insurance premiums that are proportional to the customer's risk of accident. The insurer screens customers to distinguish high-risk individuals from low-risk individuals. For instance, medical insurance companies ask a range of questions and may request medical or other reports on individuals who apply to buy insurance. The premium can be varied accordingly and any unreasonably high risks individuals are rejected. This risk selection process is one part of underwriting. In many countries, insurance law incorporates an [...] "utmost good faith" [...] or uberrima fides doctrine, which requires potential customers to answer any underwriting questions asked by the insurer fully and honestly. Dishonesty may be met with <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> claims.|$|R
5|$|Edward II's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{homage to}} the French king was based on concern for his royal sovereignty, but also on fear of a {{potential}} resurgence of domestic resistance. For this reason, he sent his wife Isabella to negotiate with King Charles, who was her brother. The Queen departed for France on 9 March 1325, and in September she was joined by her son, {{the heir to the}} throne, Prince Edward. Isabella's negotiations were successful, and it was agreed that the young Prince Edward would perform homage in the king's place, which he did on 24 September. Not long after this, Edmund joined the queen and prince in Paris. A circle of opposition was emerging around the queen, including the exiled Roger Mortimer. Edmund, who had previously been steadfast in his support for his half-brother, now joined the plot against the king. Though he still distrusted Mortimer, his hatred for the Despensers seems to have been even greater at this point. When Edmund, along with the others, ignored the king's order to return to England, his lands were confiscated in March 1326.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Alberto {{served as}} the royal yacht for Victor Emmanuel III when he {{attended}} the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom in 1902. Victor Emmanuel invited Guglielmo Marconi to accompany him and conduct radio experiments en route. Originally scheduled for 26 June, the coronation was delayed by Edward's illness and rescheduled for 9 August. In the meantime, the ship took Victor Emmanuel to meetings with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in Kronstadt. She returned to England before the coronation ceremony and then participated in the fleet review at Spithead on 16 August. On the return voyage Marconi conducted more long-range experiments with his site in Poldhu, Cornwall. The King then loaned Carlo Alberto to Marconi in September for more testing. She then ferried Marconi across the Atlantic to Glace Bay, Nova Scotia for further experiments transmitting radio messages across the ocean. After 15 December, when Marconi successfully transmitted messages from Glace Bay to Poldhu, Carlo Alberto was sent to Venezuelan waters during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03, when an international force of British, German, and Italian warships blockaded Venezuela over the country's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> foreign debts. She returned in early 1903 and was briefly deployed in Salonica later that year. From 1907 to 1910 she served as a gunnery and torpedo training ship.|$|E
5|$|Dole and {{his allies}} in the {{legislature}} used the coin issuance {{as a means of}} attacking the government, accusing Gibson and others of disobeying the laws, and demanding information on Spreckels' profits, which the government stated was about three percent after costs such as transport and insurance were calculated. The political fallout of the coinage was the 1884 election-year shift towards the Kuokoa (independent) Party in the legislature. The Currency Act of 1884, passed after the election, restricted acceptance of silver coin as payment to debts under $10, and limited the exchange of silver for gold at the treasury to $150,000 a month. The new silver coins were expected to flow into the Treasury in exchange for gold under this arrangement, but the government refused to implement the law until forced to by the Supreme Court. To avoid a financial panic, major private banks and businesses agreed to exchange gold for the new silver coins, in which there was little public confidence. But in February 1885, faced with a government <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> out gold (of which the Treasury was almost bare), the private businesses stopped this arrangement. Negotiations followed, and the government reluctantly agreed to sequester more than $550,000 of the coins in a special account to back the banknotes then in circulation. Although this left the government with little liquidity, the increased confidence in its finances allowed it to borrow on a short-term basis. By mid-1885, sugar prices were rising, and prosperity was returning to the islands. Greater amounts of gold flowed into the islands, balancing the silver that was already there, and stabilizing the monetary situation. The Kalākaua coins became more acceptable, and by 1888, most of the non-US foreign silver had been exchanged for them. They remained in circulation during the turbulent years of the 1890s in Hawaii, as the monarchy fell and the short-lived republic ended in 1898 with annexation to the United States. Despite the urging of local interests, it was not until 1903 that Congress acted, ordering that the Hawaii silver coins be exchanged by January 1, 1904, or lose status as legal tender. By 1907, coins worth about $814,000 of the $1,000,000 originally issued had been redeemed; they were exchanged for US silver and melted down at the San Francisco Mint.|$|E

Shortly after the Conservatives won {{a majority in the}} election, the new home secretary William Whitelaw decided against a Welsh fourth channel, and suggested that, except for an occasional opt-out, the service should be the same as that offered {{in the rest of the}} UK. This led to acts of civil disobedience, including <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the television licence fee, thereby running the risk of prosecution or even a prison sentence, and sit-ins in BBC and HTV studios.

About 2,000 so-called [...] "regulators" [...] had gathered, hoping to gain concessions from the Governor by intimidating him with a show of superior force.

40|$|With {{adequate}} {{cost containment}} unlikely {{in the foreseeable}} future, health care use {{will have to be}} curtailed, ideally with open and explicit criteria for equitably allocating resources or rationing.

The absence of any global limitation on health care resources may encourage patients to believe that health care resources are not scarce and {{do not need to be}} rationed. A belief in vitalism [...] that everyone is morally entitled to unlimited longevity and good health [...] may discourage setting limits on one's own care. Together, these characteristics may foster the belief that denials of health care services, especially by health insurers, are arbitrary or unfair <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for existing resources and not a necessary method of rationing scarce resources.
