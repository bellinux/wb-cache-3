40|$|<b>Revalidation</b> <b>and</b> <b>renewal</b> of {{registration}} {{are issues}} of concern to most psychiatrists. Keeping up-to-date with current knowledge {{is an essential part}} of the renewal of license to practice. Training needs of psychiatrists are addressed in postgraduate courses and the gaps in training and updating of knowledge addressed through continuing medical education programs. This study aims to look at whether the training needs of psychiatrists working in the state of Kerala are being met. Two aspects of training and practice, child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy, were assessed using a questionnaire. A significant number of respondents had not received any training in either of these areas in their postgraduate training. This did not affect their practice; most respondents continued to practice psychotherapy and see child patients despite not being trained. These two areas can thus be identified as lacunae in the curriculum as well as a need which should be addressed through Continuation Medical education programs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND All general {{practitioners}} (GPs) {{are expected}} to have an appraisal from 2002 and the first cohort will experience revalidation in 2005. Although there is a link between appraisal <b>and</b> <b>revalidation,</b> this has yet to be clarified. OBJECTIVE To investigate the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of GPs towards <b>revalidation</b> <b>and</b> appraisal. DESIGN Cross sectional survey. SETTING Lincolnshire, UK. PARTICIPANTS General practitioners. METHOD In 2000 a self-administered postal questionnaire survey was sent to all 343 GP principals on the list of Lincolnshire Health Authority. The questionnaire consisted of 47 attitudinal statements on appraisal <b>and</b> <b>revalidation.</b> It also included open questions on concerns about appraisal <b>and</b> <b>revalidation</b> <b>and</b> questions on attributes of responders. RESULTS Of the 343 GPs sent questionnaires, 272 (79...|$|R

The aim {{of this article is}} to look at the principles of <b>revalidation</b> <b>and</b> consider what it means to those who have to revalidate. There are a number of factors that relate to <b>revalidation</b> <b>and</b> in order to discuss revalidation it is necessary to reflect upon the concept of competence as well as continuing professional development in professional health care practice. The ways in which competence can be achieved will be discussed, as well as how continuing professional development can ensure that competence is maintained. There will also be discussion of how continuing professional development <b>and</b> <b>revalidation</b> are interlinked <b>and</b> that <b>revalidation</b> is essentially a method of ensuring and demonstrating competence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Turkish Association of Medicine {{founded a}} Continuing Medical Education Accreditation Committee in 1993 to {{evaluate}} and accredit scientific meetings and publications. The aims of this project were to raise the standards of meetings and to introduce compulsory <b>revalidation</b> <b>and</b> re-certification for physicians in Turkey. Discussion Since the year 1994, 2348 applications to the Continuing Medical Education board have been made (mostly for scientific meetings), and 95 % of these applications have been accepted. Physicians received 139. 014 credits during this time. This number is increasing every year. Meeting organisers' demand for such a kind of evaluation is increasing, because participants increasingly request it. Summary Efforts for <b>revalidation</b> <b>and</b> re-certification of physicians have not been completely successful yet. In the near future the Co-ordination Council of Medical Speciality Societies is going to oblige member associations to establish speciality boards. This {{will be the first}} step to the conventional use of Continuing Medical Education credits in occupational evaluation. Time-limited re-certification of physicians is the principal goal of Turkish Medical Association. Efforts to implement this change in legislation are being made. </p...|$|R

S. patents and interprets this new evidence using a model of patent transfers <b>and</b> <b>renewal.</b> We find {{that the proportion of}} transferred patents is large and differs across technology fields and especially type of patentees. We also find that the probability of a patent being traded depends on a number of factors—the age of the patent, the number of citations received by a given age, the patent generality, and whether the patent has been previously traded or not. These findings are consistent with the predictions of a model of patent transfers <b>and</b> <b>renewals.</b> 1...|$|R
