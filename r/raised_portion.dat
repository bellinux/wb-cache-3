5|$|The Royal Stoa {{was built}} upon the artificially <b>raised</b> <b>portion</b> of the Temple Mount platform. Arches {{underneath}} supported the columns of the Stoa, and provided service areas for the structures above. The Huldah Gates {{at the bottom}} of the southern wall led through corridors beneath the Stoa, rising to the Temple plaza, and served as the main entrance to the Temple compound for worshipers. Additional passages led to storage areas, and possibly provided secondary access to the Stoa and the Temple beyond. An arched overpass on the eastern side of the Temple Mount led to a gate which opened into the so-called Solomon's Stables just beneath the eastern end of the Stoa. It is widely assumed that at least part of this area was used as a storage area in conjunction with business conducted in the Stoa.|$|E

50|$|The dies {{used for}} this type of {{printing}} have the embossed, (<b>raised),</b> <b>portions</b> of the stamp design cut away, (recessed), into the metal. The colourless detail as appears on the hair and diadem are achieved by variations in the depth of the engraving.|$|R
25|$|BMT-72 – Ukrainian T-72 upgrade. The unique {{compact design}} of the Ukrainian-developed BMT-72 power pack, based on that of the T-84, made it {{possible}} not only to considerably increase the power capabilities of the vehicle, but also to introduce into the vehicle design a troop compartment. The troop compartment is located between the fighting compartment and the power pack compartment. In the troop compartment roof there {{is a set of}} three hatches in slightly <b>raised</b> <b>portion</b> of the hull roof behind turret that allow the troops to get in or dismount the vehicle. There are also steps on the end of each catwalk at rear of vehicle. The main visual difference between BMT-72 and T-72 is a seventh pair of roadwheels.|$|E
2500|$|A {{friction}} ridge is a <b>raised</b> <b>portion</b> of the epidermis on the digits (fingers and toes), {{the palm}} of the hand or the sole of the foot, consisting {{of one or more}} connected ridge units of friction ridge skin. These are sometimes known as [...] "epidermal ridges" [...] which are caused by the underlying interface between the dermal papillae of the dermis and the interpapillary (rete) pegs of the epidermis. These epidermal ridges serve to amplify vibrations triggered, for example, when fingertips brush across an uneven surface, better transmitting the signals to sensory nerves involved in fine texture perception. These ridges may also assist in gripping rough surfaces and may improve surface contact in wet conditions.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Trelawny {{explained}} to us certain other things, not laid {{down on the}} chart. Such as, for instance, that the hollowed part of the table was exactly fitted {{to the bottom of}} the Magic Coffer, which was therefore intended to be placed on it. The respective legs of this table were indicated by differently shaped uraei outlined on the floor, the head of each being extended in the direction of the similar uraeus twined round the leg. Also that the mummy, when laid on the <b>raised</b> <b>portion</b> in the bottom of the sarcophagus, seemingly made to fit the form, would lie head to the West and feet to the East, thus receiving the natural earth currents. [...] "If this be intended," [...] he said, [...] "as I presume it is, I gather that the force to be used has something to do with magnetism or electricity, or both. It may be, of course, that some other force, such, for instance, as that emanating from radium, is to be employed. I have experimented with the latter, but only in such small quantity as I could obtain; but so far as I can ascertain the stone of the Coffer is absolutely impervious to its influence. There must be some such unsusceptible substances in nature. Radium does not seemingly manifest itself when distributed through pitchblende; and there are doubtless other such substances in which it can be imprisoned. Possibly these may belong to that class of [...] "inert" [...] elements discovered or isolated by Sir William Ramsay. It is therefore possible that in this Coffer, made from an aerolite and therefore perhaps containing some element unknown in our world, may be imprisoned some mighty power which is to be released on its opening." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{community}} {{is set on}} a flat relief to about 150 m. On the road you can see several structures with low or [...] ak 'Alché, which are areas of flat land bounded by slightly more <b>raised</b> <b>portions.</b> These lower the gaps forming due to the impermeability of the floor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shell is}} {{regularly}} grooved {{throughout the body}} whorl, with the intertices plane or granular. The spire is striate, often gradate. The color is orange-red, <b>raised</b> <b>portions</b> with very narrow chestnut revolving lines, white clouded, especially in the middle, forming an irregular band, which is mottled and bordered with chestnut. The interior of the aperture is rosy.|$|R
5000|$|... 5″ is the Caliber of this gun. The term [...] "Caliber" [...] {{used here}} is the Artillery Caliber definition, and its value {{is equal to the}} bore {{diameter}} of THIS gun as measured from land to land. (Lands are the <b>raised</b> <b>portions</b> of the bore rifling, between the groves.) (Note: Artillery Caliber and Small Arms Caliber are not the same.) ...|$|R
50|$|The rim or edge of {{a crater}} is the part that extends above {{the height of the}} local surface, usually in a {{circular}} or elliptical pattern. In a more specific sense, the rim may refer to the circular or elliptical edge that represents the uppermost tip of this <b>raised</b> <b>portion.</b> If there is no <b>raised</b> <b>portion,</b> the rim simply refers to the inside edge of the curve where the flat surface meets the curve of the crater bottom.|$|E

50|$|The {{tour for}} {{the album was}} {{designed}} to maximize interactivity with the audience, allowing members to dance on a <b>raised</b> <b>portion</b> of the stage, and even to guest solo on guitar. Rundgren was the only performer on this tour apart from three female dancers.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} directed immobilisation of nano- or micro-objects on a substrate surface, comprising the steps of: a) providing a rough substrate surface, which comprises a conductive layer and a multiplicity of <b>raised</b> <b>portions,</b> with local radii of curvature in the dimension of the objects to be immobilised; b) providing polarisable nano- or micro-objects, which have an induced dipole in an electrical alternating field, on or {{in the vicinity of}} the substrate surface; c) applying an electrical alternating current voltage between the substrate surface and at least one counter-electrode, such that an electrical alternating field having local field gradients is produced and the polarised nano- or micro-objects are preferably attracted by the <b>raised</b> <b>portions</b> of the substrate surface and are oriented according to the electrical field lines. Further aspects of the invention relate to a device for carrying out said method and to an arrangement of immobilised polarised nano- or micro-objects on a rough substrate surface that can be obtained by the method according to the inventio...|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{transformers}} {{are most}} commonly used in videocassette recorders. Signals must be coupled from the electronics of the VCR to the fast-moving tape heads carried on the rotating head drum; a rotary transformer is ideal for this purpose. Most VCR designs require more than one signal to be coupled to the head drum. In this case, the cup core {{has more than one}} concentric winding, isolated by individual <b>raised</b> <b>portions</b> of the core. The transformer for the head drum shown to the right couples six individual channels.|$|R
50|$|A low {{floor in}} the {{vehicular}} sense is normally combined in a conceptual meaning with normal pedestrian access from a standard kerb height. However, the accessibility of a low-floor vehicle can also be utilised from slightly <b>raising</b> <b>portions</b> of kerb at bus stops, or through use of level boarding bus rapid transit 'stations' or tram stops. The combination of access from a kerb was the technological development of the 1990s, as step-free interior layouts for buses had existed in some cases for decades, with entrance steps being introduced as chassis designs and overall height regulations changed.|$|R
50|$|The headshield (or cephalon) carries spines (called genal spines) of {{approximately}} 4-8 thorax segments long (measured {{parallel to the}} midline). The genal spines are attached {{in front of the}} back of the headshield. The central <b>raised</b> <b>portion</b> of the cephalon that represents the axis in the cephalon (or glabella) touches the flattened ledge that borders the cephalon. The furrows that separate border, eye ridges, glabella and its lobes are distinct.|$|E

5000|$|The {{surface of}} the <b>raised</b> <b>portion</b> of the Plaza, {{consisting}} of dark and light marble, delineates L’Enfant’s plan. [...] Brass outlines mark the sites of the White House and the Capitol. Quotes about the city from its visitors and residents are carved into the marble surface. Granite retaining walls, marked at intervals by planted urns, edge the plaza. [...] A granite-walled fountain flows in the western portion of the plaza.|$|E
5000|$|The five-storeyed 1912 brick {{building}} occupies {{the corner of}} Brunswick and Wickham Streets. Its facade has continuous piers and arched openings to the first and fourth floors, and is trimmed with rendered concrete sills, lintels and insets. The parapet has a substantial cornice with dentils, and <b>raised</b> <b>portions</b> bearing the name [...] "McWhirters". The Wickham and Warner Streets corner is rounded, and has a castellated parapet and a round window at first floor level. Internally, this 1912 section retains some of its pressed metal ceilings with floral motifs and some column capitals with plaster scrolls, and has an encased steel structure.|$|R

Some lichenologists consider squamulous lichens to be a special kind of crustose lichen.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} an {{unwanted}} piece {{of material and}} is removed with a deburring tool in a process called 'deburring'. Burrs are most commonly created by machining operations, such as grinding, drilling, milling, engraving or turning. It may {{be present in the}} form of a fine wire on the edge of a freshly sharpened tool or as a <b>raised</b> <b>portion</b> of a surface; this type of burr is commonly formed when a hammer strikes a surface. Deburring accounts for a significant portion of manufacturing costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{corner of}} the {{building}} has a section of brick wall that curves onto the Mary Street facade. This facade has a <b>raised</b> <b>portion</b> near the corner with a single opening on each level. The building then continues back in the manner of one of the recessed portions {{on the front of the}} building with broad arches at the upper level but with paired windows below rather than a group of three. As the ground drops away at this corner, openings to the basement appear at footpath level.|$|E

40|$|No {{lettering}} on label. Higher-priced labels used 10 or more colors plus bronze or 24 K gold leaf. Bronze {{was usually}} burnished or buffed to a metallic luster. As {{if that was}} not enough, in the mid- 1890 s, lithographers began using 38 -ton presses and precision-machined dies to emboss many of their labels. The embossing process highlighted the <b>raised</b> <b>portions</b> of the label with 24 K gold leaf or bronze. Embossing gave the labels their life-like dimensionality; gold coins found on most labels now looked like real gold pieces.

50|$|On May 30, 2005, Villamán, at age 46, {{was on his}} {{way home}} around 3:40 a.m. after {{broadcasting}} from Yankee Stadium over the weekend. He died when his sport utility vehicle sideswiped a truck on Interstate 93 near Wilmington, Massachusetts, rolled down an embankment, and slammed into a tree. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The loss of the charismatic broadcaster was also felt deeply in San Francisco de Macoris, where he was <b>raised.</b> <b>Portions</b> of his funeral, held at St. Mary-Immaculate Conception Church in Lawrence, were broadcast live on three regional radio stations. He is buried at St. Mary's cemetery in Lawrence, Massachusetts.|$|R

5000|$|A {{plate is}} a broad, concave, but mainly flat vessel on which food can be served. [...] A plate {{can also be}} used for {{ceremonial}} or decorative purposes. Most plates are circular, but they may be any shape, or made of any water-resistant material. Generally plates are raised round the edges, either by a curving up, or a wider lip or <b>raised</b> <b>portion.</b> Vessels with no lip, especially if they have a more rounded profile, are likely to be considered as bowls or dishes, as are very large vessels with a plate shape. Plates are dishware, and tableware. Plates in wood, pottery and metal go back into antiquity in many cultures.|$|E
