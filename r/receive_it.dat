5|$|Following {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia, Serbia ceased using many of the awards and decorations {{established}} during the communist period, {{though it was not}} until 2010 that the Serbian Government officially reinstated the Order of Karađorđe's Star as Serbia's highest decoration.

5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to <b>receive</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Men {{were also}} {{motivated}} by positive means. New medals were instituted: the Military Cross {{was created in}} December 1914 for warrant officers and officers up to captain, the Military Medal for enlisted men in March 1916 (although to the regret of some men, it did not carry a cash bounty like the Distinguished Conduct Medal). The Order of the British Empire (of which the MBE is one grade) was instituted in 1917. By 1918, medals for bravery were often awarded within a week {{to ensure that the}} man lived long enough to <b>receive</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the sword from the trunk shall <b>receive</b> <b>it</b> as a gift, and he {{who is able to}} pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves the hall, and nobody knows who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword from the trunk of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Tang {{slipped out of}} the city, however, the entire Nanking Garrison Force was rapidly {{disintegrating}} with some units in open flight. Furthermore, contact had already been lost with many units who thus never received Tang's message and continued to hold their positions as ordered, though even those that did <b>receive</b> <b>it</b> had little luck at slipping through the Japanese lines. China's 66th and 83rd Corps made a bid to evade the Japanese as planned through a gap to the east but immediately ran into their own minefield. After that they were attacked in flight by Japanese units and lost two divisional chiefs of staff in combat. Though the two corps had started the battle at least 11,000 men strong, only 600 of them escaped Nanking. Near dawn on December 13 a portion of China's 74th Corps was also annihilated in a bid to break through Japanese lines along the Yangtze River south of Nanking.|$|E
5|$|In 1552, Las Casas {{published}} A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. This book, {{written a}} decade earlier {{and sent to the}} attention of then-prince Philip II of Spain, contained accounts of the abuses committed by some Spaniards against Native Americans during the early stages of colonization. In 1555 his old Franciscan adversary Toribio de Benavente Motolinia wrote a letter in which he described Las Casas as an ignorant, arrogant troublemaker. Benavente described indignantly how Las Casas had once denied baptism to an aging Indian who had walked many leagues to <b>receive</b> <b>it,</b> only on the grounds that he did not believe that the man had received sufficient doctrinal instruction. This letter, which reinvoked the old conflict over the requirements for the sacrament of baptism between the two orders, was intended to bring Las Casas in disfavour. However, it did not succeed.|$|E

He continued at his position as Opposition Leader until May 2013. Dar was re-elected to the Senate {{for the third time}} in the 2012 senate election, for six years. During his tenure as Member of the Senate, he served as a member of the Special Committee of the Parliament of Pakistan on Constitutional Reforms, and co-prepared and passed the 18th, the 19th, and the 20th amendments to the Constitution of Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The first Grey Cup {{game was}} held on December 4, 1909, between two Toronto clubs: the University of Toronto Varsity Blues {{defeated}} the Parkdale Canoe Club 26–6 before 3,800 fans. The trophy was not ready for presentation following the game, and the Varsity Blues did not <b>receive</b> <b>it</b> until March 1910. They retained the trophy in the following two years, defeating the Hamilton Tigers in 1910 and the Toronto Argonauts in 1911. The University of Toronto failed to reach the 1912 Grey Cup, which was won by the Hamilton Alerts over the Argonauts. The Varsity Blues refused {{to hand over the}} trophy on the belief they could keep it until they were defeated in a title game. They kept the trophy until 1914 when they were defeated by the Argonauts, who made the trophy available to subsequent champions.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was {{the first}} of two African Americans to be awarded the Medal of Honor in Korea, the other being Cornelius H. Charlton in June 1951. Charlton was {{also a member of the}} 24th Infantry who was {{recognized}} posthumously. Other African Americans who fought in Korea are known to have been nominated for the medal but did not <b>receive</b> <b>it.</b> They were the first two African Americans to be nominated for the Medal of Honor since the Spanish–American War, though several World War II veterans were later nominated. The two nominations had seen delays because unit commanders refused to submit their nominations. In all, 131 men were awarded the medal during and in the immediate aftermath of the war.|$|E
