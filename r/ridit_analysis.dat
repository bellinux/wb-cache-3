40|$|Most {{analyses}} of student evaluations of courses and instructors {{are based on}} averaging the point values of the questions about course and instructor quality. But using the average assumes that {{the answers to the}} questions are uniform on an interval even though the categories may not be equally spaced in the minds of those filling out the forms. A better statistical method treats the responses as ordinal data, not equally spaced. For this purpose, we can use <b>RIDIT</b> <b>analysis,</b> which is analysis that compares the responses to a questionnaire relative to an identified distribution. In this paper, we use <b>RIDIT</b> <b>analysis</b> on 20 years of data from the Robins School of Business at the University of Richmond. We show how the evaluation based on <b>RIDIT</b> <b>analysis</b> can lead to different conclusions than when using the arithmetic average. Statistical inference about significant differences in instructor quality can be made with a sounder theoretical basis. Based on <b>RIDIT</b> <b>analysis,</b> we are able to compare performance of a variety of subgroups, as well as for individual courses and instructors. We first establish a baseline control RIDIT, then analyze how the control has changed over time and how it depends, for example, on the course level, the time of day of the course, and whether the course is a required course or an elective. We then compare these results to those that would be obtained with a more typical analysis based on the means of the evaluations assuming equally spaced intervals for the answers on the student-evaluation questionnaire...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Dietary inequality, via {{socio-economic}} inequality, {{may involve}} several mechanisms. Different aspects of adolescents’ socio-economic circumstances {{should therefore be}} considered {{in order to make}} effective interventions to promote healthy eating in the young population. Indicators designed to tap socio-economic status among adolescents in particular will facilitate {{a better understanding of the}} concept of socio-economic status and how it influences health behaviour among young people. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if material capital and cultural capital individually and independently contribute to the prediction of eating habits in the Norwegian adolescent population. Methods The analysis is based on survey data from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children study. The Family Affluence Scale (number of cars, holidays, PC and bedrooms) and number of books in the household were used as indicators of socio-economic status, respectively measuring material capital and cultural capital. Their influence on adolescent’s consumption of fruit, vegetables, sweets, soft drinks, and consumption of breakfast and dinner was evaluated. Pearson’s correlation, logistic regression and <b>ridit</b> transformation <b>analysis</b> were used to analyse the data. Results Higher family affluence was shown to predict consumption of more fruit (OR 1. 52) and vegetables (OR 1. 39) and consumption of breakfast (OR 1. 61) and dinner (1. 35). Cultural capital was significantly associated to consumption of fruit (OR 1. 85), vegetables (OR 2. 38) sweets (OR. 45), sugary soft drinks (OR. 26), breakfast (OR 2. 13) and dinner (OR 1. 54). Cultural capital was the strongest predictor to healthy eating among adolescents in Norway. Conclusions Material capital and cultural capital individually and independently contributed to the prediction of healthy eating patterns among adolescents in Norway. Cultural capital is an understudied dimension of the socio-economic status concept and the influence on health behaviour needs to be explored in future studies. Initiatives to promote healthy eating should focus on education, habits and consciousness of a healthy diet, but also at reducing the high cost of fruit and vegetables. There is further a need for developing appropriate indicators for adolescent socio-economic status. </p...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo {{principal}} deste estudo foi avaliar o grau de intensidade com que as clínicas médicas privadas utilizam e combinam os componentes de seu marketing de relacionamento, sob as perspectivas de seus gerentes e também dos clientes externos. O setor de serviços de saúde privada é um dos que mais crescem no mundo em virtude da, entre outros fatores, maior disponibilidade de serviços de saúde domésticos. Tais interações indicam necessidades de estabelecer relacionamentos mais duradouros com os clientes. Para atender aos objetivos do estudo utilizou-se uma abordagem metodológica exploratória e descritiva. De forma a sustentar na literatura existente, optou-se por aplicar o modelo conceitual de Gordon (1998) que avalia o marketing de relacionamento por meio de oito componentes: cultura e valores; liderança; estratégia; estrutura; recursos humanos; tecnologia; conhecimento e percepção; e processos. Uma amostra de 40 clínicas localizadas em João Pessoa/PB, seus respectivos gerentes e 400 clientes foi utilizada. Os dados foram tratados de forma qualitativa e quantitativa por meio do Mann-Whitney, Análise RIDIT e estatística descritiva. Os resultados sugerem, entre outras coisas, que os componentes do marketing de relacionamento são utilizados moderadamente pelas clínicas médicas privadas. Entretanto, tanto as clínicas quanto os clientes reconhecem a importância da matéria na tentativa de estabelecer relacionamentos longitudinais com os clientes leais. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the degree of intensity with which private clinics use and combine the components of relationship marketing to improve its competitiveness, the perspectives of their managers and also external customers. The sector of private health services is one of the fastest growing in the world because, among other factors, of the increased availability of home health services. Such interactions indicate needs to establish lasting relationships with customers. In order to meet the objectives of the study, a methodological exploratory and descriptive approach was chosen. After reviewing the literature, we decided to apply the conceptual model of Gordon (1998) which assesses the relationship marketing through eight components: culture and values, leadership, strategy, structure, personnel, technology, knowledge and perception; and processes. We used a sample of 40 clinics with their managers and 400 customers. We used quantitative and qualitative methods, such as Mann-Whitney test, <b>analysis</b> <b>RIDIT</b> and descriptive statistics, in the analysis of the data collected. The results suggest, among other things, that the components of relationship marketing are used sparingly by private clinics. However, both clinics and customers acknowledge the importance of the matter in an attempt to establish longitudinal relationships with the loyal clients...|$|R

40|$|Silent {{myocardial}} ischemia {{is common}} in unstable angina, but its prognostic significance is unknown. Fifty-two (42 with subsequent angiography) of 81 patients prospectively evaluated for unstable angina had ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings analyzed by compact analog technique after they had received medical treatment (3 of the 52 had unanalyzable recordings and were excluded). From 1, 103 hours of recordings, 298 ischemic episodes were identified, only 9 % associated with angina. By <b>Ridit</b> <b>analysis</b> a significant correlation {{was found between the}} cumulative duration of transient myocardial ischemia and the number of diseased coronary vessels and indexes of proximal stenosis. During a 3 to 6 month follow-up period, there was one death and one patient was lost to follow-up among 20 patients without transient ischemia; in the group of 11 patients with a cumulative duration of transient ischemia 60 minutes/ 24 h, only 1 developed a stable angina pattern; 12 required coronary surgery (n = 11) or angioplasty (n = 1) and 5 developed myocardial infarction (2 died, 2 needed surgery for postinfarction angina and 1 recovered). A favorable clinical outcome occurred in only 6 % of patients in the group with ischemia duration > 60 minutes/ 24 h; this rate was significantly lower (p < 0. 001) than that (70 %) for the group with ischemia duration 60 minutes/ 24 h or that (95 %) for the group without ischemia.

The patients had undergone upper abdominal operation for which a uniform regime of premedication and anaesthesia had been used. Pain was assessed by an observer before and after treatment and by the subjects, using a five-point scoring scheme. The pain scores before treatment and at 30 -, 60 -, 90 - and 120 -min intervals after treatment were compared by <b>Ridit</b> <b>analysis.</b> All three treatments produced significant relief, but the relief after diazepam alone was not as long-lasting as after the other two treatments.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the validity in Belgium of the National Triage Scale for judgement of the urgency of a patient's condition and making a case-mix description of the patient profiles in the different urgency categories. The study is of a descriptive retrospective and descriptive correlational design and was carried out in the emergency department at the University Hospital Gasthuisberg in Leuven, Belgium. The urgency of patients arriving at the emergency department was evaluated during one randomly selected shift a day over 12 weeks in 1997 by one of the four triage-educated nurses, using an instrument based on the National Triage Scale. Patient identification and outcome parameters were retrieved from the existing computer system. The data were mainly analysed using the <b>Ridit</b> <b>analysis.</b> Overall 3650 patients were evaluated: Category 1, 4. 19 %; Category 2, 24. 44 %; Category 3, 39. 32 %; Category 4, 27. 97 %; Category 5, 4. 08 %. Any similarity between sentinel diagnoses as well as between the admission percentages in this pilot study and the reference from Australia (Z = 0. 827; p > 0. 05) was noted. Different aspects influenced the triage nurses while determining the degree of urgency. Urgency categories profiles revealed a significant effect of age (Kruskall-Wallis = 530. 5; p = 0. 000). Higher categories of urgency resulted in a higher degree of admission (t (df = 3640) = 643. 45; p = 0. 000). It is concluded that a resemblance between the pilot study and the reference confirms the predictive validity of the scale used.

The nine-item version consists of seven sensory items (burning, tingling/prickling, light touching, sudden pain attacks/electric shock-type pain, cold/heat, numbness, and slight pressure), a pain course pattern item, and a pain radiation item. The seven-item version consists {{only of the}} sensory items. Total scores of both versions discriminate average pain-severity levels (mild, moderate, and severe), but their ability to discriminate individual item severity has not been evaluated. Methods: Data were from a cross-sectional, observational study of six neuropathic pain conditions (N= 624). Average pain severity was evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, with severity levels defined using established cut points for distinguishing mild, moderate, and severe pain. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was followed by <b>ridit</b> <b>analysis</b> to represent {{the probability that a}} randomly selected subject from one average pain-severity level had a more favorable outcome on the specific painDETECT item relative to a randomly selected subject from a comparator severity level. Results: A probability > 50 % for a better outcome (less severe pain) was significantly observed for each pain symptom item. The lowest probability was 56. 3 % (on numbness for mild vs moderate pain) and highest probability was 76. 4 % (on cold/heat for mild vs severe pain). The pain radiation item was significant (P< 0. 05) and consistent with pain symptoms, as well as with total scores for both painDETECT versions; only the pain course item did not differ. Conclusion: painDETECT differentiates severity such that the ability to discriminate average pain also distinguishes individual pain item severity in an interpretable manner. Pain-severity levels can serve as proxies to determine treatment effects, thus indicating probabilities for more favorable outcomes on pain symptoms.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} Yunnan white medicinal powder combined with somatostatin and pantoprazole {{in the treatment of}} liver cirrhosis complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleeding and its effect on inflammatory factors. Methods A total of 150 patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were admitted to Shenyang 242 Hospital from April 2016 to March 2017 were enrolled and randomly divided into observation group and control group, with 75 patients in each group. The patients in the control group were given somatostatin for injection+pantoprazole sodium for injection, and those in the observation group were given Yunnan white medicinal powder in addition to the treatment for the control group. The two groups were observed and compared in terms of clinical outcome, blood transfusion volume, time to hemostasis, length of hospital stay, and change in hemoglobin, as well as the changes in the serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) after treatment. The t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between groups, the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups, and the <b>Ridit</b> <b>analysis</b> and the u test were used for ranked data of clinical outcome. Results Compared with the control group, the observation group had a significantly lower blood transfusion volume and significantly shorter time to hemostasis and length of hospital stay (t= 6. 357, 7. 360, and 4. 469, all P＜ 0. 01), as well as a significantly higher level of hemoglobin after treatment (t= 4. 042, P＜ 0. 01). The observation group had a significantly higher overall response rate than the control group (96. 00 % vs 85. 33 %, u= 2. 564, P＜ 0. 05). Both groups had significant reductions in the serum levels of hs-CRP and IL- 6 after treatment (t= 14. 240, 6. 943, 35. 277, and 17. 764, all P＜ 0. 01), and the observation group had a significantly higher level of hs-CRP and IL- 6 than the control group after treatment(t= 7. 984 and 18. 946, both P＜ 0. 01). Conclusion Yunnan white medicinal powder combined with somatostatin and pantoprazole has a marked clinical effect in the treatment of liver cirrhosis complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleeding and can reduce blood transfusion volume, shorten the time to hemostasis and length of hospital stay, and reduce the serum levels of hs-CRP and IL- 6...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{development}} and superior health care are so closely related {{that it is}} impossible to achieve one without the other. While the economic development in India is gaining momentum over the past few decades, our health system is at cross roads today. In this regard, health and health care need to be distinguished from each other for no better reason than that the former is often incorrectly seen as a direct function of the later. Indian healthcare sector is no longer limited to care rendered by or financed by government sector alone but recent time has seen massive participation of private players. At the same time superior service quality in private health care sector has been a major concern as customers have to pay a huge amount of money and effort to avail the services. The major problem in managing service quality lies in its heavy reliance on technical clinical criteria and the absence of ‘customers view’ on the services provided. Thus our main objective is to analyze perceived service quality, customer satisfaction and behavioural intention and looked at the most preferred private healthcare setting as perceived by Indian customers and the reasons thereof. At the same time we investigated and prioritized the diverse factors affecting perceived service quality and value in Indian private healthcare sector. The study uses both probability and non-probability sampling techniques for choosing the hospitals and respondents. Simple random sampling is used for availing respondents’ opinion on the subject whereas convenience and judgmental sampling is used for selection of hospitals. The sample size for respondents is determined by Hair et al., 2003 formula and found to be 384. However as increasing the sample size will reduce the sampling error we have finalized a sample size of 526 from twelve private hospitals of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank order of preferred healthcare setting with respect to the service quality dimensions and relative standings of every service provider with respect to its competitors. For decision making statistical tool such as AHP analysis, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), <b>RIDIT</b> <b>analysis</b> and GREY Relational Analysis (GRA) were used. The exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the underlying dimensions of customer perceived service quality (CPSQ) and customer perceived value (CPV) & confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to confirm the factor structure and validate EFA results.
