5|$|Following Murray's strong end to 2014 and {{reaching}} {{the final of}} the 2015 Australian Open, he moved into the top four in the ATP rankings {{for the first time in}} over year, meaning that the Big Four held the top four places in the rankings for the first time since early 2013, slowing the idea of the <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> the quartet. However, Federer and Nadal both lost in the third round and in the quarterfinals respectively, the first time in 12 appearances that Federer had lost before the semi-finals at the first Grand Slam of the season. Djokovic won the title, as well as the first three Masters titles of the year in Indian Wells (where the Big Four were the top four seeds in ATP Masters 1000 event for the time since 2012), Miami and Monte-Carlo, defeating Murray in the final in Miami (his seventh straight victory against the Brit) and Federer in the final of Indian Wells respectively. With these victories, Djokovic became the only man to win the Indian Wells-Miami sweep on three separate occasions.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the fossils}} {{discovered}} in the Mussentuchit are scattered and disarticulated, with intact skeletons being relatively rare. Although the lakes did not actively destroy bones, it was not particularly conducive to good preservation either due to the long duration of the burial process. Before burial, scavengers could have disrupted the skeletal material, which {{is evident in the}} severed Eolambia tibiae bearing tooth marks {{discovered in the}} Cifelli #2 quarry. The <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> the lake could have occasionally created bogs, but they would not have been permanent enough to entrap and preserve larger vertebrates.

These directions would have been parallel or sub-parallel to the edges of the lake, indicating orientation by lake currents, except for the 69° and 93° azimuths, which probably represent river currents.|$|E

To reduce synkinesis, facial retraining teaches the patient techniques for increasing wanted movements while focusing on restricting unwanted movement. If, for example, the mouth moves whenever the eyes blink voluntarily, facial retraining techniques will teach the patient to slowly close the eyes while actively focusing on keeping the mouth muscles still. Facial retraining has shown to be very successful with almost a 60-70% average decrease in synkinesis reported after 7 months.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Charles Huggins {{reported}} that androgen ablation therapy causes <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> primary and metastatic androgen-dependent prostate cancer. He {{was awarded the}} 1966 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for this discovery. Androgen ablation therapy causes remission in 80-90% of patients undergoing therapy, resulting in a median progression-free survival of 12 to 33 months. After remission, an androgen-independent phenotype typically emerges, wherein the median overall survival is 23–37 months {{from the time of}} initiation of androgen ablation therapy. It is not clear how the prostate cancer becomes androgen-independent or how it reestablishes progression, although a few possibilities (on how) have been proposed. And the way the cancer changes, to overcome the lack of androgen, may vary between individual patients.|$|E

25|$|Fenitrothion {{is a kind}} of {{organophosphate}} and it {{can affect}} the development of reproductive system of male rats. Treatment with fenitrothion to male rats causes <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> androgen-dependent organ weights because fenitrothion is a potent competitive androgen receptor antagonist. Its effect on SDN-POA is different between male rats and female rats. In male rats, prenatal exposure to fenitrothion causes significantly increase of the volume of SDN-POA; whereas, in female rats, prenatal exposure to fenitrothion causes significantly decrease of the volume of SDN-POA. One possible explanation is that fenitrothion can alter the activity of aromatase, which then alters the level of estrogens converted by it from androgens and finally alters the volume of SDN-POA.|$|E

25|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause {{temporary}} <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels. Because of {{the limitations}} and side effects of this medication, it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink {{the size of the}} fibroids and uterus before surgery.

The main side effects are transient postmenopausal symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however, significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency. Several add-back regimes are possible, tibolone, raloxifene, progestogens alone, estrogen alone, and combined estrogens and progestogens.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{evidence}} of increased inflammation combined with demographic features (male sex, age {{less than six}} months or greater than eight years) and incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease. The likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to be determined in large measure by its initial size, in which the smaller aneurysms have a greater likelihood of regression. Other factors are positively associated with the <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> aneurysms, including being younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease, fusiform rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment. The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among those who develop large aneurysms. The worst prognosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms. This severe outcome may require further treatment such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, coronary artery stenting, bypass grafting, and even cardiac transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Testing of Genie's {{language}} occurred {{until the}} end of 1977, but in mid-1975, when she was 18 years old, authorities placed her in a foster care setting which subjected her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, causing her to become afraid to speak and to rapidly begin losing her newly acquired language skills.
