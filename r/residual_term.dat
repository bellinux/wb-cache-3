It is also shown that available <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> fail to account sufficiently for the residual effects, performing actually better when combined with the aforementioned poorer Flory-Huggins and original UNIFAC combinatorial expressions.

This term does not affect the observed acceleration of particles on the surface of m because with respect to M, m (and everything on its surface) is in free fall. When the force on the far particle is subtracted from the force on the near particle, this first term cancels, as do all other even-order terms. The remaining (residual) terms represent the difference mentioned above and are tidal force (acceleration) terms. When ∆r is small compared to R, the terms after the first <b>residual</b> <b>term</b> are very small and can be neglected, giving the approximate tidal acceleration (axial) for the distances ∆r considered, along the axis joining the centers of m and M: ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the response of this system/scheme in terms of stability in presence of explicitly treated <b>residual</b> <b>terms,</b> as it inevitably occurs in the reality of NWP. This sudy is restricted to the impact of thermal and baric <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> (metric <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> linked to the orography are not considered here). It is shown that conversely to what occurs with Hydrostatic Primitive Equations, the choice of the prognostic variables used to solve the system in time is of primary importance for the robustness with Euler Equations. For an optimal choice of prognostic variables, unconditionnally stable schemes can be obtained (with respect to the length of the time-step), but only for a smaller range of reference states than in the case of Hydrostatic Primitive Equations. This study also indicates that: (i) vertical coordinates based on geometrical height and on mass behave similarly in terms of stability for the problems examined here, and (ii) hybrid coordinates induce an intrinsic instability, the practical importance of which is however not completely elucidated in the theoretical context of this paper.

40|$|The {{activity}} coefficient models {{that have been}} proposed for correlation of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) of polymer solutions are often based on an ad-hoc coupling of the combinatorial (free-volume) and <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> available in the literature. The goal of this work is to present {{a comparison of the}} performances of all the possible models that can be obtained based on some of the best and most used combinatorial (free volume) and <b>residual</b> <b>terms.</b> The combinatorial terms studied here are the Entropic free volume, p-free volume and Freed FH and the <b>residual</b> <b>terms</b> the NRF, UNIQUAC and Wu-NRTL along with a segment based UNIQUAC term, sUNIQUAC, here proposed for the first time. All the models investigated have two adjustable parameters and a two-parameter Flory-Huggins model was used as benchmark for comparative purposes. A database of 70 VLE data systems was used to evaluate the different models. It is shown that models based on the p-free volume combinatorial term with a segment based residual part derived from either the NRTL or UNIQUAC models can provide an excellent correlation of VLE data for polymer systems and can describe a wide range of molecular weights using a single pair of interaction parameters. The NRF based models are shown to suffer from some deficiencies that limit their application to dilute solutions...|$|R

Using the data of an unsecured consumer credit provider in South Africa, the in-sample and out-of-sample performance for a seasonal time series model and residual modified model were evaluated.
