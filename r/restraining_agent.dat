Questionnaires completed at home by the dogs&# 39; owners revealed a tendency toward greater incidence of temporary aggression following fentanyl/droperidol as well as a longer recovery period at home as judged by lack of interest in surroundings and lack of response to known commands. Oxymorphone and acepromazine appear to be a satisfactory neuroleptic combination, with fewer undesirable side effects during the recovery period. ...|$|E

In perspective of advantages of fluorine- 18 (favourable half-life, high production capacity, low β-energy), more recently, derivatives based on [18 F]aluminium fluoride complexation have been developed.[2] To achieve high labelling efficiency at biomolecule compatible conditions and improve radiotracer properties in vivo, we synthesized an octreotate conjugate with an acyclic trans-cyclohexane spanned pentadentate chelator: <b>Restrained</b> complexing <b>agent</b> 1, RESCA 1 (1).

30|$|Introduction: The Al 18 F-labelling {{strategy}} involves {{formation of}} aluminium mono[18 F]fluoride ({Al 18 F} 2 +) which is trapped by a suitable chelator –mostly bound to a biomolecule- in aqueous medium. 1 At this moment however, {{the need for}} elevated temperatures (100 - 120 °C) limits its widespread use. Therefore, we designed new <b>restrained</b> complexing <b>agents</b> (RESCAs) for use of this strategy at moderate temperature. RESCA 1 is an acyclic pentadentate ligand with a N 2 O 3 coordinative set that is able to complex {Al 18 F} 2 + efficiently at 25 °C. To evaluate the stability and kinetic inertness of the chelate in vivo, RESCA 1 was conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) and labelled with {Al 18 F}. The Al 18 F-labelled conjugate was monitored in vivo for 6 h p.i.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project {{is meant to}} identify the impact of Real Estate Development {{in the growth of}} Real Estate Agents in Nakuru Municipality. The occupation of real estate broker or real estate agent began in the early nineteenth century. Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, most sales of real property involved lawyers and business persons but not real estate agents as we have come to know them. In some instances, parties to real estate sales had employees who handled the transactions, but those employees were not considered real estate agents or brokers. In light of this the objectives {{of the study was to}} assess the growth as well as identify services the Estate Agents offer to the public. Furthermore, limitations which <b>restrain</b> Estate <b>Agents</b> were identified as well as ascertain if their services has benefited the public. The study was also centered on factors affecting Estate Agents as well as Property Development thus giving a clear picture on their interdependence in regard to access to the Real Estate Market. The sample was selected using random technique. The study used primary data collection method via a questionnaire to collect data on impact of Property Development in Estate Agent Growth. The researcher approached the respondents and requested them to participate in the survey.

Numerous chemopreventive strategies against malignancy have been developed considering the anticancer perspectives of allied nutraceutical constituents. Current evidences have proven an inverse association of spices with that of oncological incidences. The high antioxidant activity of spices derived bioactives triggers the free radicals scavenging ability at cellular level thereby alleviating various metabolic syndromes. Promising compounds including curcumin and curcuminoids (turmeric), limonene (cardamom), allicin, allyl isothiocyanate (garlic), cinnamic aldehyde, 2 -hydroxycinnamaldehyde and eugenol (cinnamon), gingerol, zingiberone, zingiberene (ginger), dipropyle disulfides and quercetin (onion), piperidine piperine, limonene, α- and β-pinene (black pepper), crocetin, crocin and safranal (saffron) have been identified as chemopreventing agents against various malignancies. Chemopreventive properties of spices are mediated by functional bioactive ingredients that arrest the activity of cytochrome P 450 and isozymes CYP 1 A 1, cyclooxygenase- 2, reducing activator of transcription- 3 (STAT- 3) and signal transducer. They are closely associated with tumorigenesis activated by interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) receptors and epidermal growth factor (EGF) relate to an array of tumors.

40|$|Multi-agent {{systems are}} in general {{believed}} to be more efficient, robust, and versatile than their single-agent equivalents. However, {{it is not an}} easy task to design strategies that fully exploit the multi-agent benefits, and with this in mind we address several multi-agent system design issues. Specifically, it is of central importance to determine the optimal agent group composition, which involves a trade-off between the cost and performance increase per additional agent. Further, truly autonomous agents solely rely on on-board environment measurements, the design of which requires quantifying the multi-agent performance {{as a function of the}} locally observed environment areas. In this thesis, we focus on the collaborative search for individually rewarding resources, i. e. it is possible for multiple agents to incur the same reward. The system objective is to maximize the aggregate rewards incurred. Motivated by a cooperative surveillance context, we formulate a graph traversal problem on an unbounded structured graph, and <b>restrain</b> the <b>agent</b> motion spatially so that only the lateral agent separation is controlled. We model the problem mathematically as a discrete, infinite state, infinite horizon Dynamic Program and convert it using standard techniques to an equivalent Linear Program (LP) with infinitely many constraints. The graph spatial invariance allows to decompose the LP into a set of infinitely many coupled LPs, each with finitely many constraints. We establish that the unique bounded function that simultaneously satisfies the latter LPs is the problem optimal value function. (cont.) Based on this, we compute the two-agent optimal value function explicitly as the solution of an LP with finitely many constraints for small agent separations, and implicitly in the form of a recursion for large agent separations, satisfying adequate connection constraints. Finally, we propose a similar method to compute the state probability distribution in steady state under an optimal policy, summarizing the agent behavior at large separations in a set of connection constraints, which is sufficient to compute the probability distribution at small separations. We analyze and compare the optimal performance of various problem instances. We confirm and quantify the intuition that the performance increases with the group size. Some results stand out: for cone-shaped local observation, two agents incur 25 % less cost than a single agent in a mine field type environment (scarce though high costs); further, for some environment specifics, a third agent provides little to no performance increase. Then, we compare various local observation zones, and quantify their effect on the overall group performance. Finally, we study the agent spatial distribution under an optimal policy, and observe that as rewards are scarcer, the agents tend to spread in order to gather information on a larger environment part. by Jan De Mot.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) is a sensitive, non-invasive imaging technology that produces three-dimensional images showing the in vivo concentration of radiotracers, {{which are usually}} labelled with short-lived positron emitting radioisotopes. Among β+-emitting radioisotopes, fluorine- 18 is currently the radionuclide of choice for PET because of its favourable nuclear decay characteristics and ease of production. Clinicians in the molecular imaging community are not only interested in in using small organic molecules but also high molecular weight biomolecules and peptides are increasingly being considered for use as PET-radiopharmaceuticals. However, the incorporation of fluorine- 18 into heat-sensitive and complex biomolecules creates substantial challenges for radiochemists. The Al 18 F-labelling method {{is a relatively new}} approach that allows radiofluorination of biomolecules such as peptides and proteins in a one-step procedure and in aqueous solution. McBride et al. published the first study using a chelator for {Al 18 F} 2 + labelling in 2009. Although many studies demonstrated the versatility of the Al 18 F approach to radiolabel peptides, the approach has limited applicability for heat sensitive biomolecules due to high temperatures required for the complexation reaction (≥ 100 °C) when used with macrocyclic complexing agents such as NOTA and NODA. Therefore the objective of this thesis was to develop new polydentate ligands that allow chelation of {Al 18 F} 2 + at moderate temperatures (< 40 °C), whilst maintaining in vivo stability. In this thesis, we identified new chelators that allow efficient complexation of {Al 18 F} 2 + using mild labelling conditions, whilst maintaining in vivo stability. The first set of chelators that we developed are acyclic ligands with an N 2 O 3 coordinative set or N 3 O 2 bis-phenol structure. It was observed that only ligands containing the fragment ethylenediamine-N,N’-diacetic acid (H 3 L 1 -L 4) were able to efficiently chelate aluminium fluoride. Ligands without this arrangement of functional groups (H 3 L 5 - 8) did not complex aluminium fluoride with good RCY under the conditions tested. Successful labelling of two compounds, (H 3 L 1) and (H 3 L 3) was established. H 3 L 1 and H 3 L 3 both have excellent labelling properties but, unfortunately, [18 F]AlF-L 1 was not stable in vitro. [18 F]AlF-L 3 complex demonstrated a stability in PBS and in rat plasma comparable to that of the previously reported [18 F]AlF-N-benzyl-NODA complex, up to 60 minutes, but suffered from decomplexation after extended incubation times. Although in vitro incubation in rat plasma showed slow decomposition, biodistribution of [18 F]AlF-L 3 showed absence of bone uptake indicating that in vivo defluorination or demetalation if any, is limited. Optimal labelling results were obtained at pH 4. 5 - 5 and {{it has been shown that}} the specific activity of fluorine- 18 proves to be an important parameter for the Al 18 F chelation yield. The acyclic chelator H 3 L 3 demonstrated to be a good lead candidate for labelling of heat-sensitive biomolecules with fluorine- 18. However, there was still room for improvement regarding the stability of the [18 F]AlF-L 3 complex, so that the synthesis of improved derivatives was warranted. We explored whether incorporation of a trans-cyclohexyl moiety into H 3 L 1, to form <b>restrained</b> complexing <b>agent</b> 1 (RESCA 1), would increase steric rigidity of the AlF-complex, improving the orientation of the chelating groups and as a result improving the stability of the resulting AlF-complex. RESCA 1 is an acyclic pentadentate ligand with an N 2 O 3 coordinative set of donor atoms and was synthesised starting from commercially available chemicals. RESCA 1 as such showed excellent labelling properties and its Al 18 F-complex demonstrated high in vitro and in vivo stability. Small changes in the backbone of RESCA 1, to form RESCA 2 - 5, resulted in minor to major loss of stability of the corresponding Al 18 F-complexes and thus, RESCA 1 was found to be the most promising lead candidate for radiolabelling heat-sensitive biomolecules via the Al 18 F-method. To demonstrate the generic applicability of the proposed method we successfully labelled the heat-sensitive biomolecule Human Serum Albumin (HSA) at ambient temperature with {Al 18 F} 2 + with high radiochemical purity in less than 30 minutes. [18 F]AlF-RESCA 1 -HSA showed excellent in vitro and in vivo stability. Moreover, [18 F]AlF-RESCA 1 -HSA showed favourable properties for PET blood pool imaging applications. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in a majority of primary and metastatic prostate cancer patients and is a very promising target for specific prostate cancer imaging and therapy. Currently, [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBEDD-CC is the most widely used PSMA-ligand. This urea-based PSMA inhibitor demonstrates excellent pharmacokinetics as well as stability in vivo, leading to its clinical applications worldwide for imaging of prostate cancer. However, labelling with fluorine- 18 would offer advantages with respect to availability, batch size, and image resolution compared to labelling with gallium- 68. In this thesis we have developed three new Al 18 F-labelled urea-based PSMA inhibitors, [18 F]AlF-PSMA-L 3, [18 F]AlF-PSMA-NODA-MPAA and [18 F]AlF-PSMA-RESCA 1. Cell uptake and internalisation experiments with LNCaP (PSMA+) and PC- 3 (PSMA-) cells revealed similar specific internalisation and cell accumulation for [18 F]AlF-PSMA-RESCA 1 and [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC. In contrast, [18 F]AlF-PSMA-NODA-MPAA and [18 F]AlF-PSMA-L 3 showed considerable lower uptake in LNCaP cells. Moreover, [18 F]AlF-PSMA-L 3 suffers from instability over time which compromises the utility of this tracer. All tracers were cleared fast from plasma and PSMA-negative tissue mainly by the kidneys but also hepatobiliary excretion was observed in the case of [18 F]AlF-RESCA 1 -PSMA. High specific accumulation of all tracers was observed on PSMA+ LNCaP tumour slices and autoradiography on human prostate tumour tissue showed specific affinity for the human PSMA receptor. Comparable specific tumor uptake was observed for [18 F]AlF-PSMA-RESCA 1 and [68 Ga]Ga-HBEDD-CC-PSMA in a head-to-head comparison in PSMA+ tumor bearing mice. To conclude, [18 F]AlF-PSMA-RESCA 1 might be a promising tool for early detection of prostate cancer recurrence. Nanobodies are promising tools in molecular imaging and have many advantages in comparison with full-size antibodies. We demonstrated that the Al 18 F-method using RESCA 1 provides an efficient approach to radiolabel nanobodies with fluorine- 18 at ambient temperature. We successfully derivatised nanobodies targeting the CRIg receptor with RESCA 1 and labelled the conjugate with {Al 18 F} 2 + in good radiochemical yields at ambient temperature. [18 F]AlF-RESCA 1 -NbV 4 m 119 was purified with preparative HPLC resulting in the Al 18 F-tracer with a radiochemical purity higher than 97 % and the compound showed excellent in vitro stability. Furthermore, we successfully optimised a generic radio-HPLC-HRMS system for the analysis and quality control of radiolabelled nanobodies. Biodistribution studies in mice showed that [18 F]AlF-RESCA 1 -NbV 4 m 119 was mainly excreted via the renal pathway but also high liver uptake was observed in normal WT mice, which is expected because CRIg receptors are highly expressed on Kupffer cells. Biodistribution and microPET studies in CRIg-/- mice demonstrated absence of significant uptake in liver, indicating excellent specificity of the Al 18 F-labelled tracer. Almost no intact [18 F]AlF-RESCA 1 -NbV 4 m 119 was found in urine at 3 h p. i. and relatively high bone uptake was observed, indicating in vivo instability of the tracer. However, in vivo PET imaging in mice did not show significant bone uptake at 1 h p. i. and high liver-to background images were obtained, indicating favourable in vivo imaging properties of [18 F]AlF-RESCA 1 -NbV 4 m 119 with high specificity for CRIg. This generic radiolabelling, purification and characterisation method provides a general approach for radiolabelling of nanobodies with fluorine- 18. In conclusion, the acyclic chelator RESCA 1 demonstrated to be a good lead candidate for labelling of heat-sensitive biomolecules with fluorine- 18. This new class of AlF-chelators may have a great impact on PET radiochemical space as it will stimulate the rapid development of new fluorine- 18 labelled peptides and other heat-sensitive biomolecules. However, more basic research is needed before this method can result in a kit-based, radiolabelling strategy. status: publishe...|$|R
