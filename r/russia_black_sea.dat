40|$|The Black Sea is {{a region}} of vital {{interest}} to the foreign investor. This study examines the six countries that border it (Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria) and presents the financial outlook and the foreign direct investment performance of each state. The main {{focus is on the}} analysis of the legislation related to the promotion and protection of investments. This is done with the aim of providing information about the opportunities and pitfalls of doing business in the area. The main conclusion is that the Black Sea presents great opportunities that remain largely unrealized. The reasons for this are mainly administrative barriers and the lack of legal certainty and enforcement. Law, FDI, <b>Russia,</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> Investment, Growth, Development...|$|E
