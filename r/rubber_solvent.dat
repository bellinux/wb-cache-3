An overview of occupational exposures from tire manufacturing operations is outlined. The engineering control strategy is summarized. General work practices and recommendations {{to improve conditions}} or to minimize hazards are discussed. The observed importance of work practices is described. Challenges {{in the implementation of}} proper work practices are discussed. Results of 13 preliminary surveys in tire manufacturing factories, particularly in different areas of processing, compounding, banbury loading, milling and curing, and tread cementing are outlined. Limits are set by NIOSH and are given as time weighted averages for occupational exposure to the air contaminants benzene (71432), carbon-black (1333864), heptane (142825), hexane (110543), pentane (109660), toluene (108883), xylene (1330207), talc(14807966), alkanes with five to eight carbons, <b>rubber</b> <b>solvent,</b> nuisance dust, asbestos (1332214), petroleum distillate, and refined petroleum solvents.

40|$|The exhaust {{emission}} of the {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) considered toxic to human health were investigated on two spark ignition light duty vehicles, one being gasohol (Gasohol, in Brazil, is the generic denomination for mixtures of pure gasoline plus 20 - 25 % of anhydrous ethyl alcohol fuel (AEAF).) -fuelled {{and the other a}} flexible-fuel vehicle fuelled with hydrated ethanol. The influence of fuel type and quality, aged lubricant oil type and use of fuel additives on the formation of these compounds was tested using standardized tests identical to US FTP- 75 cycle. PAH sampling and chemical analysis followed the basic recommendations of method TO- 13 (United States. Environmental Protection Agency, 1999. Compendium Method TO- 13 A - Determination of polycyclic Aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in Ambient Air Using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (CG/MS). Center for environmental research information, Cincinnati, p. 78), with the necessary modification for this particular application. Results showed that the total PAH emission factor varied from 41. 9 mu g km(- 1) to 612 mu g km(- 1) in the gasohol vehicle, and from 11. 7 mu g km(- 1) to 27. 4 mu g km(- 1) in the ethanol-fuelled vehicle, a significant difference in favor of the ethanol vehicle. Generally, emission of light molecular weight PAHs was predominant, while high molecular weights PAHs were not detected. In terms of benzo(a) pyrene toxicity equivalence, emission factors varied from 0. 00984 mu g TEQ km(- 1) to 4. 61 mu g TEQ km(- 1) for the gasohol vehicle and from 0. 0117 mu g TEQ km(- 1) to 0. 0218 mu g TEQ km(- 1) in the ethanol vehicle. For the gasohol vehicle, results showed that the use of fuel additive causes {{a significant increase in the}} emission of naphthalene and phenanthrene at a confidence level of 90 % or higher; the use of <b>rubber</b> <b>solvent</b> on gasohol showed a reduction in the emission of naphthalene and phenanthrene at the same confidence level; the use of synthetic oil instead of mineral oil also contributed significantly to a decrease in the emission of naphthalene and fluorene. In relation to the ethanol vehicle, the same factors were tested and showed no statistically significant influence on PAH emission. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|In the {{preparation}} of GR-S using the Mutual recipe considerable gel formation occurs after about 80 % conversion, producing polymer of such inferior quality that the reaction must be stopped before this point has been reached. Efficient plant operation then depends upon recovery of the unchanged styrene and butadiene[ [...] . ] In both the recovered butadiene and styrene, polymerization may occur to produce a polymer, which is practically insoluble {{in any of the}} usual <b>rubber</b> <b>solvents.</b> This polymer usually occurs as a deposit in the condensers, in the styrene recovery unit, while the counterpart in the butadiene recovery occurs mainly in the rerun tower. Since the insoluble polymer formed from styrene containing small amounts of butadiene is usually white and has a cauliflower-like appearance, it is known as “popcorn” polymer. Insoluble butadiene polymer is usually glassy and brittle and varies in color from white to green or brown. Both types of popcorn show such proliferative activity that at intervals, production may have to be stopped to clean the condensers mechanically. In the recovery units of the Polymer Corporation plant at Sarnia, Canada, it has been necessary on occasion, to cut the styrene condensers apart to remove the popcorn. The economic waste of such an operation is apparent.

40|$|Although contact {{dermatitis}} (CD) from eyeglass frames is uncommon, occasionally {{it may be}} encountered. Various substances may cause allergic CD, including metals, cosmetics, plastics, <b>rubber,</b> <b>solvents,</b> antioxidants, dyes, and waxes, some {{of which can be}} found in the average eyeglass frame. Recently, it has been determined that plasticizers, UV stabilizers and nickel are the most common allergens. Thus CD from eyeglass frames should be suspected in patients with retroauricular dermatitis or with lesions on the point of contact with the skin. Sometimes, the question is raised whether skin lesions result from allergy or just irritation. It has also been found that the varnish applied to eyeglass frames could be a source of nickel. Sometimes, although the frame looks silver or gold, it may contain nickel. Additionally, palladium or titanium eyeglass frames have also been reported to result in allergic CD. Some titanium frames contain palladium, which may cause CD. Plastic frames occasionally present the problem as they contain a combination of materials, making it difficult to determine the exact composition. Most plastic glasses are made of zyl or propionate, and may contain other materials, such as nylon, carbon, polycarbonate, optyl and polyamid. Patch (epicutaneous) test on contact allergens with analysis of softened scrapings from frames is a valuable diagnostic method for these patients. Although topical corticosteroid therapy results in transient clinical resolution, they do not preclude recurrences and changing frame material is often the only solution for these patients. Additionally, hypoallergenic eyeglass frames are also available on the market...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Natural rubber distinguishes {{itself by}} its {{particular}} mechanical properties. It {{has become an}} al-most irreplaceable important component part in industrial applications such as vibration isolator, sealing system, flexible piping or structural bearing.

40|$|AbstractUnder cyclic loading, {{elastomeric}} material exhibits strong inelastic responses such as stress-softening due to Mullins effect, hysteresis and permanent set.

The swollen rubbers are obtained by immersing dry ones in solvent until desired degrees of swelling are achieved.

Molecular contribution concept as well as innovative computer search procedures have been employed. Both moderately polar and strongly polar (hydrogen bonding) chemicals including acetates, alcohols, ketones, ethers, chlorinated organics, water, ammonia are evaluated and compared with experimental data. ^ Chain-of-rotators equation of state is extended to describe fluid phase equilibria in polymer solutions by introducing mixing rules into the equation. New mixing rules obtained from excess Gibbs free energy models are investigated with the view of describing polymer solution phase behaviors for systems of polar solvents plus polymers or non-polar solvents plus polymers. Vapor-liquid equilibria are calculated in natural <b>rubber</b> - <b>solvent,</b> poly(dimethylsiloxane) - solvent, polyethylene - solvent, poly(ethylene glycol) - solvent, poly(ethylene oxide) - solvent, polyisobutylene - solvent, polyisoprene - solvent, polypropylene - solvent, poly(propylene glycol) - solvent, polystyrene - solvent, poly(vinyl acetate) - solvent, and poly(vinyl chloride) - solvent. With only two parameters from the modified Wilson model, each mixture system can completely be described by the chain-of-rotators equation of state at various temperatures. Results are shown and compared with several recently developed models. ^ With the binary interaction parameter cubic (BIP 3) mixing rules, the chain-of-rotators equation of state is further applied to various binary polymer mixtures or blends to study the compatibility of polymer systems.

40|$|Fossil fuels {{are used}} as raw {{materials}} for the manufacture of synthetic organic materials, e. g. plastics, fibres, synthetic <b>rubber,</b> paints, <b>solvents,</b> fertilisers, surfactants, lubricants and bitumen. Since fossil carbon is embodied in these products they may be particularly relevant to climate change. This thesis analyses the production, use and waste management of synthetic organic materials. The main research questions are to determine · how much the production and waste management of synthetic organic materials contribute {{to the release of}} CO 2 emissions and · to what extent these emissions could be reduced in the short term by improved material management, including recycling, re-use, energy recovery and the use of bio-based resources as feedstocks. The thesis aims to answer these research questions for Germany, which accounts for about one quarter of the total production of synthetic organic materials and products in Western Europe. In Chapter 2, firstly a Material Flow Analysis (MFA) is conducted and secondly, the IPCC Reference Approach is applied. A prerequisite for the application of both methods is that statistical data for carbon feedstocks as published in national energy balances comply with a common definition. The analyses for Germany, Italy and the Netherlands show that this is not always the case a fact which shows the importance of data harmonisation. If harmonised data are used for Germany the results determined according to the two methods correspond well. In Chapter 3, a model to estimate a the total amount of plastics waste in a country is developed and applied. According to the model results for Germany the amount of post-consumer plastics waste will rise from 4. 6 Mt in 1995 to 6. 2 - 7. 2 Mt in 2005 and could easily reach a value in the range of 12 - 14 Mt in 2025. Chapter 4 studies the energy requirements and the CO 2 emissions related to the production of organic intermediates and plastics. In Chapter 5 and 6, surfactants made from vegetable oils are compared to petrochemical surfactants and to biodiesel with regard to energy use and CO 2 emissions. One important finding is that the savings of non-renewable energy and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions are higher if vegetable oils {{are used as}} a feedstock to produce chemicals compared to their use for biofuels. Chapter 7 analyses recycling and energy recovery strategies for post-consumer plastics. Based on the results of earlier chapters, Chapter 8 studies the total system of production and waste management of synthetic organic materials in Germany in present and future. In 1995, the entire system required 1700 PJ of non-renewable primary energy and 57 Mt CO 2 of fossil origin were emitted. The technical saving potential by the year 2005 is estimated at 220 PJ of energy and 14 Mt of CO 2. These figures include the use of waste as a resource (recycling, re-use, energy recovery) and material production using biomass-derived feedstocks.

30|$|Dyes {{are widely}} used in various {{industries}} such as textile, leather, paper, printing, food, cosmetics, paint, pigments, petroleum, <b>solvent,</b> <b>rubber,</b> plastic, pesticide, wood preserving chemicals, and pharmaceutical industry. Over 10, 000 of different commercial dyes and pigments exist currently and more than 7  ×  105 tonnes are produced annually worldwide [1, 2, 3]. Discharge of dye-bearing wastewaters into the natural environment from textile, paper and leather industries causes a serious threat for the aquatic life [4]. On the other hand, limited aquatic resources and increasing demand for safe water require efficient water treatment methods [5]. Synthetic dyes are generally resistant to biodegradation and physicochemical techniques for their removal [6, 7], such as adsorption, chemical oxidation, electrocoagulation and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been extensively used to comply {{with more and more}} stringent legislation regarding the maximum allowable dye concentration in wastewaters [7, 8, 9, 10]. Methylene blue (MB) is a thiazine cationic dye with widespread applications, including coloring paper, dyeing cottons, wools and coating for paper stock. It is also used in microbiology, surgery and diagnostics and as a sensitizer in photo-oxidation of organic pollutants. Although it has low toxicity, it can cause some specific harmful effects for the human health such as heartbeat increase, vomiting, shocks, cyanosis, jaundice and tissue necrosis [11, 12]. Hence, its removal from wastewaters is an important issue for the environmental protection [13]. The conventional methods have been extensively used for treating waters contaminated with heavy metal and dyes [14, 15, 16]. However, these methods present some disadvantages such as high cost, low removal efficiency and production of excessive toxic sludge [17]. Recently, inexpensive, ecofriendly and not pathogenic organisms have been used for the dye removal [18]. In this respect, the biosorption process has attracted a great interest in this context, and seems a good alternative for the removal of dyes and other pollutants from wastewaters [19, 20], as a replacement for costly commercially biosorbents [21]. It can be defined as sequestering of organic or inorganic compounds by alive or dead biomasses or their derivatives; the biomass can consist of bacteria [22], fungal [19], yeasts [22], algae [23], seaweeds and even industrial or agricultural wastes [24, 25]. Different vegetal biomasses have been used such as Opuntia ficus indica [26], Sugar beet pulp [21], Stoechospermum marginatum [24], Scolymus hispanicus L. [27], Palm kernel [28], Pinus brutia Ten.
