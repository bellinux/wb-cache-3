50|$|The {{failure of}} a firm of De Neufville’s size - almost half {{as large as the}} Bank of Amsterdam itself - shocked the markets. The {{immediate}} victims were a group of firms known as “cashiers.” The cashiers were about 30-40 financial intermediaries whose activities formed a bridge between the large banks and merchants. Traditionally, the cashiers had served as brokers in the market for bank funds. By {{the last half of the}} eighteenth century, their activities had expanded to include settlement of bills denominated in current guilders, deposit taking, and even the issue of cashier’s receipts that circulated locally as bank notes. The cashiers were run hard during the first days of the crisis, as panicked holders of cashier’s receipts demanded coin from the issuers. The contraction of the bill market put the Amsterdam merchant bankers under heavy pressure, as their ability to <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>funding</b> was several constricted.|$|E
50|$|While HSAs can be <b>rolled</b> <b>over</b> from <b>fund</b> to fund, an HSA {{cannot be}} rolled into an IRA or a 401(k), and funds from such {{investment}} vehicles cannot be rolled into an HSA, {{except for the}} one-time IRA transfer mentioned earlier. Unlike some employer contributions to a 401(k) plan, all HSA contributions belong to the participant immediately, regardless of the deposit source. A person contributing to an HSA is {{under no obligation to}} contribute to an employer-sponsored HSA, but employers may require that payroll contributions be made only to the sponsored HSA plan.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how workers use 401 (k) plans by examining their participation, contribution, and withdrawal decisions. Sixty-five percent of eligible workers participate in 401 (k) plans. Employee participation rises with income, age, job tenure, and education. While participation also rises if the employer matches contributions, 401 (k) participation does not grow with {{the rate of}} matching. When pension plan assets are withdrawn in lump-sum distributions before retirement, just 28 percent of distribution recipients (representing 56 percent of distribution assets) <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> the withdrawn <b>funds</b> into tax-qualified savings plans. Our findings suggest that many workers, particularly those with low incomes, do not use 401 (k) plans to save for An increasing fraction {{of the work force}} is being offered an employer-sponsored pension plan where the worker makes the critical plan decisions. These decisions include whether to participate, how much to contribute, how to invest the plan assets, and {{what to do with the}} plan assets shoul...|$|R
40|$|Many {{organizations}} fund {{their spending}} {{out of a}} fixed budget that expires at year’s end. Faced with uncertainty over future spending demands, these organizations {{have an incentive to}} build a buffer stock of <b>funds</b> <b>over</b> {{the front end of the}} budget cycle. When demand does not materialize, they then rush to spend these funds on lower quality projects at the end of the year. We test these predictions using data on procurement spending by the U. S. federal government. Using data on all federal contracts from 2004 through 2009, we document that spending spikes in all major federal agencies during the 52 nd week of the year as the agencies rush to exhaust expiring budget authority. Spending in the last week of the year is 4. 9 times higher than the rest-of-the-year weekly average. We examine the relative quality of year-end spending using a newly available dataset that tracks the quality of $ 130 billion in information technology (I. T.) projects made by federal agencies. Consistent with the model, average project quality falls at the end of the year. Quality scores in the last week of the year are 2. 2 to 5. 6 times more likely to be below the central value. To explore the impact of allowing agencies to <b>roll</b> unused spending <b>over</b> into subsequent fiscal years, we study the I. T. contracts of an agency with special authority to <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> unused <b>funding.</b> We show that there is only a small end-of-year I. T. spending spike in this agency and that the one major I. T. contract this agency issued in the 52 nd week of the year has a quality rating that is well above average. ∗ We are grateful to Steven Kelman and Shelley Metzenbaum for conversations that stimulated our interest in this topic.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of foreign exchange}} (FX) swaps {{as a source of}} funding and as a hedging tool has focused attention {{on the role of the}} FX swap market in the recent crisis. The turbulence in international money markets spilled over into the FX swap market in the second-half of 2007 and into 2008, giving rise to concerns over the ability of banks to <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> their <b>funding</b> requirements and manage their liquidity risk. The turmoil also raised questions about banks'' ability to continue their supply of credit to the local economy, as well as the external financing gap it could create. In this paper, we examine the channels through which FX swap transactions could affect a country''s financial and economic stability, and highlight the strategies central banks can employ to mitigate market pressures. While not offering any judgment on the instrument itself, we show that the use of FX swaps for funding and hedging purposes is not infallible, especially during periods of market stress.
