40|$|Among all engine {{auxiliary}} units {{a cooling}} fan is the noisiest. There are two mechanisms that generate the overall noise of the fan: the rotational and non-rotational one. These mechanisms depend on the fans geometry and operation conditions. The <b>rotational</b> <b>noise</b> {{is characterized by a}} broadband noise and superimposed discrete frequency tones. The superimposed tones are linked with the blade passage frequency and its higher harmonics. In heavily loaded conditions (at the lower flow rate) non-rotational noise is found to be prevailing. The non-rotational noise spectrum has a peak at frequency that is not related to the rotational speed or blade passage frequency. <b>Rotational</b> <b>noise</b> is mainly the consequence of the fluctuating forces on the rotor blades and is provoked by the interaction of the rotor blades with the nearby stationary objects. Non-rotational noise is caused by: a) laminar boundary layer vortex shedding, b) blade interaction with the tip clearance vortex and c) blade stall.

40|$|Abstract—Three-dimensional {{rotational}} angiography (3 DRA) {{is a new}} {{and promising}} technique for obtaining high-resolution isotropic 3 D images of vascular structures. However, due to the relatively high noise level {{and the presence of}} other background structures in clinical 3 DRA images, noise reduction is inevitable. In this paper, we evaluate a number of linear and nonlinear diffusion techniques for this purpose. Specifically, we analyze the effects of these techniques on the threshold-based visualization and quantification of vascular anomalies in 3 DRA images. The results of in-vitro experiments indicate that edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion filtering is most suitable: the increase in the user-dependency of visualizations and quantifications is considerably less with this technique compared to linear filtering techniques, and it is better at reducing noise near edges than isotropic nonlinear diffusion. However, in view of the memory and computation-time requirements of this technique, the latter scheme may be considered a useful alternative.

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>rotational</b> spin <b>noise</b> (referred to as timing noise) in non-accreting pulsars: millisecond pulsars, canonical pulsars, and magnetars. Particular {{attention is}} placed on quantifying the strength and non-stationarity of timing noise in millisecond pulsars because the long-term stability of these objects is required to detect nanohertz gravitational radiation. We show that a single scaling law is sufficient to characterize timing noise in millisecond and canonical pulsars while the same scaling law underestimates the levels of timing noise in magnetars. The scaling law, along with a detailed study of the millisecond pulsar B 1937 + 21, leads us to conclude that timing noise is latent in most millisecond pulsars and will be measurable in many objects when better arrival time estimates are obtained over long data spans. The sensitivity of a pulsar timing array to gravitational radiation is strongly affected by any timing noise. We conclude that detection of proposed gravitational wave backgrounds will require the analysis of more objects than previously suggested over data spans that depend on the spectra of both the gravitational wave background and of the timing noise. It is imperative to find additional millisecond pulsars in current and future surveys {{in order to reduce}} the effects of timing noise. Comment: 16 pages and 6 figures. ApJ, accepte...|$|R

They can be extended to characterize temporal or dynamical aspects by mapping neural responses in dynamical state spaces. The state-space receptive field of a neuron is the probability distribution of the dynamical state of the stimulus-generating system conditioned upon the occurrence of a spike. We have computed state-space receptive fields for semicircular canal afferent neurons in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana).

40|$|A {{technique}} of on-line identification of linear system characteristics from sensory systems with spike train or analog voltage outputs {{was developed and}} applied to the semicircular canal. A pseudorandom binary white noise input was cross-correlated with the system's output to produce estimates of linear system unit impulse responses (UIRs), which were then corrected for response errors of the input transducers. The effects of variability in the system response characteristics and sensitivity were studied by employing the technique with known linear analog circuits. First-order unit afferent responses from the guitarfish horizontal semicircular canal were cross-correlated with white <b>noise</b> <b>rotational</b> acceleration inputs to produce non-parametric UIR models. In addition, the UIRs were fitted by nonlinear regression to truncated exponential series to produce parametric models {{in the form of}} low-order linear system equations. The experimental responses to the white noise input were then compared with those predicted from the UIR models linear convolution, and the differences were expressed as a percent mean-square-error (%MSE). The average difference found from a population of 62 semicircular canal afferents was relatively low mean and standard deviation of 10. 2 +/- 5. 9 SD%MSE, respectively. This suggests that relatively accurate inferences can be made concerning the physiology of the semicircular canal from the linear characteristics of afferent responses...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of fuel cost escalation and increased stringent engine emission regulations, interest in counter-rotating open rotor engines (CRORs) has been renewed. R&D efforts are currently ongoing to develop the technologies required to ensure the appropriate levels of structural integrity, noise, vibrations and reliability. The assessment {{of the impact of}} the main low pressure preliminary design and control parameters of CRORs on mission fuel burn, certification noise and emissions is necessary to identify optimum design regions. These assessments aid the development process when compromises need to be performed as {{a consequence}} of design, operational or regulatory constraints. These assessments are not possible with the state-of-the-art aero-engine preliminary design simulation tools. Novel 0 -D performance models for counter-rotating propellers (CRPs) and differential planetary gearboxes, as well as 1 -D and 0 -D performance models for counter-rotating turbines (CRTs) were developed and verified using available data. These models were used to create 0 -D pusher geared (GOR) and direct drive (DDOR) open rotor engine performance simulation modules allowing the independent definition of the design and operation of each of the two counter-rotating parts of the CRP and CRT. A multi-disciplinary preliminary design simulation framework was built using the novel engine performance modules together with dedicated CROR aircraft performance, engine geometry and weight, gaseous emissions and certification noise simulation modules. Design space exploration and trade-off studies were performed and minimum fuel burn design regions were identified for both the pusher GOR and DDOR. A 160 PAX aircraft flying a business mission of 500 NM was chosen for these studies. Based on the assumptions made, the main conclusions of these studies are as follows. · Fuel burn reductions of ~ 1 - 2 % are possible through optimised propeller control · The propeller diameter for minimum mission fuel burn lies between 4. 26 and 4. 7 m · The design nozzle pressure ratio for minimum mission fuel burn lies between 1. 55 and 1. 6 · CRPs with 13 or 14 blades per propeller provide minimum mission fuel burn · Increasing spacing between the propellers reduces noise significantly (~ 6 EPNdB for each certification point) with a relatively small fuel burn penalty (~ 0. 3 - 0. 5 %) · Relative to unclipped designs, 20 % clipped CRPs reduce flyover noise by at least 2. 5 EPNdB and approach noise by at least 4. 5 EPNdB. The corresponding fuel burn penalty is ~ 2 % for a GOR and ~ 3. 5 % for a DDOR. · Sideline and flyover noise can be reduced by increasing the diameter of the CRP and appropriately controlling CRP <b>rotational</b> speeds. Approach <b>noise</b> can be reduced by either reducing the diameters or the rotational speeds of the propellers. · The rotational speed of the forward propeller for minimum noise is higher than that for minimum mission fuel burn for all the studied CROR designs. · Regardless of clipping, reducing the rotational speed of the rear propeller relative to the forward propeller reduces noise and, to a certain limit, also mission fuel burn. (further reductions in rotational speed would have an adverse effect on fuel burn) · An increase in the number of blades results in an increase in certification noise. The main recommendations for further work are as follows. · Integrating the 1 -D CRT model with the 0 -D DDOR performance model in order to assess the impact of different CRT design criteria at engine and mission levels · Developing preliminary design methods to account for changes in aircraft weight and aerodynamics due to changes in engine design and required cabin noise treatment...|$|R
