A hybrid approach associating a virtual city [1] and a simplified physical ElectroMagnetic (EM) model has been retained. To extract such simplified EM model, numerical tools are to be used instead of extensive measurements campaigns. The tools mentioned above are based on asymptotical methods such as Physical Optics (PO) and ray-based algorithms. One of the main drawbacks of such techniques is that their validity domain is restricted to objects larger than several wavelengths. The commonly admitted limit for PO algorithm is between three to four wavelengths [2].|$|E

40|$|Action {{potential}} {{generation is}} governed by the opening, inactivation, and recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels. A channel’s voltage-sensing and pore-forming alpha subunit bears an intrinsic fast inactivation particle that mediates both onset of inactivation upon membrane depolarization and rapid recovery upon repolarization. We describe here a novel inactivation particle housed within an accessory channel subunit (A-type FHF protein) that mediates rapid-onset, long-term inactivation of several sodium channels. The channel-intrinsic and tethered FHF-derived particles, both situated at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, compete for induction of inactivation, causing channels to progressively accumulate into the long-term refractory state during multiple cycles of membrane depolarization. Intracellular injection of a short peptide corresponding to the FHF particle can <b>reproduce</b> <b>channel</b> long-term inactivation in a dose-dependent manner and can inhibit repetitive firing of cerebellar granule neurons.

40|$|Determining {{the effect}} of a {{compound}} on IKr is a standard screen for drug safety. Often the effect is described using a single IC 50 value, which is unable to capture complex effects of a drug. Using verapamil as an example, we present a method for using recordings from native myocytes at several drug doses along with qualitative features of IKr from published studies of HERG current to estimate parameters in a mathematical model of the drug effect on IKr. IKr was recorded from canine left ventricular myocytes using ruptured patch techniques. A voltage command protocol was used to record tail currents at voltages from − 70 to − 20  mV, following activating pulses over a wide range of voltages and pulse durations. Model equations were taken from a published IKr Markov model and the drug was modeled as binding to the open state. Parameters were estimated using a combined global and local optimization algorithm based on collected data with two additional constraints on IKrI–V relation and IKr inactivation. The method produced models that quantitatively reproduce both the control IKr kinetics and dose dependent changes in the current. In addition, the model exhibited use and rate dependence. The results suggest that: (1) the technique proposed here has the practical potential to develop data-driven models that quantitatively <b>reproduce</b> <b>channel</b> behavior in native myocytes; (2) the method can capture important drug effects that cannot be reproduced by the IC 50 method. Although the method was developed for IKr, the same strategy can be applied to other ion channels, once appropriate channel-specific voltage protocols and qualitative features are identified...|$|R

The results show a generally good accordance of the simulated performance with the outcomes of the experiments. Moreover, given the absence of a widely agreed upon underwater channel model, and the recent interest in incorporating more accurate propagation simulators into network simulators, we compare the measured channel impulse responses against those obtained through the ray tracing tool Bellhop, and give some observations about the suitability of the tool for the purpose of <b>reproducing</b> realistic <b>channel</b> traces...|$|R

The effect of this noise on the neuronal performance has been modelled using either approximate or Langevin model, based on stochastic differential equations or an exact model, based on a Markov process model of channel gating. Yet whether the Langevin model accurately <b>reproduces</b> the <b>channel</b> noise produced by the Markov model remains unclear. Here we present a comparison between Langevin and Markov models of channel noise in neurons using single compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models containing either $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$, or only $K^{+}$ voltage-gated ion channels. The performance of the Langevin and Markov models was quantified over a range of stimulus statistics, membrane areas and channel numbers. We find that {{in comparison to the}} Markov model, the Langevin model underestimates the noise contributed by voltage-gated ion channels, overestimating information rates for both spiking and non-spiking membranes.

A proper channel model {{should be able to}} faithfully <b>reproduce</b> the <b>channel</b> parameters obtained in field measurements and accurately predict the spatial and temporal channel impulse response along with large-scale fading. This paper compares two popular channel models for next generation wireless communications: the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) TR 38. 900 Release 14 channel model and the statistical spatial channel model NYUSIM developed by New York University (NYU). The two channel models employ different modeling approaches in many aspects, such as the line-of-sight probability, path loss, and clustering methodology. Simulations are performed using the two channel models to analyze the channel eigenvalue distribution and spectral efficiency leveraging the analog/digital hybrid beamforming methods found in the literature. Simulation results show that the 3 GPP model produces different eigenvalue and spectral efficiency distributions for mmWave bands, as compared to the outcome from NYUSIM that is based on massive amounts of real-world measured data in New York City. This work shows NYUSIM is more accurate for realistic simulations than 3 GPP in urban environments.

40|$|Although film matrix {{surround}} decoders {{are primarily}} four channel devices, {{with a single}} channel devoted to sound the sides and the rear, in practice there are almost always two or more surround speakers. These speakers are driven in parallel, with in some cases a delay modulation to “decorrelate ” the single surround channel. There is substantial interference between the various loudspeakers, resulting in a listener dependent comb filtering and a non-spacious surround. Although designs for decoders {{with more than one}} rear channel exist, these suffer from low separation between the rear channels when the decoder inputs are decorrelated- during music or effects like applause. Current decoders also suffer from various defects such as pumping of the music during dialog.

Matrix equations for both a 5 channel and a 7 channel decoder are presented, along with an active and a passive encoder for 5 channel films.

These networks are often deployed in environments not easily accessible and highly unpredictable, where doing experiments is very expensive and time consuming.

This paper presents a methodology to realize the downscaling of a real deployment on an experimental platform, called controllable testbed that has a much larger number of nodes with respect to the real one. The downscaling procedure proposed is based on the identification of the most appropriate subset of nodes of the controllable testbed, to be used to <b>reproduce</b> the <b>channel</b> gains between each node pair in the real world.
