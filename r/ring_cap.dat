The aim of the proposed research work {{was to develop a}} novel dual-compartment capsule (NDCC) with polymeric disc for gastroretentive dosage form, which will ultimately result in better solubility and bioavailability of Ofloxacin. Floating <b>ring</b> <b>caps</b> were formulated by using different natural polymers, separating ring band and swellable polymer located at the bottom of capsule. Formulated <b>ring</b> <b>caps</b> were assessed for coating thickness, In vitro buoyancy, In vitro drug release, release kinetics and stability studies. Coating attained by the capsule shell was found to be 0. 0643 mm. Depending on nature of natural polymer used, most of the formulations showed buoyancy for more than 9 hrs. Developed formulation demonstrated considerably higher drug release up to 9 hrs. The developed formulation FE 2 depicted the drug release according to Korsmeyer-Peppas model. There was not any significant change in performance characteristics of developed <b>ring</b> <b>caps</b> after subjecting them to stability studies. The present study suggests that the use of NDCC for oral delivery of Ofloxacin could be an alternative to improve its systemic availability which could be regulated by the floating approach. The designed dosage system can have futuristic applications over payloads which require stomach-specific delivery. 1...|$|R
50|$|Like {{other members}} of the family Sarcoscyphaceae, Wynnea species have multinucleate ascospores and paraphyses. The ascus has a {{thickened}} apical <b>ring</b> <b>capped</b> by a hinged operculum; its opening often is oriented obliquely, a condition referred to as suboperculate. Three structural components are involved in spore discharge in Wynnea species: the operculum, the suboperculum, and the zone of dehiscence.

40|$|We {{report on}} the results of {{numerical}} simulations for the linear optical polarizability of single-walled zigzag (9, 0) carbon nanotubes with modified ends. The nanotubes of a variable length are fullerene-capped at one end and covalently bonded to a hydrophobic cluster of nine benzene rings at the other end. We investigate electronic and optical properties of such structures within a framework of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We demonstrated that the localized states in this system exhibit nonlinear characteristics of excited states. The nanotubes have a strongly oscillating dependence of their optical polarizability on the energy of incident light. Spectral features of the optical polarizability drop in intensity and shift towards higher energies with a decrease in the length of a nanotube or upon fullerene-uncapping. The length dependence is similar for the nanotubes without benzene <b>rings,</b> <b>capped</b> either at one or both ends. Potential applications are suggested for hydrophobic pollutant control in liquid-purification systems...|$|R
