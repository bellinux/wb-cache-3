40|$|Abstract— UV‐enhanced {{reactivation}} of minute‐virus‐of‐mice (MVM), {{an autonomous}} parvovirus, was studied in parasynchronous mouse A 9 cells. The survival of UV‐irradiated MVM is increased in cells {{which have been}} UV‐irradiated prior to infection. UV‐enhanced reactivation can be explained neither by facilitated plaque detection on UV‐treated indicator cells, nor by altered kinetics of virus production by UV‐irradiated cells. No effect of the multiplicity of infection on virus survival was detected in unirra‐diated or irradiated cells. The magnitude of UV‐enhanced reactivation is a direct exponential function of the UV dose administered to the virus while virus survival is inversely proportional to the UV dosage. The expression of UV‐enhanced reactivation can be activated in cells arrested in G 0, it requires de novo protein synthesis and it is maximal when cells are irradiated 30 h {{before the onset of}} viral DNA replication. Early phases of the viral cycle, such as adsorption to cellular receptors, migration to the nucleus and uncoating, were not affected by cell irradiation and are unlikely targets of the UV‐enhanced <b>reactivation</b> <b>function(s).</b> These results, together with the single‐strandedness of the viral genome, strongly suggest that the step stimulated in UV‐irradiated cells functions concomitant with, or subsequent to, viral DNA replication.

40|$|Recently it {{was shown}} that short term memory (STM) free recall {{consists}} of two stages: the first few recalls empty working memory and a second stage, a reactivation stage, concludes the recall (Tarnow, 2015; {{for a review of}} the theoretical predictions see Murdock, 1974). Bayley et al (2000) investigated free recall in people who had undergone Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and found that both recency and primacy effects were normal. Here I investigate this further, and argue that this finding suggests a division of STM between STM Control and long term memory (LTM) traces and that STM Control is not effected by ECT. Serial position probabilities from an investigation of Bayley et al (2000) were used to compare 11 subjects with ECT treatments to a control group and to a group of Alzheimer’s subjects. The free recall probabilities are found to be separable into the serial position curves and the overall probability of recall. This suggests that STM is separable into an STM Control structure (the serial position curve responsible for working memory and <b>reactivation</b> <b>functions)</b> and LTM traces (the overall probability of recall). Using the ECT review of Abbott et al (2014 a) showing excess activity in MTL and lacking activity in the frontal lobes I suggest that STM Control is overworked trying to establish stable patterns in LTM. It could be that the confusion resulting from ECT is due to the failure of this process, suggesting a neurological definition of confusion...|$|R

In this context, the present study aim to analyse it and to determine the interests and limits {{of this type of}} physiological information. Objectives: The present study aims to examine how different traditional training exercise modes affect the cardiac parasympathetic <b>reactivation</b> <b>function</b> in elite soccer players. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two international soccer players participating in UEFA Champion’s League took part in this study (age: 24. 3 ± 4. 2 years; height: 178. 1 ± 6. 2 cm; body mass: 80. 3 ± 5. 7 kg). Players performed different training methods including: short-duration intermittent exercises (INT) in-line and with changes of direction (COD) (10 - 10 seconds, 15 - 15 seconds, 30 - 30 seconds, e. g. an alternance of 10 - 10 seconds is 10 seconds of running according to the maximal aerobic speed (MAS) and 10 -sec of recovery), INT including agility and technical skills (8 - 24 -seconds), small-sided-games (SSGs) with and without goalkeepers (2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, 4 vs. 4), and repeated sprint ability (RSA) efforts (10 × 20 m, 10 × 30 m, 15 × 20 m). Heart rate (HR) decline was recorded 3 minutes after each exercise. Results: HR declines were greater after the RSA compared to SSGs (P < 0. 001) and INT (P < 0. 01), especially at 1 min post-exercise. In addition, when the analysis focused on each type of exercise, greater HR declines were observed in on-field players at 1 minute when there was: inclusion of goalkeepers in SSGs (for 2 vs. 2 and 3 vs. 3, P < 0. 01); increase of sprint distances or number of sprint repetitions in RSA (P < 0. 01); increase of intensity (% of maximal aerobic speed), and the use of COD or inclusion of technical skills during INT, especially for the 30 - 30 -seconds. Conclusions: This study revealed that cardiac parasympathetic <b>reactivation</b> <b>function</b> varied after INT, RSA and SSG, but also according to the rules manipulation. Therefore, this study provides interesting information for the training monitoring and players’ recovery profile, with the aim of facilitating a more efficient planning and manipulation of training recovery strategies according to their fitness markers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) latency-associated {{transcript}} (LAT) gene is required for efficient spontaneous reactivation in the rabbit ocular model. We recently showed that insertion of 1. 8 kb of the LAT promoter and the first 1. 5 kb of the 8. 3 -kb primary LAT transcript into a novel, ectopic location in the virus unique long (UL) region restored wild-type spontaneous reactivation to a LAT-null mutant. To further map the LAT spontaneous <b>reactivation</b> <b>function</b> within the first 1. 5 kb of LAT, we rescued the same LAT-null mutant by inserting 1. 8 kb of the LAT promoter and just the first 811 nucleotides of LAT into the same location in the UL. In {{a series of three}} experiments, the resulting virus, designated LAT 2. 6 A, had a spontaneous reactivation rate that was midway between the original LAT-null mutant and wild-type virus. Thus expression of the first 811 LAT nucleotides produced a spontaneous reactivation rate that was significantly higher than that of the LAT-null mutant but significantly less than that of wild type. This suggests that part, but not all, of the LAT function involved in efficient spontaneous reactivation is located within the first 811 nucleotides of the primary 8. 3 -kb LAT...|$|E

40|$|Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is {{maintained}} as a nucleosome-covered episome {{that can be}} transcriptionally activated by overexpression of the viral immediate-early protein, Zta. We show here that reactivation of latent EBV by Zta can be significantly enhanced by coexpression of the cellular coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) and p 300. A stable complex containing both Zta and CBP could be isolated from lytically stimulated, but not latently infected RAJI nuclear extracts. Zta-mediated viral reactivation and transcriptional activation were both significantly inhibited by coexpression of the E 1 A 12 S protein but not by an N-terminal deletion mutation of E 1 A (E 1 AΔ 2 - 36), which fails to bind CBP. Zta bound directly to two related cysteine- and histidine-rich domains of CBP, referred to as C/H 1 and C/H 3. These domains both interacted specifically with the transcriptional activation domain of Zta in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Interestingly, {{we found that the}} C/H 3 domain was a potent dominant negative inhibitor of Zta transcriptional activation function. In contrast, an amino-terminal fragment containing the C/H 1 domain was sufficient for coactivation of Zta transcription and viral <b>reactivation</b> <b>function.</b> Thus, CBP can stimulate the transcription of latent EBV in a histone acetyltransferase-independent manner mediated by the CBP amino-terminal C/H 1 -containing domain. We propose that CBP may regulate aspects of EBV latency and reactivation by integrating cellular signals mediated by competitive interactions between C/H 1, C/H 3, and the Zta activation domain...|$|E

40|$|The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) K 1 gene encodes a polypeptide bearing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that is constitutively {{active for}} ITAM-based signal transduction. Although ectopic overexpression of K 1 in cultured fibroblasts {{can lead to}} growth transformation, in vivo this gene is primarily expressed in lymphoid cells undergoing lytic infection. Here we have examined function of K 1 {{in the setting of}} lytic replication, through the study of K 1 mutants lacking functional ITAMs. Expression of such mutants in BJAB cells cotransfected with wild-type K 1 results in dramatic inhibition of K 1 signal transduction, as judged by impaired activation of Syk kinase and phospholipase C-γ 2 as well as by diminished expression of a luciferase reporter gene dependent upon K 1 -induced calcium and Ras signaling. Thus, the mutants behave as dominantly acting inhibitors of K 1 function. To assess the role of K 1 in lytic replication, we introduced these K 1 mutants into BCBL- 1 cells, a B-cell lymphoma line latently infected with KSHV, and induced lytic replication by ectopic expression of the KSHV ORF 50 transactivator. Expression of lytic cycle genes was diminished up to 80 % {{in the presence of a}} K 1 dominant negative mutant. These inhibitory effects could be overridden by tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate treatment, indicating that inhibition was not due to irreversible cell injury and suggesting that other signaling events could bypass the block.

40|$|Oxidative {{refolding}} of the dimeric alkaline {{protease inhibitor}} (API) from Streptomyces sp. NCIM 5127 has been investigated. We demonstrate here that both isomerase and chaperone {{functions of the}} protein folding catalyst, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), are essential for efficient refolding of denatured-reduced API (dr-API). Although the role of PDI as an isomerase and a chaperone has been reported for a few monomeric proteins, {{its role as a}} foldase in refolding of oligomeric proteins has not been demonstrated hitherto. Spontaneous refolding and reactivation of dr-API in redox buffer resulted in 45 % to 50 % reactivation.

PDI <b>functions</b> as a chaperone by suppressing aggregation and maintains the partially unfolded monomers in a folding-competent state, thereby assisting dimerization. Simultaneously, isomerase function of PDI brings about regeneration of native disulfides. 5 -Iodoacetamidofluorescein–labeled PDI devoid of isomerase activity failed to enhance the reactivation of dr-API despite its intact chaperone activity. Our results on the requirement of a stoichiometric excess of PDI and of presence of PDI in redox buffer right from the initiation of refolding corroborate that both the functions of PDI are essential for efficient reassociation, refolding, and reactivation of dr-API...|$|R

Zn(II) -curc is a novel small molecule that {{has been shown to}} target mutp 53 protein in several cancer cells, but its effect in thyroid cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether Zn(II) -curc could affect p 53 in thyroid cancer cells with both p 53 mutation (R 273 H) and wild-type p 53.

Here we show that the p 120 gene is mutated in SW 48 cells, and that the cadherin adhesion system is impaired as {{a direct consequence of}} p 120 insufficiency. Restoring normal levels of p 120 caused a striking reversion from poorly differentiated to cobblestone-like epithelial morphology, indicating a crucial role for p 120 in <b>reactivation</b> of E-cadherin <b>function.</b> The rescue efficiency was enhanced by increased levels of p 120, and reduced by the presence of the phosphorylation domain, a region previously postulated to confer negative regulation. Surprisingly, the rescue was associated with substantially increased levels of E-cadherin. E-cadherin mRNA levels were unaffected by p 120 expression, but E-cadherin half-life was more than doubled. Direct p 120 –E-cadherin interaction was crucial, as p 120 deletion analysis revealed a perfect correlation between E-cadherin binding and rescue of epithelial morphology. Interestingly, the epithelial morphology could also be rescued by forced expression of either WT E-cadherin or a p 120 -uncoupled mutant. Thus, the effects of uncoupling p 120 from E-cadherin can be at least partially overcome by artificially maintaining high levels of cadherin expression. These data reveal a cooperative interaction between p 120 and E-cadherin and a novel role for p 120 that is likely indispensable in normal cells...|$|R

The functional {{importance of this}} inhibitory pathway differs widely from one teleostean species to another. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a teleost fish that has become increasingly popular as an experimental vertebrate model. However, the role of DA in the neuroendocrine control of its reproduction has never been studied. Here the authors evaluated in sexually regressed female zebrafish the effects of in vivo treatments with a DA D 2 receptor (D 2 -R) antagonist domperidone, or a GnRH agonist, alone and in combination, on the pituitary level of FSHβ and LHβ transcripts, the gonadosomatic index, and the ovarian histology. Only the double treatment with GnRH agonist and domperidone could induce {{an increase in the}} expression of LHβ, in the gonadosomatic index, and a stimulation of ovarian vitellogenesis, indicating that removal of dopaminergic inhibition is required for the stimulatory action of GnRH and <b>reactivation</b> of ovarian <b>function</b> to occur.

The first part consists of the detailed study of certain conditions of infection of HeLa cells by poliovirus. The second is concerned with the interfering activity of virus, either live or inactivated, with the multiplication of superinfecting live virus, either homotypic or heterotypic. It was found that live virus interferes with heterologous virus (homologous not tested), while UV-killed virus lacks interfering ability. It was also found that the virus released from cells infected by two heterotypic polioviruses, when interference does not occur, contains particles which are neutralized by both specific antisera. This phenomenon {{may be the result of}} a "phenotypic mixing" mechanism similar to that observed with phages. The third part of the study deals with multiplicity reactivation among homotypic polioviruses inactivated by UV irradiation. When killed viruses are adsorbed to cells at multiplicities greater than one, more cells release live virus than can be accounted for on the basis of the input of UV-surviving viruses. This multiplicity <b>reactivation</b> is a <b>function</b> of the UV'd particles, not of non-viral agents in the lysate, heat-killed viruses, originally uninfectious particles, nor anomalies in adsorption. The fraction of cells releasing virus increases with multiplicities up to 40 - 80, when saturation appears to set in. At high doses the fraction of yielders decreases with the UV dose to the virus at a rate equal to that at which the virus itself is killed.

40|$|Introduction: The tumor {{suppressor}} protein p 53 {{is frequently}} mutated in human cancer, which is commonly related to poor prognosis. Thus, <b>reactivation</b> of wild-type <b>functions</b> to mutant p 53 {{is an attractive}} anticancer therapeutic strategy (1). Indeed, many efforts {{have been developed to}} target mutant p 53. In a recent work, our group discovered the small molecule SLMP 53 - 1, which restores the wild-type activity to mutant p 53 R 280 K with promising in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity results (2; 3). Aims: The present work aims to unravel the binding of SLMP 53 - 1 to mutant p 53 R 280 K. Materials and methods: With that purpose, two strategies were defined: i) to assess the thermal stabilization of mutant p 53 R 280 K, induced by the binding of SLMP 53 - 1 to mutant p 53, in a cellular context by Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA); and ii) to produce p 53 R 280 K for biophysical binding assays, including MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST), Saturation-Transfer Difference NMR (STD-NMR) and X-ray crystallography. Results: By CETSA, we showed that SLMP 53 - 1 induces p 53 R 280 K thermal stabilization, confirming the binding of SLMP 53 - 1 to p 53 R 280 K. Recombinant p 53 R 280 K protein (core domain) was successfully produced and purified from E. coli BL 21 (DE 3). So far, crystals of apo p 53 R 280 K and with SLMP 53 - 1 were obtained. Co-crystallization optimization, MST and STD-NMR experiments are underway. Conclusions: With this work, the SLMP 53 - 1 binding to p 53 R 280 K was confirmed and its characterization is in progress. This integrated study will contribute to understand the biology and pharmacology of p 53 mutant forms and to the rational design of improved reactivators of mutant p 53. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{modification}} of the conventional threshold model for assessing the probability of rainfall-induced landslide reactivation. The modification {{is based on the}} consideration that exceedance of a pre-determined rainfall threshold is a necessary but not sufficient condition to reactivate a landslide. The proposed method calculates the probability of <b>reactivation</b> as a <b>function</b> of the probability of exceedance of a pre-determined rainfall threshold, as well as the probability of occurrence of a landslide after such exceedance. The data for the calculation were obtained from historical records of landslides and rainfall. The method was applied to two complex landslides ("San Donato" and "La Salsa") involving fine-grained debris in the southern section of the Apennine foredeep. The minimum rainfall threshold triggering landslide reactivation on the two slopes was determined by examining rainfall patterns during the 180  days preceding the slide events. For the San Donato and La Salsa landslides, the minimum triggering threshold consists of rainfall events lasting 15  days, with cumulated rainfall exceeding 150 and 180  mm, respectively. Based on hydrological and statistical analyses, the annual probabilities of exceeding the thresholds were estimated to be 0. 38 and 0. 25, respectively. During the period from 1950 to 1987, the minimum threshold was exceeded 14 times, and four reactivations occurred at San Donato; whereas, the threshold was exceeded 10 times and three reactivations occurred at La Salsa. Hence, the probabilities of landsliding after exceedance of the minimum rainfall threshold are 4 / 14 and 3 / 10, respectively. Finally, annual reactivation probabilities were calculated to be 0. 11 and 0. 08, respectively. The reliability of the minimum rainfall threshold was tested by: i) simulating variations in the stress-strain behavior of the slopes as a result of fluctuations in the water table from normal to extreme values; and ii) analyzing the results of continuous multi-year monitoring of pore pressure and rainfall variations on a slope composed of dominantly fine-grained debris. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|After ocular {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) infection, the virus travels up axons and {{establishes}} a lifelong latent infection in neurons of the trigeminal ganglia. LAT (latency-associated transcript), the only known viral gene abundantly transcribed during HSV- 1 neuronal latency, is required for high levels of <b>reactivation.</b> The LAT <b>function</b> responsible for this reactivation phenotype is not known. Recently, we showed that LAT can block programmed cell death (apoptosis) in neurons of the trigeminal ganglion in vivo and in tissue culture cells in vitro (G. -C. Perng et al., Science 287 : 1500 – 1503, 2000; M. Inman et al., J. Virol. 75 : 3636 – 3646, 2001). Consequently, we proposed that this antiapoptosis function may be {{a key to the}} mechanism by which LAT enhances reactivation. To study this further, we constructed a recombinant HSV- 1 virus in which the HSV- 1 LAT gene was replaced by an alternate antiapoptosis gene. We used the bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV- 1) latency-related (LR) gene, which was previously shown to have antiapoptosis activity, for this purpose. The resulting chimeric virus, designated CJLAT, contains two complete copies of the BHV- 1 LR gene (one in each viral long repeat) in place of the normal two copies of the HSV- 1 LAT, on an otherwise wild-type HSV- 1 strain McKrae genomic background. We report here that in both rabbits and mice reactivation of CJLAT was significantly greater than the LAT null mutant dLAT 2903 (P < 0. 0004 and P = 0. 001, respectively) and was at least as efficient as wild-type McKrae. This strongly suggests that a BHV- 1 LR gene function was able to efficiently substitute for an HSV- 1 LAT gene <b>function</b> involved in <b>reactivation.</b> Although replication of CJLAT in rabbits and mice was similar to that of wild-type McKrae, CJLAT killed more mice during acute infection and caused more corneal scarring in latently infected rabbits. This suggested that the BHV- 1 LR gene and the HSV- 1 LAT gene are not functionally identical. However, LR and LAT both have antiapoptosis activity. These studies therefore strongly support the hypothesis that replacing LAT with an antiapoptosis gene restores the wild-type reactivation phenotype to a LAT null mutant of HSV- 1 McKrae...|$|R
