25|$|Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract (from the trachea {{to the terminal}} bronchioles), or in the alveolar region. The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines {{the health effects of}} exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by aerodynamic diameter. The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The <b>respirable</b> <b>fraction</b> is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region. To measure the <b>respirable</b> <b>fraction</b> of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal elutriators, and large pore membrane filters.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, long-term {{exposure to}} silica dust generated by cutting fiber cement siding during installation {{can lead to}} silicosis and other lung diseases among workers. Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) confirmed these findings, showing {{that many of the}} silica dust particles are in the <b>respirable</b> <b>fraction,</b> able to penetrate the deepest parts of the lung. Laboratory tests performed by cutting fiber cement siding within an isolated chamber showed that by connecting a regular shop vacuum to a circular saw, exposures to silica dust produced by the cutting can be reduced by 80-90%. Later, NIOSH completed four field surveys where construction workers cut fiber cement siding. Results showed that exposure to silica dust was controlled below the NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) for respirable crystalline silica (0.05 mg/m3) when a regular shop vacuum was used.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether spray drying is an appropriate method for the production of respirable particles of therapeutic proteins. Meeting this objective requires that active, stable, dry powders in the 1 - 5 μm size range be obtained. A model protein, β-galactosidase, was used throughout the study. ^ The first part of the experimental work focused on the effect of various processing and formulation variables on the critical quality attributes of the spray dried protein (residual activity, moisture content, particle size and yield). Statistically designed experiments were used so that both direct and interactive effects of the variables could be identified, and the most appropriate formulation and process established. In order to obtain acceptable product yields and moisture contents, relatively harsh drying conditions were required. This necessitated the inclusion of a stabilizer in the formulation to preserve enzyme activity. Trehalose was found to be the most suitable stabilizer of those evaluated (sucrose, mannitol, arginine hydrochloride and trehalose). ^ Subsequent experiments were carried out to evaluate the in vitro deposition properties of the spray dried β-galactosidase from dry powder inhaler devices. <b>Respirable</b> <b>fractions</b> were determined using the twin impinger and cascade impactor. These in vitro devices divide the 2 ̆ 7 inspired 2 ̆ 7 dose into different size fractions enabling the amount of material in the respirable size range to be calculated. The <b>respirable</b> <b>fractions</b> were comparable with published values for conventional small molecule drugs. The spray dried powders were found to be extremely sensitive to moisture with dramatic reductions in <b>respirable</b> <b>fractions</b> occurring after exposure of the powders to environments of high humidity. ^ The <b>respirable</b> <b>fractions</b> were highly dependent on the inhaler device used, and the powder formulation. With less efficient inhaler devices, the presence of a coarser carrier material blended with the spray dried powder substantially improved the <b>respirable</b> <b>fractions.</b> The cascade impactor and twin impinger gave comparable estimates for <b>respirable</b> <b>fractions</b> and were both found to be suitable evaluation methods for dry powder inhalers.

50|$|Similarly, {{so called}} fine PM, (often {{referred}} to as PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung (alveolus), and very small particles (< 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Penetration of particles is not wholly dependent on their size; shape and chemical composition also play a part. To avoid this complication, simple nomenclature is used to indicate the different degrees of relative penetration of a PM particle into the cardiovascular system. Inhalable particles penetrate {{no further than the}} bronchi as they are filtered out by the cilia. Thoracic particles can penetrate right into terminal bronchioles whereas PM which can penetrate to alveoli, the gas exchange area, and hence the circulatory system are termed respirable particles.In analogy, the inhalable dust fraction is the fraction of dust entering nose and mouth which may be deposited anywhere in the respiratory tract.

50|$|The <b>respirable</b> <b>fraction</b> {{of lunar}} dusts may be toxic to humans. NASA has {{therefore}} determined that an exposure standard {{is necessary to}} {{limit the amount of}} respirable airborne lunar dusts to which astronauts will be exposed. The nominal toxicity that is expected from ordinary mineral dust may be increased for lunar dusts due to the large and chemically reactive surfaces of the dust grains. Human exposures to mineral dusts during industrial operations and from volcanic eruptions give researchers some sense of the relative toxicity of lunar dust, although the Earth-based analogs have serious limitations. Animal and cellular studies provide further evidence that mineral dusts can be somewhat toxic. Earth-based research of mineral dust has shown that freshly fractured surfaces are chemically reactive and can elicit an increased toxic response. Since lunar dust is formed in space vacuum from highly energetic processes, the grain surfaces can be expected to be indefinitely reactive on the lunar surface. NASA predicts that this chemical reactivity will change once the dust is brought into a habitable environment.|$|E

The total release fraction accounts for several mechanisms that tend to retain, retard, or diminish the amount of radionuclides that are available for transport to dose receptors or otherwise can be shown to reduce exposure of receptors to radiological releases.

This study aimed to assess exposure to crystalline silica and cement dust among workers of a cement industry in Saveh city, Iran.. Material and Method: In this cross-sectional study, 62 samples of respirable dust were collected from breathing zone of the workers in different sections of factory. Determination of <b>respirable</b> <b>fraction</b> of cement dust concentrations carried out using gravimetric method according to the NIOSH method no. 0600. Visible absorption spectrophotometry was used according to the NIOSH method no. 7601 to determine crystalline silica content of respirable dust samples.. Result: The highest exposure concentrations to <b>respirable</b> <b>fraction</b> of cement dust was observed in the Raw Mill and Cement Mill, and the lowest exposure in Administrative Department and Kiln the range of workers exposure in the production sites were 1. 77 to 18. 89 mg/m 3. The range of workers exposure to the crystalline silica in the production sites was 0. 011 to 0. 104 mg/m 3. The highest and lowest mean of exposures was observed in the raw Mill and cement mill respectively. Occupational exposure to the crystalline silica in 57 % of site samples exceeded adjusted TLV recommended by NIOSH and Iranian of Occupational Health Technical Committee (0. 05 mg/m 3). The average of free SiO 2 fraction in whole site samples was 1. 17 % varying from 0. 49 % in the cement Mill to 1. 53 % and 1. 7 % in crusher and Kiln sections, respectively. Conclusion: Levels of exposure to cement respirable dust in all productive sections were significantly higher than the adjusted TLV.

40|$|Citric acid < 1 77 - 92 - 9 NE NE At {{very high}} {{temperatures}} such as during refractory use, phase transformations may take place leading to other/additional compounds (such as magnesium compounds, etc.), triggering other applicable exposure guidelines. In addition, refractory may become contaminated with other hazardous substances (e. g., metals, alkaline materials). The specific processing {{and use of}} this refractory should be fully evaluated to assess the entire scope of health hazards. Note: 1) TLV and PEL values given above are 8 -hour, time-weighted averages, unless otherwise specified. 2) NE = None Established, and means that the substance is not assigned a specific TLV or PEL. Substance regulated by OSHA as particulates not otherwise regulated (PNOR, PELs- 15 mg/m 3 total dust, 5 mg/m 3 <b>respirable</b> <b>fraction)</b> and by ACGIH as particulates not otherwise classified (PNOC, TLV- 10 mg/m 3 total dust, 3 mg/m 3 <b>respirable</b> <b>fraction)</b> and is considered a nuisance dust. 3. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION EMERGENCY OVERVIEW: Granular mix, practically odorless. As-manufactured product does not pose significant fire hazard. Refractory particulates formed during processing, installation, maintenance procedures and/or tear-out may be irritating to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract, and may cause pulmonary system effects. Product is noncombustible and stable...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{slow-acting}} insulin {{preparations for}} subcutaneous injection, e. g., suspensions {{of the complex}} with protamine and/or zinc, were reformulated as dry powders for inhalation and the insoluble aerosol tested for providing sustained insulin plasma levels. Large porous particles made of lactose, albumin, and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and incorporating insulin, protamine, and/or zinc chloride were prepared using spray-drying. Integrity of insulin after spray-drying and insulin insolubilization in spraydried particles was verified in vitro. The pharmacokinetic profile of the formulation delivered by inhalation and subcutaneous injection was assessed in vivo in the rat. The formulation process of insulin as dry powders did not alter insulin integrity and did not impede, in most cases, insulin insolubilization by protamine and/or zinc. Large porous insulin particles presented 7 μm mass mean geometric particle diameters, 0. 1 g/ cm 3 bulk powder tap densities and theoretical aerodynamic diameters suitable for deep lung deposition (in the range of 2. 2 - 2. 5 μm). The dry powders exhibited 40 % <b>respirable</b> <b>fractions</b> in the Andersen cascade impactor and 58 - 75 % in the Aero-Breather. Insoluble inhaled insulin provided sustained insulin plasma levels for half a day, similar to injected insulin, and exhibited a bioavailability of 80. 5 % relative to subcutaneous injection of the same formulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{health effects}} of 6 {{different}} fly ash samples from biomass combustion plants (bark, wood chips, waste wood, and straw), and co-firing plants (coal, co-firing of coal and sawdust) were investigated in a 28 -day nose-only inhalation study with Wistar WU rats. <b>Respirable</b> <b>fractions</b> of carbon black (Printex 90) and of titanium dioxide (Bayertitan T) were used as reference materials for positive and negative controls. The exposure was done 6 hours per day, 5 days per week at an aerosol concentration of 16 mg/m 3. The MMAD of all fly ash samples and reference materials in the inhalation unit were {{in the range from}} 1. 5 to 3 micro m. The investigations focused predominantly on the analysis of inflammatory effects in the lungs of rats using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and histopathology. Different parameters (percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), interleukin- 8 and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissue) indicating inflammatory effects in the lung, showed a statistically significant increase in the groups exposed to carbon black (positive control), C 1 (coal) and C 1 +BM 4 (co-firing of coal and sawdust) fly ashes. Additionally, for the same groups a statistically significant increase of cell proliferation in the lung epithelium was detected. No significant effects were detected in the animal groups exposed to BM 1 (bark), BM 2 (wood chips), BM 3 (waste wood), BM 6 (straw) or titanium dioxide...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} supplemental {{information for}} the document Analysis of Accident Sequences and Source Terms at Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities for Waste Generated by US Department of Energy Waste Management Operations. Additional technical support information is supplied concerning treatment of transuranic waste by incineration and considering the Alternative Organic Treatment option for low-level mixed waste. The latest <b>respirable</b> airborne release <b>fraction</b> values published by the US Department of Energy for use in accident analysis have been used and are included as Appendix D, where <b>respirable</b> airborne release <b>fraction</b> {{is defined as the}} fraction of material exposed to accident stresses that could become airborne {{as a result of the}} accident. A set of dominant waste treatment processes and accident scenarios was selected for a screening-process analysis. A subset of results (release source terms) from this analysis is presented...|$|R
