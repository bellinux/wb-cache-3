The old traveller Linschott, writing in 1599, says: [...] "It is of such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all the other fruits of the world, according to those who have tasted it." [...] And Doctor Paludanus adds: [...] "This fruit is of a hot and humid nature. To those not used to it, it seems at first to smell like rotten onions, but immediately when they have tasted it, they prefer it to all other food. The natives give it honourable titles, exalt it, and make verses on it." [...] When brought into a house the smell is often so offensive that some persons can never bear to taste it. This was my own case when I first tried it in Malacca, but in Borneo I found a ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater.|$|E

50|$|Hornbills are {{predominantly}} frugivores. The oriental pied hornbill's diet consists of wild fruits such as figs (Ficus spp.), melanoxylon berries, <b>rambutans,</b> palm fruit, papaya and fruits of liana plants. It will also take large insects (grasshoppers), small birds (finches) small reptiles (lizards and snakes), amphibians such as frogs, and fish. Its diet differs slightly between the breeding and non-breeding season. During the non-breeding season, oriental pied hornbills feed more on non-fig fruit such as small sized berries, drupes, arillate capsules and lianas (woody vines), however {{the availability of}} these food items is lower in the breeding season, {{which suggests that the}} species increases its habitat range during that time. They also tend to feed in flocks during the non breeding season. When foraging for food, they tend to select a few common species of fruit trees. They show a preference towards trees belonging to the families Annonaceae, Meliaceae and Myristicaceae. Other target species include Rourea minor, Polyalthia viridis, Cinnamomum subavenium, Trichosanthes tricuspidata, and many others. Feeding on a diversity of fruits ensure that nutritional requirements are met. In the non-breeding season fruits that are selected for are generally sugar rich, while lipid-rich fruits and invertebrates are highly selected for during the breeding season.|$|R

Among the different methods to overcome picky eating and food neophobia (the fear of eating new or unfamiliar foods) in children, few have explored sensory engagement, more specifically haptic stimulation. There is little evidence as to how touching unfamiliar food influences one’s willingness to taste and consume it. This research explores whether the sense of touch – a sense that is not fully engaged when using utensils – might be used to guide children to be more accepting of an unfamiliar food. Haptic information like consistency, temperature, and texture could be fundamental while deciding to taste a novel food or not. Moreover, the practice of eating with your hands may be experienced as a fun activity due to again the sensory stimulation during the process. Given both the informative and fun nature of eating with one’s hands, we investigate whether the practice of eating with your hands may be used in the ‘discovery process’ of a novel food and help to diminish the negative feelings towards novel foods among children. Twenty-three 5 to 10 years old children (15 female, 8 male) participated in a field experiment during a summer-long camp in a medium-sized city in the Northeast United States. On four separate occasions, children were given two of four unfamiliar foods (along with a familiar control food) for lunch. They were assigned to either eating with your hands or with utensils. Plates were weighed before and after mealtime to determine the amount (grams) of food eaten. When eating an unfamiliar food (papaya, <b>rambutans,</b> Greek pasta, or Thai dumplings) with their hands, children ate on average 73. 7 % more than when they ate with utensils (Mhands = 123. 0, Mutensils = 76. 3 grams; t = 3. 97, p <. 01). Specifically, in the case of unfamiliar fruits (papaya or <b>rambutans),</b> on average children ate 30. 8 grams (41. 1 % of the fruit) while eating with their hands as opposed to 10. 9 grams (14. 5 % of the fruit) while using utensils (t = 2. 82, p =. 02). In the case of unfamiliar pasta (Thai dumplings or Greek pasta), on average children ate 92. 2 grams (46. 1 % of the pasta) while eating with their hands as opposed to 65. 4 grams (32. 7 % of the pasta) while using utensils (t = 2. 43, p =. 029). In addition to the unfamiliar foods, as a control variable, the children had also been given a familiar and highly favored food (cherry-flavored finger gelatin). As expected, regardless of whether the children ate with their hands (M = 96. 3) or with utensils (M = 87. 6), they ate a comparable amount of the familiar food (t= 0. 82, p =. 68). The results reveal that haptic stimulation during a meal encourages children to consume more of an unfamiliar food although it has no impact on familiar food. It seems that the greater the number of senses that are included in the first encounter with a novel food, the easier the decision to eat for a child. On a practical level, the findings challenge the long discouraged approach of not letting children touch or “play with” their food. In contrast, {{it appears to be a}} beneficial means to expose children to a more varied diet and decrease picky eating and perhaps even food neophobia. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|Chinese {{economic}} {{dominance of}} Cambodia dates back the pre-French colonial kingdoms where Chinese merchants often maintained patron-client {{relationships with the}} Khmer monarchy. William Willmot, a Sinologist at the University of British Columbia estimated that 90 percent of the Chinese in Cambodia were involved in commerce in 1963. Today, an estimated 60 percent are urban dwellers engage in commerce {{while the rest of}} the rural population work as shopkeepers, processors of food products (such as rice, palm sugar, fruit, and fish), and moneylenders. Throughout Cambodian cities, Chinese dominated numerous industries such as retail, hospitality, export-import trade, light, food processing, soft drinks, printing and machine shops. In addition, virtually all of Cambodia's richest people are of Chinese descent. Rural Chinese businessmen operated general shops that provided ethnic Khmer peasants with essential purchases such as farming supplies, groceries imported from China, sanpots and sarongs, bamboo baskets, perfume, kerosene for lamps, alcohol as well as tobacco. Those in the Kampot Province and parts of Kaoh Kong Province cultivate black pepper and fruit (especially <b>rambutans,</b> durians, and coconuts). Additionally, rural Chinese Cambodians also engaged in salt water fishing. In the 19th century, French colonials allowed Chinese-run businesses to flourish due to their laissez faire capitalist policies. Willmott estimated that the ethnic Chinese controlled 92 percent of the Cambodian economy by the mid-20th century. They traded in urban areas and worked as shopkeepers, moneylenders and traditional healers in rural areas, while Chinese farmers controlled Cambodia’s lucrative Kampot pepper industry. Chinese Cambodian moneylenders wield considerable economic power over the poorer indigenous ethnic Khmer peasants through usury at an interest rate of 10 to 20 percent per month. This might have been the reason why seventy-five percent of the peasants in Cambodia were in debt in 1952, according to the Australian Colonial Credit Office. Chinese Cambodian entrepreneurs are also estimated to control 70 percent of the industrial investment and are actively engaged in trading, real estate development, construction, small-scale manufacturing, alcohol distilling, hospitality, fast food restaurants, and food processing. Ethnic Chinese also dominate the silk weaving industry where key commercial positions in the Cambodian silk trading networks are completely held in Chinese hands.|$|R
