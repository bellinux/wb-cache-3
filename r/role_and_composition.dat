A competitive bidding process generally consists of different stages, for example, compiling bid specifications, advertising the bid, the receipt and evaluation of bids, and the award and implementation of the contract. The Municipal Supply Chain Management Regulations require a municipality’s Supply Chain Management Policy to provide for a committee system to oversee the different stages. Such committee system must, moreover, consist of at least a bid specification committee, a bid evaluation committee and a bid adjudication committee. Until recently, little attention has been given by the courts to the <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of the different committees in the committee system. It is only after government, and in particular, municipalities have begun to implement the committee system in their procurement processes that it is evident that problems are arising.

Several scholars consider the Cadbury Code (1992) as the original code, although the first code was created in 1978 in the US. Today about 90 nations worldwide have issued their own code(s). Regulating CG through codes is seen as a process, where "soft rules" for example codes, are favored over traditional "hard rules".

40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor {{and a member}} of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Mutations in the {{androgen receptor}} are associated with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), and a neurodegenerative disease, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Most of the mutations causing AIS are loss-of-function missense mutations whereas SBMA is caused by a gain-of-function polyglutamine expansion in the N-terminal domain of the protein. Characterization of AR mutations has led to a better understanding of structure-function relationships of the AR and serves as a prototype for steroid receptors mechanisms of action. In the first paper, we examine the role of an AR mutation in causing mild androgen insensitivity syndrome. We found that this mutation conferred reduced transactivation by AR through impaired interactions with the AR coactivator, TIF 2, and impaired homodimerization. In the second paper, we investigate the role of the AR polyGln expansion mutation in SBMA pathogenesis. Recent evidence has implicated proteolytic degradation of polyGln-expanded proteins and their subsequent intracellular aggregation in polyGn-expanded disease pathogenesis. We examined the <b>role</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of aggregates using fluorescently-tagged AR and found that proteolysis need not be a prerequisite for aggregation and that aggregation is not necessary for poly-Gln-induced cellular toxicity.

Evolutionarily speaking, normal cutaneous flora likely has been selected for because it potentiates or, at minimum, does not impede wound healing. While pigs are the gold standard model for wound healing studies, the porcine skin microbiome has not been studied in detail. Herein, we performed 16 S rDNA sequencing to characterize the pig skin bacteriome at several anatomical locations. Additionally, we used bacterial conditioned-media with in vitro techniques to examine the paracrine effects of bacterial-derived proteins on human keratinocytes (NHEK) and fibroblasts (NHDF). We found that at the phyla level, the pig skin bacteriome {{is similar to that}} of humans and largely consists of Firmicutes (55. 6 %), Bacteroidetes (20. 8 %), Actinobacteria (13. 3 %), and Proteobacteria (5. 1 %) however species-level differences between anatomical locations exist. Studies of bacterial supernatant revealed location-dependent effects on NHDF migration and NHEK apoptosis and growth factor release. These results expand the limited knowledge of the cutaneous bacteriome of healthy swine, and suggest that naturally occurring bacterial flora affects wound healing differentially depending on anatomical location. Ultimately, the pig might be considered the best surrogate for not only wound healing studies but also the cutaneous microbiome. This would not only facilitate investigations into the microbiome's role in recovery from injury, but also provide microbial targets for enhancing or accelerating wound healing...|$|R

The human pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is known to form biofilms in vitro in food chain-relevant conditions, but the exact <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of the extracellular matrix are still not clear. Extracellular DNA has been found in many bacterial biofilms and can be a major component of the extracellular matrix. Here we show that extracellular DNA is also {{an important}} component of the C. jejuni biofilm when attached to stainless steel surfaces, in aerobic conditions and on conditioned surfaces. Degradation of extracellular DNA by exogenous addition of DNase I led to rapid biofilm removal, without loss of C. jejuni viability. Following treatment of a surface with DNase I, C. jejuni was unable to re-establish a biofilm population within 48 h. Similar results were obtained by digesting extracellular DNA with restriction enzymes, suggesting the need for high molecular weight DNA. Addition of C. jejuni genomic DNA containing an antibiotic resistance marker resulted in transfer of the antibiotic resistance marker to susceptible cells in the biofilm, presumably by natural transformation. Taken together, this suggest that eDNA is not only an important component of C. jejuni biofilms and subsequent food chain survival of C. jejuni, but may also contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance in C. jejuni. The degradation of extracellular DNA with enzymes such as DNase I is a rapid method to remove C. jejuni biofilms, and is likely to potentiate the activity of antimicrobial treatments and thus synergistically aid disinfection treatments...|$|R

This study aims to describe the development and process of implementation of the HPMP, and to explore the impact on hospital performance by looking at the trends of performance scores of all different types of Iranian hospitals. This was a mixed method study consisting of longitudinal data and qualitative document analysis. Hospital performance data over the period of 2002 to 2008 was analysed. Iran instituted a comprehensive HPMP and implemented it in all hospitals since 1997. The program followed a phased development to stimulate performance and quality improvement in hospitals. Overall, the program has had a positive impact on the performance of general and specialized hospitals. The performance of general hospitals {{did not appear to be}} associated with their size or affiliated university ranking. However, the rate of performance improvement of general teaching and private hospitals was significantly lower than the average improvement rate of all general hospitals. There was no relationship between teaching status of the specialized hospitals and their level of performance. However, the performance of the governmental specialized hospitals showed a substantial decline over time. Moreover, among specialized hospitals, the bigger sized and those affiliated with higher ranked universities, reported better performance. Overall, the development and implementation of an obligatory HPMP in Iran has improved the level of performance in general and specialized hospitals. However, there is room for further performance improvement especially in the general teaching, private, and governmental specialized hospitals. Reconsidering the ownership type, funding mechanisms and responsibility for the HPMP may have an impact on the absolute level of performance and improvement capacity of hospitals.

40|$|Aging is {{associated}} with numerous changes in the human body. One {{of the most prominent}} alterations is in the decline of neuromuscular function leading to loss of muscle strength. Muscular weakness in the lower limb muscles is a risk factor for falls in the elderly, with the Tibialis Anterior (TA) playing a pivotal role. This loss in strength has been identified as being due to several age-associated neuromuscular alterations. These alterations can be unique for each muscle, depending on their functional <b>role</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition.</b> Nonetheless, the individual contributions of the altered neuromuscular properties to muscle strength decline remain unclear. A need to delineate these influences has been identified in order to provide a more targeted strength preservation strategy for the elderly. This thesis has investigated the relative influence of neuromuscular properties on age-associated muscle strength decline in the Tibialis Anterior using a new improved computational surface electromyogram (sEMG) and muscle force model. It has further used this model to estimate the neuromuscular properties and expected strength loss in the older cohorts from the age-associated sEMG changes. It has also investigated the inhomogeneous aging of the Triceps Surae (TS) in comparison to the Tibialis Anterior using sEMG. A series of experiments were performed with healthy young cohorts (age range: 20 - 30 years) and older cohorts (age range: 60 - 85 years). They performed isometric dorsi- and plantarflexion of the ankle at six fractions of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), and their exerted force and sEMG from the TA and TS muscles was recorded. The power spectrum (PSD) and bispectrum of the sEMG was computed for each participant. This study has found significant age-associated changes in the sEMG&rsquo;s PSD, and Gaussianity where older cohorts had higher maximal power and increased non-Gaussianity of their sEMG. These changes were attributable to the age-associated physiological motor unit remodelling reported in literature. This study has also found the TA to have significantly higher age-associated increase in the maximal power of the PSD in comparison to TS. Within the Triceps Surae complex, the Soleus and Lateral Gastrocnemius were not significantly affected in comparison to Medial Gastrocnemius. These differential changes were considered to be due to different fibre composition, and rates of age-associated neuromuscular changes. The simulation studies performed with the sEMG model found the firing rate as the most influential property, followed by muscular factors. The model was also able to estimate the aging condition that described the older cohorts of this study. The older cohorts&rsquo; TA were characterised to have moderate motor unit remodelling which corresponded to a 40 % loss of motor units with half the number of fast fibres. This study highlights that firing rate is the most influential property regulating muscle strength. It also establishes that moderate motor unit remodelling in the TA may not be accompanied with strength loss. This was also found in the TS muscles, which was differently altered to the TA. This information can be used to provide more targeted strength preservation strategies for the prevention of falls in the elderly...|$|E
40|$|Employed {{either in}} metal holding ladles/ tundishes, stopper rods, or metal {{delivery}} shrouds/ nozzles; the service life of refractory bodies {{plays an important}} role in the commercial feasibility of continuous casting of steel. A suitable selection of oxide–graphite refractory material for a specific application is usually based on the fundamental understanding of its high temperature corrosion behaviour. Slag attack is particularly important. The structural strength of refractory may be critically reduced by the solvent action of liquid slags. Typically, in the conventional method of the continuous casting of liquid steel whether refining slags in the metal holding ladle, or casting powder in mould – they are almost always composed of high basic oxide constituent (CaO) concentration. Therefore, corrosion studies having CaO as one of the constituent oxides, has been the subject of many research work. However, with the advent of modern near–net–shape continuous casting of steel not only thin walled refractory bodies are being employed but <b>role</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of meniscus slags has also changed making the control of corrosion a big challenge. The lack of available information on the corrosive action of the menisci slags of the modern continuous casting of steel, which are usually composed of high MnO and SiO 2 contents (having no or very little concentration of CaO), on the refractory bodies needs to be thoroughly studied. In general, uncertainties also exist regarding the fraction of graphite content in the refractory mix because an increase of the graphite content of refractory does not always minimize corrosion process. An experimental study, using static corrosion test, was conducted at the usual steel casting temperature (1550 C) to develop a fundamental understanding by comparing the transient progresses of corrosion reactions of several commonly available oxide–graphite refractory in their interaction with menisci slags that are generated during the near–net–shape casting of liquid steel. Factors such as the presence of solid fractions and the low wetting characteristic of molten slag phase seems to promote the entrapment of gas bubbles at the vi interface, which was found to favourably impact the corrosion resistance property of refractory by minimizing its contact with the corrosive slag phase. MgO–graphite refractories showed higher resistance to the corrosive actions of both the menisci slags due to the formation of two inhibitive layers: a thin layer of dense MgO and Olivine phase. It has also been found that the corrosion performance of some oxide–graphite refractory completely changes with the change of meniscus slag composition. Exhibiting different corrosion behaviours against the two menisci slags, refractories composed of (Y–PSZ) ZrO 2 as oxide aggregate phase while performed poorly in interaction with ternary meniscus slag, a satisfactory corrosion performance of the refractory was noted when it interacted with binary meniscus slag composition. Examining the effect of graphite content on the corrosion performances of refractories by ternary meniscus slag (MnO–SIO 2 –Al 2 O 3), we found that while an inverse relationship existed for Al 2 O 3 –graphite refractory, the corrosion performance of MgO–graphite refractory improved when these were composed of higher graphite contents...|$|E

Similarly, the presence of an ECM-like extracellular polymeric substance is known to support and protect bacterial and fungal multicellular aggregates, such as biofilms or colonies. However, the <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>composition</b> of this microbial ECM are still poorly understood. RESULTS This work presents a protocol to produce S. cerevisiae and C. albicans ECM in an equally highly reproducible manner. Additionally, methodologies for the extraction and fractionation into protein and glycosidic analytical pure fractions were improved. These were subjected to analytical procedures, respectively SDS-PAGE, 2 -DE, MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS, and DAE and FPLC. Additional chemical methods were also used to test for uronic acids and sulphation. CONCLUSIONS The methodologies hereby presented were equally efficiently applied to extract high amounts of ECM material from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans mats, therefore showing their robustness and reproducibility for yECM molecular and structural characterization. yECM from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans displayed a different proteome and glycoside fractions. S. cerevisiae yECM presented two well-defined polysaccharides with different mass/charge, and C. albicans ECM presented a single different one. The chemical methods further suggested the presence of uronic acids, and chemical modification, possibly through sulphate substitution. All taken, the procedures herein described present the first sensible and concise approach to the molecular and chemical characterisation of the yeast ECM, opening the way to the in-depth study of the microbe multicellular aggregates structure and life-style...|$|R
