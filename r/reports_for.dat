5|$|The most {{significant}} problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena {{is that the}} vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of <b>reports</b> <b>for</b> transient phenomena occurring at the same place on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same event, these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.|$|E

His Chetniks later merged with other collaborationist forces that had withdrawn towards the west, and were put under the command of the SS General Odilo Globocnik of the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral. Jevđević fled to Italy in the spring of 1945, where he was arrested by Allied military authorities and detained at a camp in Grottaglie. He was eventually set free, having received considerable Allied support. Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored. Jevđević moved to Rome and lived under an assumed name.

5|$|Given {{the losses}} of {{industry}} and jobs, St. Louis has had significant and persistent problems with both crime and perceptions of crime. In 2011 St. Louis was named by U.S. News and World Report as the most dangerous city in the United States, using Uniform Crime Reports data published by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime <b>reports</b> <b>for</b> the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of firearm deaths for the metropolitan statistical area was one-fifth of the city rate.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, IUPAC {{published}} a recommendation on naming the disputed elements following the previous <b>reports.</b> <b>For</b> element 105, they proposed the name joliotium (Jl), after the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie, a significant {{contributor to the}} development of nuclear physics and chemistry; this name was originally proposed by the Soviet team for element 102, which by then had long been called nobelium. (The name nielsbohrium for element 107 was transformed to bohrium to conform with the practice set by all then-named elements.) This recommendation paper was generally met with criticism from the American scientists: their recommendations were scrambled (the names rutherfordium and hahnium, originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were used for elements 106 and 108, respectively); both elements 104 and 105 were given names suggested by the Russian team despite earlier recognition of the Berkeley team as of an equal co-discoverer; and especially because the name seaborgium for element 106 was rejected for honoring a living person, a rule that had only just been approved. These names were to be accepted on a Council meeting in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{testified to}} a closed federal court {{that the moral}} {{philosophy}} of Thelema was both anti-fascist and anti-communist, emphasizing his belief in individualism. This along with references from his scientific colleagues resulted in his security clearance being reinstated by the Industrial Employment Review Board, which ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies. This allowed Parsons to obtain a contract in designing and constructing a chemical plant for the Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City. Von Kármán put Parsons in touch with Herbert T. Rosenfeld, President of the Southern Californian chapter of the American Technion Societya Zionist group dedicated to supporting the newly created State of Israel. Rosenfeld offered Parsons {{a job with the}} Israeli rocket program and hired him to produce technical <b>reports</b> <b>for</b> them. In November 1950, as the Red Scare intensified, Parsons decided to migrate to Israel to pursue Rosenfeld's offer, but a Hughes secretary whom Parsons had asked to type up a portfolio of technical documents reported him to the FBI. She accused Parsons of espionage and attempted theft of classified company documents on the basis of some of the reports that he had sought to submit to the Technion Society.|$|E

After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries.

5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and {{times to be}} {{by far the most}} prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest <b>reports</b> <b>for</b> the use of time-out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s.
