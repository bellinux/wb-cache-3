[...] In 2004, she extended her work to cover the critically endangered <b>river</b> <b>terrapins</b> of Terengganu. This work is now carried out as community-based projects in the Setiu and Kemaman Rivers under the Turtle Conservation Society of Malaysia. Her contributions in marine turtle conservation were recognised by the United Nations Environment Programme when she was conferred the UNEP Global 500 Roll of Honour in 2001. She was listed in the UNEP's Who's Who of Women and the Environment in 2006. In Malaysia, she was conferred the title Pingat Jasa Kebaktian (PJK) by the late Sultan of Terengganu in 1991 in recognition of her contributions in the state. She has also received several research awards in the university. Chan has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, magazines and newsletters. She has also authored several books, including a book for children entitled [...] "Little Turtle Messenger". Many of her works have been applied directly in the conservation of turtles in Malaysia, either to enhance existing efforts, or to develop new approaches in protecting turtles. Her publications were cited extensively in {{the report of the}} WTO (World Trade Organization) Panel on the United States - Import Prohibition of Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products, WT/DS58/R, 15 May 1998.
