5|$|The figure {{arrives at}} Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands. Joker has {{strapped}} a camera to Valestra's corpse {{and sees the}} murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues the killer, but is interrupted {{by the police and}} rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains that she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had embezzled money; her father repaid, but they put out a hit on him. Bruce now believes her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a familiar-looking man in the background of the photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont: the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits <b>Reeves</b> and presses him for information; <b>Reeves</b> insists that Batman is the cloaked killer. He professes his ignorance but Joker believes <b>Reeves</b> needs to protect his reputation and poisons him. <b>Reeves</b> is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. <b>Reeves</b> confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape and told Valestra's mob their location.|$|E

5|$|Handley {{served as}} coach for two mediocre seasons (1991–92), {{in which the}} Giants went from Super Bowl champions to a 6–10 record. He was fired {{following}} the 1992 season and replaced by former Denver Broncos coach Dan <b>Reeves.</b> In the early 1990s, Simms and Taylor played out {{the last years of}} their career with steadily declining production. In 1993, however, the Giants experienced a resurgent season with <b>Reeves</b> at the helm, and Simms and Taylor ended their careers as members of a winning team.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by Dan <b>Reeves,</b> the successful former {{head coach of the}} Denver Broncos who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, <b>Reeves</b> took the unusual step of lobbying heavily for the job. Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and <b>Reeves</b> was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at the time because he felt he knew him better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E

5|$|Many {{actors were}} {{considered}} to replace <b>Reeves</b> including: Simon Baker Denny, Jon Bon Jovi, Patrick Muldoon, Johnathon Schaech, Christian Slater, and Billy Zane. Bullock initially suggested Matthew McConaughey, who passed on the role, prompting her to suggest Jason Patric, {{with whom she had}} wanted to work since seeing his performance in After Dark, My Sweet (1990). De Bont was skeptical of featuring a relatively unknown actor such as Patric, but was reminded by the studio that Bullock and <b>Reeves</b> were also relatively unknown prior to Speed, and ultimately chose Patric based on his role in Sleepers (1996). Patric was paid a reported $4.5–$8 million for his role in Speed2 and used his salary to finance a 1998 drama, Your Friends & Neighbors. After accepting the role, Patric stated that he never saw Speed or had any intentions of seeing it; <b>Reeves</b> said he was looking forward to seeing Patric star in the sequel. After <b>Reeves</b> declined to appear in Speed2, the screenplay was rewritten to remove his character from the story, which De Bont wanted to deal with early in the film. His absence is explained in the first scene, where Annie talks about how her relationship with Jack did not work out, and mentions her current relationship with Alex (Patric), before his character is introduced in the film.|$|E
