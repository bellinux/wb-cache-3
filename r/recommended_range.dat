40|$|AIM: The Caring for Australians with Renal Impairment (CARI) {{clinical}} practice guidelines {{were established in}} 2000 to provide <b>recommended</b> <b>ranges</b> for parameters associated with anaemia management in patients with chronic kidney disease. This study used data from the Renal Anaemia Management (RAM) database to determine the level of compliance with the CARI Guidelines in Australia since their implementation. METHODS: De-identified data from haemodialysis patients at 15 dialysis centres {{were obtained from the}} RAM database provided by Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd, Australia. Validated data were extracted over 6 months (April-September) in 2001 (n = 2586 patients) and 2003 (n = 3190 patients). The percentage of patients with biochemical and haematological parameters that were within the <b>ranges</b> <b>recommended</b> in the CARI Guidelines was compared from 2001 - 2003. RESULTS: There was {{a significant increase in the}} number of patients with values within the <b>recommended</b> <b>ranges</b> for serum ferritin, phosphate, calcium phosphate product and urea reduction ratio from 2001 - 2003. There was no change in the proportion of patients with values within the <b>recommended</b> <b>ranges</b> for haemoglobin, transferrin saturation, calcium or parathyroid hormone. There was considerable variation in compliance with <b>recommended</b> <b>ranges</b> between and within individual dialysis centres. Compliance to the target haemoglobin level (> or = 110 g/L) ranged from 42 - 78 % of patients at different centres in 2003. CONCLUSION: Although the number of patients with values within those recommended in the CARI guidelines has increased for some parameters, many patients in Australia have clinical parameters outside the <b>ranges</b> <b>recommended</b> in the CARI Guidelines...|$|R

2500|$|Excess calcium from supplements, {{fortified}} food and high-calcium diets, can cause milk-alkali syndrome, which has serious toxicity {{and can be}} fatal. In 1915, Bertram Sippy introduced the [...] "Sippy regimen" [...] of hourly ingestion of milk and cream, and the gradual addition of eggs and cooked cereal, for 10 days, combined with alkaline powders, which provided symptomatic relief for peptic ulcer disease. Over the next several decades, the Sippy regimen resulted in renal failure, alkalosis, and hypercalcaemia, mostly in men with peptic ulcer disease. These adverse effects were reversed when the regimen stopped, but it was fatal in some patients with protracted vomiting. Milk-alkali syndrome declined in men after effective treatments for peptic ulcer disease arose. During the past 15 years, {{it has been reported}} in women taking calcium supplements above the <b>recommended</b> <b>range</b> of 1.2 to 1.5g daily, for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and is exacerbated by dehydration.

40|$|Abstract. Landscape-level {{bark beetle}} (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) {{outbreaks}} occurred in Arizona ponder- osa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Law.) forests from 2001 to 2003 {{in response to}} severe drought and suitable forest conditions. We quantified surface fuel loadings and depths, and calculated canopy fuels based on forest structure attributes in 60 plots established 5 years previously on five national forests. Half of the plots we sampled in 2007 had bark beetle- caused pine mortality and half did not have mortality. Adjusting for differences in pre-outbreak stand density, plots with mortality had higher surface fuel and lower canopy fuel loadings 5 years after the outbreak compared with plots without mortality. Total surface fuels averaged 2. 5 times higher and calculated canopy fuels 2 times lower in plots with mortality. Nearly half of the trees killed in the bark beetle outbreak had fallen within 5 years, resulting in loadings of 1000 -h woody fuels above <b>recommended</b> <b>ranges</b> for dry coniferous forests in 20 % of the mortality plots. We expect 1000 -h fuel loadings in other mortality plots to exceed <b>recommended</b> <b>ranges</b> as remaining snags fall to the ground.
