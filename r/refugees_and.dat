5|$|According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, {{there are}} three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted {{on the basis of}} a point system that {{accounts}} for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada's labour market) and Refugee class (those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 <b>refugees,</b> <b>and</b> 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total immigrants to the country. Canada resettles over one in 10 of the world's <b>refugees</b> <b>and</b> has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Cameroon {{hosted a}} total {{population}} of <b>refugees</b> <b>and</b> asylum seekers of approximately 97,400. Of these, 49,300 were from the Central African Republic (many driven west by war), 41,600 from Chad, and 2,900 from Nigeria. Kidnappings of Cameroonian citizens by Central African bandits have increased since 2005.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 There {{is limited}} {{research}} around {{best practices in}} working with <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> immigrant students. Since teachers spend {{the majority of the}} school day with students, their insights about how best to serve these populations of children and adolescents is critical. This dissertation study conducted an online survey study with 139 elementary school general education teachers in a large urban school district to examine teacher beliefs and attitudes about the following factors in meeting the needs of <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> immigrant children: teachers’ perceived self-efficacy, attitudes toward implementing new and innovative practices, cultural competency, prior preparation and overall competency, and perceptions about the needs of <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> immigrant students. Results indicate that overall, teachers feel confident, culturally competent, and are open to implementing practices to serve <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> immigrant students; the majority of teachers reported that they didn’t think that <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> immigrant students have unique needs, which conflicts with current research; only minority status was found to be a unique predictor of beliefs around student needs. Implications and future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{describes}} and analyses undertaking {{a pilot study}} in which refugee or asylum-seeking parents who have been drawn into social work safeguarding children procedures reflect upon their experiences. This study is located {{within the context of}} political, policy and social work safeguarding practice developments in the UK which are relevant to <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> asylum-seeking families. Interviews were undertaken with five <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> asylum-seeking parents and one carer, three support workers and one social worker, and three conference chairs. Although the sample is small, the findings from the pilot study reveal some significant commonalities between comments from all three groupings, as well as significant differences. These findings will be of interest to <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> asylum-seeking peoples, support workers, social workers, managers and policymakers and all who are concerned for the wellbeing of <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> asylum-seeking parents, children and young people...|$|R

40|$|During the 2010 federal {{election}} campaign, the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition issued statements on asylum seeker policy that were pandering to the anxieties {{of a minority}} of Australians. The statements about asylum seekers that have been issued by the major political parties highlight {{the need for a}} comprehensive and informed debate about asylum seeker <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> policy. An informed debate about <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> asylum seeker policy has been lacking not least {{because of a lack of}} historical awareness of <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> asylum seeker issues. <b>Refugee</b> <b>and</b> asylum seeker issues have not featured prominently in Australian historiography. Six themes suggest themselves for further historical research: anti-alienism <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> advocacy; the institution of asylum; engagement with the international refugee regime; the intersections between <b>refugee</b> <b>and</b> immigration policy; the evolvement of the category of the refugee; and the admission <b>and</b> rejection of <b>refugees.</b> Social inclusion ought to be thought of as a two-way process.

5|$|As the Turkish forces moved towards Nakhichevan, Andranik {{with his}} Armenian Special Striking Division {{moved to the}} mountainous region of Zangezur {{to set up a}} defense.

Andranik arrived in Zangezur at a critical moment with around 30,000 <b>refugees</b> <b>and</b> an estimated force of between 3,000 and 5,000 men. He established effective control of the region by September. The role of Zangezur was crucial because it was a connection point between Turkey and Azerbaijan.

The mortar operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats North Korean troops disguised themselves as <b>refugees</b> <b>and</b> would form roadblocks in the UN troops' rear areas, or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable.|$|E
