40|$|INTENDED USE Oxidase Reagent Droppers {{are used}} in the Kovacs oxidase test as a {{qualitative}} reaction in the identification of nonfermenters and miscellaneous gram-negative bacteria. 1, 2 SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION The oxidase test is based on the production of an enzyme called indophenol oxidase. This enzyme oxidizes a redox dye (present in the reagent) which results in a color change of yellow to dark purple. 1, 2 PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE Indophenol oxidase, in the presence of atmospheric oxygen, oxidizes the phenylenediamine oxidase reagent to form a dark-purple compound, indophenol. 1, 2 REAGENTS Oxidase Reagent Droppers contain 0. 5 mL of a 1 % aqueous solution of N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylp-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride which has been formulated with agents to ensure maximum stability.

5000|$|Though often {{extremely}} painful, most stings from a Portuguese man o' war do {{not require}} immediate medical treatment. The stings result in severe dermatitis characterized by long, thin open wounds that resemble those caused by a whip. These are not caused by any impact or cutting action, however, but by irritating urticariogenic substances in the tentacles. The usual round of treatment for a Portuguese man o' war sting begins with the application of poured salt water to rinse away any remaining microscopic nematocysts—rubbing or touching the wound causes the discharge of any nematocysts still attached to the <b>skin.</b> <b>Rinsing</b> <b>with</b> salt <b>water</b> helps wash these [...] "unfired" [...] nematocysts away from the wound, though it does not directly relieve the pain (also, as {{it is likely that}} this rinse water will contain some nematocysts, care should be taken to keep it from running over the victim's skin: salt water poured down a leg may result in fresh stings suddenly appearing on the feet, for example). Fresh water has been shown to cause nematocystic discharge and is not recommended for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|Acrylic {{painters}} can {{modify the}} appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other {{characteristics of the}} paint surface by using acrylic media or simply by adding water. Watercolor and oil painters also use various media, but the range of acrylic media is much greater. Acrylics {{have the ability to}} bond to many different surfaces, and media can be used to modify their binding characteristics. Acrylics can be used on paper, canvas and a range of other materials, however their use on engineered woods such as medium-density fiberboard can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces. In these cases it is recommended that the surface first be sealed with an appropriate sealer. Acrylics can be applied in thin layers or washes to create effects that resemble watercolors and other water-based media. They {{can also be used to}} build thick layers of paint—gel and molding paste media are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features. Acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as train, car, house, and human models. People who make such models use acrylic paint to build facial features on dolls, or raised details on other types of models. Wet acrylic paint is easily removed from paint brushes and <b>skin</b> <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> whereas oil paints require the use of a hydrocarbon.|$|R

5000|$|In Islamic tradition, Bakkah {{is where}} Hagar and Ishmael (Ismā'īl) settled after being taken by Abraham (Ibrāhīm) to the wilderness, a story {{parallel}} to the Bible's Book of Genesis (21:14-21)(but see below for the biblical geography). Genesis tells of how after Hagar and Ishmael ran out of water to drink. In Arab tradition, Hagar runs {{back and forth between}} two elevated points seven times to search for help before sitting down in despair, at which point the angel speaks as recorded in Genesis 21:17-19: [...] God heard the cry of the boy, and an angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, 'What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heeded the cry of the boy where he is. Come, lift up the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.' Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the <b>skin</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> and let the boy drink. [...] Here, the tradition holds that a spring gushed forth from the spot where Hagar had laid Ishmael, and this spring {{came to be known as}} the Well of Zamzam.
