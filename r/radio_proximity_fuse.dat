5000|$|Dennison was {{a student}} of Niels Bohr, and knew Hans Bethe, Wolfgang Pauli, and Enrico Femi before they became world-famous.Most of Dennison's work was on {{molecular}} structure. Following {{the discovery of the}} spin of the electron in 1925 by George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit, the specific heat of hydrogen was a major unsolved problems. Dennison solved this problem in 1927 by postulating that the spin of protons does not transition frequently during measurements. This new theory agreed precisely with experiments given that the proton's spin was 1/2.In 1932 Dennison and Uhlenbeck solved the two-minima [...] "reversing umbrella" [...] problem for the position of nitrogen in ammonia. This result predicted absorption at microwave wavelengths, which inspired Neal Williams to build a molecular microwave spectrograph, one of the first ever built.During World War 2 Dennison received a citation from the US Navy for his work with the VT <b>radio</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse.</b> After the war, Dennison returned to work on molecular structure, as well as working on the design of the new synchrotron at Michigan. With Theodore H. Berlin, he developed the theory of stable orbits in a synchrotron with straight sections, a feature that soon became standard in most large synchrotrons.|$|E
5000|$|The allies most {{advanced}} technologies were showcased by the anti-aircraft defence against the German V-1 cruise missiles (V stands for Vergeltungswaffe, [...] "retaliation weapon"). The 419th and 601st Anti-aircraft Gun Battalions of the US Army were first {{allocated to the}} Folkestone-Dover coast to defend London, and then moved to Belgium {{to become part of}} the [...] "Antwerp X" [...] project coordinated from the [...] in Keerbergen. With the liberation of Antwerp, the port city immediately became the highest priority target, and received the largest number of V-1 and V-2 missiles of any city. The smallest tactical unit of the operation was a gun battery consisting of four 90 mm guns firing shells equipped with a <b>radio</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse.</b> Incoming targets were acquired and automatically tracked by SCR-584 radar, developed at the MIT Rad Lab. Output from the gun-laying radar was fed to the M-9 director, an electronic analogue computer developed at Bell Laboratories to calculate the lead and elevation corrections for the guns. With the help of these three technologies, close to 90% of the V-1 missiles, on track to the defence zone around the port, were destroyed.|$|E
40|$|Besides {{enhancing}} the warhead effectiveness, the terminal lead angle constraint {{ensures that the}} target remains {{within the field of}} view of the <b>radio</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> which is very critical for the success of a mission. This paper presents substantial enhancement of the generalized explicit guidance to include the terminal lead angle constraint in three dimension (3 -D) [...] With the availability of the desired total lead angle in 3 -D, it computes the necessary terminal flight path and heading angles so that it not only satisfies the lead angle constraint, but also leads to the minimum among all minimum control effort solutions for various possible terminal flight path and heading angle combinations. With no lead angle constraint, it also gracefully degenerates to the standard proportional navigation guidance...|$|E
5000|$|As {{with most}} other US destroyers of this period, the 5 inch guns {{featured}} all-angle power loading and were director controlled, making them {{as effective as}} the technology allowed against aircraft. By late 1942, <b>radio</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses</b> (VT fuses) made them much more effective. As in the last two Maurys, the two forward 5 inch guns were in enclosed mounts, while the after guns were open. However, in common with all US surface combatants in the 1930s, the light AA armament was weak; only four [...]50 caliber machine guns (12.7 mm) were equipped. It was apparently felt that the heavy AA armament would shoot down most incoming aircraft in all situations, but the attack on Pearl Harbor showed that this was not true. The Bagleys' weak AA armament was partially remedied after Pearl Harbor by replacing the machine guns with one twin 40 mm Bofors (1.6 in) mount and six 20 mm Oerlikon cannon (0.8 in). Most of these destroyers had some or all torpedo tubes replaced by light AA guns during World War II, but not the Bagleys.needed ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{with most}} other US destroyers of this period, the 5-inch guns {{featured}} all-angle power loading and were director controlled, making them {{as effective as}} the technology allowed against aircraft. By late 1942, <b>radio</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses</b> (VT fuses) made them much more effective. As in the last two Maurys, the two forward 5-inch guns were in enclosed mounts, while the after guns were open. However, in the Benhams, the after two mounts were a Mark 30 Mod 1 base-ring type with an integral ammunition hoist fed from a handling room below each gun, as in an enclosed mount. This allowed some of the class to be fitted with an enclosure for No. 4 gun and an open-top shield for No. 3 gun while on Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic in 1941; but the shields were removed later to save weight for light anti-aircraft armament. In common with all US surface combatants in the 1930s, the as-built light AA armament was weak; only four [...]50 caliber machine guns (12.7 mm) were equipped. It was apparently felt that the heavy AA armament would shoot down most incoming aircraft in all situations, but the attack on Pearl Harbor showed that this was not true.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{equivalent}} {{microstrip antenna}} used in <b>radio</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> is presented. The design of this antenna {{is based on}} multilayer multi-permittivity dielectric substrate which is analyzed by finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. Equivalent iterative formula is modified in the condition of cylindrical coordinate system. The mixed substrate which contains two kinds of media (one of them is air) {{takes the place of}} original single substrate. The results of equivalent antenna simulation show that the resonant frequency of equivalent antenna {{is similar to that of}} the original antenna. The validity of analysis can be validated by means of antenna resonant frequency formula. Two antennas have same radiation pattern and similar gain. This method can be used to reduce the weight of antenna, which is significant to the design of missile-borne antenna...|$|E
5000|$|As built: These {{were the}} first US destroyers with a dual-purpose main armament. They {{received}} five of the then-new 5 in/38cal gun (Mark 12), installed in Mark 21 dual-purpose single mounts. The forward two mounts (numbered 51 and 52) were partially enclosed with lightly-armored open-back shields. (see picture) The midships mount (No 53) and the after two mounts (numbers 54 and 55) were open. Unlike subsequent five-gun US destroyers, mount 53 was immediately aft of the stacks. An important feature was the dual-purpose Mark 33 director above the bridge, which coordinated the fire of the 5 inch guns against both ships and aircraft. By late 1942, <b>radio</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses</b> (VT fuses) would make the guns much more effective against aircraft. Just aft of mount 53 were two trainable torpedo tube quad-mounts (with four 21 in tubes on each mount), one abaft the other. The class was initially equipped with the Mark 8 torpedo, which {{was replaced by the}} Mark 15 torpedo beginning in 1938. On the 02 level, aft of mount 52, there were two single [...]50 cal (12.7mm) machine gun (MG) mounts next to the port and starboard rails. Two more [...]50 cal MGs were on the main deck, midships.|$|R

50|$|One of Sprague Electric's biggest {{contributions}} {{to the war effort}} was in the manufacturing of the variable timing <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse.</b> The <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> was a small transmitter (and in some cases a receiver) built on a bomb or artillery shell that would detonate the bomb or shell before impact, causing greater destruction.

50|$|The {{demands on}} {{personnel}} and funds {{at the start}} of the war were such that little more was done at that time. In less than a year, however, (in September 1940), Butement's concept was moved dramatically toward mass production when it was exported under the technology transfer arrangements of the Tizard Mission, and subsequently a variation of his circuit became adopted in the United States as the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> or VT (variable-time) fuse, the most-manufactured electronic device of the war. In the later stages of the war, anti-aircraft shells fitted with <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses</b> played a major part in defeating both German V-1 flying bomb attacks on London, and Japanese kamikaze attacks on Allied shipping. As well as the dramatic breaking of Japanese Naval air power in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, it immortalised the invention's impact with the battle's alternate name: The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot, where the battle losses were so severe that it led to the Japanese adoption of the kamikaze. Years later, Butement said that he considered the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> as his most significant accomplishment.|$|R
