2500|$|Irradiation {{treatments}} are typically classified by dose (high, medium, and low), but are sometimes classified by {{the effects of}} the treatment (radappertization, radicidation and <b>radurization).</b> Food irradiation is sometimes referred to as [...] "cold pasteurization" [...] or [...] "electronic pasteurization" [...] because ionizing the food does not heat the food to high temperatures during the process, and the effect is similar to heat pasteurization.

50|$|<b>Radurization</b> is the {{application}} of food irradiation to foods using a dose of ionizing radiation sufficient to enhance its keeping quality by causing a substantial decrease in numbers of viable specific spoilage microorganisms.

5000|$|Up to {{the point}} where the food is {{processed}} by irradiation, the food is processed in the same way as all other food. To treat the food, they are exposed to a radioactive source, for a set period of time to achieve a desired dose. Radiation may be emitted by a radioactive substance, or by X-ray and electron beam accelerators. Special precautions are taken to ensure the food stuffs never come in contact with the radioactive substances and that the personnel and the environment are protected from exposure radiation.Irradiation treatments are typically classified by dose (high, medium, and low), but are sometimes classified by the effects of the treatment (radappertization, radicidation and <b>radurization).</b> Food irradiation is sometimes referred to as [...] "cold pasteurization" [...] or [...] "electronic pasteurization" [...] because ionizing the food does not heat the food to high temperatures during the process, and the effect is similar to heat pasteurization.

40|$|<b>Radurization</b> {{processing}} of fresh eviscerated poultry has been microbiologically studied. The recommended dose of 0. 5 Mrads extended the shelf life at 5 C by approximately 14 days. This treatment also effected a 10 and 11 log {{reduction in the}} number of viable Salmonella species and Staphylococcus aureus strains, respectively. Recycling these organisms at sublethal doses of irradiation resulted in strains possessing increased irradiation resistance. Shifts in the microbial ecology after irradiation and storage resulted, in some instances, in the isolation of organisms tentatively identified as Moraxella sp. and Herellea vaginicola...|$|E
40|$|Results {{of several}} major studies on food systems for space {{missions}} beginning with Apollo 12 through Apollo-Soyuz and {{investigations of the}} application of irradiation to food for manned space flight are reported. The study of flight food systems involved the application of <b>radurization</b> (pasteurizing levels) doses of gamma irradiation to flour and bread supplied by Pepperidge Farms {{in advance of the}} missions. All flights from Apollo 12 through 17 carried irradiated fresh bread. On Apollo 17, cooperation with Natick Laboratories permitted the introduction of a ham sandwich using irradiated bread and irradiated sterile ham. Investigations centered on irradiated bread were conducted during the course of these missions. Studies were applied to the concept of improving fresh bread {{from the point of view}} of mold inhibition. The studies considered how irradiation could best be applied at what levels and on a variety of bread types. Throughout the studies of the application of gamma irradiation the emphasis was placed upon using low levels of irradiation in the pasteurizing or radurizing doses [...] under a Megarad. The primary goal was to determine if a public health benefit could be demonstrated using <b>radurization</b> along with food preservation and food quality improvements. The public health benefit would be parallel to that of pasteurization of milk as a concept. Publications are included providing the details of these observations, one dealing with the flour characteristics and the other dealing with the influence on fresh bread types. These demonstrate the major findings noted during the period of the studies examining bread...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Microbiology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 1996. This study {{analysed}} {{the bacteria}} numbers of Hake products manufactured at 6 {{different levels of}} processing complexity, analyses were conducted at 20 °C on Salt Water Agar (SWA) for a 48 h incubation period. This enumeration method was suitable for indicating time and temperature related abuse in the processing system. This method was sensitive in indicating the level of processing complexity. The aerobic bacteria enumerations at 20 °C (SWA) were compared to the current EU/FDA (European Union/Federal Drug Administration USA) standard procedure testing samples on Plate Count Agar, (PCA) incubated at 30 - 35 °C. The method using SWA incubated at 20 °C provided better and more accurate bacterial counts under "good" and "poor" manufacturing practice. The hurdle concept was applied, using gamma irradiation, temperature (Time), chemical preservatives and Vacuum packaging {{in an attempt to}} prolong the shelf life of fresh, uncooked Cape hake and Kingklip products. <b>Radurization</b> was effective only when the treated product was kept at refrigerated temperatures. Temperature was the most important control measure in extending the shelf life of the products. No shelf life extension was achieved with the use of chemical preservatives. Vacuum packaging was not effective in prolonging shelf life of the products and did not show any benefit when compared to oxygen permeable vacuum (microaerophilic) packaging. Determination of the total aerobic viable bacteria numbers at 20 °C SWA, were suitable for estimating the shelflife of deepsea whitefish products...|$|E
40|$|In {{the world}} practice, the {{radiation}} technologies for food product processing are extensively used; with that, free radicals {{are found in}} products. Scientists have not made a final conclusion about the complete safety of the method of radiation sterilization, so {{it is very important}} to control irradiated food products to determine a fact of irradiation and residual effects. The experimental data obtained on the domestic spectrometer EPR series Labrador Expert X, which was developed by Spektr LLC with the assistance of the research team of the authors from the Institute of Natural Sciences of UrFU named after Yeltsin B. N., indicate the presence of free radicals in the samples of boneless beef, which is probably associated with °Ccurrence of ante-mortem technological and slaughter stress in animals. Irradiation of the chicken meat samples carried out in laboratory conditions allows a comparison of the spectra before and after irradiation. The dose of irradiation of poultry was 12 kGy. This dose was selected based on the practice of recognizing the radiation doses of 10 - 12 kGy as safe, which was established in many countries. It was found that in the range of the magnetic fields from 3272 to 3280 Gs, there was a weak EPR signal with an amplitude of 7. 28 e- 05 and D less than 1. Such a background signal can be explained by stress in the birds, peculiarities of feeding and other factors. After irradiation at a dose of 12 kGy, the ESR signal increased in the range of the magnetic fields from 3273 to 3286 Gs and D was higher than 1. This technology or, in other words, radappertization, is an industrial sterilization of food products for long storage at positive temperatures, which precludes re-contamination by microorganisms. After irradiation, the fivefold increase in the amplitude of the ESR signal was observed and two additional signals with small amplitude appeared. The fact of irradiation/absence of irradiation of the samples was also confirmed by calculation according to GOST R 52529 - 2006. The need for further research of meat and meat products by the EPR method is obvious: to determine a fact of sterilization or <b>radurization,</b> to determine a radiation dose, to accumulate reliably established information on radiation sensitivity and to develop a methodological base for the use of an EPR spectrometer...|$|E
