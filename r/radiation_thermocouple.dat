40|$|International audienceThermal {{radiation}} sensors {{are based}} on two signal transduction stages: radiation to thermal and thermal to electrical. The most common of these sensors are the <b>radiation</b> <b>thermocouple</b> using the Seebeck effect and the bolometer applying the thermoresistive effect. While the bolometer requires a bias current for signal generation the thermocouple is generally operated unbiased. The paper theoretically investigates a biased thermocouple instead, which {{can be thought of}} as a combination of both thermal radiation sensor types. Its responsivity and detectivity is calculated based on previous theories of the performance of bolometers and radiation thermocouples, respectively, thereby including the Peltier effect. The electrical resistance and thermal conductance of the thermocouple as input parameters for these calculations are modeled using a simple strip geometry to facilitate one-dimensional analytical electrothermal modeling...|$|E

40|$|The surface {{temperature}} of sea ice controls {{the rate of}} ice growth and heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. An algorithm for the satellite retrieval of ice {{surface temperature}} has recently been published, but {{due to the lack}} of validation data has not been extensively tested. In this paper, data from a recent Arctic field experiment is used in an attempt to validate that algorithm. While the procedure is, in principle, straightforward, we demonstrate that validation is complicated by a variety of factors, including incorrectly assumed atmospheric conditions, undetected clouds in the satellite data, spatial and temporal variability in the surface temperature field, and surface and satellite measurement errors. Comparisons between surface temperatures determined from upwelling broadband longwave radiation, spatial measurements of narrow-band <b>radiation,</b> <b>thermocouples</b> buried just below the snow surface, and narrow-band satellite data show differences of 1 to 3 deg. C. The range in these independent measurements indicates the need for specially designed validation experiments utilizing narrow-band radiometers on aircraft to obtain broad spatial coverage...|$|R

40|$|Low {{pressure}} {{hot water}} radiators {{are the most}} popular type of heat emitter used in UK buildings. Because of high surface temperatures, or for aesthetic reasons, radiators are often encased in some form of architectural casing which reduces their output. An alternative method of reducing surface touch temperature and enhancing the appearance of radiators may be achieved by using decorative covers. This research examines how the heat output from a radiator is affected by the application of an innovative magnetic decorative cover to the radiator surface. A series of tests was run which compared the heat output from a bare radiator, to the output when the radiator is installed (a) under a magnetic cover, and (b) within a traditional wooden cover. Since the heat output from a radiator is by convection and <b>radiation,</b> <b>thermocouples</b> were located on radiator and supporting wall surfaces, {{as well as in the}} air spaces around the radiator. By this means the temperature differences which drive both heat transfer mechanisms could be determined. Additionally, temperatures were also monitored by a thermal imaging camera. The scenario tests were carried out under steady state conditions at closed room space, with controlled room temperature. Results from the tests showed that magnetically applied radiator covers efficiency increased by 13 - 20 % relative to traditional radiator wooden cover. In terms of space-heating, this can reduce energy input needed to achieve comfort temperature. This demonstrates that magnetic radiator covers can offer improved heating system energy performance.

40|$|Improving {{fuel economy}} and {{reduction}} of exhaust emissions {{have become the}} major concerns in the combustion community. Due to low pollutant emission and superior combustion characteristics hydrogen/hydrocarbon blends have received increased attention as alternative fuels for numerous power generation applications. The combustion chemistry of hydrocarbon fuels is significantly {{different from that of}} hydrogen and the flame structure of composite fuels largely depends on the interaction between the two mechanisms. Studies are needed {{in order to understand the}} fundamental combustion chemistry of composite fuels. In this work we have investigated the effect of hydrogen addition on soot formation in a rich premixed ethylene-air flame produced by a McKenna burner and with an equivalence ratio Φ = 2. 34. Hydrogen was added up to 50 % in volume. Temperature axial profiles of different flames were measured by a <b>radiation</b> corrected <b>thermocouple.</b> A cw Nd:YAG laser was used to measure soot axial profiles. The results indicate that hydrogen has a great influence in reducing the amount of soot in the investigated region of the flame. In order to distinguish between chemical and pure dilution effects, similar flames were also produced by helium addition. Soot reduction has been also observed in this case but to a minor extent. In conclusion hydrogen addition in a premixed ethylene-air flame decreases the soot volume fraction both by a dilution effect and by influencing the chemistry of soot formation...|$|R
40|$|Air {{temperature}} within culture vessels is {{a dominant}} factor influencing {{the growth of}} plantlets. A heat transfer model for tissue culture vessels was developed in this study. The heat source for vessels was irradiance from fluorescent tubes. The energy transfer included convective and radiative heat exchanges. In order to validate the model, two types of culture vessels were studied at various light <b>radiation</b> levels. Type-T <b>thermocouples</b> connected to a data logger were used to measure temperatures. The discrepancies between the values predicted by the model and actual measurement values were less than 0. 6 degreesC, and the average absolute error was lower than 0. 4 degreesC. Increasing the surface convection coefficient by increasing ventilation velocity could effectively reduce the greenhouse effect in these small size culture vessels.

40|$|By pre-thawing and {{consolidating}} {{the upper}} {{layers of the}} permafrost, a thinner stable roadway embankment may be constructed, provided {{the thickness of the}} embankment plus that of the pre-thawed layers are adequate to contain the full seasonal thaw zone. Six test plots were established near Fairbanks, Alaska, in April 1980, to determine how surface modifications may be used to accelerate thawing of permafrost by increasing the solar heat gain. The various modifications examined included clearing and stripping the surface, construction of a thin gravel pad, darkening of the gravel pad surface with asphalt, and the use of clear polyethylene film to create a “greenhouse effect ” on both gravel pad and stripped sections. Each section simulated a full roadway width with adjacent uncleared vegetation. Instrumentation used to monitor performance included heat flow meters, windspeed and <b>radiation</b> sensors, and <b>thermocouples</b> for subsurface tem-perature observations. Thaw depths and surface settlements were recorded monthly at nine points on each section, and monthly measurements of surface albedo were also made for each treatment.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{optical fibre}} temperature sensor employing the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique has been utilised {{to measure the}} surface temperature of window glass during a fire. A comparison has been made between the intrinsic optical fibre sensor and thermocouples (the conventional temperature measuring device used in fire research). Neodymium doped fibre {{was used as the}} temperature sensing element. Due to the destructive nature of the fire tests on the neodymium doped fibre, a new section of bare doped fibre was spliced for each test. Before each fire test, the (non-glass) coating on the sensing fibre was removed. The detector was calibrated against K-type thermocouples in a stabilised temperature environment. This same bare optical fibre was attached to the window glass pane with an adhesive that was appropriate for the fire test conditions. A preliminary investigation was undertaken to compare the effect of a radiant heat environment on the sensing fibre and thermocouples. The bare fibre showed a significantly lower temperature (about 25 C lower) than the average thermocouple temperature. This is consistent with the expectation that the fibre is less subject to the effects of <b>radiation</b> than the <b>thermocouples.</b> Thus it was demonstrated that the thermocouple did not accurately represent the time-dependent temperature behaviour of window glass, and specifically, the temperature within the core of the fibre. Fire tests were conducted in a chamber, which was designed and built to simulate a combustion fire starting in a small room with a window. Both sensor types were used to measure the temperature of the inside surface of the window glass during a fire. The observed temperature difference was smaller than that observed during the preliminary tests where the thermocouples were subject to a radiant heat environment. Reasons for this are discussed within the thesis. The measurement of window glass temperature during a fire has been demonstrated using an optical fibre sensor based on the fluorescence intensity ratio technique. This clearly establishes the existence of a discrepancy between window glass temperature and the temperature measured by thermocouples when they are subjected to a radiant heat environment...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 94 - 99). The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to perform radiation computations in opposed-flow flame spread in a microgravity environment. In this work, the flame spread simulations consider a thermally thin, PMMA fuel in a quiescent, microgravity environment or facing low opposed-flow velocities at ambient conditions of 1 atm and 50 - 50 volumetric mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. The flame spread model, which is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, is used for numerical simulations in combination with a radiation model. The CFD code is written in FORTRAN language, and a Matlab code is developed for plotting results. The temperature and species fields from CFD computations are used as inputs into the radiation model. Radiative quantities are calculated by using a global balance method along with the total transmittance non-homogeneous model. <b>Radiation</b> effect on <b>thermocouple</b> temperature measurement is investigated. Although this topic is well known, performing radiation correction calculations usually considers surface radiation only and not gas radiation. The inclusion of gas radiation is utilized in predicting the gas temperature that a thermocouple would measure. A narrow bed radiation model is {{used to determine the}} average incident radiative flux at a specified location from which a thermocouple temperature measurement is predicted. This study focuses on the quiescent microgravity environment only. The effect of parameters such as thermocouple surface emissivity and bead diameter are also studied. For the main part of this thesis, the effect of gas radiation on the mechanism of flame spread over a thermally thin, solid fuel in microgravity is investigated computationally. Generated radiative fields including thermal and species fields are utilized to investigate the nature of the influence of gas radiation on flame structure as well as its role in the mechanism of opposed-flow flame spread. The opposed-flow configuration considers low flow velocities including a quiescent environment where radiation {{has been shown to be}} dominant. However, given the fact that gas radiation acts as a loss mechanism, and at the same time, it enhances forward heat transfer through radiation feedback to the fuel surface, there is no definitive work that establishes the role of gas radiation. This thesis explores the role played by gas radiation as a driving versus as a retarding mechanism. In this work, it is found that gas radiation is important in capturing flame images and spread rates. Gas radiation primarily acts as a loss mechanism through its effects on flame temperature which overwhelms the radiation feedback to the surface...|$|R
