2500|$|The tower's {{completed}} height was [...] {{shorter than}} the design, and commissioning was finally completed in 1851 when the <b>revolving</b> <b>lamp</b> and clockwork mechanism were fitted. [...] Unusually for the period as most lighthouse lamps and mechanisms came from England, the machinery for the revolving catoptric light was designed and built in Fremantle. [...] Assistant Surveyor-General Augustus Gregory designed the mechanism which comprised two sets of three oil burning lamps, each with a silvered parabolic reflector. [...] In 1850, a contract was let to Alfred Carson to construct the revolving apparatus {{at a cost of}} £43. [...] The official opening on 1 June 1851 coincided with the twenty-second anniversary of the Colony and the opening of another lighthouse at Arthur Head.|$|E
5000|$|A BLV Topspot 90 Volt Metal Halide 150-watt <b>revolving</b> <b>lamp</b> with a {{range of}} [...] {{provides}} the main light. This replaced three 90-watt Osram Halostar lights {{with a range}} of [...] in December 2012 in preparation for the closure of Orfordness Lighthouse in June 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Mazatlán's {{lighthouse}} (El Faro) began {{operating in}} mid-1879. The maritime signals were manufactured in Paris, France, containing a large oil lamp with mirrors, and a Fresnel lens {{to focus the}} light. Since the light was static, from a distance it was often mistaken for a star. By 1905, this lamp was converted to a <b>revolving</b> <b>lamp.</b> During that period, the Mazatlán lighthouse {{was considered to be}} the naturally highest in the world. Today, the 1000 watt bulb can be seen for 30 nmi km. Near the lighthouse shore, famous [...] "divers" [...] (called this even by the Spanish-speaking inhabitants of Mazatlán) perform daring jumps off high rocks into the Pacific Ocean, for tips from onlooking tourists.|$|E
50|$|In 1988 the 4th Order optic was {{replaced}} by a rotating beacon. This comprised an array of quartz halogen lamps in aluminium parabolic reflectors mounted on a gearless <b>revolving</b> pedestal. The <b>lamps</b> require only one-fifth of the energy required to produce the same intensity as incandescent lamps. These low-power lamps therefore allow solar power to be used in place of generators. In addition, the operation of the light is controlled by a photocell. The manning of the lighthouse was further reduced to two men. The use of solar energy which is freely and readily available has resulted in a reduction of operating and maintenance cost.|$|R
5000|$|Both Malden and Douglas {{spent time}} with SFPD detectives in order to lend an air of {{authenticity}} to the show. SFPD Detectives took a liking to both Malden and Douglas, whom they characterized as [...] "very fine fellows". Unlike subsequent generations of television production the show {{made an effort to}} insinuate itself as seamlessly as possible into the fabric of the city. The series was filmed entirely on location in San Francisco. A warehouse converted to an interior scenes sound stage was located at the dead end of Kearny Street below Telegraph Hill, across from 1855 Kearny Street currently adjoined to 150 Chestnut Street, where it still stands today. In the series, the Inspectors' unmarked Ford 4-door sedan would respond to an emergency after placing a single <b>lamp</b> <b>revolving</b> magnetic red light on the roof. This was contrary to authentic unmarked SFPD vehicles, which used a forward steady-burning red handheld spotlight (pursuant to California Vehicle Code section 25252) which hung by a hook to the top inside front windshield. The studio prop black and white marked SFPD radio cars were authentic-looking with one exception: in early episodes the studio cars had twin 2-lamp revolving roof-mounted red lights or 2 roof-mounted forward steady-burning red lights {{on opposite sides of the}} center 4-lamp revolving red light, while authentic marked SFPD black-and-white radio car roof-mounted emergency lights had one forward steady-burning red light and one rear-facing flashing amber light on opposite sides of the center 4-lamp revolving red light.|$|R
