40|$|Photograph of {{graves of}} thirty {{unidentified}} dead after the earthquake, San Francisco, 1906. Small, wooden posts connected with <b>rope</b> <b>guard</b> {{the row of}} graves in the grass yard at center. Small sticks mark each grave. Bags and furniture are piled beneath a tree on the left. A smaller tree stands {{at the center of}} the field behind the graves. More trees stand near the tents in the background. A street on the far right leads to the damaged buildings behind the tents in the background...|$|E
30|$|Camel hides are {{important}} products that fulfil many functions. The hides {{are used to}} roof traditional houses of pastoral communities. The hides were also used for making <b>ropes,</b> <b>guards,</b> drums, seats, sandals, praying mats and water and milk containers. Among the Turkana community, hide and skins are eaten as food, and also other communities use them as famine food. This finding {{is in line with}} that of Field (2005) who indicated that hides are boiled and eaten for food by the Turkana community.|$|R
30|$|This {{study found}} that camel hides were {{important}} products, used both for domestic purposes and for sale. The hides were used to build the roofs for traditional pastoral houses. They were also used for making <b>ropes,</b> <b>guards,</b> drums, seats, sandals, prayer mats used by Muslims and water and milk containers. Camels are used as means of transport for camel keepers. They offer good means of transport to the pastoralists when migrating as they carry their household goods and the materials of their traditional houses. Camels carry old people, the ill, toddlers, pregnant women {{and those who have}} just given birth.|$|R
60|$|It {{was all too}} inconceivably monstrous. I {{could not}} bear to look at her. A short {{distance}} away, behind a stretched <b>rope</b> <b>guarded</b> by a policeman, were the lepers' relatives and friends. They were not allowed to come near. There were no last embraces, no kisses of farewell. They called back and forth to one another--last messages, last words of love, last reiterated instructions. And those behind the rope looked with terrible intensity. It was the last time they would behold the faces of their loved ones, for they were the living dead, being carted away in the funeral ship to the graveyard of Molokai.|$|R
60|$|Sir Oliver {{sat down}} upon a coil of <b>rope,</b> his <b>guard</b> about him, {{an object of}} curious {{inspection}} to the rude seamen. They thronged the forecastle and the hatchways to stare at this formidable corsair who once had been a Cornish gentleman and who had become a renegade Muslim and a terror to Christianity.|$|R
60|$|We were boarded {{about the}} same time by both the pirates, who entered furiously at the head of their men; but finding us all {{prostrate}} upon our faces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong <b>ropes,</b> and setting <b>guard</b> upon us, went to search the sloop.|$|R
60|$|The man, whom {{we already}} know as Theckla the Thracian, paid no heed to the {{attention}} which he had aroused, but strode onwards, stepping as lightly as a deer, {{until he reached the}} fringe of the soldiers. Amid their open ranks he picked his way, sprang over the <b>ropes</b> which <b>guarded</b> the arena, and advanced towards the Emperor, until a spear at his breast warned him that he must go no nearer. Then he sunk upon his right knee and called out some words in the Gothic speech.|$|R
60|$|When an angekok has {{sufficient}} {{courage to}} undertake this journey, his torngak, after giving him minute instructions how to act, conducts {{him under the}} earth or sea, passing on {{the way through the}} kingdom of those good souls who spend their lives in felicity and ease. Soon they come to a frightful vacuity--a sort of vasty deep--over which is suspended a narrow wheel, which whirls round with great rapidity. This awful abyss is bridged by a <b>rope,</b> and <b>guarded</b> by seal sentinels. Taking the angekok by the hand, his torngak leads him on the rope over the chasm and past the sentinels into the palace of the Fury.|$|R
60|$|When Mr. George and Rollo {{reached the}} pier, they found, on looking around them, {{that they were}} not yet at liberty. On the {{opposite}} side of the quay was a building, with a sign over it, in French, meaning custom-house office for packet boats; and there were two long ropes stretched, one from the stem and the other from the stern of the steamer, to the opposite sides of the door of this building, so as to enclose a space on the quay, in front of the building, in such a manner as to hem the passengers in, and make it necessary for them to pass through the custom house. The <b>ropes</b> were <b>guarded</b> by soldiers, dressed in what seemed to Rollo the queerest possible uniforms. They all talked French--even those who had talked English when they came on board the packet boat on the other side.|$|R
2500|$|Sami al-Askari, {{a witness}} to the execution, said, [...] "Before the rope was put around his neck, Saddam shouted, 'Allahu Akbar. The Muslim Ummah will be victorious and Palestine is Arab!'" [...] Saddam also {{stressed}} that the Iraqis should fight the American invaders. After the <b>rope</b> was secured, <b>guards</b> shouted various rebukes including [...] "Muqtada! Muqtada! Muqtada!" [...] as reference to Muqtada al-Sadr; Saddam repeated the name mockingly and rebuked the shouts stating, [...] "Do you consider this bravery?" [...] A Shi'a version of an Islamic prayer was recited by some of those present in the room. One observer told Saddam: ...|$|R

6000|$|Then {{the three}} judges {{on the bench}} behind the table, at which sat the monkish secretaries; the hard-faced, hook-nosed [...] "Old Bishop" [...] in his {{gorgeous}} robes and mitre, his crozier resting against the panelling behind him, peering about him with beady eyes. The sullen, heavy-jawed Prior, from some distant county, on his left, clad in a simple black gown with a girdle about his waist. And on the right Clement Maldon, Abbot of Blossholme and enemy of her house, suave, olive-faced, foreign-looking, his black, uneasy eyes observing all, his keen ears catching every word and murmur as he whispered something to the Bishop that caused him to smile grimly. Lastly, placed already in the <b>roped</b> space and <b>guarded</b> by a soldier, poor old Bridget, the half-witted, who was gabbling words to which no one paid any heed.|$|R
50|$|Gomez and Alvarez {{got off to}} a {{tentative}} start in Round 1, with Alvarez playing counterpuncher and Gomez playing pressure fighter. The round was close until the very end of it, where Alvarez caught Gomez with a kind of half hook, half jab while Gomez came in on him somewhat off-balance. The punch scored a flash knockdown on Gomez, swinging the round in Alvarez's favor. In Round 2, Gomez picked up the pace and his strategy for fighting Alvarez was apparent, he would come in very low using upper body movement on Alvarez to avoid counters, fire off his jab and throw short combinations to Alvarez's head and body. This strategy proved to be effective as Alvarez was not able to time Gomez and had his offense blunted by Gomez's workrate. Alvarez would slip in a hard shot here and there, but Gomez was outlanding/outworking him by a wide margin and constantly bringing the fight to Alvarez. This pattern continued in Rounds 3 and 4. In the first half of Round 5, Gomez had a good start to the round but Alvarez finished up the round strong letting his hands go a bit more to make the round debatable. In Round 6, both men had their moments, but {{near the end of the}} round, Alvarez caught Gomez with a counter right uppercut that stunned Gomez. Gomez went back to the <b>ropes,</b> put his <b>guard</b> up, Alvarez came after him with a flurry of six or seven punches, the majority of which were partially blocked by Gomez, but the relatively unknown referee for the fight Wayne Hedgpeth called the fight in Alvarez's favor after the flurry. By the accounts of the HBO commentary team and general consensus, the stoppage of the fight was very fast as Gomez seemed to be able to defend himself and wasn't that hurt, making the stoppage look fishy. Also, despite seemingly controlling, setting the pace of the fight, and outlanding/outworking Alvarez by a wide margin for the majority of the fight, Gomez as it turned out was losing 49-45(x2) and 50-44 on the official scorecards prior to the stoppage, while unofficially HBO had the fight a draw. Gomez said after the fight that Alvarez hit pretty hard and was a good counterpuncher, but he felt that the referee was looking for a reason to stop the fight in Alvarez's favor and so he stopped the fight too early. He said he knew something like that could happen with Alvarez's backing and it is what it is. He also stated his plan to go back down to the Welterweight division and try to win a championship there.|$|R
