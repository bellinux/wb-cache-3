The images were used to measure profiles of the flame surface density (R) and the average CH layer thickness it is argued that these parameters¯(d);CH are the ones that should be used to assess new large eddy simulations (LESs), rather than insensitive parameters such as mean concentrations.

The reason for reviving the interest to this type of gasification process is that it is ecologically clean and able to produce two types of useful products (simultaneously or separately): gas (either combustible or syngas) and middle-temperature coke. The former may be used as a fuel for gas boilers and diesel-generators or as syngas for producing gasoline, etc., the latter - as a technological fuel in metallurgy, as a chemical absorbent or as raw material for household fuel briquettes.

40|$|Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) {{combustion}} {{is one of}} combustion technologies {{which can}} improve efficiency and reduce emissions simultaneously. This combustion type is characterised by the highly preheated reactant temperature and the relatively small temperature rise during combustion due to the intense dilution of the reactant mixture. These unique combustion conditions give MILD combustion very attractive features such as high combustion efficiency, reduction of pollutant emissions, attenuation of combustion instabilities and flexibility of the flow field. However, our understanding of MILD combustion {{is not enough to}} employ the MILD combustion technology further for modern combustion devices. In this thesis, Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) has been carried out for turbulent MILD combustion under four MILD and classical premixed conditions. A two-phase strategy is employed in the DNS to include the effect of imperfect mixing between fresh and exhaust gases before intense chemical reactions start. In the simulated instantaneous MILD reaction rate fields, both thin and distributed <b>reaction</b> <b>zones</b> are observed. Thin <b>reaction</b> <b>zones</b> having flamelet like characteristics propagate until colliding with other thin <b>reaction</b> <b>zones</b> to produce distributed <b>reaction</b> <b>zones.</b> Also, the effect of such interacting <b>reaction</b> <b>zones</b> on scalar gradient has {{to be taken into account}} in flamelet approaches. Morphological features of MILD <b>reaction</b> <b>zones</b> are investigated by employing Minkowski functionals and shapefinders. Although a few local <b>reaction</b> <b>zones</b> are classified as thin shape, the majority of local <b>reaction</b> <b>zones</b> have pancake or tube-like shapes. The representative scales computed by the shapefinders also show a typical volume where intense reactions appear. Given high temperature and existence of radicals in the diluted reactants, both reaction dominated and flame-propagation dominated regions are locally observed. These two phenomena are closely entangled under a high dilution condition. The favourable conditions for these phenomena are investigated by focusing on scalar fluxes and reaction rate. A conditional Probability Density Function (PDF) is proposed to investigate flamelet/non-flamelet characteristics of MILD combustion. The PDF can be obtained by both numerically and experimentally. The PDF shows that MILD combustion still has the direct relationship between reaction rate and scalar gradient, although the tendency is statistically weak due to the distributed nature of MILD <b>reaction</b> <b>zones.</b> Finally, based on the physical aspects of MILD combustion explained in this work, a representative model reactor for MILD combustion is developed. The model reactor is also used in conjunction with the presumed PDF for a mean and filtered reaction rate closure. The results show a good agreement between the modelled reaction rate and the DNS results...|$|R

2500|$|An {{essential}} {{feature for}} the formation of laterite is the repetition of wet and dry seasons. Rocks are leached by percolating rain water during the wet season; the resulting solution containing the leached ions is brought to the surface by capillary action during the dry season. These ions form soluble salt compounds which dry on the surface; these salts are washed away during the next wet season. Laterite formation is favoured in low topographical reliefs of gentle crests and plateaus which prevents erosion of the surface cover. The <b>reaction</b> <b>zone</b> where rocks are in contact with water—from the lowest to highest water table levels—is progressively depleted of the easily leached ions of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. A solution of these ions can have the correct pH to preferentially dissolve silicon oxide rather than the aluminium oxides and iron oxides.|$|E
