50|$|The Vortex Flash Hider {{made for}} AR-15 type rifles weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 {{inches in length}} and {{does not require a}} <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> for {{attachment}} to the barrel of an AR-15. The use of a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> or crush washer was rejected as their use can increase visible flash from the shooter's perspective. The Vortex is tightened by hand and repeated firing of the rifle causes the Vortex to tighten to the barrel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>washers,</b> locknuts, jam nuts, {{and safety}} wire {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with thread-locking fluid to prevent loosening of bolted joints.|$|R
50|$|In {{applications}} where vibration or rotation {{may work}} a nut loose, various locking mechanisms may be employed: <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> jam nuts, specialist adhesive thread-locking fluid such as Loctite, safety pins (split pins) or lockwire {{in conjunction with}} castellated nuts, nylon inserts (nyloc nut), or slightly oval-shaped threads.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "jam nut" [...] {{can also}} refer to any nut {{that is used}} in the same {{function}} (even a standard nut used for the jamming purpose). Jam nuts, other types of locknuts, <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> and thread-locking fluid are ways to prevent vibration from loosening a bolted joint.|$|R
50|$|Design {{engineers}} {{apply the}} Junker Test {{to determine the}} point at which fastener securing elements - such as lock nuts, wedges and <b>lock</b> <b>washers</b> - fail when subjected to vibration. The data collected by the test enables design engineers to specify fasteners that will perform under a wide range of conditions without loosening.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on safety wire at all, such as <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> locknuts, jam nuts, thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|R
50|$|National Lockwasher owned U.S. Patent 1,655,018, which covered split-ring, compression-spring <b>lock</b> <b>washers</b> with a {{construction}} {{preventing them from}} interlinking with one another when handled in bulk. The washer accomplishes this by making the helical ring-shaped washer extend more than 360 degrees in circumference, cutting {{the ends of the}} washer so that the end faces make an angle with the top and bottom faces of the washer, and making the spaces between the ends of the washer smaller than the thickness of the washer stock but large enough to allow compression to flatten the washer. (If the space is smaller than the thickness (cross-section height) of the washer stock, one washer cannot pass through the end space of another washer and entangle it.) A <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> is used to prevent a screw, bolt, or nut from loosening under vibration. It operates as a spring under compression having sufficient elasticity to neutralize the play between the assembled parts that vibration causes.|$|R
2500|$|The Vortex Flash Hider is a flash {{suppressor}} made by Smith Enterprise {{and has been}} called the [...] "most effective flash hider available short of a (sound) suppressor" [...] by writer and gunsmith Patrick Sweeney, when used on an AR-15. The Vortex made for AR-15 type rifles weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 inches in length and does not require a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> for attachment to the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The {{fastener}} {{serves the}} functions of both a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> and a nut. As the fastener is tightened in the nut the prongs are drawn inward until they exert pressure on {{the root of the}} thread on the fastener. When the fastener is tightened, the base of the nut, which is arched, elastically deforms and applies a force to the fastener, which locks it from loosening under vibrations.|$|R

25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|R
50|$|A {{built-in}} O-lock {{is a type}} of bicycle lock {{that prevents}} ride-off theft, establishes ownership, secures the back wheel to the frame (which can be separately locked), and provides a lock and slot for a cable. An O-lock is also called a <b>ring</b> <b>lock</b> or wheel lock.|$|R
40|$|A {{dexterous}} robot manipulator {{must be able}} to {{feel what}} it is doing. The mechanical hand of the future will be able to roll a screw between its fingers and sense, by touch, which end is which. This paper describes a step toward such a manipulator, an imaging tactile sensor with hundreds of pressure sensors in a space the size of a fingertip. The sensor was designed as part of a tendon-actuated mechan-ical finger, similar in size and range of motion to a human index finger (Hillis 1981). As a demonstration, the device was programmed to distinguish among several commonly used fastening devices&mdash;nuts, bolts, flat <b>washers,</b> <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> dowel pins, cotter pins, and set screws&mdash;by touching them with the finger and analyzing the tactile image...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|R
5000|$|The third variant, {{made from}} 1976 {{to the end}} of {{production}} of breech ring FD lenses (around 1980) changed the green [...] "o" [...] to a green [...] "A" [...] and the chrome aperture <b>ring</b> <b>lock</b> button was changed from chrome to black. The breech <b>ring</b> was still <b>locked</b> unless mounted and it still had the spring loaded twist {{to make it easier to}} mount the lens. The third version FD 50mm F1.8 lens also received a plastic front barrel to reduce size and weight. This corresponded with the introduction of the Canon A-series cameras which were smaller and lighter than the older, larger and heavier [...] "F-series" [...] bodies.|$|R
50|$|Set screws {{appear with}} a variety of tip (point) types. The {{different}} shaped tips have different properties that engineers can utilize. If an engineer were to use a detent to ensure proper nesting of the screw, they might choose to use a cone point type of screw. One might often need to use a flat point when the screw must press perfectly flat against a surface. The most common type is the cup point. This type works well because the surface is rounded so that a small surface area is in contact, but it does not have extremely high stress at one point like that of a cone point. Durability studies show that the cup point offers superior resistance to wear while maintaining a strong grip. Knurled cup points offer the added advantage of a locking action (similar to that of a serrated <b>lock</b> <b>washer)</b> that prevents the screws from working loose in high-vibration applications.|$|R

During {{the most recent}} recertification cycle, questions were raised concerning the ability of drum type containers with <b>locking</b> <b>rings</b> to survive the hypothetical accident sequence when the puncture test was oriented to specifically attack the <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> A series of tests has been performed that conclusively demonstrates that the specially designed <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> on the H 1616 performs adequately in this environment...|$|R
50|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{consists of}} a housing, in which a <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> is permanently fixed, and a Picatinny rail as an interface to the rifle scope. Integrated in this scope mount rail is the rear part of the emergency iron sight, designed as factory zeroed flip-up sight. Into the above-mentioned <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> the bolt <b>locks</b> by rotation; thus, the receiver with <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> bolt and barrel form the breech of the rifle. The APR rifle has a traditional manually operated rotary bolt with three radial locking lugs at the front. The bolt requires only a 60° bolt rotation; both features should be appreciated by the shooter during multiple firings that require rapid projectile placement on the target.|$|R
40|$|The enolase from Streptococcus pyogenes (Str enolase F 137 L/E 363 G) is a homo-octamer {{shaped like}} a donut. Plasminogen (Pgn) is a monomeric protein {{composed}} of seven discrete separated domains organized into a <b>lock</b> <b>washer.</b> The enolase is known to bind Pgn. In past work we searched for conditions {{in which the two}} proteins would bind to one another. The two native proteins in solution would not bind under any of the tried conditions. We found that if the structures were perturbed binding would occur. We stated that only the non-native Str enolase or Pgn would interact such that we could detect binding. We report here the results of a series of dual polarization interferometry (DPI) experiments coupled with atomic force microscopy (AFM), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and fluorescence. We show that the critical condition for forming stable complexes of the two native proteins involves Str enolase binding to a surface. Surfaces that attract Str enolase are a sufficient condition for binding Pgn. Under certain conditions, Pgn adsorbed to a surface will bind Str enolase...|$|R
