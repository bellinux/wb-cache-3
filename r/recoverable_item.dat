40|$|Inventory {{optimization}} of high-value {{spare parts}} may generate {{a significant reduction}} of cost to allow a better allocation of resources in maintenance management. Sherbrooke’s METRIC (Multi Echelon Technique for <b>Recoverable</b> <b>Item</b> Control) {{is the most common}} method to define an overall optimization process adopting a system-approach. Its main assumption consists of adopting a Poisson distribution to describe the demand pattern of the items. However, many studies proved that in high-availability systems, high-cost spare parts often follow irregular demand patterns, with very frequent zero-demand values. For this purpose, we propose an innovative model for a single site, the ZIP-METRIC, {{to take advantage of a}} distribution yet widely adopted in the healthcare and biological sciences, i. e. the Zero-Inflated Poisson. A case study of 1745 items of a European airline fleet demonstrates the model effectiveness, confirming that the ZIP-METRIC outperforms the traditional Poisson-based approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{supply of}} spare parts has {{a crucial role}} in {{maintenance}} activities, especially in industries with strict availability requirements. In the context of spare parts management, several strategies consist of taking advantage of cooperative or commercial agreements, moving from stand-alone scenarios to inventory pooling. The Performance Based Contracts (PBCs) represent valuable management strategies, based on the risk-pooling concept. This paper proposes an innovative analytic approach based on METRIC (Multi-Echelon Technique for <b>Recoverable</b> <b>Item</b> Control) to model a specific PBC. The paper explores the contracts according to the Supplier’s perspective in order to understand and quantify the effects of PBC on traditional inventory management. The model aims at defining technical contractual details that maximize the profit for the Supplier, respecting availability constraint and budget constraint of the Customers. A case study in the aviation domain, solved by a genetic algorithm, shows the outcomes of the model in a multi-echelon, multi-item, single-indenture system...|$|E
40|$|We review multi-echelon {{inventory}} {{models for}} repairable items. Such {{models have been}} widely applied to the management of critical spare parts for military equipment for around three decades, but the application to manufacturing and service industries seems to be much less documented. We feel that the appropriate use of models {{in the management of}} spare parts for heavily utilized equipment in industry can result in significant cost savings, in particular in those settings where repair facilities are resource constrained. In our review, we provide a strategic framework for making these decisions, place the modeling problem in the broader context of inventory control, and review the prominent models in the literature under a unified setting, highlighting some key relationships. We concentrate on describing those models which we feel are most applicable for practical application, revisiting in detail the Multi-Echelon Technique for <b>Recoverable</b> <b>Item</b> Control (METRIC) model and its variations, and then discussing a variety of more general queueing models. We then discuss the components which we feel must be addressed in the models in order to apply them practically to industrial settings...|$|E

40|$|Muckstadt, and Carol Shilepsky have {{conducted}} {{research on the}} inter-changeability/substitutability problem for <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> (items that are subject to repair when they fail). This problem arises when,e <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> can be substituted for one another during the repair of an assembly. The long range objective of the research project {{is to develop a}} method that the Air Force can use to assist in the management of 0 interchangeable <b>recoverable</b> <b>items.</b> To accomplish this goal we have proposed to analyze several simplified problems that will give us-insight into the form of the optimal or near-optimal policy for the U oj real problem. Specifically, we proposed: CJ (a) to understand fully the behavior of a single-echelon, two-item system over an infinite horizon when the failure processes for the items are independent, stationary Poisson processes and the repair times are exponential; Cb) to develop methods for finding optimal and near-optimal policies for the situation described in (a) ...|$|R
30|$|In our {{recommended}} study, we codify rework {{models for}} serviceable deteriorated items. In our lot sizing model for deteriorated items with rework, both serviceable and <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> are deteriorating with time. The rework production system {{is shown in}} Fig. 1. In this system, items are inspected after production. Good quality items are stocked and sold to customers immediately. Defective items are scheduled for rework. We assume that all <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> after rework are recognized “as new ”. Rework process is not done immediately after the production process, but it waits until a determined number of production setups is completed.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{returned}} item inventory management in a closed-loop supply chain system {{has become an}} important issue in recent years. So far, investigations about inventory decision making in a closed-loop supply chain system have been confined to traditional forward and reverse oriented material flow supply chain. In this study, we propose an integrated inventory model consisting a supplier, a manufacturer, and a retailer where the manufacturer inspects all of the returned items collected from the customers and classifies them as recoverable or waste. Returned items that recovered through the remanufacturing process and the newly manufactured products are then used {{to meet the demand}} of the retailer. However, some recovered items which are not comparable to the ones in quality, classified as refurbished items, are sold to a secondary market at a reduced price. This study also suggests that the flow of returned items is controlled by a decision variable, namely an acceptance quality level of <b>recoverable</b> <b>item</b> in the system. We apply multiple remanufacturing cycle and multiple production cycle policy to the proposed model and give the corresponding iterative procedure to determine the optimal solutions. Further, numerical examples are presented for illustrative purpose...|$|E
40|$|Optimal (s, S) {{replenishment}} {{policies are}} determined for inventories of <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> {{in which an}} item occasionally is lost or must be discarded. Two types of <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> are considered: rental items and repairable spares. The objective is to minimize total expected order, holding, repair and shortage costs per unit of time. A discrete time Markov chain yields steady-state probabilities {{for the number of}} items in the system. Total cost functions are developed for two types of resupply time: immediate and deterministic.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a Two-echelon logistics model for <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> with lateral supply {{in a single}} period in the Army. It derives formulas for distribution and inventory costs, and determines the optimal stock level at a depot and at a base to minimize the backorders. During the period, a Poisson demand and distinct units of operating bases which stocks can be shared are assumed. It allows the lateral supply between operating bases. A two-phase method is used to get solutions to the stock level constrained optimization problem. The outcome of this paper {{can be applied to}} lower level of logistics units (e. g. Division, Regiment) rather than higher level of logistics units of the Army (e. g. Corps, Theater) which distribute <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> periodically and repair the defective items transited from subordinate units.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a product {{recovery}} system for one product is investigated. The system contains one inventory for returned and <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> {{and one for}} serviceable items. Demands are satisfied from serviceable inventory where backlogging of demands is allowed. In addition, {{there is the possibility}} of disposal for the returned products. We assume deterministic but dynamic return and demand rates and a linear cost structure.

40|$|We study {{inventory}} {{systems with}} product recovery. Recovered items are as-good-as-new and satisfy the same demands as new items. The demand rate and return fraction are deterministic. The relevant costs are those for ordering recovery lots, for ordering production lots, for holding <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> in stock, and for holding new/recovered items in stock. We derive simple formulae that determine the optimal lot-sizes for the production/procurement of new items {{and for the}} recovery of returned items. These formulae are valid for finite and infinite production rates as well as finite and infinite recovery rates, and therefore more general {{than those in the}} literature. Moreover, the method of derivation is easy and insightful...|$|R
40|$|A {{model to}} deal with the {{disassembly}} processes in remanufacturing systems is presented with focus being on evaluating their economic consequences. More specifically, the model assists decisions such as to which degree {{and for the sake of}} which components should the returned items be disassembled. Consequently, using the economic values of <b>recoverable</b> <b>items,</b> the inventory holding costs of these items are obtained. This information is further used to determine the inventory control policy. To access such economic values, the above average cost approach is compared with the net present value method. The latter is often considered a more 'correct' way in remanufacturing systems from the viewpoint of inventory control. The results from the economic evaluation model are intended to aid companies in systematically evaluating current as well as projected remanufacturing systems...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{acquisition}} and inventory control can often {{make the difference}} between successful and unsuccessful remanufacturing. However, there is a greater degree of uncertainty and complexity in a remanufacturing system, which leads to a critical need for planning and control models designed to deal with this added uncertainty and complexity. In this paper, a method for optimal {{acquisition and}} inventory control of a remanufacturing system is presented. The method considers three inventories, one for returned item and the other for serviceable and <b>recoverable</b> <b>items.</b> Taking the holding cost for returns, recoverable and remanufactured products, remanufacturing cost, disposal cost, and the loss caused by backlog into account, the optimal inventory control model is established to minimize the total costs. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed methods...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{recovery}} {{system for a}} single product is investigated. Besides a remanufacturing and a manufacturing facility the system consists of one inventory for returned and <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> and one for serviceable items. Demands are satisfied from serviceable inventory, which can be replenished by remanufactured returned items, which {{are as good as}} new, or by new produced items. Additionally, there is the possibility of disposing of returned items. We determine the cost optimal manufacturing, remanufacturing and disposal rates for the system under the assumptions of a linear cost structure, a finite planning horizon and deterministic and dynamic demand and return rates. Thereby we study two classes of policies, one where backorders are forbidden and another one where they are allowed. In contrast to the existing literature positive leadtimes are considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a mathematical model, called MOD-METRIC, for the control of a multi-item, multi-echelon, multi-indenture inventory-system for <b>recoverable</b> <b>items,</b> that is, items subject to repair when they fail. Discussion is limited to two-echelon multi-item systems in which an item may be demanded at any one of several locations called bases; in turn, these bases receive inventory from a central location called a depot. The objectives of the model are to describe the logistics relationship between an assembly and its subassemblies, and to compute spare stock levels for both echelons for the assembly and subassemblies with explicit consideration of this logistics relationship. In particular, the model is used to determine the base and depot spare stock levels which minimize total expected base backorders for the assembly subject to a system investment constraint. An example is given showing how the model can be used to calculate spare engine and engine module stock levels. MOD-METRIC has been implemented by the Air Force as the method for computing recoverable spare stock levels for the F- 15 weapon system. ...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{expensive}} and sporadic demand nature of aircraft spare parts, the stock level of spare parts {{was difficult to}} confirm. How to maximize {{the availability of the}} aircraft fleet with cost constraint for spare parts was an important issue for airlines. A multi-ECHELON inventory model based on METRIC (Multi-ECHELON technology for <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> control) was proposed by allocating spare parts among the bases of airlines in this study. The model based on system approach instead of item approach to determine aircraft spare parts stock level in a multi-ECHELON system. First, the key system measure was selected, then, the Negative binomial distribution was employed to more accurately reflect the variance in part failure processes when the value of variance-to-mean ratio was bigger than one, Next, the marginal analysis method was applied to find the optimal position of spare parts among bases and depot, finally, two examples were given and the first one showed that the negative binomial distribution was more reasonable than Poisson distribution to describe the non-stationary demand process. The second one showed that the models in this paper were engineering applicability for airlines and could provide an effective theoretical and technical support...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis describes a simple-to-use, multi-echelon, single-item, simulation model written in SLAM II. The model simulates {{the operation of}} <b>Recoverable</b> <b>Items</b> (RIs) at one or more bases and the flow of supporting RIs through a multi-echelon maintenance system. The model can be configured by the user to simulate a system consisting of one to three maintenance echelons with one to six bases. Lateral resupply is also an option. The model uses an (s- 1,s) inventory policy. The model calculates several performance measures including operational availability, mean supply response time, and time-weighted backorders. The operating time for each RI is a exponential random variable. The mean failure rate is input by the user and may be different for each base. Each maintenance echelon has a single queue where failed RIs wait for an available maintenance stationserver. Each echelon can have any number of servers {{as determined by the}} user. The default distribution for repair time is the lognormal but other distributions can be used. The shipping times between all bases and echelons are also determined by the user.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a computer simulation model for determining effective spares stock levels for <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> at Air Force bases and depots. The simulation model {{is based on}} the following fundamental inventory theory; whenever a demand arises, it is satisfied from stock on hand, and the quantity equal to that demand is recorded immediately; when a demand exceeds stock on hand, the excess demand is backordered immediately and when item life expires procurement action is initiated at depot level. The resulting product of the model cam be used as a guide for the optimum distribution of available spares or as a computation of the necessary spares which will meet a desired percent fill rate. Outputs from the simulation model will also enable evaluation of the spares level effects as a result of change in other logistic parameters. The purpose of this thesis is two-fold {{to the extent that it}} presents: (a) A computer simulation model of an Air Force logistic system; and (b) A discussion of compound Monte-Carlo demand generation involving various analytic failure distributions.

40|$|In the {{management}} of spare parts for durables OEMs often face {{a sharp decline in}} sales of spare parts when the warranty period of their products ends. One reason for this effect is given by the high profitability of the after sales market which attracts competitors. If the competitors’ main sourcing option consists of repairing used or broken parts, an acquisition of those parts by the OEM might lower competition and increase sales. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a case-based framework to offer insights on the opportunity of recovering parts. We consider a two-stage supply chain, where independent repair shops are responsible for handling the repair process. There are two options to meet spare parts demand: repair shops may replace the part with a new one (ordered from the OEM) or they may use a part that they repaired before. While repair shops achieve a larger profit by repairing parts, the OEM would prefer the use of new parts. However, he has no control on demand which might be obtained through buyback of broken parts. Furthermore, the OEM could recover these parts on a higher level, thus reducing production/procurement of new parts. The main contribution of this paper is to elaborate the important effects of <b>recoverable</b> <b>items</b> acquisition on spare parts demand by using a simple deterministic framework thus outlining the impact of different parameters on the profitability of spare parts management.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{scheduling}} {{the production of}} new and <b>recoverable</b> defective <b>items</b> of the same product manufactured on the same facility is studied. Items are processed in batches. Each batch comprises two sub-batches processed consecutively. In the first sub-batch, all the items are newly manufactured. Some of them are of the required good quality and some are defective. The defective items are remanufactured in the second sub-batch. They deteriorate while waiting for rework. This results in increased time and cost for their remanufacturing. All {{the items in the}} same sub-batch complete at the same time, which is the completion time of the last item in the sub-batch. Each remanufactured defective item is of the required good quality. It is assumed that the percentage of defective items in each batch is the same. A setup time is required to start batch processing and to switch from manufacturing to remanufacturing. The demands for good quality items over time are given. The objective is to find batch sizes such that the total setup and inventory holding cost is minimized and all the demands are satisfied. Dynamic programming algorithms are presented for the general problem and some important special cases. ...|$|R
