Nineteen R engines were assembled in a limited production run between 1929 and 1931.

Intensive factory testing revealed mechanical failures which were <b>remedied</b> by redesigning the components, greatly improving reliability.|$|E
40|$|Most {{spheres of}} life are now {{regulated}} by statute. Many such statutes give courts both specific and wide-ranging general remedial powers in contexts where, potentially, general law, mainly equitable, <b>remedies</b> also apply.

A number of possibilities may arise. Statutory <b>remedies</b> may abrogate general law <b>remedies</b> entirely or in part, or may be alternative to general law <b>remedies.</b> In many cases, {{the relationship between the}} general law and statutory <b>remedies</b> is not clear. Whichever is the case, many important questions arise: Are the statutory <b>remedies</b> broader or narrower in scope than similar equitable <b>remedies?</b> What are the practical advantages and disadvantages of the different <b>remedies?</b> Do the statutory <b>remedies</b> help our understanding of, or influence the development of, equitable <b>remedies?</b> Do equitable concepts continue {{to play a role in}} shaping the statutory <b>remedies</b> (eg, are broad injunctive powers subject to equitable limits?) Where statutes are silent as to the meaning of key concepts, are equitable or common law approaches to <b>remedy</b> more relevantly applicable? Alternatively, should those concepts be interpreted in light of the regulatory objectives being pursued by the regulator, and general law approaches be disregarded where the technical rules inherent under those approaches frustrate the achievement of the regulatory objectives? Given the predominance of statute, these are important questions that will shed light on the ongoing relevance and importance of equitable <b>remedies,</b> and on the ongoing debates about fusion, remedial discretion and taxonomy. Conversely, the uncertain operation of equitable <b>remedies</b> suggests the importance of legislation expressly spelling out the relationship of equitable <b>remedies</b> to a particular statutory <b>remedy...</b>|$|R

5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars).

While wobble or shimmy can be easily <b>remedied</b> by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|A new route was {{launched}} by Bømlo Mayor Malvin Meling, who proposed a pontoon bridge which would cross Stokksundet. He {{was inspired by}} the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a pontoon bridge between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from Wichmann Motorfabrikk who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for shipping traffic. Similar protests also came from the shipping industry, who wished to continue using Stokksundet; the protests were not <b>remedied</b> by the plans including a suspension bridge across Foldrøysundet. To illustrate their point, one shipowner let two of his ships cross in the middle of Foldrøysundet. The shipping industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and the plans were abandoned in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria.

Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be <b>remedied</b> with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens.

5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been <b>remedied</b> in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E

This was later <b>remedied</b> by the Regiment's commander, who informed the Chamber of Commerce that they were failing {{to cooperate with the}} Army, at which point they changed their business practices. Further instances of discrimination against soldiers of the Regiment were also reported in Sacramento and San Francisco, where they were mistaken for Japanese Americans.|$|E

For historian Teodoro Agoncillo, however, Luna's death did not directly contribute to the resulting fall of the Republic. In his book, Malolos: The Crisis of the Republic, Agoncillo stated that the loss of Luna showed the existence of a lack of discipline among the regular Filipino soldiers and it was a major weakness that was never <b>remedied</b> {{during the course of the}} war.
