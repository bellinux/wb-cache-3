2500|$|Other {{terms that}} have been used as AM {{synonyms}} or hypernyms have included desktop manufacturing, <b>rapid</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (as the logical production-level successor to rapid prototyping), and on-demand manufacturing (which echoes on-demand printing in the 2D sense of printing). That such application of the adjectives rapid and on-demand to the noun manufacturing was novel in the 2000s reveals the prevailing mental model of the long industrial era in which almost all production manufacturing involved long lead times for laborious tooling development. Today, the term subtractive has not replaced the term machining, instead [...] it when a term that covers any removal method is needed. [...] Agile tooling is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods, to enable quick prototyping and responses to tooling and fixture needs. Agile tooling uses a cost effective and high quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs, and it can be used in hydro-forming, stamping, injection molding and other manufacturing processes.|$|E

In addition, analysis of the dimensional accuracy of the respective Stereolithography master models and the final sintered specimens is also carried out. The intelligent manufacturing systems test part with some modifications was used in the evaluation of the dimensional accuracy.
