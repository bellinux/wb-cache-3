40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} a concurrent physical therapy activity (keeping the hand open) during delays to reinforcement in an adult man with acquired brain injuries. Once a relatively stable level of hand-open behavior was obtained, the participant was asked to choose between a small immediate reinforcer and a larger delayed reinforcer contingent on keeping the hand open at greater-than-baseline duration. Afterwards, the participant was asked to select between a larger delayed <b>reinforcer</b> <b>with</b> no hand-open requirement and the identical larger delayed <b>reinforcer</b> <b>with</b> a progressively increasing hand-open requirement. Results suggest a shift in preference to larger delayed reinforcers and an eventual preference for the hand-open requirement option...|$|R

5|$|BuroHappold {{has also}} {{completed}} {{the designs of}} a number of cardboard structures, notably the Japan Pavilion for Expo 2000 in Hanover with Shigeru Ban and Frei Otto, consisting of a gridshell of paper tubes (the structure was <b>reinforced</b> <b>with</b> steel in order to comply with fire regulations, though the tubular structure was itself structurally sufficient). The firm has worked with Shigeru Ban on a number of other projects. Another design in cardboard was the Westborough School cardboard classroom in Westcliff.|$|E

The plan for the operation specified that, if required, No. 6 Squadron, <b>reinforced</b> <b>with</b> Beauforts from No. 8 and No. 100 Squadrons, would attack the landing area before 6 am on 4 November. An additional two Beauforts could also observe for any bombardments made by the warships.

40|$|Three {{adolescents}} with {{traumatic brain injury}} performed a physical therapy task {{in the absence of}} programmed consequences or duration requirements. Next, the experimenter gave the participants the options of a smaller immediate <b>reinforcer</b> <b>with</b> no response requirement or a larger delayed <b>reinforcer</b> <b>with</b> a response requirement. Self-control training exposed participants to a procedure during which they chose between a smaller immediate reinforcer and a progressively increasing delayed reinforcer whose values varied and were determined by a die roll. The participants chose whether they or the experimenter rolled the die. All participants initially demonstrated low baseline durations of the physical therapy task, chose the smaller immediate reinforcer during the choice baseline, and changed their preference to the larger delayed reinforcer during self-control training...|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland {{was going through}} a period of turmoil and {{constant}} devastating wars, it lacked modern permanent fortifications. To make up for it, three lines of earthworks, ramparts and palisades were constructed {{on both sides of the}} Vistula. The earthworks, usually several metres high and constructed mostly of sand and clay, were <b>reinforced</b> <b>with</b> gabions and surrounded by a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, the Port Said Sector was <b>reinforced</b> <b>with</b> the 103rd Sa'iqa {{battalion}} of the 139th Sa'iqa Group. The battalion had arrived from Cairo, {{and three days}} later the sector received ten new fiberglass boats from Alexandria. The boats however had been sent without necessary maintenance of the boats themselves or their engines. With the arrival of these reinforcements and equipment, Salah began to lay a plan of attack.|$|E

5|$|Some bivalves, {{including}} the true oysters, the jewel boxes, the jingle shells, the thorny oysters and the kitten's paws, cement themselves to stones, rock or larger dead shells. In oysters the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops {{layer upon layer}} of thin horny material <b>reinforced</b> <b>with</b> calcium carbonate. Oysters sometimes occur in dense beds in the neritic zone and, like most bivalves, are filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|The Tzotzil Maya of {{highland}} Chiapas used spears, thrown rocks, {{bows and}} arrows, and large flexible cotton shields that protected the warrior {{from head to}} foot and could be rolled up for storage. Towns were sometimes defended with walls and barricades, built from packed earth and stone, and <b>reinforced</b> <b>with</b> tree trunks. Defenders would hurl stones down from above, or pour boiling water mixed with lime and ashes upon attackers. As the Spanish became established in Chiapas, indigenous resistance took the form of flight to inaccessible regions.|$|E
40|$|The {{life-cycle}} cost can {{be regarded}} as a benchmark variable in decision making problems involving the seismic retrofit and upgrading of existing structures. A methodology is presented which takes into account both the uncertainty in the occurrence of future earthquake events and also the deterioration of the structure {{as a result of a}} series of earthquake events. In order to satisfy life safety conditions, the probability of exceeding the limit state of collapse is constrained to be smaller than an allowable threshold. The presented methodology is applied to retrofit decision-making for a set of viable upgrade options for upgrading of an existing RC building. The upgrade solutions considered include (a) <b>reinforcing</b> <b>with</b> fiber <b>reinforced</b> polymers (FRP), (b) addition of buckling restrained axial dampers (BRAD), (c) <b>reinforcing</b> <b>with</b> steel angles and steel ribbons (the CAM system), (d) applying both the FRP reinforcement and the BRAD, (e) applying both the CAM solution and the BRAD...|$|R
