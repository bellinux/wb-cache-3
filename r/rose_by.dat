5|$|Healthcare premium cost {{increases}} in the employer market continued to moderate after {{the implementation of the}} law. For example, healthcare premiums for those covered by employers <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 69% from 2000-2005, but only 27% from 2010 to 2015, with only a 3% increase from 2015 to 2016. From 2008-2010 (before passage of the ACA) health insurance premiums <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> an average of 10% per year.|$|E
5|$|Overall wages rose {{much more}} slowly {{throughout}} the period than planned: wages across the entire state (not only industrial wages) <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 22.9 percent between 1959 and 1965, against a plan for growth of 26 percent. Wage rises during the reform were made up for by increases in industrial productivity. For example, in the RSFSR (Russia) wages <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 7 percent between 1959 and 1962, whilst productivity increased by some 20 percent.|$|E
5|$|During his tenure, Chongqing {{reported}} annual GDP growth far {{exceeding the}} national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 28%, and bank loans were up 29%. Several major corporations built or greatly expanded their manufacturing operations in Chongqing, including Hewlett-Packard, Foxconn, Ford motors, and BASF.|$|E

5|$|One of Nagle's early equine {{purchases}} was 15-year-old Rose of England, {{the winner}} of the 1930 Oaks, for 3,500 guineas. The mare had already produced the 1937 St. Leger winner, Chulmleigh, and the 1939 top winning two-year-old, British Empire. In Nagle's ownership she foaled Westerlands <b>Rose,</b> <b>by</b> the stallion Colombo who produced several winners. These included Westerlands Chalice, by Chamossaire, who won three races in 1957; and Game <b>Rose,</b> <b>by</b> Big Game, another winner during the 1950s. Other winning progeny from Westerlands Rose were Westerlands Champagne, Westerlands Prince and Westerlands Rosebud. These five horses accounted for ten race wins between them.|$|E
5|$|Advance voting {{took place}} in 901 polling {{stations}} in the country. Expatriate voting took place between 6 and 9 April at 241 polling stations at embassies and consulates. One national electronic voter list was used for early voting; though for the 17 April poll, voters could only vote at their designated local polling station. The expatriate voter turnout in 91 countries <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 2.2% to a record-high 10.7%, with 35,000 people casting their votes. In addition, 400 Finns voted on ships at sea.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{took office}} {{during a period}} of {{economic}} recession {{in the wake of the}} bursting of the dot-com bubble. The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. His administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14percent, corporate tax revenues by 50percent, customs and duties by 40percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62percent, Medicare spending by 131percent, social security by 51percent, and income security spending by 130percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 35percent and spending by 65percent.|$|E
5|$|By 2017, nearly 70% {{of those}} on the exchanges could {{purchase}} insurance for less than $75/month after subsidies, which rose to offset significant pre-subsidy price increases in the exchange markets. Healthcare premium cost increases in the employer market continued to moderate. For example, healthcare premiums for those covered by employers <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 69% from 2000-2005, but only 27% from 2010 to 2015, with only a 3% increase from 2015 to 2016.|$|E
5|$|From 2006 to 2012, under chief Tim Dolan, {{the crime}} rate {{steadily}} dropped, and the police benefited from new video and gunfire locator resources, although Dolan was criticized for expensive city settlements for police misconduct. While violent crime dropped (from 6,374 in 2006 to 3,720 in 2011), homicides <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 105% and rape was at the highest rate among large cities. U.S. News & World Report said in 2011 that Minneapolis tied with Cleveland, Ohio as the 10th most dangerous city in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} cabinet decision, Modi {{set up a}} team to {{investigate}} black money. On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament. In the days following the demonetisation, banks across the country faced severe cash shortages, which had detrimental effects {{on a number of}} small businesses, on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. Following Modi's announcement, the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply. There has been a steep increase in digital payments and transactions in the country since the day demonetization was announced. Post the demonetisation, the quantum of income tax returns filed for individuals jumped by 25% indicating the widened tax net. Further, the advance tax collections <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 42% and Self assessment tax collections <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 34.25%.|$|E
5|$|In the end {{the reform}} proved unsuccessful. The {{government}} only managed to withdraw 14 billion rubles from circulation of the country's money supply against an intended target of 81.5 billion rubles. As a result, the Pavlov reform did not {{put an end to}} inflation. Prices for items including food and transport <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 100–300 percent, while the Soviet standard of living decreased sharply and the state budget deficit increased by an estimated 2030 percent of GNP. In the aftermath of the reform, inflation exceeded the 50 percent mark every month.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} weekend of sales of the iPad Mini and {{fourth-generation}} iPad, Apple reported that it sold an aggregated number of 3 million units. TechRadar noted that {{the first weekend}} sales figures for the fourth-generation iPad are lower than corresponding figures for the third-generation iPad, which sold 3 million units in its first weekend. Subsequent reports and analysis such as that from David Hsieh, a technology analyst, suggest that the iPad mini is selling better than the fourth-generation iPad. Despite the noted slump in sales, Apple's stock price, in direct response to the figures released, <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 1.4% to $584.62 on November 5.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, {{and more than a}} million {{families}} bought their council houses, giving an increase from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in owner occupiers from 1979 to 1990. The houses were sold at a discount of 33–55 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales, rather than maximise national income.|$|E
5|$|The {{quotation}} {{price of}} Olympus shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on 15 November had fallen by some 75percent since the scandal erupted. The price {{continued to be}} volatile: trading was halted as its price hit the upper limit for price falls. On 14 and 15 November, after the threat of delisting ebbed, trading in its shares was once again halted when buy orders heavily outnumbered sell orders; the price <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> the upper limit of ¥100. Trading only took place after hours as there was a glut of unsatisfied buy orders. The share price rose in four straight trading sessions, reaching 834yen at one point on 16 November.|$|E

In an interview, Oyamada said that sales of the title had increased with the release of more powerful mobile devices. By May 2015, the smartphone versions had over two million registered players. The Vita version was similarly successful: within two months of release, it had been downloaded 100,000 times. That figure <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> an additional 50,000 over the following month.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} Metro has had {{a significantly}} lower crime rate than any comparable transit system in the United States, crime on Metro {{as a whole was}} rising in the late 2000s. Crime on the transit system began spiking in 2008 and 2009. Robbery <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> 30 percent to 581 incidents in 2008, and in the first four months of 2009 rose another 28.3 percent to 240 robberies. Crime on the Green Line continued to be high: Gallery Place–Chinatown had the most robberies of any station throughout the Metro system, followed by Anacostia (25 percent fewer than Gallery Place) and L'Enfant Plaza (20 percent fewer than Anacostia). Crime by juveniles (generally robbery, or assault) also continued to be a serious issue for Metro, with more than 260 juvenile arrests {{in the first nine months}} of 2009, and Metro Transit Police continued to engage in large numbers of high-visibility patrols. Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue continued to be trouble spots, and Metro added Metro Center to the list in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment <b>rose</b> <b>by</b> over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E
