40|$|In India, High Background <b>Radiation</b> <b>Areas</b> (HBRAs) due to {{enhanced}} {{levels of}} {{naturally occurring radionuclides}} in soil (thorium and, to a lesser extent, uranium), are located along {{some parts of the}} coastal tracts viz, the coastal belt of Kerala, Tamilnadu and Odisha. It is conjectured that these deposits will result in higher emissions of radon isotopes (Rn- 222 and Rn- 220) and their daughter products as compared to Normal Background <b>Radiation</b> <b>Areas</b> (NBRAs). While the annual external dose rates contributed by gamma <b>radiations</b> in these <b>areas</b> are about 5 - 10 times higher, the extent of increase in the inhalation dose rates attributable to Rn- 222 and Rn- 220 and their decay products is not well quantified. Towards this, systematic indoor surveys were conducted wherein simultaneous measurements of time integrated Rn- 222 and Rn- 220 gas and their decay product concentrations was carried out in around 800 houses in the HBRAs of Kerala and Odisha to estimate the inhalation doses. All gas measurements were carried out using pin-hole cup dosimeters while the progeny measurements were with samplers and systems based on the Direct radon/thoron Progeny sensors (DRPS/DTPS). To corroborate these passive measurements of decay products concentrations, active sampling was also carried out in a few houses. The results of the surveys provide a strong evidence to conclude that the inhalation doses due to Rn- 222 and Rn- 220 gas and their decay products in these HBRAs are in the same range as observed in the NBRAs in India.

Our results revealed a dose dependent {{increase in the number}} of differentially expressed genes with respect to different background dose levels. Gene ontology analysis revealed majority of these differentially expressed genes are involved in DNA damage response (DDR) signaling, DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, histone/chromatin modification and immune response. In the present study, 64 background dose responsive genes have been identified as possible chronic low dose radiation signatures. Validation of 30 differentially expressed genes was carried out using fluorescent based universal probe library. Abundance of DDR and DNA repair genes along with pathways such as MAPK, p 53 and JNK in higher background dose groups (> 5. 0 mGy/year) indicated a possible threshold dose for DDR signaling and are plausible reason of observing in vivo radio-adaptive response and non-carcinogenesis in HLNRA population.
