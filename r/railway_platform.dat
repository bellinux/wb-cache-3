5|$|The hotel {{had its own}} <b>railway</b> <b>platform,</b> Track 61, {{that was}} part of the New York City Subway and was {{connected}} to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform. However, it is rarely opened to the public.|$|E
25|$|With the {{commissioning}} of the Berlin Stadtbahn in 1882, platform A {{was built}} between the connecting curves, this went into operation on 7 February. The station was called Stralau-Rummelsburg. Two other platforms, B and C, were opened in 1896 {{on the outer}} sides of the two connecting curves. In 1900 and 1901, the station complex was rebuilt and then extended. The trains of the Ringbahn have stopped at Stralau-Rummelsburg since 1 May 1903, when platform F was added. In the same year platforms were developed on the suburban lines to and from Lichtenberg (Eastern <b>Railway,</b> <b>platform</b> D, opened on 1 October), and to and from Erkner (Silesian <b>Railway,</b> <b>platform</b> E, opened on 18 April).|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, {{the newly}} {{constructed}} platform Rn1 {{was put into}} operation. It is being used by S-Bahn services {{for the next three}} years during the construction. Later it will serve as a regional platform for services on the Eastern <b>Railway.</b> <b>Platform</b> D, which was taken out of service at the same time, is being rebuilt.|$|E

25|$|The B-class trams {{were first}} {{introduced}} to Melbourne in 1984 {{with the first}} prototype B1-class trams, the second being built in 1985. As of 2016, one is currently in regular service. The B-class trams used the same traction equipment as the Z3 and A-class trams, and were built for the light rail lines. They were originally built with movable steps to allow <b>railway</b> <b>platform</b> and street level boarding, but this concept was later abandoned, with low-floor platform built at the converted light rail stations.|$|E

25|$|Chikatilo did {{not kill}} again until June 1983, when he murdered a 15-year-old Armenian girl named Laura Sarkisyan; {{her body was found}} close to an unmarked <b>railway</b> <b>platform</b> near Shakhty. By September, he had killed a further five victims. The {{accumulation}} of bodies found and the similarities between the pattern of wounds inflicted on the victims forced the Soviet authorities to acknowledge that a serial killer was on the loose. On 6 September 1983 the public prosecutor of the USSR formally linked six of the murders thus far committed to the same killer.|$|E
25|$|The {{railway service}} is {{undergoing}} major upgrading {{with the advent}} of electrified trains running on double tracks from Kuala Lumpur to Ipoh. Ipoh Railway Station is an imposing structure in the city centre. Built in the Moorish style, this white structure, nicknamed the Taj Mahal of Ipoh, was completed in 1935 to replace the original <b>railway</b> <b>platform</b> shed built in 1917. The Ipoh railway station {{is said to be the}} second most beautiful railway station in Malaysia after the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. It is located on Jalan Panglima Bukit Gantang Wahab.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his release}} from prison in December 1984, Chikatilo found new work at a {{locomotive}} factory in Novocherkassk and kept a low profile. He did not kill again until 1 August 1985 when, {{on a business trip}} to Moscow, he encountered an 18-year-old woman, named Natalia Pokhlistova, at a <b>railway</b> <b>platform</b> near Domodedovo Airport. Pokhlistova was lured into a thicket of woods where she was bound, stabbed 38 times, then strangled to death. Based upon the hypothesis that the killer had travelled from the Rostov Oblast to Moscow via air, investigators checked all Aeroflot flight records of passengers who had commuted between Moscow and the Rostov Oblast between late July and early August. On this occasion, however, Chikatilo had travelled to Moscow by train and, accordingly, no documentation existed for investigators to research. Four weeks later, on 27 August, Chikatilo killed another young woman, Irina Gulyaeva, in Shakhty. As had been the case with Natalia Pokhlistova, the wounds inflicted upon the victim linked her murder to the hunt for the serial killer.|$|E
