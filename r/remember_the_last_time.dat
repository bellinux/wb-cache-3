500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine {{called the}} episode a potential classic and a [...] "phenomenal follow up showing" [...] {{to the season}} premiere [...] "Sexual Healing", {{which he did not}} enjoy. Delgado said the script was intelligent and praised the theme of over-analyzing art. He also praised the vomiting jokes, and said he could not <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> he laughed so hard during a South Park episode. Entertainment Weekly television columnist Ken Tucker said it was better than the season premiere, which he also praised. Tucker particularly enjoyed the satire of pop culture criticism, and wrote, [...] "I'd compare the Scrotie episode to the work of Rabelais, Henry Miller, and Dennis Cooper, but then I'd be part of the boys' satire, wouldn't I?" ...|$|E
500|$|AIDS in the United States first struck {{gay men and}} IV {{drug users}} in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco due to unsafe sexual and drug-taking practices. Shilts' sources in the gay {{community}} tried to <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> everyone they knew was healthy, which was the United States Bicentennial celebration in 1976, when sailors came {{from all over the}} world to New York. Some of them carried sexually transmitted diseases and rare tropical fevers. A marked difference in these cities arose in two phases of consciousness in the gay community: [...] "Before" [...] in 1980, and [...] "After" [...] by 1985. [...] "Before", according to Shilts, was characterized by a care-free innocence, preceding the period when gay men were aware of a deadly infectious disease. [...] "After" [...] signified the realization that gay men knew most or all of their friends were infected with AIDS, and the syndrome became pervasive throughout the media.|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network {{had four}} editors review {{the first episode}} of the anime: Carl Kimlinger saw {{potential}} in its take on a typical anime premise, praising Tatsuya as the lead protagonist and its handling of mysteries surrounding the plot; Theron Martin, although hopeful because of its male lead and plot concept, expressed criticism towards the indistinguishable animation and constant exposition for the viewers; and Rebecca Silverman {{felt that it was}} bland and nothing special. The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't even <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> I saw something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." [...] Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons.|$|E

6000|$|Now Reddy Fox is no fisherman, {{though he}} likes fish to eat well enough.

500|$|At Salon.com, Joyce Millman writes, [...] "there hasn't been a finer hour {{of drama}} on TV {{this year than}} ... 'The Body' ... You have {{to hand it to}} the writers; Joyce's demise came as a {{complete}} surprise. In that instant, Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if Buffy gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> I saw a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss." [...] Andrew Gilstrap at PopMatters declares it [...] "possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none... It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one." [...] Gilstrap went on to say the series did not again address death and grief of this magnitude until, in another shocking turn of events, Tara dies of a stray gunshot in the sixth season. Jerry McCormick in The San Diego Union-Tribune agrees, rating Joyce's death as having the same emotional impact as Tara's in [...] "Seeing Red", both of which he listed as the saddest in the series.|$|E
500|$|Stereogum {{journalist}} Tom Breihan described [...] "Rocket" [...] as [...] "a squelchy, Prince-ly old-school sex-ballad" [...] {{in which}} the singer seemingly [...] "melt into the track". He stated that despite [...] "nothing remotely innovative about it... I can't <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> I heard a ballad of this type so completely fleshed-out and fully realized". Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! noted that songs on the album, such as Rocket", effectively display genre diversity, Beyoncé's vocal range and [...] "a penchant of musical experimentation". Although describing it as a [...] "pitch-perfect rehash" [...] of [...] "Untitled" [...] and noting that it succeeded in turning Beyoncé's [...] "sex life into topography", Fact Chris Kelly felt [...] "Rocket" [...] was unnecessary on the album. Philip Cosores of Paste stated that the song was [...] "dragging on {{a minute or two}} too long". Janice Llamoca from the website HipHopDX called it suitable for a bonus track on Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience (2013). Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph criticized the song as a [...] cut meant for The 20/20 Experience. In the annual Pazz and Jop mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2013, [...] "Rocket" [...] was ranked at number 424.|$|E
500|$|USA Todays Ann Oldenburg {{described}} the video as sexy and [...] "pretty personal." [...] Kenneth Partridge of AOL commented, [...] "Packed with sex, violence and questionable acting, the new Britney Spears video, 'Criminal,' {{has all the}} trappings of a midnight movie." [...] A reporter from the American edition of The Huffington Post said: [...] "We can't honestly <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> Britney Spears looked so gorgeous in a music video" [...] and deemed it as the best video from Femme Fatale. Erin Strecker Entertainment Weekly also called it the best video of the album, and highlighted Spears' look, the ending scene and the [...] "fun story". Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said it is [...] "probably the best video of the Femme Fatale era." [...] Tom Townshend of MSN stated that although the video was not appropriate for Spears' younger fans, [...] " [...] is actually rather compelling and feels more like a short film rather than a pop starlet's music video." [...] A writer for VH1 said that part of the reason the video works is the comic sensibility between Spears and Marrs Piliero, explaining that [...] " [...] point to one of Spears's greatest talents: giving the impression that although she takes her career extremely seriously, she nevertheless doesn't take it too seriously." [...] The critic summarized the review by saying that the video is [...] "entertaining [...] a bad-girl adventure story, and her role here is essentially that of a (wait for it) femme fatale." ...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} poignant stories {{of the day was}} when Phil <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Jades played together, still so very clear in his mind today. It was Christmas break 1968 and they played a party at the Civic Center here in Sparta. <b>The</b> reason he <b>remembers</b> that night is because it was the night he said good-by to Craig Yates, a classmate who was about to leave for Viet Nam. Craig died the {{following}} May 29. He was one of too many boys from Sparta who gave their last full measure that sad summer and are missed by so many to this day.|$|R

Discussing the cotdeath storyline, which {{aired in}} 1985 in the UK, Roush said, [...] "When tragedy strikes, {{as in the case}} of Ali (Nejdet Salih) and jealous wife [...] (Sandy Ratcliff), EastEnders becomes achingly believable.

2500|$|On August 31, {{mandatory}} evacuations {{began on}} North Carolina's Ocracoke Island. [...] "I don't <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> {{there was a}} mandatory evacuation order for the island," [...] stated Commissioner Kenneth Collier of Hyde County.

On September 1, state of emergency declarations were issued by the governors of Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia.

Several school districts in Rhode Island released students from school early on September 3, as well as Bristol-Warren and Cumberland school Districts, which closed schools in anticipation of Hurricane Earl.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, the {{legislature}} passed the same legislation, the Defense of Marriage Act, and expected {{the governor to}} allow it to become law without his signature. Instead, he vetoed it a second time, saying that [...] "Our laws right now prohibit same-gender marriages, and I oppose this legislation because it is trying to make illegal something that is already illegal". Democrats who feared the impact of having the legislation on the November ballot helped override his veto. One Democratic leader in the House said: [...] "I'll vote to override. I'll stand up and say it's a bad bill, but it's even worse to have this issue on the ballot." [...] According to the Seattle Times: [...] "Lawmakers, eager to be done with the controversial issue, rushed the ban through in minutes and dumped it in the governor's lap. Locke's veto came within the hour. Then both houses voted summarily to override the veto. No one could <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> a bill was passed, vetoed and overridden within hours–with almost no discussion and no debate." ...|$|E
50|$|Set in New South Wales, Australia, it's Boxing Day 1945 in Turnaround Creek, an outback town. The dust settles as {{the town}} nurses their Christmas hangover. Harold Slocum and his family of the Slocum's Travelling Tent Show are down on their luck and become stranded. They're broke and desperate for an audience; they end up in Turnaround Creek. To the country folk, the {{prospect}} of a show is a welcome diversion, but Barry the publican at the Shamrock is strangely unwelcoming. He <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Slocums were in the district. Emotions run high and the sedentary life of the town is disturbed by the remembrance of an illicit affair. The musical represses new life breathed into the rural community, and is altogether humorous and sensitive.|$|R
5000|$|... "Summer Rain" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Robbie Seidman and Maria Vidal, {{produced}} by Rick Nowels for Belinda Carlisle's third album Runaway Horses (1989). The song is {{about a man who}} goes away to war and leaves his wife, saying that nothing will change—they will be together forever and always. Although the conflict is unidentified, images in the video of a transport aircraft on an airfield and troops parachuting from transport aircraft suggest the man is an airborne soldier. The song is set in the present as his widow sings it, <b>remembering</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> she saw him. It was released around the world in 1990 and was issued as a CD single, 7" [...] single and a 12" [...] single.|$|R

60|$|That {{was how it}} {{came about}} that Appleby and Miss Harding, who had seen {{a good deal of}} each other in the {{meanwhile}} sat out in the moonlight on a veranda of the Alcalde’s house overlooking the patio. It was filled with flowers, and in place of the Sin Verguenza’s revelry the tinkle of guitars, swish of costly dresses, light patter of feet, and decorous laughter came out from the open windows that blazed with light. Nettie Harding was also now attired as became her station, and the soft shimmer of pearls emphasized the whiteness of her neck. Still, she <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> she had entered that patio, and a faint tinge of color came into her cheek as her eyes rested for a moment on the veranda above them. As it happened, Appleby, without intending it, met her eyes a moment later, and each realized what the other’s thoughts were. The man turned his head suddenly, but he felt he could not gaze across the patio indefinitely, and when he looked round again he saw the girl had laid her fan upon her knee and was regarding him curiously.|$|R
