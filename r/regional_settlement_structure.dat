30|$|Our results give {{empirical}} support for the main transmission channels identified by the neoclassical framework, both at the aggregate level {{as well as for}} age-group specific estimates. At the aggregate level, real income differences and unemployment rate disparities are found to be statistically significant with the expected signs. The results remain stable if commuting flows, regional human capital endowments, the region's international competitiveness as well as differences in the settlement structure are added as further explanatory variables. The inclusion of the regional net in-commuting rate shows a negative correlation with interregional migration, underlying the substitutive nature of the two variables. Further, an increasing level of international competitiveness attracts additional in-migration flows. We also find heterogeneous migration patterns for different types of <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>structure</b> proxied by population density and we observe persistent structural differences for the two East–West macro regions (by including individual federal state level fixed effects or a combined East German dummy). However, {{it is important to note}} that the impact of core labor market variables is still of the expected sign when further variables are added. In line with earlier empirical studies, the results show that macro regional differences matter, yet there are no qualitative effects on the estimated coefficients that hint toward a systematic rejection of the neoclassical migration model. Looking at the estimation results according to age groups, the impact of labor market signals is tested to be of greatest magnitude for workforce relevant age-groups and especially young cohorts between the ages of   18 to   25 and   25 to   30. We finally compute measures for the relative importance of labor market variables by age groups in a multiple regression framework including a broader set of controls. Our results show that for young cohorts up to   65 % of the migratory movements can be explained by differences in regional income levels and unemployment rates. This latter result emphasizes the prominent role played by labor market conditions in determining internal migration rates of the workforce population in Germany.|$|E
30|$|Given {{that the}} degree of {{geographical}} mobility of the labor force is an important indicator of the conduct of labor market policies, this paper tests the empirical validity of the neoclassical migration model in predicting German internal migration flows. The neoclassical migration model places special emphasis on the labor market dimension of migration and basically relates migration-induced population changes to the relative income (or wage) and employment situation found in the regions of origin and destination, respectively. Thereby, regions with a higher relative income level and lower unemployment rates are expected to exhibit positive net in-migration rates. In its response to regional labor market disparities, migration itself should work as an equilibrating mechanism for balancing these labor market differences. Higher in-migration flows in a certain region are expected to reduce the regional wage level due to an increase in labor supply {{and at the same time}} increase the regional unemployment rate. Thus, from the perspective of economic policy making, the empirical implications of the neoclassical migration model are important, for instance, to assess whether labor mobility can act as an appropriate adjustment mechanism in integrated labor markets facing asymmetric shocks. Though the neoclassical migration model is widely used as a policy simulation and didactic tool, the international empirical evidence so far has provided rather mixed results. To shed more light on the German case, we estimate static and dynamic migration functions for   97 Spatial Planning Regions between 1996 and 2006 using key labor market signals, including income and unemployment differences among a broader set of explanatory variables, including human capital, regional competitiveness, <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>structure</b> and interregional commuting as alternative adjustment process for labor market disequilibria. In addition to an aggregate specification, we also estimate the model for age-group related subsamples. We estimate the migration equation by means of dynamic panel data estimation using instrumental variable techniques and place special emphasis on postestimation testing in order to control for right-hand side endogeneity and cross-sectional dependence of the error term.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{scholars}} investigating prehispanic Andean polities and sociopolitical organization {{have worked}} from cross-cultural models of complex societies underlain by concepts of political hierarchy and centralized control. Recently, however, some archaeologists, drawing from ethnohistorical and ethnographic sources, {{have argued that}} late prehispanic polities {{in various parts of}} the Andes were organized around principles very different from those that underlie traditional constructs of complex societies. This ethnohistoric evidence raises the possibility that the models of political organization often used by archaeologists are not adequate to account for the development and dynamics of all prehispanic Andean polities. Ethnohistoric sources portray the structure and dynamics of the "ethnic kingdoms" as rooted in still poorly understood indigenous principles of organization featuring nested, dual socio-territorial units (ayllus), decentralized political leadership, and confederation as the basis of hierarchy. To date, there has been very little study of what these polities would look like archeologically, or how the supposedly different principles of organization would manifest themselves in a <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>structure,</b> wealth and status differentiation, or production and exchange patterns. Ethnohistoric documentation for the existence of ayllu polities in the Cinti region, southern Bolivia, made this area a prime setting for exploration of the archaeological ramifications of traditional and ayllu-based models. Full-scale regional survey and excavation generated data on the long-term evolution of sociopolitical structure and economic processes in the Cinti Valley. The investigation was organized around identifying strategies (economic and social) associated with political leadership, and their role in politico-economic centralization and social differentiation. The research revealed the emergence, by AD 800, of a strongly integrated, regional polity, characterized by a traditional settlement hierarchy, and elite residence at a dominant center. Catchment zone analysis indicated that increasing agricultural production was most closely linked to strategies of political leadership and status differentiation. The Cinti Valley investigation served to refine our understanding of the ayllu polity both as an archaeological model, and as a form of prehispanic political organization. Highlighting the convergence and divergence between emic constructs and empirical regional patterns should contribute to a better understanding of the nature and variability of southern Bolivian prehispanic societies, and how they should be archaeologically approached...|$|E
40|$|Etruscan {{cultural}} identity and its distinct material culture grew from Late Bronze Age and Villanovan protohistoric roots during the 8 th c. B. C. in southern Etruria. Through the 7 th c. Oriental influences transformed {{the aesthetics of}} elite material culture and Etruscan literacy began to become evident throughout Etruria. In the 6 th c. B. C. Etruscan culture spread though the central parts of Italy and beyond into the Po Valley and Campania in an expansion that has been termed the ‘Archaic flowering’ of Etruscan culture. The geographical spread of this historical process {{has led to the}} almost subconscious perception of southern Etruria as an Etruscan core and other parts of Etruria and neighboring areas of Italy as an Etruscan periphery, although it is rare to find this conceptual framework theorized in Etruscan studies. A key element of this process, and a focus of Etruscan studies, is the growth of urban centers that gradually become identifiable in the archaeological record as a <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>structure</b> emerges and social complexity increases while connectivity between Etruria and the Mediterranean becomes more extensive. The development of urbanism in Etruria is significant at a European scale because the Etruscan cities, along with Rome, possibly predate Greek cities and are therefore, potentially, the earliest Mediterranean cities outside of South West Asia and Egypt, and so lie at the roots of contemporary European urban societies. This chapter will consider the extent to which models of urbanization that have been developed in the southern Etruscan ‘core’ are applicable to the history of the urbanization in the more ‘peripheral’ areas of central and northern Etruria. Within the core of southern Etruria and neighboring Rome, archaeological research has focused on understanding the Etruscan urban centers and their genesis that may {{be traced back to the}} Bronze Age. This is the earliest instance of the process urbanization in the western Mediterranean and is therefore termed ‘primary urbanization’, a convenient shorthand for a complex combination of processes and circumstances and using ‘urbanization’ to mean the overall process of urban development rather than a specific a specific relocation of rural population to urban centers. Outside the ‘core’ of southern Etruria there has been less research focusing on urban origins. However, evidence is currently emerging which suggests that not all of the urban centers follow the same trajectory of urban genesis and development as those in the south. Indeed, there appears to be a later phase of development in central and northern Etruria that has less strong Bronze Age and Villanovan roots. At the risk of simplifying a very variable picture this later phase will be termed ‘secondary urbanization’. Having outlined these two instances of urban formation this chapter will explore the relationship between them focusing on two themes colonial settlement and independent local development of urban centres...|$|E

40|$|We explore <b>settlement</b> <b>structures</b> and {{hierarchy}} {{found in}} different archaeological periods in northern, specifically the Khabur Triangle (KT), and southern Mesopotamia (SM) using a spatial interaction entropy maximization (SIEM) {{modeling and simulation}} method. <b>Regional</b> <b>settlement</b> patterns are investigated {{in order to understand}} what feedback levels for settlement benefits, or incentives, and abilities to move or disperse between sites in a landscape and period could have enabled observed <b>settlement</b> <b>structures</b> to emerge or be maintained. Archaeological and historical data are then used to interpret the best results. We suggest that in the Late Chalcolithic (LC) and first half of the Early Bronze Age (EBA), the KT and SM appear to have comparable urban patterns and development, where settlement advantage feedbacks and movement are similarly shaping the two regions for those periods. Within period variations, such as restrictions to population diffusion or movement in the EBA, are possible. In the KT during the Middle Bronze Age (MBA), multiple centers begin to emerge, suggesting a lack of social cohesion and/or political fragmentation. This is similar to SM in the MBA, but we also see the emergence of a single, dominant site. In the Iron Age (IA), movement in the KT likely becomes the least constrained in all assessed periods, as socio-political cohesion facilitates this process, with small sites now the norm and dominance by one state over the region is evident. For the same period in SM, a single site (Babylon) obtains significant settlement advantages relative to its neighbors and easy movement enables it to become far larger in size and likely socially, economically, and politically dominant. Overall, the results demonstrate that the method is useful for archaeologists and social theorists in allowing them to compare different archaeological survey results, with varied spatial dimensions and diachronically, while providing a level of explanation that addresses empirical settlement patterns observed...|$|R
