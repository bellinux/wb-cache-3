40|$|Abstract. The {{bunching}} {{system of}} the ATLAS positive ion injector (PII) has been improved by relocating the harmonic buncher to a point significantly closer to the second stage sine-wave buncher and the injector LINAC. The longitudinal optics design has also been modified and now employs a virtual waist from the harmonic buncher feeding the second stage sine-wave buncher. This geometry improves the handling of space charge for high-current beams, significantly increases the capture fraction into the primary <b>rf</b> <b>bucket</b> and reduces the capture fraction of the unwanted parasitic <b>rf</b> <b>bucket.</b> Total capture and transport through the PII has been demonstrated as high as 80 % of the injected dc beam while {{the population of the}} parasitic, unwanted <b>rf</b> <b>bucket</b> is typically less than 3 % of the total transported beam. To remove this small residual parasitic component a new traveling-wave transmission-line chopper has been developed reducing both transverse and longitudinal emittance growth from the chopping process. This work was supported by the U. S. Department of Energy under contract W- 31 - 109 -ENG- 38...|$|E
40|$|In the SIS- 100 highest {{heavy ion}} intensities {{have to be}} {{accelerated}} to deliver beam to the FAIR experiments. In the projected SIS- 100 synchrotron the heavy ion bunches will be strongly affected by the longitudinal space charge force. Due to the limited <b>RF</b> <b>bucket</b> area all mechanisms which might cause longitudinal phase space dilution must be understood and controlled. Space charge effects, like {{the reduction in the}} RF voltage and the loss of Landau damp-ing, have already been part of elaborate studies. It has been shown that cavity beam loading can deform the flattened bunch shape in the dual <b>RF</b> <b>bucket.</b> Among the different counter measures an inductive insert has been proposed in order to partially compensate the longitudinal space charge impedance. Optimized settings for {{the difference between the two}} RF phases in a dual <b>RF</b> <b>bucket</b> might be an option to reduce the effect of beam loading. In this contribution we will analyse the matched bunch distribution for SIS- 100 parameters in single and dual RF buckets.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{development}} of a new storage ring operations tool for measurement of longitudinal beam density profile. The technique mixes synchrotron light with light from a mode locked solid-state laser oscillator in a non-linear crystal and detects the up-converted radiation with a photo-multiplier. The laser is phase locked to the storage ring RF system. The laser choices available for repetition frequency, pulse length and phase modulation give a very wide range of options for matching the bunch configuration of particular storage rings. Progress in the technology of solid-state lasers ensures this system can be made robust for routine use in storage ring operations. A very large number of important applications are possible including measurement of the fraction of untrapped particles prior to acceleration, the population of particles in the nominally unfilled <b>RF</b> <b>buckets</b> in a bunch train ("ghost bunches"), longitudinal tails, the diffusion of particles into the beam abort gap and the normal bunch parameters of longitudinal shape and intensity. We are currently investigating application to two devices: (1) the 1. 9 GeV ALS electron storage ring at LBNL with 328 <b>RF</b> <b>buckets,</b> 2 ns bucket spacing, 276 nominally filled bunches, 15 - 30 ps rms bunch length and (2) the 7 TeV LHC proton collider under construction at CERN with 35, 640 <b>RF</b> <b>buckets,</b> 2. 5 ns bucket spacing, 2, 808 nominally filled bunches, 280 - 620 ps rms bunch length.
