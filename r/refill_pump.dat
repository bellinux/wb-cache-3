40|$|Due {{to future}} {{requirements}} for the HP large format printer printers, {{a change in the}} current intermediate tank is necessary. The intermediate tank is a device that allows the printer to keep working while the user is changing the supply and acts as an ink dispenser towards the printheads. Therefore, the objective of the following project has been the design and development of a series of prototypes to test the viability of implementing a new intermediate tank for such devices. On the first place, a study of the different possibilities has been done and the best options have been chosen. For that, it has been taken under consideration different aspects such as the previous experience of the staff and the resources available at a reasonable price. A first prototype has been designed using CAD software. The pieces have been made using 3 D printers, extrusion and milling and then assembled. The functionality has been tested and proved. Then, two more different prototypes have also been made in order to improve some features. The automation of the prototypes has been done using a programming language and electronic devices. The final design that has proved to perform better has been a cylinder with a piston and o’rings. On one side it contents ink {{and on the other side}} pressurized air. The pressure of the air is responsible of moving the ink towards the printhead, while the inverse movement is produced when the <b>refill</b> <b>pump</b> is enabled. Finally, a set of tests with the selected design have been done and the proper functionality of the intermediate tank has been proved. Besides, technical documentation has been prepared in order to speed up the investigation in case it is attached to a major project to further develop it...|$|E

5000|$|Water high in {{mineral content}} (hard water) will leave mineral {{deposits}} on the pads and {{interior of the}} cooler. Depending on the type and concentration of minerals, possible safety hazards during the replacement and waste removal of the pads could be present. Bleed-off and <b>refill</b> (purge <b>pump)</b> systems can reduce but not eliminate this problem. Installation of an inline water filter (refrigerator drinking water / ice maker type) will drastically reduce the mineral deposits.|$|R

50|$|A single-piston pump {{delivers}} {{liquid to}} the outlet {{only during the}} discharge stroke. If the piston's suction and discharge strokes occur {{at the same speed}} and liquid is metered out half the time the pump is working, then the overall metering rate averaged over time equals half the average flow rate during the discharge stroke. Some single-piston pumps may have a constant slow piston motion for discharge and a quick retract motion for <b>refilling</b> the <b>pump</b> head. In such cases, the overall metering rate is practically equal to the pumping rate during the discharge stroke.|$|R
50|$|Intrathecal pumps require maintenance. Individuals who {{use these}} pumps {{will need to}} come into their physician's office to have the <b>pump</b> <b>refilled.</b> How {{frequently}} this occurs is dependent on several factors, including drug concentration and dosage, and <b>pump</b> size. The <b>refill</b> frequency can range between one and six months for baclofen pumps.|$|R
50|$|One or {{two players}} {{progress}} through five stages; Warehouse, Freeway, Wasteland, and Silo, with the fifth stage involving players shooting down missiles in mid flight. Throughout the stages, various powerups are found, such as stronger weapons, and extra bombs. Unlike the limited ammo found in Operation Wolf, this game has unlimited ammo. As {{long as the}} trigger is squeezed, weapons will fire on full automatic. Once the ammo counter is depleted, the rate of fire decreases sharply. When the trigger is let go, the counter instantly <b>refills.</b> A <b>pump</b> slide underneath {{the front of the}} gun barrel is used for bombs. Up to three bombs can be carried at a time, as opposed to nine in the first game.|$|R
5000|$|Lake Atalanta was {{constructed}} in 1936-1938 as a public works project of the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal-era agency. [...] For the first ten years of its existence, the area around Lake Atalanta was undeveloped, and used primarily for fishing. In 1948 and 1949, a swimming pool, miniature golf course, roller skating rink, and restaurant were constructed. [...] In the mid-1950s, Lake Atalanta became a water source for the city {{with the construction of}} a water treatment plant. During a drought in the 1960s, the lake nearly dried up, and was <b>refilled</b> by <b>pumping</b> water from nearby Beaver Lake. In 1970, Beaver Lake replaced Lake Atalanta as the city's water source.|$|R
40|$|An {{essential}} element for main-tenance of adequate forwardblood flow {{out of the}} heart issufficient venous return back to the heart with each cardiac cycle. As simple as this concept may seem, it is the distinct lack of venous return to the heart during states of profound hypotension that often leads to the downward spiral of ischemia, acidosis, hypoxemia, and ulti-mately, death. Thus, to sustain effective blood flow through a closed-loop system such as the cardiovascular tree, during each cardiac cycle, the fluid volume mov-ing forward out of the pump must be matched by an equal volume of blood {{from the rest of}} the body moving back into the <b>pump.</b> <b>Refilling</b> of the ventricles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPlasma membrane, sarco-endoplasmic {{reticulum}} and secretory pathway Ca 2 +-ATPases (designated PMCA, SERCA and SPCA) regulate intracellular Ca 2 + {{in animal}} cells. The presence of PMCA, {{and the absence}} of SERCA, in sea urchin sperm is known. By using inhibitors of Ca 2 +-ATPases, we now show the presence of SPCA and Ca 2 + store in sea urchin sperm, which <b>refills</b> by SPCA-type <b>pumps.</b> Immunofluorescence shows SPCA localizes to the mitochondrion. Ca 2 + measurements reveal that ∼ 75 % of Ca 2 + extrusion is by Ca 2 + ATPases and 25 % by Na+ dependent Ca 2 + exchanger/s. Bisphenol, a Ca 2 + ATPase inhibitor, completely blocks the acrosome reaction, indicating the importance of Ca 2 +-ATPases in fertilization...|$|R
40|$|A {{participant}} {{in a study}} of implantable insulin pump therapy recounts his experiences with on-and-off use of the pump over the past 18 years. Christopher Witkowski, 55, first had a pump implanted in 1990. Despite occasional difficulties over the years, Witkowski reports that his overall experience has been extremely positive. With delivery of insulin directly into the peritoneal cavity, he feels better, has more flexibility in eating, and experiences fewer insulin reactions. Witkowski expresses disappointment that the manufacturer of the pump, Medtronic, no longer plans to seek Food and Drug Administration approval for this therapy. Witkowski expresses his hope that research on the device will continue, believing that this therapy could be of benefit to millions of diabetes patients.

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for the prolonged infusion {{of a drug}} via a totally implanted drug delivery system is that the drug solution must be sufficiently stable at physiological temperatures to endure the time intervals between drug replacement or <b>pump</b> <b>refills.</b> Consequently, {{the stability of the}} chemotherapeutic agents can influence the dosing accuracy and ultimately the achievement of the desired therapeutic goal. The chemical stability of the pharmaceutical preparation Trimetrexate (TMQ) glucuronate, a non-classical, lipophilic antifolate, has been characterized. Incubation of TMQ (prepared in sterile water to a concentration of 5. 0 mg/ml) in sterile, amber glass vials at 37 [deg]C for 56 days resulted in a degradation rate constant of 0. 0134 +/- 0. 002 day- 1 and a half-life of 51. 6 +/- 0. 8 days. The major degradation product has been identified as (2, 4 -diamino- 5 -methyl- 6 -carboxyaldehyde) quinazoline. Ten percent TMQ degradation would occur by 7. 9 days of incubation under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Two {{alternate}} mechanical pump concepts {{have been}} identified for the transfer of superfluid helium in space. Both pumps provide flow at sufficient head and have operating characteristics suitable for the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) <b>refill</b> mission. One <b>pump</b> operates at a relatively low speed and utilizes mechanical roller bearings, while the other operates at a higher rotational speed using either electromagnetic or tilting pad gas-dynamic bearings. The use of gas bearings requires transfer of normal helium so that the gas pressure within the pump casing is high enough to operate the bearings. The operating characteristics of both pumps are predicted, the dimensions are estimated and major technology issues are identified. The major issues for each pump design are cavitation performance and bearing development. Roller bearings require quantified reliability for operation in space while electromagnetic bearings require basic development {{as well as a}} complex control system. The low speed pump has significantly poorer hydraulic efficiency than the high speed pump...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Intrathecal {{drug therapy}} is being {{utilized}} increasingly {{for the treatment}} of chronic refractory pain. However, performing the regular <b>pump</b> <b>refill</b> procedures caries the potential risk of medication injection into the subcutaneous tissue. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the accuracy of this template-guided refill technique by means of fluoroscopic evaluation. Materials and Methods In 23 patients, the difference between the identification of the reservoir fill port center using the manufacturer's template and fluoroscopic guidance was assessed on four consecutive refill procedures by a two physicians. A distance surpassing that between the center and the margin of the port (3. 5 mm) was considered a clinically relevant deviation. Analyses were performed with a one-sample t-test, with p < 0. 05 indicating statistical significance. Results The mean difference distance between identification markings of the target with fluoroscopic guidance and with the template was 8. 2 -mm, with limited variance (2. 7 -mm). For all individual refill procedures, the port center identification accuracy differed significantly from zero (all p < 0. 001) and from the clinically relevant cut-off point of 3. 5 -mm (all p < 0. 001). Only seven attempts (6. 4 %) were within the margins of the fill port. Conclusions Our results suggest poor accuracy of insertion point identification using the template. This highlights the potential risk of errors related to identification of the puncture site using the template-guided technique...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Intrathecal drug {{delivery}} systems (intrathecal pumps) {{are used to}} treat patients with chronic refractory pain syndromes and spasticity. The objective of our case report was to demonstrate that intrathecal pump malfunction can lead to intrathecal overdosing of drugs. CASE REPORT: We present 2 cases of intrathecal pump malfunction leading to overinfusion. The first case concerns a patient with an intrathecal pump that was implanted almost 5 years before the reported incident. During a refill procedure, 12. 5 mL was aspirated instead of the expected 21. 8 mL. Analysis of the pump revealed that the pump was overinfusing. The second case concerns a patient with an intrathecal pump that was implanted more than 5 years before the reported incident. Ten hours after a regular <b>refill</b> of the <b>pump,</b> she {{was found in a}} comatose state, and when the intrathecal pump was emptied, only 16 mL was aspirated instead of the 19. 6 mL expected. Analysis of the pump revealed that the inner tubing was not running smoothly over the roller arms, possibly causing spurts, which could have caused an overinfusion. CONCLUSIONS: We present 2 cases of intrathecal pump malfunction, which most likely led to overinfusion of fentanyl intrathecally. To reduce the risk of this complication, particular attention should be paid to drug reservoir volume discrepancies and overdose symptoms reported by patients.

40|$|Factors such as {{insufficient}} drug potency, non-compliance {{and restricted}} tissue penetration contribute to incomplete suppression of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) {{and the difficulty}} to control this infection. Infusion via standard catheters can {{be a source of}} infection, which is potentially life threatening in these patients. We developed an implantable infusion pump, allowing to accommodate large volumes (16 - 50 mL) of high viscous solutions (up to 23. 96 mPas at 39 degrees C) of anti-HIV agents and providing sustained release of medication: a standard Codman 3000 pump, which was initially developed to release aqueous solutions (approximately 0. 7 mPas) into the spinal cord such as for pain medication, was transformed for release of viscous solutions up to 40 mPas by adapting the diameter of the capillary flow restrictor, the capillary length and way of catheterisation [...] by placing the indwelling catheter in the vena cava. A pilot study of the pump implanted in 2 dogs showed continuous steady-state release of the protease inhibitor darunavir (25 mg/dog/day administered for 25 days), thereby achieving plasma concentration levels of approximately 40 ng/mL. Steady-state plasma levels were reproducible after monthly <b>refill</b> of the <b>pumps.</b> In conclusion, the implantable adapted Codman 3000 constant-flow infusion pump customized to anti-HIV therapy allows sustained release of anti-HIV medication and may represent an opportunity to reduce the pill burden and complexity of dosing schemes associated with common anti-HIV therapy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tolerance {{is defined}} as a {{phenomenon}} in which exposure to a drug results in a decrease of an effect or the requirement of a higher dose to maintain an effect. The fear of a patient developing opioid tolerance contributes regularly to the stigmatization and withholding of intrathecal opioid therapy for chronic pain of non-cancer origin. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the intrathecal opioid dose escalation throughout the years in chronic non-cancer pain patients. A secondary objective was the development of an intrathecal opioid dose predictive model. Study Design: Retrospective assessment of medical records. Setting: Department of Pain Management, Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley, United Kingdom. Methods: Medical records were reviewed and <b>pump</b> <b>refill</b> notes screened from the date of implant through November 2010 for 31 patients undertaking continuous intrathecal opioid therapy. All the patients included had undertaken a minimum of 6 years of intrathecal therapy when the data were collected. Results: Significant increases in the intrathecal morphine dose were verified between follow-up at one year and all subsequent observations, F (2. 075, 62. 238) = 13. 858, 0 < 0. 001, but ceased to be significant from year 3 onwards, indicating stability of the morphine dose, F (3, 90) = 2. 516, P = 0. 63. A model that accounts for 76 % of the variability of morphine doses at year 6 based on year 2 assessment combined with duration of pain prior to initiation of intrathecal therapy was developed: year 6 dose = - 0. 509 + (1. 296 x [year 2 dose]) + (0. 061 x [duration of pain]). Limitations: Retrospective study. Conclusion: The opioid dose escalation observed throughout the years was modest and not significant following year 3 of therapy. The model developed has the potential to assist the physician in the identification of a need for alternative treatment strategies. Furthermore, since many of the pump replacements are performed prior to year 6, it can also assist in the informed decision of the benefits and risks of the maintenance of this therapy...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a Thesis project at the Master Programme in Industrial Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology (LTU). The project took place between Januari and August 2012 and the goal is to develop a new kind of hand held pump for people with rheumatism. The project is {{initiated}} by Fredrik Martinsson, a client based in Mölndal, but the work is done at LTU. The purpose is to develop a new user friendly product to make it easier for people with lowered functionality in their hands to inflate car- and bicycle tires. Existing pumps are based on outdated technology and contain a lot of cumbersome steps during use. The client’s requirements focus on a user friendly product and quick usage which excludes the possibility of a completely manual pump. To meet the specific demands the development work aims to design a portable product that is easy to carry with a propulsion method fast enough to inflate a tire in a matter of seconds. Limitations during the project is an additional market analysis, regarding market potential, other than the one received from the client. It will therefore be assumed that there is an existing need for the product and that the primary users are people with rheumatism and also people who seek a user friendly and fast pump. The overall goal is a fully functional prototype. Package design and marketing material will not be considered. The project started out with conventional methods for project management and a project plan, time plan and included acitivies were discussed with the client. A product development process consisting of four different phases with dedicated deliverables was created. The first phase consists of convergent data collection with user studies, interviews and benchmarking. A problem statement and requirements list were made and lay the foundation for the second creative ideation phase. The quantitative amount of ideas generated were evaluated with numerous methods and a set of concepts were created for further development. The concepts were then refined with sketches, mock-ups and computer models in the third phase to narrow the solution space down to one final concept. Before the fourth and last phase, concepts were evaluated once more and one final direction was chosen for embodiment design. The winning concept was concretized to a finished product with a fully functioning prototype, manufacturing drawings, methods and authentic computer renderings. The result is a new-to-the-world portable pump based on usage in a standing position. This reduces the strain on finger joints, wrist as well as hips, back and knees. The product folds up to a small compact cylinder for transportation which meets the dimensional requirements and is then unfolded with a spring-loaded telescope function before use. It inflates an empty bicycle tire in about five seconds thanks to the built in C 02 cartridge. The nozzle is pressed against the tire’s vault with an ergonomic grip, similar to a crutch, which then opens a small valve that activates the C 02 cartridge. The <b>pump</b> <b>refills</b> through a separate refill station loaded with regular Sodastream bottles which can be bought at any supermarket. Validerat; 20120925 (anonymous...|$|R
