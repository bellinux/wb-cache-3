Hartmann {{jumped out of the}} back of the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E

2500|$|Types of non-fixed keels include swing keels and canting keels. Canting keels can {{be found}} on racing yachts, such as those {{competing}} in the Volvo Ocean Race. [...] They provide considerably more <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> as the keel moves out to the windward-side of the boat while using less weight. [...] The horizontal distance from the weight to the pivot is increased, which generates a larger <b>righting</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{metacentric}} height is an approximation for the vessel stability {{at a small}} angle (0-15 degrees) of heel. Beyond that range, {{the stability of the}} vessel is dominated by what is known as a <b>righting</b> <b>moment.</b> Depending on the geometry of the hull, Naval Architects must iteratively calculate the center of buoyancy at increasing angles of heel. They then calculate the <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> at this angle, which is determined using the equation: ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnlike {{conventional}} airplane, a WIG craft experiences <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> and {{adverse yaw}} moment in banked turning in ground effect. Numerical simulations {{are carried out}} to study the aerodynamics of banked wing in ground effect. Configurations of rectangular wing and delta wing are considered, and performance of endplates and ailerons during banking are also studied. The study shows that <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> increase nonlinearly with heeling angle, and endplates enhance the righting. The asymmetric aerodynamic distribution along span of wing with heeling angle introduces adverse yaw moment. Heeling in ground effect with small ground clearance increases the vertical aerodynamic force and makes WIG craft climb. Deflections of ailerons introduce lift decrease and a light pitching motion. Delta wing shows advantage in banked turning for smaller <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> and adverse yaw moment during banking...|$|R

5000|$|The {{weight of}} the entire boat is 1180 kilograms, {{including}} the hull and standing rigging. The design concentrates the <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> of the keel in a 770 kilogram torpedo-shaped bulb {{at the end of}} an airfoil shaped fin. The ballast to displacement ratio is 0.61 which provides an exceptionally [...] "stiff" [...] platform. The high <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> allows the design to carry a larger than normal sail area which increases power and consequently speed through the water.|$|R

25|$|Zizka, {{throughout}} the rest of December, launched numerous counter-offensives and raids on the Germans' lines. He also introduced the use of small firearms for large bodies of infantry, eventually equipping a third of his infantry. His normal tactic was to mount raids that would draw his opponent into attacking his wagon fort, then, at the <b>right</b> <b>moment,</b> sortie out of the fort with his cavalry, bowmen, and pikemen to ravage the enemy forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} circadian {{clock is}} profoundly influenced {{by changes in}} light, since these are its main clues about what time it is. Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, increase body temperature, and increase cognitive ability. Short pulses of light, at the <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> in the circadian cycle, can significantly 'reset' the internal clock. Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that electronic media use before bed may interfere with sleep.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just the <b>right</b> <b>moment,</b> and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered with a flick of the wrist.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} fin keel, pointing {{straight down}} from the boat, provides no <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> when the boat is level. The heeling force of the wind on the sails is therefore not counteracted until the boat has heeled over by a certain amount, moving the fixed keel to windward of the centerline. The purpose of the canting keel is to allow the boat to sail closer to level which generates maximum speed, by swinging the keel to windward and developing an adequate <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> to keep the boat's angle of heel closer to level.|$|R
50|$|The {{subsequent}} {{investigation on}} {{the loss of}} Captain, {{in the form of}} a court-martial, under Sir James Hope, took place on board HMS Duke of Wellington, in Portsmouth Harbour. It was somewhat of a departure for the Admiralty to seek scientific advice, but eminent engineers William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and William John Macquorn Rankine were appointed to the enquiry. It concluded that the ship was insufficiently stable: at 14 degrees heel (when the edge of the deck touched the sea) the <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> (torque) due to the buoyancy pushing the ship upright again was just 410-foot-tons (1.2 MN·m). HMS Monarch, the masted turret ship proposed by the 1865 committee and designed by Reed, and which was in the area at the time of the sinking, had a <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> of 6,500-foot-tons (20 MN·m) at the same angle. Maximum <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> occurred at a heel of 21 degrees, and thereafter declined to zero at 54.5 degrees. Monarch's <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> increased to a maximum at 40 degrees. Survivors testified that the Captain floated upside down for between three and ten minutes, which proved that the ship had capsized. An inclining test had been carried out at Portsmouth on 29 July 1870 to allow the ship's stability characteristics to be calculated. Captain set sail on the ship's final voyage before the results of the trial were published.|$|R
25|$|Socrates {{praises the}} Spartans {{as the best}} {{people in the world}} not only because of their fierceness in battle but because of their wisdom and {{philosophical}} skills. This is contrary to the common belief that the Spartans lacked in these issues and devoted themselves exclusively to physical training but Socrates claims that they are masters at concealing their skills. While they appear to be unimpressive speakers, at just the <b>right</b> <b>moment,</b> they can provide pithy phrases of wisdom (342e). He adds that Laconic brevity was the earliest characteristic of philosophy (343b).|$|E
25|$|In an Engine Management System (EMS), {{electronics}} control {{fuel delivery}} and ignition timing. Primary sensors {{on the system}} are crankshaft angle (crankshaft or Top Dead Center (TDC) position), airflow into the engine and throttle position. The circuitry determines which cylinder needs fuel and how much, opens the requisite injector to deliver it, then causes a spark at the <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> to burn it. Early EMS systems used an analogue computer to accomplish this, but as embedded systems dropped in price and became fast enough {{to keep up with}} the changing inputs at high revolutions, digital systems started to appear.|$|E

Half an hour {{from the beginning of}} the battle, Domerville made the signal, and then Bouillon charged upon Coligny's right flank. The French cavalry was thrown in disarray over the French infantry, which was broken and driven from the field in disorder. The malcontents and the Habsburg forces took 4,000 prisoners, including 400 officers, all the artillery and the baggage of Coligny's Royal army, many flags and a cash of 400,000 livres.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Zionists who quote the Maharal's commentary on Ketubot, anti-Zionist writers {{have said that}} even if the oaths are to be seen as decrees, it was obviously not God's intent that the Jewish people should keep trying to return to the Land of Israel and build a state until they hit the <b>right</b> <b>moment.</b> In view of the harsh consequences of failure ("I will declare your flesh ownerless like the gazelles and hinds of the field"), this would be as foolish as playing Russian roulette. Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 316 BC, Seleucus and Peithon joined Antigonus, who was {{following}} Eumenes to Susa. From Susa Antigonus went to Media, from where he could threaten the eastern provinces. He left Seleucus with {{a small number of}} troops to prevent Eumenes from reaching the Mediterranean. Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, saw the situation as hopeless and returned to his own province. The armies of Eumenes and his allies were at breaking point. Antigonus and Eumenes had two encounters during 316 BC, in the battles of Paraitacene and Gabiene. Eumenes was defeated and executed. The events of the Second War of the Diadochi revealed Seleucus' ability to wait for the <b>right</b> <b>moment.</b> Blazing into battle was not his style.|$|E

Bridge not only delegated the organ to Walter Alcock, but also used two sub-conductors, and furthermore alternated with Parratt in conducting {{from the top of the}} organ screen. The only real musical error was that Bridge misjudged the timing of I Was Glad and had finished the anthem before the King had arrived, having to repeat it when the <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> came.

50|$|The {{stability}} of a buoyant object {{at the surface}} is more complex, and it may remain stable even if the centre of gravity is above the centre of buoyancy, provided that when disturbed from the equilibrium position, the centre of buoyancy moves further to the same side that the centre of gravity moves, thus providing a positive <b>righting</b> <b>moment.</b> If this occurs, the floating object {{is said to have}} a positive metacentric height. This situation is typically valid for a range of heel angles, beyond which the centre of buoyancy does not move enough to provide a positive <b>righting</b> <b>moment,</b> and the object becomes unstable. It is possible to shift from positive to negative or vice versa more than once during a heeling disturbance, and many shapes are stable in more than one position.|$|R
