5000|$|Reuse - Reusable {{packaging}} is encouraged. [...] Returnable packaging {{has long}} been useful (and economically viable) for closed loop logistics systems. Inspection, cleaning, repair and recouperage are often needed. Some manufacturers <b>re-use</b> the <b>packaging</b> of the incoming parts for a product, either as packaging for the outgoing product {{or as part of}} the product itself.|$|R

This {{has raised the}} opportunity for service providers and application developers to develop value-added services by combining existing web services. However, current web service composition solutions do not address software engineering principles for raising the level of abstraction in web-services by providing facilities for <b>packaging,</b> <b>re-using,</b> specializing and customizing service compositions...|$|R
5000|$|Packages are {{groups of}} conceptually linked functions, procedures, variables, PL/SQL table and record TYPE statements, constants, cursors etc. The use of <b>packages</b> {{promotes}} <b>re-use</b> of code. <b>Packages</b> {{are composed of}} the package specification and an optional package body. The specification is the interface to the application; it declares the types, variables, constants, exceptions, cursors, and subprograms available. The body fully defines cursors and subprograms, and so implements the specification.Two advantages of packages are: ...|$|R

This article chronicles our journey towards a common way of packaging and exchanging digital content {{in a future}} Australian data commons - a national corpus of research resources that can be shared and <b>re-used.</b> Whatever <b>packaging</b> format is used, it has to handle complex content models and work across multiple submission and dissemination scenarios. It has {{to do this in}} a way that maintains a history of the chain of custody of objects over time. At the start of our journey we chose METS extended by PREMIS to do this. We learnt a lot during the first two stages that we want to share with those travelling to a similar destination.  ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the LHC Computing Grid (LCG) project, the Applications Area {{develops}} and maintains that part of the physics applications software and associated infrastructure that is shared among the LHC experiments. The "Physicist Interface" (PI) project of the LCG Application Area encompasses the interfaces and tools by which physicists will directly use the software, providing implementations based on agreed standards like the AIDA interfaces for data analysis. In collaboration with users from the experiments, work has started with implementing the AIDA interfaces for (binned and unbinned) histogramming, fitting and minimization as well as manipulation of tuples. These implementations have been developed by <b>re-using</b> existing <b>packages</b> either directly or by using a (thin) layer of wrappers. In addition, bindings of these interfaces to the Python interpreted language have been done using the dictionary subsystem of the LCG-AA/SEAL project. The actual status and the future planning of the project will be presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to design new and {{innovative}} packaging for agricultural products with the use of eco-friendly raw materials, processes and practises. The products considered in this study were local Greek produce like olive oil, tsipouro, raki, fruits and vegetables. These products are currently packaged in a very conventional way and it is generally recognised that the current packaging solutions do not reflect the quality of the produce or the ecological trends worldwide. The whole study was based on the use of Computer Aided Design programs and other digital technology. Glass and wood was used for the packaging of the fluid produce (olive oil, tsipouro and raki) and the raw material for the packaging solutions for the fruits and vegetables (crates) was olive tree pruning and wood wastes with the use of ecological glues. Other ecological aspects that were considered and utilised in the current proposal/study were 1. the <b>re-use</b> of the <b>packaging.</b> 2. the use of less raw material than current practises, 3. Ease of assembly and disassembly (separation) of materials...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{transcoder}} {{project set}} out to develop and trial a cloud based service that can change one type of educational content package into another (i. e. transcode). Such a capability would help overcome the current proliferation of incompatible content packaging formats, which can be an obstacle to the dissemination and <b>re-use</b> of <b>packaged</b> learning content. The aim was to both test the technical feasibility of such a transcoder, as well as explore the business case for deploying it as cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS). In that regard, both the initial set-up phase as well as potential future business models were explored. Possible further developments of the service were also considered. The transcoder software was developed after a pattern established by a similar, advertising supported service for other kinds of file formats. The pattern is centred around a manual upload and download of packages, {{in order to facilitate}} maximal transcoding capacity without bottlenecks. The software itself was developed to be hosted on Amazon web services, {{for a variety of reasons}} that include flexibility of deployment, price and sustainability. In the event, demand for the service turned out to be low, which may have something to do with limited usage of packaged content in the JISC community, exacerbated by limitations of the design of the transcoder’s interface, and possibly also the range of conversions that were developed and are currently available. As a consequence, the low start-up investment costs as well as the scalable exploitation costs of cloud computing offered clear advantages for this type of service. Also, at this, or even much higher levels of usage the ongoing costs required to keep the service going are low. Finally, feedback from stakeholders indicate that a few simple extensions to the software could make the service more useful...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the problem of}} pollution, which nowadays causes a serious damage to nature and therefore to human life. Despite warnings from nature, people are still {{not aware of the}} consequences caused by their irresponsible behaviour. That is why {{it is very important to}} raise awareness of the problem of pre-school children. With proper approach, patience and examples it is possible to inspire children with the sense of protecting the environment that surrounds them. The thesis describes some activities that present the problem in a comprehensible way to children. It also contains a list of all the books pre-school teacher can use while explain certain terms. The activities were accomplished in a group of children aged 4 to 5 years. Oral survey results show what the children already know about the problem and how much knowledge they have gained. Their knowledge has expanded through specific experience with waste, by listening to instructive stories, playing and creating with various waste materials. Along with proper waste management, children were shown options of <b>re-use</b> of waste <b>packaging</b> and various materials for creative play and work in the kindergarten...|$|R
