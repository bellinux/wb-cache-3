40|$|Despite {{the latest}} {{improvements}} in pacemaker/defibrillator lead extraction techniques, this procedure may be hindered by specific {{problems related to}} patient/lead characteristics. We report {{the case of a}} 67 -year-old man with a single-chamber implantable defibrillator (ICD) with a malfunctioning right ventricular (RV) defibrillating <b>lead,</b> <b>referred</b> for <b>lead</b> extraction. During extraction of the defibrillating electrode, the added sensing/pacing RV lead suddenly manifested an inapparent fracture with migration within the superior vena cava. Lead extraction through a superior conventional and laser-assisted approach was ineffective.

40|$|Although the {{physiological}} cost of refereeing has been already {{studied in the}} literature, especially in soccer umpires, it remains unknown whether referees spontaneously adapt their energy intake during game days. Six national soccer referees completed 24 -hour dietary recalls (assisted by the SU. VI. MAX copybook) during a control day (CON) and a day with a game (GAME). The stress level and hunger feelings were assessed using visual analogue scales. Total energy intake, energy derived from macronutrients and energy intake at each meal were analyzed using the Bilnuts nutrition software. Total daily energy intake was not significantly different between conditions (CON: 2270 ± 535 vs. GAME: 2782 ± 293). Energy derived from fat and protein was not different between conditions but the participants ingested more calories derived from carbohydrates during the GAME day (45. 5 ± 5. 9 % vs. 54. 9 ± 5. 5 %, respectively, p< 0. 05). The calories ingested during snacking were significantly increased during GAME compared with CON (p< 0. 05). The stress level was significantly higher during GAME and especially before the breakfast, lunch and snack (p< 0. 05). Hunger feeling was not different between conditions. <b>Referring</b> <b>leads</b> to nutritional adaptations in elite soccer umpires, who tend to increase their energy intake mainly during snacking, by increasing their carbohydrate consumption.

5000|$|While {{the title}} Djinn seems to allude to a Genie or mystical spirit, it instead <b>refers</b> to the <b>lead</b> {{woman of the}} novel, Jean. In French, the name spelled Jean is {{pronounced}} [...] and {{is the equivalent of}} the male name [...] "John". The English pronunciation of Jean might be written more like djinn in French.|$|R
50|$|But {{more action}} was to come, {{and it was}} <b>referred</b> to the <b>lead.</b> Reid made contact with Ciantini while braking for the Hairpin and lost ground in the process. This allowed Bosio to grab 2nd place, {{allowing}} him to go in pursuit of Bocha Ciantini. Soon after, when the engine of the leading Focus called it a day, Bosio inherited the lead.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>refers</b> {{to which}} set of legs, left or right, leads or {{advances}} {{forward to a}} greater extent when a quadruped animal is cantering, galloping, or leaping. The feet on the leading side touch the ground forward of its partner. On the [...] "left lead", the animal's left legs lead. The choice of lead is of special interest in horse riding.|$|R
25|$|From {{the above}} {{examples}} {{one can see}} why understanding of <b>referred</b> pain can <b>lead</b> to better diagnoses of various conditions and diseases. In 1981 physiotherapist Robin McKenzie described what he termed centralization. He concluded that centralization occurs when referred pain moves from a distal to a more proximal location. Observations {{in support of this}} idea were seen when patients would bend backward and forward during an examination.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name comes}} from κιννάβαρι (kinnabari), a Greek word most likely applied by Theophrastus to several {{distinct}} substances. Other sources say the word comes from the [...] shangarf (Arabicized as زنجفرة zinjifrah), a word of uncertain origin (also compare, Sanskrit सुगर sugara). In Latin it was sometimes known as minium, meaning also [...] "red cinnamon", though both of these terms now <b>refer</b> specifically to <b>lead</b> tetroxide.|$|R
40|$|Fractional centred {{differences}} and derivatives definitions are proposed generalising to real orders the existing ones valid for even and odd positive integer orders. For each one, suitable integral formulations are obtained. The computations of the involved integrals {{lead to new}} generalisations of the Cauchy integral derivative. To compute this integral, a special two straight line path was used. With this the <b>referred</b> integrals <b>lead</b> to the well known Riesz potential operators and their inverses that emerge as true fractional centred derivatives, but that can be computed through summations similar to the well known Grünwald-Letnikov derivatives Mathematics Subject Classification: 26 A 33 Keywords: fractional centred difference; fractional centred derivative; Grünwald-Letnikov; generalized Cauchy derivative. 1...|$|R
40|$|Referring {{expressions}} {{like the}} tall red cup {{are used to}} identify entities in many different language tasks, so referring expression generation (REG) is {{a crucial part of}} computational natural language generation. One of the challenges of REG is relational descriptions that refer to an object by relating it to some other object, as in the cup on the table. This paper presents a new computational algorithm, DR-REG, for referring expression generation using relational descriptions. DRREG generates relational referring expressions for complex objects by searching through syntactic and semantic information for a suitable expression. DR-REG is evaluated in a controlled experiment that shows its <b>referring</b> expressions <b>lead</b> readers to correctly identify a target object...|$|R
30|$|In sum, the <b>referred</b> {{comparison}} could <b>lead</b> to {{the firm}} conclusion that the equivalent reactor network (ERN) model can simulate the FCC riser reactor credibly and give rise to desirable results. Moreover, the ERN model can perform the steady-state simulation of FCC process in only several seconds on a single desktop personal computer, compared to multiple days/months on multiple processors for more detailed CFD-based simulations [4, 5, 6, 13].|$|R
50|$|In 2010 Golob won the Kresnik Award {{for best}} novel with his debut novel Svinjske nogice (Pigs' Legs).

The title <b>refers</b> to the <b>lead</b> character's attempt to master the art of tattooing by practicing on pigs' legs.|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Kodachrome" [...] {{is named}} after the Kodak film of the same name. Kodak {{required}} the album to note that Kodachrome is a trademark of Kodak. The song was not released as a single in Britain, where {{it could not be}} played on BBC radio due to its trademarked name. The song [...] "Was a Sunny Day" [...] has an interesting reference to early rock and roll in the line [...] "She called him Speedo but his Christian name was Mr. Earl" [...] which echoes the chorus from the 1955 song [...] "Speedo" [...] by The Cadillacs: [...] "They often call me Speedo but my real name is Mr. Earl," [...] <b>referring</b> to <b>lead</b> singer, Earl [...] "Speedo" [...] Carroll.|$|R
50|$|A few {{original}} production documents {{state the}} name of the serial as The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve, although this is an anachronism, as the actual massacre took place on St Bartholomew's Day. Some have noted that as the original French name for the event (Massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy) lacks a day, the title actually <b>refers</b> to the <b>lead</b> up to the massacre itself — that is, the Eve of the Massacre of St Bartholomew.|$|R
5000|$|... "Since You've Been Gone" [...] is a 2004 single from Powderfinger's fifth studio album Vulture Street.

This song has been featured in computer games such as Tony Hawk's Project 8 and as an instrumental version on Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08.|$|R
50|$|TRIACs {{resemble}} SCRs in {{that they}} both act as electrically controlled switches. Unlike SCRs, TRIACS can pass current in either direction. Thus, TRIACs are particularly useful for AC applications. TRIACs have three leads: a gate lead and two conducting <b>leads,</b> <b>referred</b> to as MT1 and MT2. If no current/voltage {{is applied to the}} gate lead, the TRIAC switches off. On the other hand, if the trigger voltage is applied to the gate lead, the TRIAC switches on.|$|R
