40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a contribution to}} hardened tool steel milling studies. High speed milling is largely utilized to substitute some EDM and polishing operations, mainly in hardened tool steel finishing. Tool path strategy may either enable good surface finish or contributes to generate high <b>roughness</b> <b>values</b> and poor surface finish. Tool inclination (angle between tool axis and workpiece surface) influences the system response to vibration. In this work, several milling experiments were performed in a circular convex AISI D 6 hardened steel workpiece, having as input variables feed direction (upward and downward the circle) and tilt angle (tool inclination). The main results indicate that upward tool path presented mostly high <b>roughness</b> <b>values</b> which were also influenced by tool inclination. Downward tool path presented low <b>roughness</b> <b>values</b> and was less influenced by tool inclination. Upward tool path and positive tool inclination should be avoided because they presented <b>roughness</b> <b>values</b> incompatible to EDM process substitution...|$|R
50|$|CNC {{plunge milling}} {{is often called}} z-axis milling also. In this process, the feed is {{provided}} linearly along the tool axis while doing CNC processing. Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface <b>roughness</b> <b>value</b> always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling. The cutting force and machine stability both are influenced by machining parameters. Frequency domain model can be used to estimate the machining stability.|$|E

Atomic Force Microscopy allows us to investigate the roughness of cell membrane in great detail, but the obtained <b>roughness</b> <b>value</b> is scale-dependent, i. e. it strongly depends on measurement parameters, as scanning area and step size. The scale-dependence of the <b>roughness</b> <b>value</b> can be reduced by means of data filtration techniques, that are not standardized at nanometric scale, especially as far as biological data are concerned.

In this way, a root mean square <b>roughness</b> <b>value</b> independent of cell shape, membrane micro-irregularities and measurement parameters can be obtained.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the surface roughness of esthetic composite resins finished and polished with 2 different one-step polishing systems and a conventional multi-step disc system. Materials and Method: The evaluated composite resins were: Filtek Ultimate (3 M ESPE), Amaris (Voco) and Esthet-X HD (Dentsply). A total of 120 specimens were fabricated in a plexiglass mold covered with a mylar strip. After polymerization, ten specimens per group received no polishing treatment and served as the control group. For each composite resin group (n= 30), the specimens were randomly divided into three polishing systems: Enhance (one-step; Dentsply), OptraPol (one-step; Ivoclar Vivadent) and Sof-Lex (multiple-steps; 3 M ESPE). All polishing systems were applied according to the manufacturers' instructions. The surface <b>roughness</b> <b>values</b> were determined using a profilometer. Data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests (α= 0. 05).
