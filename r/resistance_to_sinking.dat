40|$|In {{pursuing}} {{the mechanics of}} wear of cast aluminium–silicon alloy engine bore we report here the sinking of load bearing silicon protrusions under normal loading. After establishing the buried depth of particles {{as a function of}} measurable plan dimensions we experimentally relate the particle morphology to resistance to permanent sinking into the matrix by normal loading. We find this resistance, expressed as critical contact pressure at the commencement of plasticity, to increase with the surface to volume ratio of the particle being loaded. This implies that small particles enhance resistance to plastic sinking. If the particles are rectangular in shape, thinner particles (needle shaped) offer greater <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sinking.</b> The information reported provides a guide to the alloy designer concerned with wear resistance of aluminium engine bores...|$|E
40|$|A b s t r a c t Aseismic ridges on underthrusting oceanic plates often trend into cusps or {{irregular}} indentations in {{the trace}} of the subduction zone. For example, the Hawaii-Emperor Ridge trends into the Kuril-Aleutian cusp, and the Marianas arc is bounded by the Marcus-Necker Ridge on {{the north and the}} Caroline Ridge on the south. The association between ridges and cusps is too common to be due to chance; it is proposed that the extra buoyancy of the plate with its aseismic ridge gives the plate greater <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sinking.</b> This would inhibit back-arc extension and thereby produce a notch in the subduction zone. Island arcs may, therefore, acquire their curvature by additional constraints than the Earth's curva ture. The geology of about 15 such cusp areas is examined for evidence to test the hypothesis that cusps were caused by subducted aseismic ridges. This hy pothesis applies only to cases where extensional basins lie behind the arcs. There also appear to be cases where the {{trace of the}} subduction zone has been modi fied not by inhibited back-arc spreading but by splintering of the overthrustin...|$|E
40|$|Food {{concentration}} differentially affected reproductive {{rates and}} hydrodynamic characteristics of spincd and unspined phenotypes of the polymorphic rotifer Kerutella testudo. The intrinsic rate {{of population growth}} (0. 15 d- I) of the predator-induced phenotype was {{less than half that}} of the unspined morph (0. 39 d I) at high food concentrations. The spined phenotype had considerably lower survivorship and fecundity than the unspined one after the first 3 - 4 d of life. At low food concentrations population growth rates were not statistically different; their age-specific survivor-ship and fecundity schedules were nearly identical. Sinking rates and swimming speeds of both morphs were significantly and negatively correlated (r =- 0. 96). Attached eggs increased sinking rates regardless of food level. Changes in sinking rate occurred within 6 h of transferring animals acclimated to high food to conditions of starvation. Food concentration greatly influenced the center ofgravity ofthe morphs and, consequently, affected orientation during sinking. They sank posterior-end downward in high food conditions and in a more horizontal plane in low food treatments. The latter position should give maximal <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sinking,</b> consistent with the slower sinking rates in low food conditions...|$|E

40|$|As subducting plates {{reach the}} base of the upper mantle, some appear to flatten and stagnate, while others {{seemingly}} go through unimpeded. This variable <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> slab <b>sinking</b> has been proposed to affect long-term thermal and chemical mantle circulation. A review of observational constraints and dynamic models highlights that neither the increase in viscosity between upper and lower mantle (likely by a factor 20 – 50) nor the coincident endothermic phase transition in the main mantle silicates (with a likely Clapeyron slope of – 1 to – 2 MPa/K) suffice to stagnate slabs. However, together the two provide enough <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> temporarily stagnate subducting plates, if they subduct accompanied by significant trench retreat. Older, stronger plates are more capable of inducing trench retreat, explaining why backarc spreading and flat slabs tend to be associated with old-plate subduction. Slab viscosities that are ∼ 2 orders of magnitude higher than background mantle (effective yield stresses of 100 – 300 MPa) lead to similar styles of deformation as those revealed by seismic tomography and slab earthquakes. None of the current transition-zone slabs seem to have stagnated there more than 60 m. y. Since modeled slab destabilization takes more than 100 m. y., lower-mantle entry is apparently usually triggered (e. g., by changes in plate buoyancy). Many of the complex morphologies of lower-mantle slabs can be the result of sinking and subsequent deformation of originally stagnated slabs, which can retain flat morphologies {{in the top of the}} lower mantle, fold as they sink deeper, and eventually form bulky shapes in the deep mantle...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation of}} viscous slabs subducted from a migrating trench reveals {{a range of}} possible behaviours. The slab dip in a uniform mantle {{is found to be}} steady or oscillatory, depending on the rates of descent and trench migration. In addition, density and viscosity interfaces are used to model the increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sinking</b> of stiff slabs through the seismic discontinuity at a depth of about 660 km in Earth's mantle. If the slab is denser than the lower layer and its dip in the upper layer is steady, it can continue to descend through the lower layer in a tabular form and in either a steady or oscillatory manner, or it can be laid horizontally on the interface for a distance before descending in a chain of diapirs resulting from gravitational instability at the interface. If the slab dip in the upper layer is unstable, the slab sinks into the lower layer in a chain of large diapirs at a spacing determined by the frequency of oscillations set by instability of the slab within the upper layer. The style of penetration depends on the trench migration speed and the ratio of sinking velocities in the two layers. Estimates for mantle slabs indicate that they may range across the major regime transitions. The experimental system provides a gross simplification of mantle conditions but the results are a testimony to the possibility of a range of complex behaviour of subducted lithosphere. They also indicate that the relationship between the structural features in the lower mantle revealed by seismic imaging and present-day tectonic processes at the surface may not be obvious. Tomographic images of western Pacific subduction zones and data for the migration rates of associated trenches suggest a dependence of slab behaviour on migration rate similar to that seen in the experiments...|$|E
40|$|Lightweight aluminium-silicon alloy is an {{attractive}} material for making engine cylinders in automobiles. It imparts good {{power to weight ratio}} to the engine. High silicon containing aluminium alloys are used in current engine block castings where the bore surface is etched or honed to partially expose the silicon particles to provide the primary contact between the piston ring and certain regions of the piston and the cylinder. Piston reversal near the top dead centre however causes starvation of lubrication which leads to wear. To explore the wear behaviour of etched aluminium-silicon alloys under nominally dry conditions and extreme lubricated conditions, a host of mechanical and spectroscopic techniques are used here to characterize mechanical and chemical changes caused by wear. In the absence of complex chemical transformations on the wear surface in dry condition, allows a close examination of surface and subsurface microstructures. Given this understanding of the wear under dry condition, we explore the effect of boundary lubrication, where chemical transformations leading to surface modifications are involved. In dry sliding tribology of aluminium-silicon alloy slid against a steel ball four stages of wear are identified; ultra-mild wear, mild wear, severe wear and post severe oxidative wear. In the ultra-mild wear regime silicon particles bears the load. Transition to mild wear occurs when the protruded silicon particles disappear(by sinking and fracture) under higher pressure and sliding. The sinking of silicon particles under normal loading is further investigated using a naoindenter. It is found that the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sinking</b> of such particles into the matrix increases with the unexposed surface area to the buried volume of the particles. In that sense, small particles are seen to provide the stiffest <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>sinking.</b> While in ultra-mild wear regime the basic energy dissipation mechanism is sinking/tilting, in mild wear regime the subsurface is either in an elastic or an incipiently plastic state. Subsurface plasticity in mild wear regime leads to a grain refinement, fracture of silicon and nucleation of cracks at silicon-matrix interfaces but does not promote large scale flow of the matrix. Transition to severe wear occurs when the contact pressure exceeds the plastic shakedown limit. Under this condition gross plasticity leads to a severe fragmentation of silicon particles and the fragmented silicon are transported by the matrix as it undergoes incremental straining with each cyclic contact at the asperity level. A large reduction in the inter-particle distance com-pared to that in a milder stage of wear, gives rise to high strain gradients in the severe wear regime which contribute to the enhancement of dislocation density. The resulting regions of very high strains at the boundaries of the recrystallised grains as well as within the subgrains lead to the formation of microvoids/ cracks. This is accompanied by the formation of brittle oxides at these subsurface inter-faces due to enhanced diffusion of oxygen. We believe that the abundance of such microcracks in the near surface region, primed by severe plastic deformation, is what distinguishes a severe wear regime from that in the mild wear. The transition from severe wear to post severe oxidative wear is thermally induced and it transfers the metal to metal contact interaction to metal to ceramic interaction. A thick oxide layer is abraded and spalls while the metal underneath continues to flow and delaminate. A study of lubricated tribology of ultra-mild and mild wear regime of aluminium-silicon alloy shows that the initial stages of sliding friction is controlled by the abrasion of the steel pin by the protruding silicon particles of the aluminium-silicon disc. Thegeneration of nascent steel chips helps to breakdown the additive in the oil by a cationic exchange that yields chemical products of benefits to the tribology. The friction is initially controlled by abrasion, but the chemical products gain increasing importance in controlling friction with sliding time. After long times, depending on the contact pressure, the chemical products determine sliding friction exclusively. In the mild wear chemically induced low friction is achieved in short periods of time whereas in ultra-mild wear regime it takes very long time to reach this low friction state. While the basic dissipation mechanisms are the same in the ultra-mild wear and mild wear regimes,the matrix remains practically unworn in the low pressure ultra-mild wear regime. In the higher pressure mild wear regime at long sliding times a small but finite wear rate prevails. Incipient plasticity in the subsurface controls the mechanism of wear...|$|E

40|$|Bentonite {{makes an}} {{important}} contribution to the performance of the engineered barriers in most radioactive waste repository designs. The choice of bentonite results from its favourable properties for waste isolation and its stability in relevant geological environments. However, the longevity of bentonite (especially the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> waste container <b>sinking)</b> has been little studied. Modelling results suggest significant bentonite deformation and associated canister sinking is unlikely and, here, long-term natural system data are used as a reality check on model predictions. Results indicate that bentonite from the investigated site shows no significant deviation in bulk physical parameters from repository bentonite. However, micro-scale shear planes can be seen throughout the sampled cores. The presence of multi-directional S- and C-type shears suggests they originate from loading from the overlying limestone, not gravitational tectonics. The plastic limits and angles of shearing resistance for natural and repository bentonites suggest both are susceptible to shearing. The impact of bentonite shear under load could be minimised by appropriate design, but existing lower activity waste container designs do not consider the potentially high external stresses from the bentonite backfill and this should be addressed in future...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. 1. This review {{considers}} the periodic cycles of species dominance {{in a wide}} selection of temperate lakes. By ascribing individual species to assemblages, a high incidence of similarity among periodic cycles is demonstrated. Reference to lakes at high and low latitudes, as well as to rivers, shows conformity to parts of the same broad patterns. 2. The role of population dynamics in shaping community structure is emphasized. Two types of change are recognized: autogenic, undirectional subsequences (successions), regulated by speeific responses to critically changing resource-ratio gradients; and allogenic changes, regulated by variability in the physical environment. 3. Analysis of the responses of representative species to allogenic change permits further grouping of the assemblages. These groupings coincide with clear morphological distinctions among the same phytoplankton species according to their unit sizes and surface area/volume ratios. 4. It is argued that these properties condition the physiological responses of algae to seasonal variations in temperature, mixing and exposure to the underwater light field. The responses are compounded by relative <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> loss processes (<b>sinking,</b> grazing), by short-term photosynthetic adaptation and vertical migratory behaviour. 5. Graphical summaries are presented that relate the morphologically-, physiologically- and behaviourally-mediated responses to a hierarchy of physical, chemical and biotie environmental variables. Phytoplankton periodicity is the outcome of these interactions...|$|R
