50|$|Already in 1879 Schmiedeberg {{managed to}} isolate this {{carbohydrate}} from the bulb of the <b>red</b> <b>squill</b> (Urginea maritima). He named the substance ’sinistrin’, from the Latin word 'sinister' for left, {{according to its}} optical rotation activities. Sinistrin was also found in mucines of edible snails (Helix pomatia) by Hammarsten in 1885.Today sinistrin is industrially manufactured out of the bulb of <b>red</b> <b>squill</b> by various extraction and purification steps.|$|E
50|$|Drimia maritima (syn. Urginea maritima) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae (formerly the family Hyacinthaceae). This species is known by several common names, including squill, sea squill, sea onion, and maritime squill. It may also be called <b>red</b> <b>squill,</b> particularly a form which produces red-tinged flowers instead of white. It is native to southern Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.|$|E
40|$|<b>Red</b> <b>squill</b> {{has been}} used in rodent control for several hundred years but in the United States its use has {{decreased}} since the 1950 s. However, there is now a recognized need for rodenticides with different kinds of toxic activity. <b>Red</b> <b>squill</b> is being investigated as an acute rodenticide and an economic crop for the southwestern states. Clones from a prior USDA collection have been assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography and selections are being propagated in California and Arizona. The major toxicant, scilliroside, is relatively fast acting, causing convulsions and death to rats and mice. This glycoside is also strongly emetic to humans, cats and dogs, affording a safety factor uncommon to high-toxicity rodenticides. Our chemical, processing, agronomic, and toxicological studies are a technical basis for further developing this potentially superior rodenticide...|$|E
40|$|Shortly {{after the}} passage of the Federal Insecticide Act of 1910, mammal control specialists in the Bureau of Biological Survey began to {{consider}} a similar law to cover the chemicals with which they were concerned. Work on the project went slowly and spasmodically, but reached the point of having a Federal Rodenticide Act available for study and possible revision in 1928. At this time, the mammal control chemicals in use were limited to strychnine [...] alkaloid and sulphate-arsenic, barium carbonate, thallium sulphate, phosphorus, sodium and calcium cyanide, carbon disulphide, and <b>red</b> <b>squill.</b> Strychnine alkaloid was about the only predatory animal control agent, while the alkaloid and thallium sulphate dominated field rodent formulas, and calcium cyanide and carbon disulphide were the only burrow fumigants. That left strychnine sulphate, arsenic, barium carbonate, thallium sulphate, phosphorus, and <b>red</b> <b>squill</b> for rat and mouse control agents. This was not a long list, but it was long enough to have raised many problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{relatively}} recent development of more-effective pulicides has been paralleled {{by the discovery}} of more-efficient rodenticides. Eight of the latter—namely, warfarin, pival, <b>red</b> <b>squill,</b> α-naphthylthiourea (ANTU), zinc phosphide, arsenic trioxide, thallium sulfate, and sodium fluoroacetate (1080) —are discussed with particular reference to the criteria of effectiveness against rodents and relative safety to humans and pets. Although the perfect rodenticide {{has not yet been}} found, the authors consider that, at present, warfarin appears the most successful in domestic-rat control campaigns. However, the true value of warfarin has still to be determined, and in the meantime it is necessary to select the rodenticide and bait which appear to be most appropriate in each case. In addition, the authors point out that, if the initial poisoning has been ineffective, follow-up with a second rodenticide and bait can produce good results...|$|E
40|$|The nutria or coypu, Myocastor coypus, {{is a large}} {{semi-aquatic}} rodent that superficially resembles {{an overgrown}} muskrat or a stunted beaver. They were introduced into Oregon from about 1930 to the 195 O 2 ̆ 7 s. At one time Oregon had more than 600 fur farmers raising these animals for fur; now there are none. Some animals escaped and many others were released into the wild when {{it became apparent that}} pelt values were nonexistent and production costs greatly exceeded profits. Being prolific and quite mobile the nutria quickly spread through much of western Oregon. By the 19602 ̆ 7 s damage to agricultural crops was common to severe in western Oregon. Crops damaged included seed, grain, forage, hay and trees. Burrowing damage to stream banks, field borders and farm ponds was reported in many areas. Growth and reproduction data for Oregon nutria are included. Methods for controlling feral nutria including the use of prolin, <b>red</b> <b>squill,</b> strychnine alkaloid and zinc phosphide are reported. Fur trapping and adverse weather as factors in population reduction are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) is {{a stocky}} {{burrowing}} rodent, unintentionally introduced into North America by settlers who arrived on ships from Europe. Also called the brown rat, house rat, barn rat, sewer rat, gray rat, or wharf rat, it is a slightly larger animal than the roof rat (Fig. 2). Adult Norway rats weigh {{an average of}} 1 pound (454 g). Their fur is coarse and usually brownish or reddish gray above and whitish gray on the belly. Blackish individuals occur in some locations. Among the diseases rats may transmit to humans or livestock are murine typhus, leptospirosis, trichinosis, salmonellosis (food poisoning), and ratbite fever. Plague is a disease that can be carried {{by a variety of}} rodents, but it is more commonly associated with roof rats (Rattus rattus) than with Norway rats.

40|$|The {{history of}} rodent control {{programs}} in New York State is reviewed, beginning with state-funded efforts in August, 1967. In 1969, Federal rodent control grant funds {{were used to}} establish four Model Cities programs. At its peak in 1970, programs were active in 18 counties, eight cities and villages, and in six Model Cities areas. The program encompasses all the major metropolitan areas of the state, serving some nine million persons. As {{part of the state}} program, the Rodent Control Evaluation Laboratory was established to investigate chemosterilants as a means of rodent control and to develop knowledge of pest rodent biology. Since then, the investigations program has turned to the problem of rodent resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides both in New York and other states in the eastern United States. Initial rat infestations, which ran 24. 4 percent statewide in 1969, have been decreased 84 percent by late 1973. Similarly, in the same time period, unapproved refuse storage deficiencies were decreased 55. 6 percent and exposed garbage conditions declined 44. 7 percent. Rat bites showed a 40 percent decrease during these same years. By all measures, then, the program has been a success. Most programs have relied heavily upon anticoagulant rodenticides in the chemical control or rodent populations. Zinc phosphide, <b>red</b> <b>squill,</b> and norbormide are also used. Harborage removal and environmental improvement are stressed through active cleanups and educational efforts. During the four-year period, 1969 - 1972, some 177, 000 tons of rat harborage were removed from 66, 000 premises in the state...|$|E

CALIFORNIA VERTEBRATE PEST CONFERENCE WONDER CHEMICALS The only wonder is that EPA still permits us to use any chemicals for controlling vertebrate animal damage. Anderson called Secretary Andrus a 2 ̆ 2 cuttlefish 2 ̆ 2 as the latter is as adept at squirting ink to hide his operations as is the marine squid. Anderson has documented some very questionable, Mafia-linked practices by Andrus when he was govenor of Idaho. Jack Anderson Andrus: Annoyed By Stories Of Past One of the immediate effects of Andrus selling out to the environmentalists has been the loss of a potentially effective tool incontroliing livestock depredation - - the 1080 toxic collar. A laboratory-field study of multiple-catch mouse traps - - 2 ̆ 2 Tin Cat 2 ̆ 2 ™ (Woodstream Corp.) and 2 ̆ 2 Ketch-all 2 ̆ 2 l|v 1 (Kness Mfg.
