50|$|Symptoms of <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> include <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> in patches {{usually in}} {{circular}} patterns, dandruff, skin lesions, and scarring. Alopecia areata (mild - medium level) usually shows in unusual <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> areas e.g. eyebrows, backside {{of the head}} or above the ears where usually the male pattern baldness does not affect. In male-pattern <b>hair</b> <b>loss,</b> loss and thinning begin at the temples and the crown and either thins out or falls out. Female-pattern <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> occurs at the frontal and parietal.|$|R

40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>loss</b> {{has been}} ranked {{as a source}} of {{considerable}} distress and may add to the losses associated with the experience of cancer. Chemotherapy-induced <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> (alopecia) is a public consequence of the non-selective action of specific antineoplastic agents on healthy tissue. The literature demonstrates a lack of research on <b>hair</b> <b>loss.</b> Nursing studies have focused on efforts to prevent <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> or measure the impact of <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> using body-image instruments. The {{purpose of this study was}} the detailed examination of the meanings of <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> over time in a sample of women receiving alopecia-inducing cancer chemotherapy. ^ A qualitative descriptive design using a semi-structured multiple interview format examined the meaning of <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> over time. A purposive sample of ten women receiving alopecia-inducing chemotherapeutic agents at a metropolitan teaching hospital was used. Each woman was interviewed prior to <b>hair</b> <b>loss,</b> at the time of <b>hair</b> <b>loss,</b> and two-three months after initial <b>hair</b> <b>loss.</b> The specific research questions described the meanings of <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> in the lives of women receiving alopecia-inducing agents. Supporting questions explored the status of <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> among sources of cancer-related distress, the role of past experiences and expectations, and the role of other people and social demands on the experiences. Data analysis was based upon the words, metaphors, and language patterns used by participants in describing their feelings and experiences. ^ Findings reflect the meaning and real substantive losses associated with both the threat and actual <b>hair</b> <b>loss.</b> Symptom responses are shaped by personal history, experiences as well as meanings of cancer images and one 2 ̆ 7 s hair. Analysis of the findings reflect three processes: affective anticipation rehearsal, confrontation of the <b>hair</b> <b>losses,</b> and management of the <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> experience. The coping outcomes may be positive, regaining one 2 ̆ 7 s stride, or negative, not regaining one 2 ̆ 7 s stride. The findings are congruent with a number of theoretical frameworks, such as Lazarus, Benner, Mishel and Wright. The findings support both the significance of <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> and its amenability to nursing treatment approaches. Nurses have the opportunity to explore the meanings of <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> with an individual and to lessen the distress associated with the threat and actual impact of that experience. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Alopecia (<b>hair</b> <b>loss,</b> shedding) is a {{disregulation}} of {{the balance}} between <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> and its regrowth. Non-scarring alopecia leads to <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> without destroying <b>hair</b> follicles. In our culture hair {{is a sign of}} attractiveness, strength and success. Numerous studies suggested significantly deleterious effect of alopecia on patient's psychic well-being. Aim of the study: The aim of the study was assessment of quality of life in patients with different types of non-scarring alopecia based on Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Material and methods: The study comprised 60 patients with <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> treated at the Dermatology Outpatient Clinic at the Department of General, Esthetic Dermatology and Dermatosurgery of the Medical University of Łodź since January 2007 to February 2009. In order to evaluate quality of life in patients with different types of non-scarring alopecia we used the Polish version of the DLQI. Results: Excessive <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> has been found to have a moderate or significant effect on quality of life in patients with alopecia. The differences in subjective assessment of the influence of the excessive <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> on patients' quality of life were not statistically significant according to the sex and type of <b>hair</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|R
