60|$|But it {{must have}} {{appeared}} that its most characteristic feature was the absence of everybody he knew. This {{was one of the}} things that commended Boston to Bromfield Corey during the summer; and if his son had any qualms about the life he had entered upon with such vigour, {{it must have}} been a relief to him that there was scarcely a soul left to wonder or pity. By the time people got back to town the fact of his connection with the mineral paint man would be an old story, heard afar off with different degrees of surprise, and considered with different degrees of indifference. A man has not reached the age of twenty-six in any community where he was born and reared without having had his capacity pretty well ascertained; and in Boston the analysis is conducted with an unsparing thoroughness which may fitly impress the un-Bostonian mind, darkened by the popular superstition that the Bostonians blindly admire one another. A man's qualities are sifted as closely in Boston as they doubtless were in Florence or Athens; and, if final mercy was shown in those cities because a man was, with all his limitations, an Athenian or Florentine, some abatement might as justly be made in Boston for like reason. Corey's powers had been gauged in college, and he had not given his world reason to think very differently of him since he came out of college. He was rated as an energetic fellow, a little indefinite in aim, with the smallest amount of inspiration that can save a man from being commonplace. If he was not commonplace, it was through nothing remarkable in his mind, which was simply clear and practical, but through some combination of qualities of the heart that made men trust him, and women call him sweet--a word of theirs which conveys otherwise indefinable excellences. Some of the more nervous and excitable said that Tom Corey was as sweet as he could live; but this perhaps meant no more than the word alone. No man ever had a son less like him than Bromfield Corey. If Tom Corey had ever said a witty thing, no one could remember it; and yet the father had never said a witty thing to a more sympathetic listener than his own son. The clear mind which produced nothing but practical results reflected everything with charming lucidity; and it must have been this which endeared Tom Corey to every one who spoke ten words with him. In a city where people have good reason for liking to shine, a man who did not care to shine must be little short of universally acceptable without any other effort for popularity; and those who admired and enjoyed Bromfield Corey loved his son. Yet, when it came to accounting for Tom Corey, as it often did in a community where every one's generation is known to the remotest degrees of cousinship, they could not trace his sweetness to his mother, for neither Anna Bellingham nor any of her family, though they were so many blocks of Wenham ice for purity and <b>rectangularity,</b> had ever had any such savour; and, in fact, it was to his father, whose habit of talk wronged it in himself, that they had to turn for this quality of the son's. They traced to the mother the traits of practicality and common-sense in which he bordered upon the commonplace, and which, when they had dwelt upon them, made him seem hardly worth the close inquiry they had given him.|$|E

Traditional Swedish forestry practices include planting trees at evenly spaced rectangularities {{in order to}} maximize nutrient and light availability to individual trees, minimize branch diameter, and to encourage good stem form. In 1982, a study using Lodgepole pine was established to evaluate any differences in growth characteristics between planting rectangularities. This research study is a completely randomized block design <b>rectangularity</b> study where lodgepole pine was planted in three replications at five different rectangularities (0. 8 x 5 m, 1 x 4 m, 1. 33 x 3 m, 1. 46 x 1. 46 x 4 m, and 2 x 2 m) all at the same planting density of 2500 trees/hectare.

In the present work the morphometry (circularity, <b>rectangularity,</b> form factor, OL/OW and ellipticity indices) and chemistry (Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, Zn:Ca) of lapilli otolith, and geometric morphometry of scales of streaked prochilod juveniles, in two sites in the Plata basin (Uruguay River and Estrella Wetland), were compared {{to determine if they}} are area-specific and to identify possible breeding areas. Otolith Ba:Ca ratios was 0. 017 ± 0. 003 mmol/mol for Uruguay River while for Estrella Wetland individuals was bellow the detection limits. Zn:Ca ratios tended to be higher for the latter (0. 03 ± 0. 002 mmol/mol). Significantly high circularity and low <b>rectangularity</b> values were obtained for Estrella Wetland otoliths (p < 0. 05), while no significant differences for form factor, OL/OW and ellipticity were observed between sampling sites. Considering all scale geometric morphometry variables, discriminant analysis showed a good percentage of classification of individuals (90. 5 % for Estrella Wetland and 85. 7 % for Uruguay River). These results indicate that the otolith microchemisty and morphometry (circularity and <b>rectangularity</b> indices) and scale morphometry are good markers of habitat and represent a potential tool for identification of streaked prochilod nursery areas...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a feature useful for detection of structures in {{images that are}} perceived as approximate rectangular contours. Given a set of extracted line segments, this <b>rectangularity</b> feature quantifies the degree of alignment of an optimal subset with a contour of rectangular shape, arbitrary size, and aspect ratio. The <b>rectangularity</b> feature has high values not only for perfect rectangles, but also for rectangles with distorted angles, fragmented, or with a completely missing side. However, it has zero response for configurations of lines that do not form at least three sides of a rectangular contour. This feature {{is based on a}} graph with nodes corresponding to line segments in a particular neighborhood and with edges encoding spatial relations between the lines.

40|$|When {{sawn timber}} is planed, the timber is {{to some extent}} {{flattened}} by the feeding rollers and other pressure elements inside the planer, with the plank middle affected {{to a greater degree}} than the top and butt end. As a result, any twist present in rough timber influences the planing process in the proximity of the latter two areas. This is manifested primarily as reduced <b>rectangularity</b> in the affected zones of the planed timber, but also as an increased risk of planer misses. One way to avoid these unwanted features in the end product is to plane an excess length of timber, then cross-cutting to the required final length after planing. This study found low <b>rectangularity</b> to be a larger problem than planer misses, with the top end most affected. The study also indicates that simple models could be used to predict the size of the zone affected by twisting near the ends of planed timber, and thus also the length that must be removed in order to produce an acceptable cross-sectional shape throughout the length of planed timber.

40|$|Although planers {{and wood}} {{machining}} {{researchers have been}} around a long time, the interactions between planks and planers have been neglected in basic research. With a solid understanding of the movements of planks during planing, planers and planing strategies can be developed to reduce waste and improve the value yield. Cutting depths, changes in the amount of warp and cross-sectional shape were used to analyse the movements of the planks during planing, the alignment between the planks cross-sections and planers cutters and the improvement potential. The feeding roller in the planer intake had most control over the plank motion. Apart from cup reduction, the parts mostly affected by planing were the top and the butt end, where twist-induced misalignment between the cross-sections and the planers cutters resulted in skewed cross-sections and reduced <b>rectangularity.</b> By adjusting the cutting depths and in some cases the sawing oversize, planer misses could have been avoided but improvements in <b>rectangularity</b> would have required changes in the planer setting or planer design. This thesis increases the knowledge on how a 4 -side planer works together with warp to affect 50 × 150 mm planks. For the 20 planks used in this study, the planer removed cup, it decreased the amount of twist and crook but had no effect on bow. The major factor reducing the <b>rectangularity</b> of the planed planks was twist. In the future, knowledge derived from this thesis can be used to create a simulation tool to model the behaviour of warped planks in a planer.
