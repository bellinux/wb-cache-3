It effects almost every decision throughout implementation of data warehouse or business intelligence system. Currently, there are no standardization of user <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> approaches had been outlined and this leads to complexity in data warehouse design. Various <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> approaches have been proposed. However, data warehouse designer unable to choose which approach most suitable to be adapted in their project. This paper review various user <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> approaches that been classified into four categories; data-driven approach, user driven approach, goal driven approach and mixed driven approach. It also outlines their strengths and weaknesses within different contexts.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the determinants for getting information requirements right, cognitive {{research has been conducted}} to study the process of information <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis.</b> As a result, three important determinants for the correctness of requirement specifications have been identified: the knowledge of information analysts, <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques, and problem domains. In {{order to identify}} and explain the important variables for the correctness of requirement specifications, various cognitive models have been built on the basis of different cognitive theories such as normative models, problem solving models, mental models, and comprehension models. However, they are inadequate because they are focused on some rather than all of the three determinants. As a result, two issues related to <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques cannot be accounted for: First, no <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> technique can consistently outperform the others. Second, experienced information analysts use multiple <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques in analyzing complex information systems. This research suggests that an adequate cognitive model need to meet two requirements: first, it can explicate the interactive relationships among the three determinants of information <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis,</b> and second, it can explain the two unsolved issues for <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques The importance of an adequate cognitive model can be shown in four aspects: (1) it provides an adequate model for information requirement analysis; (2) it provides a basis for empirical validation; (3) it provides a framework for viewing and comparing important aspects of information requirement analysis; and (4) it provides a theoretical basis for the design of computer-aided software engineering tools...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Communication failure between IT {{experts and}} end users {{who are not}} {{computer}} – oriented leads to unsuccessful and chaotic <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis.</b> The Use Case approach, {{even if it is}} a tested and useful UML method, is not enough for the completion of <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis,</b> since the workflow is not present at Use Case Diagrams. BORM methodology which is also tested in real – life projects for <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> on a business level, comes to cover the weaknesses of the Use Case approach, but fails in terms of standard definition of the business process workflow steps. The proposed new and modern method to business process <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis,</b> is based on the transition from Use Case methodology to BORM approach and is entitled as Use Case To BORM Transformation Algorithm (UCBTA). The construction of the algorithm is based on the nondeterministic finite automaton theory. The method aims to cover the gaps of the two aforementioned approaches by ensuring timely IT project termination since no task repetition caused by <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> miscommunication will be required after its implementation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the de-facto {{standard}} modeling {{language for}} the development of software with broad ranges of applications. It supports for modeling a software at different stages during its development: <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis,</b> design and implementation. The use of UML encourages software developers to devote more effort on <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> and modeling to produce better software products. The most important models to produce in an object-oriented <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> are a conceptual class models and a use-case models. This paper proposes a method to combine these two models by using a classic transition system. Then we can reason about and refine such systems with well established methods and tools...|$|R

However, there is no cognitive process model available for explaining the interactions among the three factors: knowledge, modeling behaviors, {{and the quality of}} requirement specifications. On the basis of structure-mapping model of analogy, this article proposes a cognitive process model that views information <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> as a process of conceptual mapping from the base structures (i. e., the knowledge structures of <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques) to the target structures (i. e., the knowledge structures o...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturers {{of complex}} {{engineering}} systems are increasingly recognising {{the importance of}} identifying, understanding and satisfying stakeholders??? needs {{in order to produce}} high-quality products. The analysis of these needs into a formal requirement specification is a time consuming and complex process for which little support is offered to design engineers. This can result in requirements being poorly documented and with little or no traceability to their origins. This dissertation reports an investigation to understand the process of <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> and develop computational support for this important phase of the engineering design process. The key argument of this research is that the existing practice of <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> can be improved by providing better support for requirement rationale capture and enabling greater requirement traceability. The research consisted of three main phases. In the first phase, literature related to the <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> was reviewed and {{led to the creation of}} a <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> model. In the second phase, the practices of a global engineering organisation were investigated using document analysis as well as interviews with and shadowing of company engineers. The research found that <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> lacks support for requirement rationale capture and traceability. On the basis of this result, a workflow for <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> was proposed. The workflow involves the use of the Decision Rationale editor tool to capture requirement rationale and enable requirement traceability. In the third phase, four studies were undertaken to validate the workflow. These studies investigated: 1) application of the workflow to requirements generated through reverse-engineering a low-complexity consumer product; 2) requirements extracted from documents produced by a graduate engineering team during a twelve-week project; 3) the <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> process undertaken by two graduate engineering teams during twelve-week projects; and 4) requirements for a new aircraft engine development programme. The studies showed that the proposed workflow is feasible, practical, and scalable when applied to engineering projects. Requirement rationales were classified into categories, namely product design and use, pre-existing rationale, and project management. In order to fully support requirement traceability, it was found that it is important to make traceable four types of requirement transformations: newly introduced, copied, updated, and deleted requirements. The research demonstrated that the proposed workflow is a successful proof-of-concept and can lead to improved quality of requirement documentation and requirement traceability. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Informal {{interactions}} with clients {{are prone to}} errors in interpretation and communication which can later result in errors in the ensuing requirements models. Resolving such errors early can prevent rework or {{the building of a}} system that is non-compliant with the client 2 ̆ 7 s intention. In developing complex systems and highly interactive systems, such as agent oriented systems, those errors in <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis</b> are even more likely. By focussing on the quality of interactions between the future users of the system and the human modellers, this article presents an innovative validation and verification process to support <b>analysis</b> of <b>requirement</b> <b>analysis.</b> We use domain knowledge to validate compliance with the client 2 ̆ 7 s intention. Using layered abstractions, we formulate the validation process which is methodology independent.
