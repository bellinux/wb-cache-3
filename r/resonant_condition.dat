When the input light meets the resonance condition of the first ring, it will couple into the ring and travel around inside of it. As subsequent loops around the first ring bring the light to the resonance condition of the second ring, the two rings will be coupled together and the light will be passed into the second ring.

40|$|The linearzition {{solution}} of averaged resonant equations for planar circular restricted three-body problem with non-gravitational effect is derived. The solution {{is derived from}} Lagrange's planetary equations with added terms in order to include of the non-gravitational effects. The solution has the standard form with time dependence in exponential, quadratic, linear and constant terms. We investigate how well the linearization solution describes real solution obtained from equation of motion by a comparison of frequency found analytically and numerically. Since differential equations describing the evolution in the mean motion resonance are averaged, applicability of linearization solution depends on the averaging. Usual assumption is that the orbit of dust particle does not change during of the averaging. The assumption implies for the mean motion resonances that the applicability of linearization solution describes the real evolution with best accordance close to the {{solution of}} <b>resonant</b> <b>condition</b> ($da / dt$ $=$ 0). At the solution of <b>resonant</b> <b>condition</b> is the semimajor axis maximal or minimal and the resonant angular variable has approximately linear time dependence in the libration period. The variations of orbital elements except that of the semimajor axis at the solution of <b>resonant</b> <b>condition</b> shifts the best accordance from the maxima or mimima of the semimajor axis. If the initial condition are chosen close to the <b>resonant</b> <b>condition</b> (maximum of minimum of the smimajor axis in the evolution), then practically all simple oscillatory evolutions can be suitable well approximated. Due to this property "frequencies" of stationary solutions can be determined from the linearization solution. Comment: 27 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a mechanism of spin transfer between individual quantum dots {{that does not}} require tunneling. Incident circularly-polarized photons create inter-band excitons with non-zero electron spin in the first quantum dot. When the quantum-dot pair is properly designed, this excitation can {{be transferred to the}} neighboring dot via the Coulomb interaction with either conservation or flipping of the electron spin. The second dot can radiate circularly-polarized photons at lower energy. Selection rules for spin transfer are determined by the <b>resonant</b> <b>conditions</b> and by the strong spin-orbit interaction in the valence band of nanocrystals. Coulomb-induced energy and spin transfer in pairs and chains of dots can become very efficient under <b>resonant</b> <b>conditions.</b> The electron can preserve its spin orientation even in randomly-oriented nanocrystals.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} symmetric wave propagations in asymmetric nonlinear quantum systems. By {{solving the}} nonlinear Schördinger equation, we first analytically prove {{the existence of}} symmetric transmission in asymmetric systems with a single nonlinear delta-function interface. We then point out that a finite width of the nonlinear interface region is necessary to produce non-reciprocity in asymmetric systems. However, a geometrical <b>resonant</b> <b>condition</b> for breaking non-reciprocal propagation is then identified theoretically and verified numerically. With such a <b>resonant</b> <b>condition,</b> the nonlinear interface region of finite width behaves like a single nonlinear delta-barrier so that wave propagations in the forward and backward directions are identical under arbitrary incident wave intensity. As such, reciprocity re-emerges periodically in the asymmetric nonlinear system when changing the width of interface region. Finally, similar resonant conditions of discrete nonlinear Schördinger equation are discussed. Therefore, we have identified instances of Reciprocity Theorem that breaking spatial symmetry in nonlinear interface systems {{is not sufficient to}} produce non-reciprocal wave propagation.
