5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>deviation</b> (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins.

It obtains the TCWV for cloud-free scenes above land at a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km and provides uncertainties on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The algorithm has been extended by introducing empirical correction coefficients for the transmittance calculation within the forward operator.

Nearly half of the amide protons involved in hydrogen bonds in solution show no measurable protection from exchange in water, cautioning against a direct correspondence between hydrogen bonding and hydrogen exchange protection.

40|$|Abstract. Protein {{structure}} {{analysis is}} one of the most important research issues in the post-genomic era, and faster and more accurate query data structures for such 3 -D structures are highly desired for research on proteins. This paper proposes a new data structure for indexing protein 3 -D structures. For strings, there are many efficient indexing structures such as suffix trees, but it has been considered very difficult to design such sophisticated data structures against 3 -D structures like proteins. Our index structure is based on the suffix trees and is called the geometric suffix tree. By using the geometric suffix tree for a set of protein structures, we can search for all of their substructures whose RMSDs (<b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>deviations)</b> or URMSDs (unit-vector <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>deviations)</b> to a given query 3 -D structure are not larger than a given bound. Though there are O(N 2) substructures, our data structure requires only O(N) space where N is the sum of lengths of the set of proteins. We propose an O(N 2) construction algorithm for it, while a naive algorithm would require O(N 3) time to construct it. Moreover we propose an efficient search algorithm. We also show computational experiments to demonstrate the practicality of our data structure. The experiments show that the construction time of the geometric suffix tree is practically almost linear to the size of the database, when applied to a protein structure database. ...|$|R
