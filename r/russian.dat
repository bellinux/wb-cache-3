5|$|A naval {{confrontation}} {{took place}} between <b>Russian</b> and Georgian ships on 10 August. According to the <b>Russian</b> Ministry of Defence, the <b>Russian</b> navy sank one Georgian vessel after four Georgian missile boats had attacked the <b>Russian</b> Navy ships {{off the coast of}} Abkhazia. The <b>Russian</b> patrol ship Mirazh was probably responsible for the sinking. The Georgian coast was blockaded by vessels of the <b>Russian</b> Black Sea Fleet on 10 August. The Black Sea Fleet, which participated in the military conflict {{for the first time since}} 1945, had probably departed from Sevastopol before full-scale hostilities between Russia and Georgia began.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>Russian</b> expert Anton Lavrov, on 8 August, <b>Russian</b> and South Ossetian troops {{deployed}} in South Ossetia were unaware that <b>Russian</b> aviation {{was involved in}} the war. <b>Russian</b> troops and South Ossetians often assessed <b>Russian</b> aircraft as hostile and fired at them before precise identification took place. On 8 August, the air force performed 63 flights in support of <b>Russian</b> ground troops. A total of six <b>Russian</b> aircraft were lost during the war: one Su-25SM, two Su-25BMs, two Su-24Ms and one Tu-22M3; friendly fire was the cause of the downing of three planes. Lavrov denies that the downed Tu-22M was used for reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|After half an {{hour the}} Russians finally stormed the ramparts of Fort 74 and {{defeated}} the Polish battalion defending it. This forced the Polish mobile artillery in Czyste, until then shelling the advancing <b>Russian</b> columns and their Grand Battery, to fall back. Meanwhile, the <b>Russian</b> right column was approaching Fort 72. Defended by only 200 men, the fort was approached by the <b>Russian</b> spearhead formed by the reinforced Nieśwież Regiment. Seeing this, the Polish commander ordered his cavalry reserve to charge the <b>Russian</b> infantry. <b>Russian</b> grenadiers stormed the ramparts of Fort 72, but were repelled and forced back behind the moat, where the Polish cavalry charged them. The Russians formed infantry squares, but were defeated and forced to retreat. To counter the threat to <b>Russian</b> infantry, General Nostitz charged his own cavalry reserve under General Georg von Sass, and a cavalry battle ensued.|$|E

50|$|That evening, {{hundreds}} of Aleut men gathered {{on a mountain}} and marched to the Russians' houses. When five <b>Russians</b> opened fire, the Aleuts ran away.

As <b>Russians</b> opened fire, they started to run away again. After they ran, the <b>Russians</b> noticed that all the men had left the village. The <b>Russians</b> took around 40 women and children hostage, forcing the Aleut to surrender. The <b>Russians</b> killed four Aleut leaders.|$|R
5000|$|The modern <b>Russians</b> {{formed from}} {{two groups of}} East Slavic tribes: Northern and Southern. The tribes {{involved}} included the Krivichs, Ilmen Slavs, Radimichs, Vyatiches and Severians. Genetic studies show that modern <b>Russians</b> do not differ significantly from Belarusians and Ukrainians. Some ethnographers, like Zelenin, affirm that <b>Russians</b> are more similar to Belarusians and to Ukrainians than southern <b>Russians</b> are to northern <b>Russians.</b> <b>Russians</b> in northern European Russia share moderate genetic similarities with Uralic peoples, who lived in modern north-central European Russia and were partly assimilated by the Slavs as the Slavs migrated northeastwards. Such Uralic peoples included the Merya and the Muromians.|$|R
5|$|In the end, the <b>Russian</b> {{declaration}} of war {{came as a surprise}} to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, who had not been informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial <b>Russian</b> Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official <b>Russian</b> proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by <b>Russian</b> apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the <b>Russian</b> road was the country's only choice.|$|E

On 22 August, <b>Russian</b> forces withdrew from Igoeti and the Georgian police proceeded towards Gori. Russia claimed that its military withdrawal was completed; however, <b>Russian</b> checkpoints remained near Gori and two <b>Russian</b> lookout stations remained near Poti. On 13 September, <b>Russian</b> troops began withdrawing from western Georgia and by 11:00 Moscow Time, the posts near Poti were abandoned.

5|$|Poti is {{the crucial}} port of Georgia on the Black Sea {{and serves as}} an {{essential}} entry point for Transcaucasia and the landlocked nations of Central Asia. <b>Russian</b> aircraft attacked the town of Poti on 8 August, causing a two-day shutdown of the port. Russia positioned ships {{in the vicinity of}} Poti and other Georgian ports on 10 August 2008. The next day, Georgian and <b>Russian</b> representatives said that <b>Russian</b> troops were in Poti, although Russia claimed it had only sent a task force for surveying the area. On 13 August, six Georgian naval vessels were sunk by <b>Russian</b> troops in Poti. <b>Russian</b> deputy chief of the General staff, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, denied the <b>Russian</b> presence in Poti the following day. One day after Russia's declaration of the beginning of the withdrawal from Georgia, 70 <b>Russian</b> soldiers moved into the port on the morning of 19 August. <b>Russian</b> forces took twenty-one Georgian soldiers prisoner and grabbed five US Humvees in Poti, taking them to a military base occupied by <b>Russian</b> troops in Senaki. The Wall Street Journal said that <b>Russian</b> actions in Poti constituted an additional attack on Georgian economy. <b>Russian</b> military was looting and damaging properties during their presence in Poti, even ransacking toilets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Russian</b> and {{a number}} of other {{immigrant}} languages are widely used in Israel, because ethnic Jews from dozens of countries from all around the world have settled in the area. <b>Russian</b> is the major immigrant language of Jews living in Israel.

5|$|Shein's army {{retreated to}} its main camp, {{which was in}} turn {{surrounded}} by Commonwealth forces in mid-October. The besieged Russians waited for relief, but none arrived, as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry {{had been sent to}} disrupt the <b>Russian</b> rear. Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the <b>Russian</b> camp as responsible for their inaction and ineffectiveness (Jasienica blames the <b>Russian</b> warlords, and Parker the foreign mercenaries). The Tatar invasion threatening the south <b>Russian</b> borderlands was a contributory factor, with many soldiers and boyars from those regions deserting the <b>Russian</b> camp to return to protect their homes.

5|$|The <b>Russian</b> Civil War {{began after}} the <b>Russian</b> {{provisional}} government collapsed and the Bolshevik party assumed power in October 1917.

Although the Australian government refused to commit forces, many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting. A small number served as advisors to White <b>Russian</b> units with the North <b>Russian</b> Expeditionary Force (NREF). Awaiting repatriation in England, about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force (NRRF), where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed.|$|E
