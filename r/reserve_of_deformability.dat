The test specimens were made with sieved samples of selected grain size ranges of laterite used as fine aggregates to replace sand in normal concrete. Batching was by weight. Three mix ratios of (1 : 1 Â½: 3), (1 : 2 : 4) and (1 : 3 : 6) were used. Water/cement ratio of 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7 and 0. 75 were used for each of the mix ratios. The specimens were tested at curing ages of seven to 28 days. The results showed that there was a corresponding increase in both modulus of elasticity and modulus <b>of</b> <b>deformability</b> <b>of</b> laterized concrete due to increase in curing ages. The mix proportion, compressive strength and water/cement ratio were found to have significant effects on both modulus of elasticity and modulus <b>of</b> <b>deformability</b> <b>of</b> laterized concrete...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{flexural}} {{design of}} reinforced concrete (RC) beams, {{the strength and}} deformability, which are interrelated, {{need to be considered}} simultaneously. However, in current design codes, design of strength is separated with <b>deformability,</b> and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>deformability</b> is independent <b>of</b> some key parameters, like concrete strength, steel yield strength and confinement content. Hence, provisions in current design codes may not provide sufficient deformability for beams, especially when high-strength concrete (HSC) and/or high-strength steel (HSS) are used. In this paper, influences of key factors, including the degree of reinforcement, concrete strength, steel yield strength, compression steel ratio, and confining pressure, are studied based on a theoretical method. An empirical formula for direct evaluation <b>of</b> <b>deformability</b> is proposed. Interrelation between the strength and deformability are plotted in charts. Based on the empirical formula and charts, a new method of beam design called “concurrent flexural strength and deformability design” that would allow both strength and deformability requirements to be considered simultaneously is developed. The method provides engineers with flexibility of using high-strength concrete, adding compression steel or adding confinement to increase <b>deformability</b> <b>of</b> RC beams...|$|R

However, the functional significance of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway, which contributes cell shape changes and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, has yet to be explored in erythrocytes. Therefore, we examined the influence of several activators and inhibitors of Rho/Rho-kinase signaling on human erythrocyte deformability. Materials and Methods: RhoA and ROCK- 2 proteins were studied by western blotting. Influences of 2 Rho-kinase inhibitors, fasudil and y- 27632 (both 10 - 7 to 10 - 4 M), on erythrocyte deformability was determined by ektacytometer at various shear stresses (0 - 30 Pa) in {{the presence or absence of}} a known Rho activator, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, 10 - 5 to 5 x 10 - 5 M, 1 - 15 min).

Prediction <b>of</b> <b>deformability</b> beyond the elastic range {{is important in}} the performance-based design of earthquake-resistant structures.

An experimental system was devised in which normal cells were modified in vitro to induce specific alterations in each factor. Measurements <b>of</b> <b>deformability</b> {{as a function of}} medium osmolality showed characteristic behavior of the modified cells.

We studied complement-coated human erythrocytes and measured surface charge and deformability, two parameters believed {{to be important in}} erythrocyte survival. Erythrocytes were coated with complement by two in vitro techniques: the addition of (a) low ionic strength sucrose, and (b) IgM cold agglutinins. Erythrocytes obtained from three patients with cold agglutinin disease were used as a source of in vivo complement-coated cells. No difference was found in surface charge as measured by electrophoretic mobility between erythrocytes from normal subjects and complement-coated erythrocytes from any of the three sources. When deformability was measured by filtration through 3 -mum polycarbonate sieves, marked decreases in deformability were found in complement-coated erythrocytes. The filtration returned toward control levels by incubating the complement-coated erythrocytes in serum for 1 h and correlated with decreases in immune adherence. Using screen filtration pressure as a measure <b>of</b> <b>deformability,</b> a positive correlation between number of C 3 molecules per erythrocyte and decreased deformability was found.
