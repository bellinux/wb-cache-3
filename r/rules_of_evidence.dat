In enacting Rule 412, Congress 2 ̆ 7 primary purpose was to spare victims of rape the degrading and unwarranted intrusions into intimate details of their private lives that had formerly been common practice in the federal courts. Part I of this comment discusses the background, structure and rationale <b>of</b> Federal <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evidence</b> 412.

25|$|Lastly, if a {{statement}} is being offered for its truth—meaning that its relevance {{depends upon the}} jury believing {{the substance of the}} statement—then it is being offered to prove {{the truth of the matter}} asserted therein.

25|$|There are {{two other}} common misconceptions {{concerning}} the hearsay rule. The first is that hearsay applies only to oral statements. The hearsay rule applies to all out-of-court statements whether oral, written or otherwise. The Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evidence</b> defines a statement as an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct of a person, if the conduct is intended by the person as an assertion.

25|$|Royal decrees are {{the other}} main source of law; but are {{referred}} to as regulations rather than laws because they are subordinate to the Sharia.

25|$|The <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> in sharia courts also {{maintain}} a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony.

In civil cases in some countries, a Muslim woman witness is considered half the worth and reliability than a Muslim man witness. In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of sharia, such as those found in Hanbali madhhab.|$|E
25|$|Appearing {{before some}} {{administrative}} tribunals may feel like appearing in court, but the tribunal's procedure is relatively less formal {{than that of}} a court, and more importantly, the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> are not as strictly observed, so that some evidence that would be inadmissible in a court hearing may be allowed in a tribunal hearing, if relevant to the proceeding.
