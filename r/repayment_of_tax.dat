50|$|An {{argument}} {{about whether the}} teacake is a biscuit or a cake led to an action in the European Court of Justice by British company Marks and Spencer. The UK tax authorities had eventually accepted the company's argument that the teacakes were cakes (biscuits are taxed, cakes are not), but refused to repay most of the VAT. The European court ruled that in principle the tax should be repaid and in a further hearing before the UK Law Lords in 2009, after 13 years of litigation, Marks and Spencer won full <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> they had paid from 1973 to 1994, amounting to £3.5 million.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the concept of presumptions, and in {{particular}} of legal presumptions, in the context <b>of</b> national <b>tax</b> systems (Italy and Belgium) and EU law. The purpose was to investigate the concept of legal presumption under a twofold comparative perspective. After having provided a general overview of the common core concept of presumption in the European context, an insight in the national approach to legal presumptions was given by examining two different national experiences, namely the Italian and Belgian tax systems. At this stage, the Constitutional framework and some of the most interesting and relevant at EU level presumptive measures were explored, with a view to underlining possible divergences and common grounds. The concept of (national) legal presumption was then investigated in the context of EU law, with the attempt to systematize under a uniform perspective a matter which has been traditionally dealt with either from the merely national point of view or, at EU level, through a fragmented form. In this instance, the EU law relevant framework and the most significant EUCJ case-law, in particular in the field of customs duties, VAT, on the issue <b>of</b> the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> levied in breach of EU law and in the area of direct taxation, were examined so as to construe the overall EU approach to national legal presumptions. This was done with the finality of determining if and to what extent a common analytical framework may be identified, from which were extracted certain criteria governing the compatibility of national legal presumptions with EU law. ...|$|R

Its extension to all {{goods and services}} is discussed among the tax policy makers at the national and EU level. Opponents of general reverse-charge argue that this method of VAT collection would completely {{change the nature of}} the VAT system. One of the practical drawbacks of reverse charge is the negative impact on the cash flow of the public budgets. This article quantifies the average monthly financing available to the State thanks to delayed <b>repayments</b> <b>of</b> input <b>tax</b> to VAT payers under the normal VAT system. This amount equals to almost 53 billion CZK and represents the negative impact of the general reverse charge on the cash flow of the public budgets. A change in the deadline for remitting VAT or introducing VAT advances to be paid prior to the final tax payment would reduce the negative influence on public finances...|$|R

The ideal goal of such a refund {{is the creation of}} positive incentives: People will be rewarded when they behave in the wanted way. If, for example they reduce the emission of greenhouse gases or environmentally dangerous pollutants and reduce their Ecological footprint, they get back an ecological bonus (German: Ökobonus), because with the consumption of non-taxed environmentally friendly products, they pay less eco-taxes than the Green-Cheque is per capita: The amount of the eco-bonus is independent from the energy consumption of the individual recipients. In the words of a publication of the European Environment Agency: “A Swiss study (INFRAS/ECOPLAN, 1998), which investigated the economic and social impacts <b>of</b> different energy <b>tax</b> schemes, showed that redistributing revenues {{in the form of a}} per capita bonus is the most progressive option for an Environmental-tax-reform and creates the most beneficial social effects, although it leads to slightly negative effects on economic development.”The <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> steering <b>taxes</b> is often named fiscal subsidy.

The official wording of the German federal government for such a revenue abstinence is [...] "subsidy related matters of fact".|$|R

40|$|Local governments {{routinely}} {{struggle with}} how to provide citizens quality services while keeping tax rates manageable. This challenge is intensified in areas where population is growing most quickly and where neighboring localities are competing to attract newcomers. The need for added investment in infrastructure (schools, roads, water and sewer, etc.) forces municipalities to either take on large amounts of debt, significantly increase tax revenue, or both. Taking on debt saddles future generations with the burden <b>of</b> <b>repayment.</b> Increasing <b>tax</b> revenue {{can be accomplished by}} either attracting more industry to increase the tax base or by increasing tax rates, but either of these approaches tends to threaten the quality of life differentials that likely drove rapid growth. This creates an important and interesting dilemma. While the data and analyses presented in this paper are particular to Union County (and a set of other comparable, fast-growing counties in North Carolina), this case study can provide a valuable blueprint for better understanding how these issues may affect communities in general...|$|R
40|$|I {{study the}} dynamic <b>tax</b> evasion program <b>of</b> a {{household}} with many sources of income. Contrary {{to the previous}} literature, I assume that the detection risk <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> evasion is uncorrelated across these sources. If detection triggers the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> currently and previously evaded taxes, the marginal cost of evasion increases over time and the optimal duration of evasion is positive but finite. With stochastic pre-tax income, the fraction <b>of</b> aggregate <b>taxes</b> evaded remains interior, even if detection triggers duration-independent penalties. The model helps to understand the recent European debate about the cross-border exchange of information about capital income as opposed to taxation at the source. It yields a transparent representation of the revenue and efficiency losses due to tax evasion and highlights various effects <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> policy on evasion.
