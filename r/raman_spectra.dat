5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, <b>Raman</b> <b>spectra</b> are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their <b>Raman</b> <b>spectra.</b>|$|E

25|$|For high-intensity {{continuous}} wave (CW) lasers, SRS {{can be used}} to produce broad bandwidth spectra. This process can also be seen as a special case of four-wave mixing, wherein the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident light by the phonon energies. The initial Raman spectrum is built up with spontaneous emission and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long fibers, higher-order <b>Raman</b> <b>spectra</b> can be generated by using the Raman spectrum as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of intrinsic noise due to the initial spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since this technology easily fits into the fast evolving fiber laser field and there is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e., broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), Raman amplification and spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recent years}} {{manufacturers}} have sought ways of distinguishing their product by supposedly [...] "improving" [...] cubic zirconia. Coating finished CZs {{in a film}} of diamond-like carbon (DLC) is one such innovation, a process using chemical vapor deposition. The resulting material is purportedly harder, more lustrous and more like diamond overall. The coating is thought to quench the excess fire of CZ, while improving its refractive index, thus making it appear more like diamond. Additionally, {{because of the high}} percentage of diamond bonds in the amorphous diamond coating, the finished simulant will show a positive diamond signature in <b>Raman</b> <b>spectra.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 2D {{correlation}} analysis originated from 2D NMR spectroscopy. Isao Noda developed perturbation based 2D spectroscopy in the 1980s. This technique required sinusoidal perturbations to the chemical system under investigation. This {{specific type of}} the applied perturbation severely limited its possible applications. Following research done by several groups of scientists, perturbation based 2D spectroscopy could be developed to a more extended and generalized broader base. Since the development of generalized 2D {{correlation analysis}} in 1993 based on Fourier transformation of the data, 2D correlation analysis gained widespread use. Alternative techniques that were simpler to calculate, for example the disrelation spectrum, were also developed simultaneously. Because of its computational efficiency and simplicity, the Hilbert transform is nowadays used for the calculation of the 2D spectra. To date, 2D correlation analysis {{is used for the}} interpretation of many types of spectroscopic data (including XRF, UV/VIS spectroscopy, fluorescence, infrared, and <b>Raman</b> <b>spectra),</b> although its application is not limited to spectroscopy.|$|E

An additional peak at 958 /cm was also observed in the <b>Raman</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the calcified plaque, which was identical to the characteristic peak at 958 /cm of hydroxyapatite (HA).

30|$|It can be {{also found}} from Fig. 2 that the <b>Raman</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the ZnO {{nanowires}} is slightly asymmetrical {{with respect to}} those of ZnO crystals [20]. This asymmetrical spectrum shape is mainly attributed to the confinement effects of phonons in nanowire samples. The phonons can be confined within the nanosized systems and thus phonons other than those of Brillouin-zone center can {{also contribute to the}} <b>Raman</b> <b>spectrum,</b> which leads to the asymmetrical shapes of the <b>Raman</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Such an asymmetrical shape of the Raman modes associated with the phonon confinement effects in ZnO nano-sized systems are also reported on ZnO nanoparticles [22].|$|R
40|$|An in-situ and {{nondestructive}} {{technique was}} proposed and {{established for the}} study of domain switching in PUT ceramics via observation of <b>Raman</b> <b>spectrum</b> changes based on the Raman light scattering principle and the soft mode theory. A Vickers indent was introduced into the polarized PLZT specimen so that the <b>Raman</b> <b>spectrum</b> change associated with the domain switching as induced either by an applied electric field or by a stress field surrounding the tip of the Vickers indent crack was in-situ measured and studied using this established technique. The relation between the domain switching and the measured <b>Raman</b> <b>spectrum</b> was discussed. It is well demonstrated that this technique can sensitively detect and measure the domain switching via the observation of <b>Raman</b> <b>spectrum</b> changes. The results confirm that <b>Raman</b> <b>spectrum</b> intensity is directly attributed to the change of the polarization direction of the incidence and scattered lights with respect to the direction of the average polarization direction of the domain in the polarized specimen. When the two directions are parallel, the induced polarizability tensor of the specimen would be enhanced and give rise to a higher intensity for Raman scattering light...|$|R
2500|$|Left handed DNA {{was first}} {{discovered}} by Robert Wells and colleagues, during their studies of a repeating polymer of inosine-cytosine. They observed a [...] "reverse" [...] circular dichroism spectrum for such DNAs, and interpreted this (correctly) {{to mean that}} the strands wrapped around {{one another in a}} left handed fashion. The relationship between Z-DNA and the more familiar B-DNA was indicated by the work of Pohl and Jovin, who showed that the ultraviolet circular dichroism of poly(dG-dC) was nearly inverted in 4 M sodium chloride solution. The suspicion that this {{was the result of a}} conversion from B-DNA to Z-DNA was confirmed by examining the <b>raman</b> <b>spectra</b> of these solutions and the Z-DNA crystals. Subsequently, a crystal structure of [...] "Z-DNA" [...] was published which turned out to be the first single-crystal X-ray structure of a DNA fragment (a self-complementary DNA hexamer d(CG)3). It was resolved as a left-handed double helix with two anti-parallel chains that were held together by Watson-Crick base pairs (see: x-ray crystallography). It was solved by Andrew Wang, Alexander Rich, and co-workers in 1979 at MIT. The crystallisation of a B- to Z-DNA junction in 2005 provided a better understanding of the potential role Z-DNA plays in cells. Whenever a segment of Z-DNA forms, there must be B-Z junctions at its two ends, interfacing it to the B-form of DNA found in the rest of the genome.|$|E

However, the vibrational frequencies of Fe-AlPO 4 - 5 are higher than those of Fe-ZSM- 5 because of the higher force constant of oxygen in Al-O-P than in Si-O-Si. Furthermore, the effect of the electrostatic attraction between the PO 4 tetrahedron and the AlO 4 tetrahedron is found to be important to the vibrational frequencies...|$|R
