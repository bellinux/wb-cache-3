The models described are those used in the Spectrum Orbit Utilization Program (SOUP) analysis. The geometric relationships necessary to model broadcasting satellite systems are discussed. Antenna models represent copolarized and cross polarized performance as functions of the off axis angle. The protection ratio is modelled as a co-channel value and a template representing systems with frequency offsets...|$|R

Given the requirements for direct broadcast service by the administrations, the conference delegates (1) developed the appropriate technical parameters; (2) made tentative assignments to the orbit locations, frequencies, and polarizations of space stations, (3) calculated the interferences and margins of such assignments through the use of the Spectrum Orbit Utilization Program (SOUP); and (4) iterated this procedure until an acceptable plan was found...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of recent studies by the Feeder Link Sub-Working Group of the FCC Advisory Committee for the 1983 <b>Regional</b> <b>Administrative</b> Radio <b>Conference</b> (RARC). These studies conclude that specification of a few key parameters will make feeder link planning relatively straightforward. Feeder links can be located anywhere within a country if satellite orbit locations are separated by 10 deg for adjacent service areas and key parameter values presented in the paper are adopted. Colocated satellites serving a common service area need special attention to attain sufficient isolation between a desired channel and its adjacent cross-polarized channels and alternate co-polarized channels. In addition to presenting planning conclusions by the Advisory Committee, the paper presents and analyzes actions of the International Radio Consultative Committee's Conference Planning Meeting (CPM) concerning feeder links. The CPM reached conclusions similar to, and compatible with, those of the Advisory Committee...|$|R

The <b>Regional</b> <b>Administrative</b> Decentralization is a method of {{administrative}} action, which focused {{on the distribution of}} competences of the administrative function between the central authority and the local entities. The <b>regional</b> <b>administrative</b> decentralization leads to the application of democratic principles by enabling local people to manage their own affairs and they participate in decision-making, in addition to allowing minorities to choose their representatives to participate in decision-making, which helps in the unity of the country. As well as, the <b>regional</b> <b>administrative</b> decentralization helps to reduce routine and improve the delivery of public services. However, there are several obstacles to the implementation of administrative decentralization are the lack of experience of the local entities and the lack of financial resources as well as accountability. In addition to the fear of division in countries that consist of multiple nationalities and religions. Some countries such as France implemented the administrative decentralization in stages. France succeeded in decentralization in stages since 1982, but the decentralization experiment {{at the beginning of the}} French Revolution in 1789 failed when implemented it directly. So, the researcher believes the gradual implementation the best method for getting the advantages of the <b>regional</b> <b>administrative</b> decentralization and avoid the obstacles, for several reasons...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, parties {{interested}} in rulemaking by federal agencies {{were forced to}} voice their views primarily through adversarial procedures. An alternative, negotiated rulemaking, was proposed by the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Conference</b> of the United States (ACUS) in 1982. Since then, negotiated rulemaking has been used four times by federal agencies. The four completed negotiations show that negotiated rulemaking permits affected interests to retain greater control over the content of agency rules, while ensuring fairness and balance. It also permits agencies to obtain a more accurate perception of {{the costs and benefits}} of policy alternatives than can be obtained from digesting voluminous records of testimonial and documentary evidence presented in adversarial hearings. This article summarizes the results of a recently completed report prepared by the author for the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Conference.</b> It reviews the genesis of negotiated rulemaking, presents a framework within which to understand dynamics of the negotiation process and related administrative law issues, and presents recommendations for future agency use of negotiated rulemaking recently adopted in substance by the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Conference.</b> ...|$|R
