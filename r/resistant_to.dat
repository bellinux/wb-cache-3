5|$|Some {{people are}} <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> certain strains of HIV. For example, {{people with the}} CCR5-Δ32 {{mutation}} are <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> infection with R5 virus, as the mutation stops HIV from binding to this coreceptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells.|$|E
5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> demineralization and thus more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more sucrose than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a hybrid of the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.|$|E

30|$|When the {{emergence}} of <b>resistant</b> bacteria <b>to</b> antibiotic has modelled, there are the two basic aspects generally considered. These are within-host models and within-hospital compartmental models. Within-hospital compartmental models are generally SIR models in epidemiology, considering especially how infections will expand throughout the hospital (Ternent et al. 2014). These models are useful to develop strategies {{to prevent the spread}} of <b>resistant</b> individuals <b>to</b> antibiotic in hospital.|$|R
