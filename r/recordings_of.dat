5|$|The first {{commercial}} <b>recordings</b> <b>of</b> Sullivan's music, beginning in 1898, were of individual {{numbers from the}} Savoy operas. In 1917, the Gramophone Company (also known as HMV) produced the first album of a complete musical score of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Mikado, followed by <b>recordings</b> <b>of</b> eight more of the operas. Electrical <b>recordings</b> <b>of</b> the complete musical scores {{of most of the}} operas were then issued by the Gramophone Company and Victor Talking Machine Company beginning in the late 1920s. These recordings were supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce recordings until 1979. Between 1988 and 2003, after the company was revived, it recorded seven of the operas.|$|E

5|$|<b>Recordings</b> <b>of</b> {{excerpts}} from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas began {{to be released in}} 1906. In 1917, the Gramophone Company (also known as HMV) produced the first album of a complete musical score of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Mikado, followed by <b>recordings</b> <b>of</b> eight more of the operas. Electrical <b>recordings</b> <b>of</b> the complete musical scores of most of the operas were then issued by the Gramophone Company and Victor Talking Machine Company beginning in the late 1920s. These recordings were supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte. The original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce well-regarded recordings until 1979, helping to keep the operas popular through the decades. Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD. After the copyrights on the operas expired, other professional companies were free to perform and record the operas. Many performing companies arose to produce the works, such as Gilbert and Sullivan for All in Britain and the Light Opera of Manhattan and Light Opera Works in the U.S., and existing companies, such as English National Opera and Australian Opera added Gilbert and Sullivan to their repertories. These companies also released popular audio and video <b>recordings</b> <b>of</b> the operas. In 1966 and again in the 1980s, BBC Radio presented complete cycles of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas, with dialogue. In 1980, a Broadway and West End production of Pirates produced by Joseph Papp brought new audiences to Gilbert and Sullivan, and between 1988 and 2003, the revived D'Oyly Carte Opera Company revived the operas on tour and on the West End, also recording seven of the operas. A set of eleven of the operas (omitting the last two) was produced in 1982 for television, ten of which are available on VHS and DVD.|$|E
