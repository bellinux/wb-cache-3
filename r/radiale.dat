5|$|A bone {{unique to}} pterosaurs, {{known as the}} pteroid, {{connected}} to the wrist and helped to support a forward membrane (the propatagium) between the wrist and shoulder. Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb suggests that this forward membrane {{may have been more}} extensive than the simple pteroid-to-shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations. The position of the pteroid bone itself has been controversial. Some scientists, notably Matthew Wilkinson, have argued that the pteroid pointed forward, extending the forward membrane. This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett, who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed forward, but rather inward toward the body as traditionally thought. Peters (2009) proposed that the pteroid articulated with the ‘saddle' of the <b>radiale</b> (proximal syncarpal) and both the pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia. This view of the articulation of the pteroid has since been supported by specimens of Changchengopterus pani and Darwinopterus linglongtaensis, both of which show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal.|$|E

This technique is difficult to carry out because it requires high contrasts at short angular separations (10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 10 at ~ 0, 2 ''). During my PhD thesis, I focused on two instruments : the SPICES mission and the VLT/NaCo instrument. SPICES (Spectro-Polarimetric Imaging and Characterization of Exoplanetary Systems) is a project of space coronagraph which aims to characterize in spectro-polarimetry cold exoplanets and faint circumstellar disks (≥ 1 zodi).

SPICES could characterize Jupiters at separations ≤ 5 AU and distances ≤ 10 pc, super-Earths at 1 - 2 AU for a few stars within 4 - 5 pc and possibly Earths around α Centauri A.

40|$|The mean {{intensity}} of the NE Atlantic upwelling system at its northern limit (Galicia, NW Spain) decreased during the last 40 years. At the same time, warming of surface waters was detected. Plankton biomass and composition are expected to reflect such changes when integrated over large time and space scales. In this study, biomass, abundance and species composition of phyto- and zooplankton were analysed to search for significant patterns of annual change and relations with upwelling intensity. Regionally integrated, mostly offshore, data {{were obtained from the}} Continuous Plankton Recorder (since 1958) whereas coastal data from Vigo and A Coruña came from the <b>Radiales</b> program (since 1987). No significant trends were found in phytoplankton biomass at either regional or local scales. However, there was a significant decrease in diatom abundance at regional scales and also of large species at local scales. Zooplankton abundance (mainly copepods) significantly decreased offshore but increased near the coast. Biomass of zooplankton also increased near the coast, with the fastest rates in the south. Warm-water species, like Temora stylifera, were increasingly abundant at both regional and local scales. Significant correlations between upwelling intensity and plankton suggest that climatic effects were delayed for several years. Our results indicate that the effects of large scale climatic trends on plankton communities are being effectively modulated within the pelagic ecosystem in this upwelling region...|$|R

The bone fragments found of this species were indicative of its large size when compared to skeletal measurements from the extant species, Leptoptilos dubius. Due to having heavy bones and a heavy body it is assumed that it rarely, if ever, flew. The thick walled tibiotarsus, constituting the thickest of all other extant and extinct Leptoptilini species, is an unusual feature for flying birds which usually selects for minimum mass. As well as heavier than normal bone structure, measured size ratios suggested that it may have had reduced forelimbs and therefore flight capabilities. The body size was similar in dimension to L. dubius, with the exception of its tibiotarsus. However, the fragmentary nature of the ulna and the carpometacarpus found do not allow an accurate estimate of wingspan length and the question {{as to whether or not}} L. robustus could fly is currently unknown.|$|R

Various plans were drawn up and these contemplated generous aid to facilitate the construction and to compensate for possible exploitation shortfalls. As a result of these conditions a considerable number of proposals were offered, some aimed at bringing prosperity to the less favoured areas while others were orchestrated by wily adventurers in quest of subsidies. However, neither one nor the other succeeded in providing Spain with a subsidiary railway network due to the difficulty of raising sufficient capital to set up the lines. Up to the present time, we know little of the history of the secondary Spanish Railway network and we still lack research on its financing and political relations. The case of Richard Preece Williams is paradigmatic and hence the interest in undertaking its study.

Since 1991, {{shelf and}} slope {{waters of the}} Southern Bay of Biscay are {{regularly}} sampled in a monthly hydrographical section north of Santander to a maximum depth of 2500 m, {{as part of the}} IEO <b>Radiales</b> program. On June 2007, an ocean-meteorological buoy (AGL) was moored at the end of Santander standard section, 22 nm north at 2850 m depth, to complete the ocean information with the ocean-atmosphere interaction. All of them are part of IEO Observing System (1). The integrated system of AGL and its nearest hydrographic station (2600 m depth) is named Biscay-AGL observatory. It is also one station for the EU FixO 3 project. Joint resources and systematic analysis lead to a powerful tool, which is much more than the combination of the AGL buoy and the hydrographical samplings. Data Access. All AGL buoy collected data are added to the local database sited at IEO-Santander in real-time and, after rutinary automatised quality controls, they are immediately available through its dedicated webpage (www. boya_agl. st. ieo. es). Monthly CTDO 2 data from the hydrographic section are lab-calibrated in order to obtain acurated values of salinity, dissolved oxygen and density, and added to the long-term time series. Biscay-AGL data are quality controlled, flagged and formatted according internationally agreed standards (2, 3) and routinely sent to the IEO Datacenter. This added-value controlled data are incorporated to the IEO permanent archive and made freely available through the SeaDataNet infrastructure for data access and discovery. Derived products. Data acquired by Biscay-AGL may be displayed as timeseries as usual, but end-users are benefited by derived products which provide direct information. A recently developed software tool produces not only timeseries of several parameters at different time resolutions but also derived products, both real and delayed time. Derived products from this buoy include, but not only, annual cycles as well as anomalous values, air-sea heat fluxes, salinity and water temperature anomalies, subinertial currents series, chlorophyll surface series, estimations of the mixed layer depth and wind and currents roses. Sensor Web Enablement (SWE). Sensor Web infrastructures are setup to access real-time data observed by sensors. This system has been implemented in AGL buoy sensors in order to simplify the retrieved events and alerts triggered through sensors. All those functionalities of the Sensor Web are provided in an interoperable way, following the standards stablished by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). By defining standardized service interfaces, these services hides the heterogeneity of the sensor network, its communication details, enabling the access to archived sensor data that can be discovered and accessed using standard protocols and application programming interfaces...|$|R

5000|$|The {{pterosaur}} {{wing membrane}} {{is divided into}} three basic units. The first, called the propatagium ("first membrane"), was the forward-most part of the wing and attached between the wrist and shoulder, creating the [...] "leading edge" [...] during flight. This membrane may have incorporated the first three fingers of the hand, as evidenced in some specimens. The brachiopatagium ("arm membrane") was the primary component of the wing, stretching from the highly elongated fourth finger of the hand to the hind limbs (though where exactly on the hind limbs it anchored is controversial and may have varied between species, see below). Finally, at least some pterosaur groups had a membrane that stretched between the legs, possibly connecting to or incorporating the tail, called the uropatagium; the extent of this membrane is not certain, as studies on Sordes seem to suggest that it simply connected the legs but did not involve the tail (rendering it a cruropatagium). It is generally agreed though that non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs had a broader uro/cruropatagium, with pterodactyloids only having membranes running along the legs.A bone unique to pterosaurs, known as the pteroid, connected to the wrist and helped to support a forward membrane (the propatagium) between the wrist and shoulder. Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb suggests that this forward membrane may have been more extensive than the simple pteroid-to-shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations. The position of the pteroid bone itself has been controversial. Some scientists, notably Matthew Wilkinson, have argued that the pteroid pointed forward, extending the forward membrane. This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett, who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed forward, but rather inward toward the body as traditionally thought. Peters (2009) proposed that the pteroid articulated with the ‘saddle' of the <b>radiale</b> (proximal syncarpal) and both the pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia. This view of the articulation of the pteroid has since been supported by specimens of Changchengopterus pani and Darwinopterus linglongtaensis, both of which show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal.|$|E
40|$|In extant birds, {{the hand}} is {{permanently}} abducted towards the ulna, and the wrist joint can bend extensively {{in this direction}} to fold the wing when not in use. Anatomically, this asymmetric mobility of the wrist results from the wedge-like shape of one carpal bone, the <b>radiale,</b> and from the well-developed convexity of the trochlea at the proximal end of the carpometacarpus. Among the theropod precursors of birds, a strongly convex trochlea is characteristic of Coelurosauria, a clade including the highly derived Maniraptora in addition to tyrannosaurs and compsognathids. The shape of the <b>radiale</b> can be quantified using a ‘radiale angle’ between the proximal and distal articular surfaces. Measurement of the <b>radiale</b> angle and reconstruction of ancestral states using squared-change parsimony shows that the angle was small (15 °) in primitive coelurosaurs but considerably larger (25 °) in primitive maniraptorans, indicating that the <b>radiale</b> was more wedge-shaped and the carpal joint more asymmetric. The <b>radiale</b> angle progressively increased still further within Maniraptora, with concurrent elongation of the forelimb feathers and the forelimb itself. Carpal asymmetry would have permitted avian-like folding of the forelimb {{in order to protect}} the plumage, an early advantage of the flexible, asymmetric wrist inherited by birds...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines literary {{representations of}} the neoliberal transformations of urban space in Santiago, Chile and Havana, Cuba since the 1990 s. It draws on the influential work of scholars who argue that throughout the later part {{of the twentieth century}} cities have acquired important significance as spaces that register the conflicts that emerge in national contexts and are perpetuated on a global scale by neoliberalism. This dissertation evaluates how the urban imaginaries of Santiago and Cuba have been reshaped since 1990 as a neoliberal reconfiguration of urban space has taken place in each city as a result of important transitions that occur after political and economic crises that have strongly impacted social justice debates. In the Chilean context, it focuses on how neoliberalism was institutionalized with the political transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. In the Cuban context, it focuses on how amidst the economic crisis of the special period, the State began to transition from a socialist planned economy to a mixed system that integrates partially neoliberal policies. This dissertation analyzes how, through the respective direct and indirect neoliberal reconfiguration of Santiago and Havana, the discourse of the neoliberal market imposes a neoliberal imaginary of Chile as a neoliberal paradise and Cuba as a revolution in ruins. Thus this dissertation examines how those imaginaries are dismantled in Cuban and Chilean literary production. Chapter one analyzes literary {{representations of the}} social production of the city in Nancy Alonso's Tirar la primera piedra (Cuba, 1997), Ramón Díaz Eterovic's La oscura memoria de las armas (Chile, 2008), Pedro Lemebel's De perlas y cicatrices : crónicas <b>radiales</b> (Chile, 1998), and Ena Lucía Portela's Cien botellas en una pared (Cuba, 2002). The chapter evaluates how the texts intervene in the social production of postdictatorship Santiago and special period Havana by establishing a relationship between memory, time, and space that opposes the dominant conceptions of these that are established through the neoliberal reconfiguration of urban space. It argues that the texts re-write the city to re-think the possibilities for social change by theorizing memory as a vehicle that constantly elucidates an oppositional re-mapping of the city. Chapter two analyzes literary representations of the act of writing the city in Roberto Bolaño's Estrella distante (Chile, 1996), Díaz Eterovic's La oscura memoria de las armas, Ena Lucía Portela's Cien botellas en una pared, and Anna Lidia Vega Serova's Noche de ronda (Cuba, 2001). The chapter revisits the foundational relationship between writing and power in Latin America to examine transformations in the texts' literary depictions of how intellectuals map out Santiago and Havana. It contends that by tracing the relationship between those transformations and the economic and political transformations that have taken place in Chile and Cuba since 1990, the texts situate themselves at the margins of the State and the market as a strategy toward social justice that proposes an alternate relationship to power and knowledge. Chapter three analyzes the literary construction of the act of walking in Alonso's Tirar la primera piedra, Lemebel's De perlas y cicatrices : crónicas <b>radiales,</b> Karla Suárez's Silencios (Cuba, 1997), and Diamela Eltit's Jamás el fuego nunca (Chile, 2007). The chapter reviews foundational theorizations of the construction of the urban walker to understand {{the ways in which the}} neoliberal reconfiguration of postdictatorship Santiago and special period Cuba determines the characters' movement through those cities. It argues that as the characters walk through Santiago and Havana documenting the changes [...] forms of justice and injustice [...] that have taken place since 1990, they not only identify different forms of marginality that have emerged both in public and private spaces but also represent how the reconstruction of urban space inevitably redefines their identities. This dissertation concludes with an analysis of how debates on justice became a central focus in Chile and Cuba since the mid-twentieth century. It explores the ways in which those debates were impacted in Chile by the military coup d'�tat that in 1973 established the dictatorship as the embodiment of injustice, and in Cuba as the success of the 1959 Cuban Revolution was seen as the triumph of justice. It explores how the works make significant interventions in current social justice debates in each country through their focus on the neoliberal reconfiguration of the city. The conclusion argues that the texts dismantle the neoliberal imaginaries of Chile and Cuba to open a space for new theorizations of social justice beyond the limits of the market and the State. It contends that in refuting the neoliberal reconfiguration of their cities the texts propose alternate relationships between time, space, and memory that represent a possibility to conceptualize social justice not as a closed project imposed from above but as a struggle from below that must constantly be redefined to address diverse injustices. This dissertation underlines the importance of the intersections of culture, politics, economics, and history to understand social justice struggles in Chile and Cuba. By examining how the neoliberal transformations of the city impact conceptualizations of social justice transnationally, this dissertation is relevant for understanding these debates in other contexts where the logic of neoliberalism is posited as the only possibility for a prosperous futur...|$|R

Esto sucedió como consecuencia de haber alcanzado resultados similares a los obtenidos mediante el acceso femoral, con los beneficios de una menor tasa de complicaciones y mayor confort de los pacientes. Recientemente, su utilización tomó un impulso adicional, por estar asociada a mejor pronóstico en síndromes coronarios agudos. En el presente trabajo hemos evaluado si la factibilidad, resultados y ventajas relacionadas al acceso percutáneo de la arteria radial en procedimientos por cateterismo, se aplican también a quienes presentan disección previa de la arteria humeral. Sobre un total de 1 356 accesos <b>radiales</b> percutáneos, 53 fueron en pacientes con disección previa de la arteria humeral, obteniéndose éxito del acceso en el 96. 2 % (51 / 53) de las punciones. A través de estos accesos se realizaron 71 procedimientos por cateterismo, con 93. 6 % (44 / 47) de éxito del procedimiento en las intervenciones diagnósticas y 100 % (24 / 24) en las terapéuticas. En este grupo no ocurrieron complicaciones mayores. Las complicaciones menores sucedieron en el 1. 4 % (1 / 71) de los casos y no se registraron nuevas complicaciones en el seguimiento a siete días. Si bien el grupo es pequeño, consideramos que resulta suficiente para mostrar que las punciones percutáneas de la arteria radial para la realización de procedimientos por cateterismo, en pacientes con disección previa de la arteria humeral, son factibles y permiten elevadas tasas de éxito con baja frecuencia de complicaciones. The {{percutaneous}} punction of the {{radial artery}} for catheterization procedures has gained acceptance lately. This was {{a consequence of}} achieving results similar to the femoral approach, with {{the benefits of a}} lower rate of complications and increased comfort for the patients post procedure. Recently it has gained an additional impulse with the better prognosis obtained in acute coronary syndromes. In this trial we have evaluated if the feasibility, results and advantages related {{with the use of the}} radial artery percutaneous approach to perform catheterization procedures, continues when used in patients who have had a previous brachial artery cutdown. Out of a total of 1356 percutaneous radial accesses, 53 were in patients with previous brachial artery cutdown. Through this access 71 catheterization procedures were performed, achieving access success in 96. 2 % (51 / 53) of the punctions. Once the access success was obtained, 93. 6 % (44 / 47) of the diagnostic procedures and 100 % (24 / 24) of the therapeutics procedures were successful. During hospitalization, in this group of patients, no major adverse cardiac events occurred and there was a 1. 4 % (1 / 71) rate of minor events. At seven days follow up, no new complications were recorded. Although this is a small group, we believe that it is enough to show that percutaneous punctions of the radial artery to perform catheterization procedures, in patients with previous brachial artery cutdown, are feasible, allowing high access and procedure success rates, with a low frequency of complications...|$|R
