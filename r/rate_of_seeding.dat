The percentage of fiber, however, appeared to increase slightly with an increase in the seeding rate, indicating that a higher total yield of fiber might be expected when the higher seeding rates were used. In 1943, studies on stand in four locations showed that the total stand of plants and the stand of small and dead plants increased rapidly with an increase in <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeding,</b> while the stand o desirable plants (4 feet or more in height) increased at a much slower rate. Where there was an excess of nitrogen and the hemp grew extremely tall and rank, much self-thinning occurred, resulting in a relatively thin stand of coarse stalks, a condition not desirable for the production of high quality fiber. In general, in 1943 as in 1942, there were {{no significant differences in}} the yield of retted straw when the seeding rate was varied within rather wide limits.

Altruistic seeders help bootstrap new peers and provide a significant fraction of the global upload bandwidth.

Seed growth rates ranged from 4 to 37 milligrams·day− 1 ·fruit− 1. When seed growth rates were greater than 12 milligrams·day− 1 ·fruit− 1, sucrose concentration remained relatively constant in the pod wall (1. 5 milligrams· 100 milligrams dry weight− 1), seed coat (8. 5 milligrams· 100 milligrams dry weight− 1), and embryo (5. 0 milligrams· 100 milligrams dry weight− 1). However, sucrose concentrations decreased in all three parts of the fruit as growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> fell below 12 milligrams·day− 1 ·fruit− 1.

40|$|Seed {{predation}} {{and seed}} dispersal can have strong effects on early life history stages of plants. These processes {{have often been}} studied as individual effects, but {{the degree to which}} their relative importance co-varies with seed predator abundance and how this influences seed germination rates is poorly understood. Therefore, we used a combination of observations and field experiments to determine the degree to which germination <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> the palm Astrocaryum mexicanum varied with abundance of a small mammal seed predator/disperser, Heteromys desmarestianus, in a lowland tropical forest. Patterns of abundance of the two species were strongly related; density of H. desmarestianus was low in sites with low density of A. mexicanum and vice versa. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> predation and dispersal <b>of</b> A. mexicanum <b>seeds</b> depended on abundance of H. desmarestianus; sites with high densities of H. desmarestianus had the highest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> predation and lowest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> germination, but a greater total number <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> were dispersed and there was greater density of seedlings, saplings, and adults of A. mexicanum in these sites. When abundance of H. desmarestianus was experimentally reduced, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> predation decreased, but so did dispersal <b>of</b> A. mexicanum <b>seeds.</b> Critically, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> germination <b>of</b> dispersed <b>seeds</b> were 5  times greater than undispersed seeds. The results suggest that the relationship between A. mexicanum and H. desmarestianus is a conditional mutualism that results in a strong local effect on the abundance of each species. However, the magnitude and direction of these effects are determined by the relative strength of opposing, but related, mechanisms. A. mexicanum nuts provide H. desmarestianus with a critical food resource, and while seed predation on A. mexicanum nuts by H. desmarestianus is very intense, A. mexicanum ultimately benefits because of the relatively high germination <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> its <b>seeds</b> that are dispersed by H. desmarestianus...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that considerable {{care must be}} exercised on some soils to establish stands of small-seeded legumes, notably alfalfa and red clover and sometimes sweet clover. Farmers generally {{are aware of the}} necessity of sowing a good grade of seed of a hardy variety on a well-prepared seedbed under a light nurse crop, after the soil, if acid, has been limed. The common <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeding</b> alfalfa is 10 - 15 pounds per acre, which, with good-quality seed, provides for 50 - 75 seeds per square foot. Second year stands in Iowa, however, rarely contain more than 10 plants per square foot. Obviously a reduction of any part of an alfalfa stand loss, with its accompanying hazard of complete failure, would be of real benefit to the Iowa farmer. The role of Pythium in destroying alfalfa seedling stands on three acid Iowa soils was first pointed out by the author (1, 2) in two short preliminary papers in 1934 and 1935. Pythium was observed to produce necrotic lesions on germinating seed and alfalfa seedlings more commonly on slightly acid Clarion loam, Webster loam and Tama silt loam than on two similar areas of neutral Webster loam and Webster silty clay loam. At 9 °C. fewer alfalfa and alsike clover seedlings became infected than at 20 ° - 25 ° C. Plantings of alfalfa and alsike clover on steamed and formaldehyde-treated acid soil yielded as many or more healthy alfalfa seedlings than similar plantings on neutral field soil. Alsike seedlings seemed more resistant to Pythium than alfalfa seedlings at 20 °- 25 ° C.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 A great {{potential}} for increasing upland rice production exists in the savanna soils of Colombia. These vast areas are currently underutilized. However, they have good soil structure, flat topography, coupled with sufficient and well distributed rainfall, making savanna soils ideal for upland rice cropping system. The major constraints to upland rice production in these soils are their low fertility and lack of appropriate technology for their management. The basic concept is to alleviate or overcome soil constraints by planting rice cultivars to Al toxicity and low native fertility, and obtaining reasonable, but not necessarily the maximum yield obtained with lowland or paddy rice. Upland rice production systems were evaluated in representative savanna soils of CRI La Libertad, Llanos Orientales, Colombia, during the rainy seasons of 1983 and 1984. Cultivars such as Perola, Tox 1011 - 4 - 2, IAC 47, IAC 165, IRAT 101 and Makalioka 34 showed a high yield potential and good level of resistance against the prevalent pests and diseases. They also have thick and deep roots which make them suitable for upland rice culture in savanna soils. They are tolerant to Al toxicity, and have good level of adaptation to acid-soil conditions. A second component of a successful rice production technology was the determination of appropiate rates of P an Ca. Based on plant tissue analyses and in grain yield, a fertilization rate of 150 Kg Ca/ha using dolomite, and 60 Kg P₂ 0 ₅/ha as concentrate superphosphate, appears to be adequate for acceptable yield levels on savanna soils. An additional component of the management system is to drill plant adapted rice cultivars in rows 15 cm apart, with a <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeding</b> of 60 Kg/ha. Significantly higher yield was obtained with these cultural practices.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the best method to establish subterranean clover on medusahead infested ranges in Western Oregon. Secondary objectives of this study were to determind the effects of management treatments on (a) subterranean clover density, (b) density of medusahead and other vegetation, and (c) yield of subterranean clover. Four treatments for establishing subterranean clover were compared including two seeding methods superimposed over six old treatments for controlling medusahead. The results of this experiment are as follows: Subterranean clover density was found to be significantly higher early in the season in the sod plus broadcast seeded area, in all but the chemically treated areas, when compared with the sod seeded area. The number of subterranean clover plants per square foot in May was significantly higher in the sod plus broadcast seeded areas in all but the chemical treatment. There was a great loss of subterranean clover plants in both methods of seeding from March through April; this was due to poor nodulation. Vegetation density was significantly lower in the chemical-mowed and sheep-grazed treatments in May. Medusahead density was lower in only the chemical-mowed treatment. It appears that removing the old vegetation before applying paraquat makes the chemical more effective in controlling medusahead and other vegetation. The yield of vegetation other than subterranean clover ranged from 1, 871 to 2, 437 pounds per acre. The yield of vegetation in the chemical-mowed and sheep-grazed treatment was significantly lower than in the mechanical and control treatment. Subterranean clover yields, which were highest in the sod plus broadcast seeded areas, ranged from 22 to 397 pounds per acre. The chemical-unmowed treatment along with a previous control treatment had the highest yield: the lowest yield was obtained in the mechanical treatment combined with a late grazed treatment. Low yields of subterranean clover were attributed to lack of nodulation which probably was caused by dessication of rhizobja prior to sowing (a 24 hour delay in broadcast inoculated seed), drying after seeding because of poor coverage in drill rows and lack of available phosphorus. In establishing subterranean clover on similar sites, reduction of vegetation would be of prime importance. Prior grazing would be beneficial as shown, but because of the unpalatable and low nutritional value of annual grasses in summer and autumn, vegetation removal might depend on use of fire or mechanical means, with or without herbicides. For stand establishment sod- seeding was more effective than broadcasting the seed. A higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeding</b> is suggested when surface broadcasting seed onto undisturbed soil.

Four of these {{newly released}} cultivars were grown at three different locations which have different environmental conditions. Data were obtained on grain yield, tiller number per plant, 1000 kernel weight, seed number per spike, plant and spike number per unit area, plant height, heading and maturity dates. At the lowest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeding</b> the grain yield {{was significantly lower}} at all three locations. Although {{there were no significant}} differences for grain yield for all the other seeding rates, maximum yields were obtained from lower seeding rates at Ryan while at Hyslop and Madras, which had better moisture conditions, maximum yields were obtained at higher seeding rates. This situation was not observed for the Yamhill cultivar in which maximum yields were obtained at 160 seeds per m² seeding rate at all three locations. Tillers per plant value decreased as the seeding rate increased. Hyslop and McDermid produced significantly higher number of tillers per plant from the other cultivars. Significantly highest 1000 kernel weight values were obtained at the lowest seeding rate. Yamhill produced the highest significant 1000 kernel weight while Paha produced the lowest. Seeds per spike value followed the same order as tillers per plant and 1000 kernel weight showing a continuous decrease with the increased rates of seeding. The number of plants per m² was a direct linear function of seeding rate. The number of spikes per m² increased curvilinearly with the increased seeding rate. Hyslop and McDermid produced the highest significant number of spikes per m² because of their higher tillering ability. Plant height increased with increased rates of seeding because of the increased competition for light. Yamhill and Paha were significantly the tallest cultivars. The tallest plants were observed at Hyslop. There was a decrease in the number of days in heading and maturity as the rates of seeding increased. The cultivars ranked in the order Paha > Yamhill > Hyslop > McDermid for heading and maturity dates. Heading first occurred at Hyslop followed by Ryan and Madras while maturity occurred first at Ryan followed by Hyslop and Madras. Highly positive correlations were observed among plants per m², spikes per m and seeding rate while these factors correlated negatively with tillers per plant, 1000 kernel weight and seeds per spike.

Treating <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> this cultivar by 97 % sulfuric acid for longer period resulted in damage to embryo and no seedlings emerged after these treatments. The best result for cv. Arbequina observed following 97 % sulfuric acid treatment for 9 h (69. 5 %). Mechanical treatment {{had no effect on}} germination percentage or germination <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> this cultivar. Growth of olive seedlings also increased by scarification treatments significantly. Results suggested that chemical and mechanical scarification treatments can improve germination percentage and seedling growth of olive cultivars...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{measurement}} of transverse inequality <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the pneumatic <b>seed</b> drills. The first section describes the types of sowing, divisions of seeders and a description of the most common sowing units. The practical part is devoted to measurement of transverse inequality <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> pneumatic <b>seed</b> drill. The changes in accuracy <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the older <b>seed</b> drill were being monitored. Additional measurements were carried out with the seal insert mounted in a distribution head. This measurement simulated sowing in rows with row spacing 50 cm. The current trends in creation of crops are presented. The discussion contains important information acquired during the measurement. The conclusion summarizes the findings of the thesis...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to control the seed borne pathogens (Alternaria spp.) of carrot and to examine the seed germination rate by using 13 environment friendly agricultural materials instead of conventional chemicals for organic cultivation. The growth inhibiting effects on pathogens showed the different responses according to each agricultural material and effective 7 materials against seed borne pathogens were selected. Among 7 materials, the carrot seeds sterilized with plant extracts, Tanger Stop and Land Saver were not germinated at all. The germination <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> sterilized with other materials showed the similar levels with reference chemical (Benlate-T) and non-treated <b>seeds.</b> Infection <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> sterilized with seaweed extract, Bellopper for controlling A. radicina and plant extract, Ssial- 100 for A. dauci were similar or low infection rate compared with reference chemical. The germination rate and root length <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> sterilized with Bellopper and Ssial- 100 was similar or superior to those <b>of</b> chemical sterilized <b>seeds.</b> The optimal condition seemed {{to be a little bit}} different depending on the concentration of materials. As a result, the sterilization <b>of</b> carrot <b>seeds</b> by using the environment friendly materials could be effectively utilized as a technology to inhibit the infection of seed-borne pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Climate change affects {{communities}} both {{directly and}} indirectly via changes in interspecific interactions. One such interaction that may be altered under climate change is the ant-plant seed dispersal mutualism common in deciduous forests of eastern North America. As climatic warming alters the abundance and activity levels of ants, the potential exists for shifts in <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> ant-mediated <b>seed</b> dispersal. We used an experimental temperature manipulation at two sites in the eastern US (Harvard Forest in Massachusetts and Duke Forest in North Carolina) to examine the potential impacts of climatic warming on overall <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal (using Asarum canadense seeds) as well as species-specific <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal at the Duke Forest site. We also {{examined the relationship between}} ant critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and the mean seed removal temperature for each ant species. We found that seed removal rates did not change as a result of experimental warming at either study site, nor were there any changes in species-specific <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal. There was, however, a positive relationship between CTmax and mean seed removal temperature, whereby species with higher CTmax removed more seeds at hotter temperatures. The temperature at which seeds were removed was influenced by experimental warming as well as diurnal and day-to-day fluctuations in temperature. Taken together, our results suggest that while temperature {{may play a role in}} regulating seed removal by ants, ant plant seed-dispersal mutualisms may be more robust to climate change than currently assumed.

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread pollutants and can negatively affect plants. Fluorene is a prevalent PAH in the contaminated environment. In this study, {{the effects of}} higher concentrations of fluorene in soil on <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> germination, growth, and the physiological parameters of wheat, sunflower, and alfalfa were studied. The {{results showed that the}} higher concentration <b>of</b> fluorene decreased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> germination and seedlings growth of plants. Wheat showed the highest resistance at seed germination and seedlings growth phases, and sunflower was the most sensitive species at both stages. Therefore, it was concluded that higher resistance at seed germination could be followed by the higher resistance of seedlings. Fluorene toxicity also induced oxidative stress in plants as shown by MDA accumulation in the plants. There was a significant correlation between the lower activity of CAT and MDA accumulation in the studied plants. Therefore, CAT could be an important enzyme involved in detoxification of ROS and plants resistance to fluorene toxicity. Depending on plant species and fluorene concentration, photosynthetic pigments content was differently affected...|$|R
