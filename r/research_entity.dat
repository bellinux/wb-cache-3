40|$|Research {{capacity}} in two jurisdictions in tropical northwestern Australia was mapped to a searchable website. The website provides {{ready access to}} all research organisations in the region with the underlying database providing a baseline against which developments in research and research networks can be measured. Of 202 <b>research</b> <b>entities</b> entered into the database, 38 were businesses, 12 civil society organisations, five cooperative research centres, 10 government research institutes, 64 government agencies within three jurisdictions and 70 university research groups within seven universities. The data were analysed by sector to describe the size and linkages between organisations, areas of research strength and socioeconomic objectives of research. Most enterprises undertaking research in tropical Western Australia and the Northern Territory are small with the majority having fewer than 10 research staff. The primary area of expertise for <b>research</b> <b>entities</b> in tropical Western Australia and the Northern Territory is agricultural and environmental research, {{which is also the}} area where there is greatest breadth of capacity. Similarly, the socioeconomic objective of most <b>research</b> <b>entities</b> is in fields related to environmental management and social development with the breadth of capacity greatest in environmental policy frameworks. There were substantial differences between the skills and direction of research in government and the universities and those in business.
