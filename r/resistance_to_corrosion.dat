It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and takes on a dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, malleability, and high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion</b> (due to passivation).|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion</b> meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} {{application}} for manganese is in aluminum alloys. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion</b> through grains that absorb impurities which {{would lead to}} galvanic corrosion. The corrosion-resistant aluminium alloys 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most beverage cans. Before year 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese.|$|E

5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion,</b> it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion,</b> almost {{equivalent to}} platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E

5|$|Its {{high density}} and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion</b> have been {{exploited}} {{in a number}} of related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E
5|$|Most other binary alloys are {{of little}} use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver–cadmium alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental {{amalgams}} are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys {{are very important}} in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium–indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion</b> in hot water.|$|E
5|$|Platinum {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{reactive}} metals. It has remarkable <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion,</b> even at high temperatures, and is therefore considered a noble metal. Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, {{but it was not until}} Antonio de Ulloa published a report on a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it began to be investigated by scientists.|$|E

5|$|Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, {{and highly}} {{conductive}} {{of heat and}} electricity. The metal is renowned for its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion</b> by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, {{as well as with}} a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017°C (boiling point 5458°C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|The alloy {{of copper}} and nickel, called cupronickel, {{is used in}} low-denomination coins, often for the outer cladding. The US 5-cent coin (currently called a nickel) {{consists}} of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable for its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion,</b> is used for various objects exposed to seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries. Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and are used in decorations.

40|$|In {{applications}} where <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> localised <b>corrosion</b> is required, {{stainless steel}} alloys containing molybdenum are generally used thanks <b>to</b> their superior <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> localised attack in aggressive environments. For ferritic stainless steels, vanadium additions {{have been found}} to also have a beneficial effect on the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> localised <b>corrosion.</b> In this study vanadium and molybdenum were compared directly as alloying elements in 18 % chromium ferritic stainless steel as far as their effect on increasing the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> localised <b>corrosion</b> is concerned. Pitting potentials in a neutral chloride solution were used as the criterion for qualifying <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> localised <b>corrosion</b> and it was shown that vanadium gave similar or slightly higher pitting potentials at addition levels of up to 4 % (weight percent). It was subsequently found that the mechanism by which the molybdenum and the vanadium increase the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> localised <b>corrosion,</b> are not the same. The experimental data for the molybdenum containing alloys corresponded well with other work done in this field. The positive effect of molybdenum additions on the pitting resistance of these alloys could be explained through its effect in lowering the dissolution rate in the active dissolution region by enriching on the dissolving surface. The vanadium additions to these alloys were shown not to {{have an effect on the}} active dissolution kinetics. The effect of these two alloying elements on the initiation of metastable pits were examined, but no meaningful advantage for the vanadium containing alloys over the rest could be found. It is suggested that vanadium play a role in changing the dissolution kinetics of the salt film, which forms during the growth of a metastable pit. A delayed dissolution of salt film remnants would lead to a loss of the enriched pit solution, which would cause the metastable pit to repassivate.

25|$|Corrosion from {{tellurium}} - The reactor makes {{small amounts}} of tellurium as a fission product. In the MSRE, this caused {{small amounts of}} corrosion at the grain boundaries of the special nickel alloy, Hastelloy-N. Metallurgical studies showed that adding 1 to 2% niobium to the Hastelloy-N alloy improves <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>corrosion</b> by tellurium. Maintaining the ratio of / to less than 60 reduced corrosion by keeping the fuel salt slightly reducing. The MSRE continually contacted the flowing fuel salt with a beryllium metal rod submerged in a cage inside the pump bowl. This caused a fluorine shortage in the salt, reducing tellurium to a less aggressive (elemental) form. This method is also effective in reducing corrosion in general, because the fission process produces more fluorine atoms that would otherwise attack the structural metals.|$|E
