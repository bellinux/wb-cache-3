40|$|The first {{systematic}} {{evaluation of}} the effects of six existing forms of fitness scaling in genetic algorithms is presented alongside a new method called transform ranking. Each method has been applied to stochastic universal sampling (SUS) over a fixed number of generations. The test functions chosen were the two-dimensional Schwefel and Griewank functions. The quality of the solution was improved by applying sigma <b>scaling,</b> linear <b>rank</b> <b>scaling,</b> nonlinear <b>rank</b> <b>scaling,</b> probabilistic nonlinear <b>rank</b> <b>scaling,</b> and transform <b>ranking.</b> However, this benefit was always at a computational cost. Generic linear scaling and Boltzmann scaling were each of benefit in one fitness landscape but not the other. A new fitness <b>scaling</b> function, transform <b>ranking,</b> progresses from linear to nonlinear <b>rank</b> <b>scaling</b> during the evolution process according to a transform schedule. This new form of fitness scaling was found {{to be one of the}} two methods offering the greatest improvements in the quality of search. It provided the best improvement in the quality of search for the Griewank function, and was second only to probabilistic nonlinear <b>rank</b> <b>scaling</b> for the Schwefel function.

50|$|The {{national}} final {{was held}} in the Ahoy Rotterdam arena, hosted by Paul de Leeuw. Eight songs took part, with the winner being decided by a 50/50 split between televoting and twelve regional juries. Each jury awarded points to the songs on the <b>ranking</b> <b>scale</b> 10-7-5-4-3-2-1-0. Televotes were assessed by taking the same number of points available to the juries (384) and allocating them pro rata according to the percentage of votes each song had received. The rounding up and down of televoting points to the nearest whole number resulted in a slight discrepancy, with only 381 televoting points being awarded in total. The voting {{turned out to be a}} one-horse race, with Wagenmakers receiving over twice the points of her closest rival, having been ranked first by eight of the twelve juries and receiving over one third of the entire televote.|$|E

50|$|Cinnamomum glaucescens {{has been}} {{successfully}} cultivated, and promotes species conservation. A <b>ranking</b> <b>scale</b> was established, assessing mode of domestication, cultivation and social beliefs from farmer or forest users perspective, to rank the suitability of MAPs for farming. With the highest ranking being five, and lowest zero, sugandha kokila ranked four out of five. This demonstrate that Cinnamomum glaucescens is not only physiologically appropriate for cultivation but also has a high chance to be adopted by farmers, when compared with other MAPs. Furthermore, the GEF Small Grants Programme ran a successful project mobilizing two indigenous Nepalese communities, promoting the knowledge and tools to cultivate sugandha kokila. The project amended the two involved communities’ local forestry operation plan to include the conservation of Cinnamomum glaucescens. The two communities involved planted Cinnamomum glaucescens 13ha of community forests, in addition to 6ha planted on private land. Increasing the market demand of sugandha kokila oil will not only benefit the farmers and producers in Nepal but also encourage the conservation of Cinnamomum glaucescens. As the market grows, the plant will increase in value, encouraging more cultivation of the plant and therefore increase conservation efforts. Also, three women-run forest nurseries established, responsible for growing 30,000 seedlings of sugandha kokila, sapindus, cinnamon, zanthoxylum, lemon and asparagus. Creating women run nurseries empowered women to learn new skills and {{play an important role}} in the cultivation of sugandha kokila and other products. Additionally, 86 households were supported in developing suitable infrastructure for the processing of sugandha kokila. This project is an example of how the cultivation of sugandha kokila using a community approach can empower women and conserve this endemic plant.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Measures {{of comfort}} are {{important}} in the prescription and development of footwear. The purpose of our {{study was to examine}} three commonly used scales (visual analog scale (VAS), Likert scale, and <b>ranking</b> <b>scale)</b> to determine the most reliable, to calculate a minimal clinically important change in rating scales, and to explore dimensions of comfort important to the patient. Methods: Twenty subjects were allocated consecutively to two experiments consisting of five sessions of repeated measures. Using comfort measures from each subject's usual jogging shoe, experiment 1 examined the reliability of VAS and Likert scale over six dimensions of the foot, including overall comfort. The second experiment examined the reliability of <b>ranking</b> <b>scale</b> by assessing the ranked position of the shoe. Comfort measures were obtained in both walking and jogging. Results: The <b>ranking</b> <b>scale</b> was the most stable scale. Mixed linear modeling found that VAS was more stable than the Likert scale. The VAS required two sessions to become reliable for all measures but those obtained from the heel, which required more. Using a data-derived approach, a clinically important change in comfort was 9. 59 mm on the 100 -mm VAS; using an anchor-based approach, it was 10. 2 mm. Subjects identified arch comfort as the most important consideration in footwear comfort. Conclusions: <b>Ranking</b> <b>scale</b> and VAS are reliable measures of footwear comfort. Using the VAS, changes of 9. 59 and 10. 2 mm indicate a clinically relevant change in comfort. The most important dimensions to the patient are overall comfort and the arch. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Causality in abusive {{head trauma}} {{has never been}} fully {{established}} and hence no gold standard exists for the diagnosis. Implications hereof include bias introduced by circular reasoning and a shift from a trustful doctor patient relationship to a distrustful one when the caregiver statement is questioned. In this paper we examine seven recent abusive head trauma studies including 476 diagnosed abuse cases for circular reasoning {{as well as the}} role of the caregiver statement in the diagnosis. Secondly, we present a novel <b>ranking</b> <b>scale</b> for the diagnosis of abusive head trauma designed to minimize circular reasoning. We found circularity to be a potential source of bias in all seven studies. The caregiver statement (lack of trauma mechanism or trauma mechanism considered incompatible with clinical findings) was listed as a diagnostic item in 329 (69 %) of 476 cases. Applying our <b>ranking</b> <b>scale</b> to the abuse cases showed that the demands of our <b>ranking</b> <b>scale</b> were not fulfilled in 440 (92 %) cases. We conclude that most abuse cases in the studies were, to some extent, diagnosed on criteria based on circular reasoning. The caregiver statement {{was one of the most}} frequently used diagnostic items. Hypothetically, caregivers offer no or inadequate explanation to the clinical findings in assumed abuse cases. Thus, when this feature is encountered, it is regarded as indicative of abuse adding further to the risk of circularity bias. We propose the use of our novel <b>ranking</b> <b>scale</b> in abusive head trauma research in an effort to minimize circular reasoning...|$|E
