5|$|Snake {{is arrested}} for smoking inside the Kwik-E-Mart. Chief Wiggum {{explains}} {{that this is}} Snake's third strike, so he will be executed {{in accordance with the}} three strikes law. Before hauling Snake away, Chief Wiggum points out that Apu, Moe, and Bart are all witnesses; Snake vows to kill them all. After the execution, Homer visits Dr. Nick, who transplants Snake's hair onto Homer's head. When Homer goes to sleep the following night, it plants its roots in Homer's brain. With the hair controlling his mind, Homer murders Apu and Moe. Bart realizes that the other two witnesses have been killed, and Homer vows to protect him. Homer locks himself and Bart in a room, but Snake's hair takes control of him. Homer tries to kill Bart with a sledgehammer. Bart begs Homer to fight the hair and, after a struggle, Homer <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> hair off his head. Wiggum bursts in and shoots the hair dead.|$|E

25|$|Hanging {{from the}} cross, Jesus prays to God asking {{forgiveness}} {{for the people}} who did this to him, and redeems a criminal as a saint who is crucified beside him. Succumbing to impending death, Jesus gives up his spirit and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering a sudden earthquake which destroys the temple and <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> cloth covering the Holy of Holies in two, to the horror of Caiaphas and the other priests. Satan is shown screaming in agonized defeat. Jesus' lifeless body is taken down from the cross, and entombed. In the end, the healed body of Jesus rises from the dead and exits the tomb resurrected.|$|E
25|$|Jeoseung is {{ruled by}} the ten Underworld gods, the Yeoldaewang. The Yeoldaewang offer {{different}} punishments; Jingang shreds sinners to pieces, Sogan burns sinners in an iron pot, Songye whips sinners and exiles them, and Ogan offers the blessed fire to withstand the cold and makes sinners pass naked through his icy realm. Yeomyeo <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> tongues of those who earned money through interest, Bingshin hurls sinners in a pit full of lizards, spiders, and snakes, Taesan grinds the flesh of sinners inside a barn, and Paengdeung shreds sinners with a saw. Those who are destroyed in Paengdeung's realm must reincarnate into the twelve beasts. Doshi undresses sinners, hangs them on a tree, and hits them ruthlessly, and Yeolsi sends the blessed into the village of Sang, located in Mt.Seokhyo, and sends sinners into a dark realm {{where there is no}} light.|$|E
25|$|In an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima {{and enters}} the media layer. The high {{pressure}} <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> tissue of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart. This can propagate {{along the length of}} the aorta for a variable distance forward or backwards. Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with the flow of blood) are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the flow of blood) are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100mm of the aortic valve, so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a hemopericardium. Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.|$|E

500|$|Finn and Jake later rile up the apathetic demon masses by {{performing}} a [...] "political rap", which instigates anarchy.

Marceline is initially disappointed in her father for tricking her into ruling the Nightosphere to make him proud, but they reconcile when Hunson reassures Marceline that he is proud of her, no matter what she does, and that he actually enjoys Finn and Jake.|$|E
500|$|The pores on the {{underside}} of the cap are yellowish and angular, measuring [...] wide, and formed by tubes that extend [...] deep. These pores have a slightly decurrent attachment to the stem (extending down its length). Young specimens have a whitish fibrous partial veil that protects the developing pores; as the cap expands it <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> veil, which remains as a grayish ring on the stem. The stem is [...] long, and [...] thick, roughly cylindrical in shape, or sometimes with a bulbous bottom so as to be somewhat club-shaped. The stem surface is tomentose, with scales at the top, and a ring on the upper half of the stem. Below the ring the stem is fibrillose, covered with a mat of soft hairs. Its color at the top is yellow, but with wine-red to reddish-brown scales below, underlaid with a pale yellow to grayish color. The stem is usually solid, rarely hollow. The tissue of all parts of the fruit body—cap, pores, and stem—will turn brownish shortly after being bruised or injured.|$|E
500|$|Sasha Geffen from MTV News noted Gaga's eyes {{rolling back}} in {{her head as she}} moshes with the crowd in the clip and [...] "at one point she almost <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> head off of [...] ". Similar {{thoughts}} were echoed in Lara Walsh's review of the clip for InStyle, where she fawned about being a [...] "big fan" [...] of Gaga's [...] "raw appearance" [...] in the video. Writing for the Idolator, Mike Wass noted that the cover artwork gives one a clear idea regarding what to expect from the video, seeing that it [...] "reinvents Gaga as a rockstar" [...] and the [...] "epilepsy induced editing brings the whole thing to life". However he missed the theatricality associated with the singer's previous videos. Caitlyn Callegari from Bustle compared the clip with that of experiencing a Gaga concert from the front row and called it [...] "appealing" [...] since it had the singer's [...] "patented stylistic melodrama while also maintaining an air of realness to it". Callegari complimented the visuals for bringing out Gaga as both a performer and singer, [...] "and this video invites us to enjoy her in her purest form".|$|E

Yes, she is a cheerleader, but she also goes home and listens to punk music. She's into really dark art and probably <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> heads off of Barbie dolls. Basically, she's a train wreck." [...] Burton said the character may be [...] "a train wreck" [...] but that she was [...] "so glad [...] putting a girl like her on TV. You don't have to be one thing. Peyton has made that OK".|$|E

The group eventually recruited guitarist Stacey Blades, with both Muscat and Kelli departing the group, in 2004 while they also released the cover album, titled <b>Rips</b> <b>the</b> Covers Off, the same year. Commenting on Blades addition to the lineup, Lewis stated that [...] "Stacey really is a virtuoso type of guy and player. It was really fortunate that we found him and that he's another Hollywood guy. I’ve read reviews where they called him a Tracii [...] clone, but he's not. He is definitely his own man." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "This {{one is the}} worst," [...] Reed {{said after}} the game, {{referring}} to the Bills' streak of four consecutive Super Bowl losses. [...] "We should have won.

[...] "Dallas didn't wear us down in the second half," [...] added Thomas. [...] "I fumbled. I cost us the game." [...] However, center Kent Hull managed to find some consolation.

2500|$|Within the [...] "tale" [...] {{sections}} of the book, Peter, Martin, and Jack fall into bad company (becoming the official religion of the Roman empire) and begin altering their coats (faith) by adding ornaments. They then begin relying on Peter to be the arbitrator of the will. He begins to rule by authority (he remembered the handyman saying that he once heard the father {{say that it was}} acceptable to don more ornaments), until such a time that Jack rebels against the rule of Peter. Jack begins to read the will (the Bible) overly literally. He <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> coat to shreds to restore the original state of the garment which represents the [...] "primitive Christianity" [...] sought by dissenters. He begins to rely only upon [...] "inner illumination" [...] for guidance and thus walks around with his eyes closed, after swallowing candle snuffs. Eventually, Peter and Jack begin to resemble one another, and only Martin is left with a coat that is at all like the original.|$|E
2500|$|In the Preliminary Final against Sydney FC, the Phoenix lost 4–2 in {{controversial}} circumstances. After {{being locked}} at 1–1 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected {{the ball into}} the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight over to the linesman, but the goal stood. [...] "I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. I spoke to the ref at halftime about it and he said it wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for something like that to change the game is very disappointing." [...] Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward. Eugene Dadi then added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that it changed the dynamics of the game. [...] "It just <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> heart out of you. We got back in the game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think we were right back in it. They played some good football but I thought we had withstood it OK. If we went into halftime [...] we were really confident we could get something out of it." [...] Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.|$|E

2500|$|Bryant Frazer of Studio Daily {{wrote that}} Godard breaks the {{conventional}} [...] "rules" [...] of 3D in five ways: [...] "he does not keep a clean frame" [...] in his screen compositions, [...] "he embraces low-quality cameras", [...] "he gravitates toward deep focus" [...] cinematography, [...] "he <b>rips</b> <b>the</b> 3D image apart and then restores it {{in a single}} shot" [...] and [...] "he uses stereo to elevate the mundane" [...] instead of spectacular subjects like superhero or fantasy films. Frazer said that Godard [...] "wants to experiment with the technology, draw attention to it, test its boundaries, {{and see what happens}} when the image falls apart completely." [...] Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote that [...] "rather than using 3-D as an effect to create a sensation of flight or to make a viewer feel like the target of propelled objects, Godard uses 3-D to emphasize the materiality, the physical properties, of the world at hand." [...] Bordwell said that, other than [...] "to awe us with special effects", 3D's purposes are typically to be realistic in its enhancement of the depth of objects and [...] "advancing our understanding of the story", which is usually achieved with only one part of the screen in 3D while the rest is out of focus and in 2D. In Goodbye to Language Godard uses 3D in deep focus shots with images that allow the audience to scan the entire frame. Bordwell wrote that Godard's use of 3D [...] "is aiming to make us perceive the world stripped of our conceptual constructs (language, plot, normal viewpoints, and so on)." ...|$|E
