40|$|This paper <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> our <b>entry</b> to the small-vocabulary, moving-talker {{track of}} the 2 nd CHiME challenge. The system we employ {{is based on the}} one that we {{developed}} for the 1 st CHiME challenge, the latest results of which are reported in (Ma and Barker, 2012). Our motivation is to benchmark the system on the new CHiME challenge and to measure {{the extent to which it}} is robust against speaker motion, a feature of the second challenge that was absent in the first. The paper presents a brief overview of our fragment-decoding plus missingdata imputation system and then makes a component-bycomponent analysis of the system performance on both the 1 st and 2 nd CHiME challenge datasets. We conclude that due to its reliance on pitch and spectral cues the system is robust against the introduction of small speaker motions. We achieve an average keyword recognition score of 85. 9 % compared to 86. 3 % for the stationary speaker condition.

5000|$|Yadav's third work, Portraits of India, is a {{collection}} of poems. Extracts from this work received praise from Khushwant Singh, India's premier writer.Writing in one of his regular weekly columns, Singh remarked that the couplet of one of the poems [...] "sycophancy is a practice in which, modern-day India is very rich" [...] was an accurate summation of the mental state of Indians and [...] "deserved to be quoted". Khushwant Singh's acclamation proved prophetic and Yadav has begun to win international endorsement and recognition. He secured the rank of a semi-finalist in the United Kingdom's Song Writing Contest 2013 for his submission 'Never Love a Woman'.Following this success two of India's premier newspapers, The Hindustan Times and the Hindu, did feature <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> Yadav. His <b>entry</b> for the 2014 contest, 'To None Ever Bound', also secured a semi-finals position.|$|R
40|$|Within the C-HPP, the French and Swiss {{teams are}} {{responsible}} for the annotation of proteins from chromosomes 14 and 2, respectively. neXtProt currently <b>reports</b> 1231 <b>entries</b> <b>on</b> chromosome 2 and 624 <b>entries</b> <b>on</b> chromosome 14; of these, 134 and 93 entries are still not experimentally validated and are thus considered as "missing proteins" (PE 2 - 4), respectively. Among these entries, some may never be validated by conventional MS/MS approaches because of incompatible biochemical features. Others have already been validated, but are still awaiting annotation. Based on information retrieved from the literature and from three of the main C-HPP resources (Human Protein Atlas, Peptide Atlas and neXtProt), a subset of 40 theoretically detectable missing proteins (15 on chromosome 14 and 25 on chromosome 2) was defined for upcoming targeted studies in sperm samples. This list is proposed as a roadmap for the French and Swiss teams in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The CC {{chemokine}} receptors CCR 5, CCR 2, and CCR 3 and the CXC chemokine receptor CXCR 4 {{have been}} implicated as CD 4 -associated cofactors {{in the entry}} of primary and cell line-adapted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) strains. CXCR 4 is also a receptor for T-cell-line-adapted, CD 4 -independent strains of HIV- 2. With the exception of this latter example, little has been <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> the <b>entry</b> cofactors used by HIV- 2 strains. Here we show that a CD 4 -dependent, T-cell-line-adapted HIV- 2 strain uses CXCR 4 and, to a lesser extent, CCR 3 for fusion with and infectious entry into cells. In a cell-to-cell fusion assay, the envelope protein of this virus can utilize a wider repertoire of chemokine receptors to induce fusion. These include CCR 1, CCR 2, CCR 3, CCR 4, CCR 5, CXCR 2, and CXCR 4. Kinetic analysis indicated that cell lines expressing the receptors that support infection, CXCR 4 and CCR 3, form syncytia more rapidly than do cell lines expressing the other receptors. Nevertheless, although less efficient, fusion with CXCR 2 expressing cells was specific, since it was inhibited by antibodies against CXCR 2. The extensive use of chemokine receptors in cell-to-cell fusion has implications for understanding the molecular basis of CD 4 -chemokine receptor-induced lentivirus fusion and may have relevance for syncytium formation and the direct cell-to-cell transfer of virus in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Lately, {{the problem}} of stolen {{vehicles}} is frequently happened. This happens not {{because there is no}} direct supervision towards the vehicle, but the methods used are less efficient. Not only vehicles parked in public places are likely to be lost, but the vehicles in an area with security guards are also likely to be lost. For example, in government departments such as the office parking area, housing areas with guard posts and even in Universiti Malaysia Pahang itself. Student and staff of UMP need a safer place to park their vehicles. In UMP, the supervision at guard post is done manually where a few security guards will be stationed at each guard post to monitor the entry and exit of vehicles. The possibility of stolen vehicle is high because there is no identity inspection done to every vehicle’s owner that enter and exit UMP area. Anyone can drive a vehicle inside UMP area with a condition that the vehicle has UMP sticker on it. The criminal may have stolen the vehicle by disguising as student or staff of UMP. To overcome this problem, UMP Vehicle Entry and Exit Monitoring System will be develop. This system can increase the safety of vehicle in Universiti Malaysia Pahang, especially for cars. With the existence of this system, the security guards of UMP Security Department will easily obtain the traffic <b>report</b> <b>on</b> vehicle <b>entry</b> and exit from UMP. This system will be able to record the vehicle registration number and matric ID of the driver...|$|R
