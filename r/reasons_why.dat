5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's.

The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000.

British lesbians followed with the publication of Arena Three beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.|$|E
5|$|The Joker has {{undergone}} many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common {{interpretation of the}} character {{is that he is}} disguised as the criminal Red Hood, and pursued by Batman. The Joker falls into a vat of chemicals which bleaches his skin, colors his hair green and his lips red, and drives him insane. The <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> the Joker was disguised as the Red Hood, and his identity before his transformation have changed over time.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, {{there is}} also a cost in {{structurally}} keeping inflation lower than in the United States, UK, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, the euro has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers. Hence export from the euro zone becomes more difficult. This {{is one of the main}} <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> economic growth inside the euro zone now lags behind growth in other large economies. This effect is strongest in European countries with a weak economy.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 is {{a yellow}} subgiant (spectral type G3 IV). It is about 65 parsecs {{away from the}} Sun that is larger than, but of a similar mass to, the Sun. However, HD 154672 is much older. The star is very metal-rich, {{which is one of}} the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> it was {{targeted}} for a planet search by the N2K Consortium, which discovered the gas giant planet HD 154672 b using Doppler Spectroscopy; the discovery was reported in October 2008. The N2K collaboration chose HD 154672 primarily because it aimed to discover the correlation between a star's metallicity and the mass of orbiting planets.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} {{the character of}} a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in {{the final version of the}} script.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E

When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be , and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity.|$|E
