40|$|RNA interference, {{mediated}} by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), is a conserved regulatory {{process that has}} evolved as an antiviral defense mechanism in plants and animals. It is not known whether host cells also use siRNAs as an antibacterial defense mechanism in eukaryotes. Here, we report the discovery of an endogenous siRNA, nat-siRNAATGB 2, that is specifically induced by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae carrying effector avrRpt 2. We demonstrate that the biogenesis of this siRNA requires DCL 1, HYL 1, HEN 1, RDR 6, NRPD 1 A, and SGS 3. Its induction also depends on the cognate host disease resistance gene RPS 2 and the NDR 1 gene that is required for RPS 2 -specified resistance.

Isogenic bacterial strains that differ {{by the presence of}} single avirulence genes are being used to analyze plant resistance. Plant resistance genes have been identified in crosses between resistant and susceptible lines. The extensive map-based cloning tools available in Arabidopsis are being used to isolate these resistance genes.

40|$|<b>Race-specific</b> disease <b>resistance</b> {{in plants}} is {{mediated}} by Resistance (R) proteins that recognize pathogen attack and initiate defence responses. Most R proteins contain a central NB-ARC domain and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain.

We expressed the CC-NB-ARC and LRR parts in trans and analyzed functional transcomplementation and physical interactions. We show that these domains functionally transcomplement when expressed in trans. Known autoactivating LRR domain swaps were found to induce a hypersensitive response (HR) upon co-expression. Likewise, autoactivating mutants in the NB subdomain transcomplemented to induce HR. Point mutations in the ARC 2 subdomain that induce strong autoactivation in the full-length Mi- 1. 2 protein, however, fail to induce HR in the transcomplementation assay. These data indicate distinct functions for the NB-ARC subdomains in induction of HR signalling.

40|$|Quantitative {{resistance}} is postulated {{to be more}} durable than qualitative (R-gene mediated) resistance, which is usually quickly overcome by the pathogen population. Despite its wide use for nearly 10 years in France, the French bread wheat cultivar Apache remains resistant to stripe rust. Here, we investigated the genetic architecture of cv. Apache resistance to examine whether its durability {{could be explained by}} quantitative characteristics. We identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) by composite interval mapping of disease progress data recorded throughout 4 years of field assays. These assays included inoculation with three different pathotypes on a segregating population originating from a cross between cv. Apache and cv. Taldor, a French cultivar susceptible to stripe rust. Three QTLs derived from Apache, QYr. inra- 2 AS, QYr. inra- 2 BL and QYr. inra- 4 B, were detected. Each of these QTLs contributed between approximately 15 and 69 % of the phenotypic variance and corresponds to a <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> gene. We showed that QYr. inra- 2 AS and QYr. inra- 2 BS map to the positions of Yr 17 and Yr 7, respectively, whereas QYr. inra- 4 B corresponds to an adult plant resistance gene.

40|$|Black rot, {{caused by}} Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases affecting Brassica crops worldwide. Nine races have been differentiated in X. campestris pv. campestris, with races 1 and 4 being the most virulent and widespread. The objective of this work was to identify sources of resistance to races 1 and 4 of X. campestris pv. campestris in different Brassica napus crops, mainly in the underexplored pabularia group. Seventy-six accessions belonging to four B. napus groups were screened for resistance to two X. campestris pv. campestris races (1 and 4). The strain of race 1 used in this study was more virulent on the tested materials than the strain of race 4. No <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> was found to race 1. Most cultivars were susceptible except Russian kale, from the pabularia group, which showed some resistant plants and some other accessions with some partially resistant plants. High levels of <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> to race 4 were found in the pabularia group, and great variability within accessions was identified. Three improved cultivars (Ragged Jack kale, Friese Gele, and Valle del Oro) and four landraces (Russian kale, MBG-BRS 0037, MBG-BRS 0041, and MBG-BRS 0131) showed plants with some degree of resistance to both races, which may indicate that race-nonspecific resistance is involved.

40|$|The {{importance}} of leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, {{has increased dramatically}} {{in recent years in}} durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) worldwide. Little is known on the occurrence and nature of resistance in this crop. Thirty durum wheat lines derived from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) were characterized for their resistance to the Mexican P. triticina race BBG/BN which was identified in 2001 and caused susceptibility {{of a large number of}} the world's durum wheat cultivars. Ten genotypes with <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> displayed low to intermediate seedling reactions to leaf rust. In the field, eight genotypes were immune and two displayed moderate levels of resistance. The slow rusting resistant lines displayed a range of disease severity responses indicating genetic diversity. The yield protection conferred by race-specific and slow rusting resistance was investigated in yield loss trials under high leaf rust pressure in the field. <b>Race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> provided effective protection against yield losses caused by leaf rust. Yield losses for slow rusting resistant lines were higher than for immune race-specific resistant ones, but significantly lower than for the susceptible checks. Slow rusting lines with high resistance levels and reduced yield losses were identified. The slow rusting components; latent period, uredinium size and receptivity, were determined in greenhouse experiments, and associations of these components with leaf rust progress in the field were calculated. The results indicated that predominantly uredinium size contributed to slow leaf rust progress in durum wheat. The genetic basis and diversity of <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> was also determined in progenies from crosses of nine durum wheat lines with a leaf rust susceptible parent, and from intercrosses among the resistant parents. Five distinct sources of resistance were identified, four of which involved single partially, or completely, dominant genes, of which two were closely linked, and a pair of partially dominant complementary genes. Using molecular tools, the two linked genes were located on the long arm of chromosome 6 B. The best slow rusting resistant lines and the five distinct <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> sources can be used for enhancing the diversity and durability of leaf rust resistance in durum wheat...|$|E

However, it is largely unknown whether and how sRNAs {{are involved in the}} regulation of rice responses to the invasion of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, the most devastating bacterial disease of rice worldwide. We performed simultaneous genome-wide analyses of the expression of sRNAs and genes during early defense responses of rice to Xoo mediated by a major disease resistance gene, Xa 3 /Xa 26, which confers durable and <b>race-specific</b> qualitative <b>resistance.</b> A large number of sRNAs and genes showed differential expression in Xa 3 /Xa 26 -mediated resistance. These differentially expressed sRNAs include known microRNAs (miRNAs), unreported miRNAs, and small interfering RNAs.

40|$|Abstract: Stripe rust of wheat, {{caused by}} Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, {{continues}} to cause severe damage worldwide. Durable resistance {{is necessary for}} sustainable control of the disease. High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance, which expresses when the weather becomes warm and plants grow older, has been demonstrated to be durable. We con-ducted numerous studies to understand the molecular mechanisms {{of different types of}} stripe rust resistance using a tran-scriptomics approach. Through comparing gene expression patterns with <b>race-specific,</b> all-stage <b>resistance</b> controlled by various genes, we found that a greater diversity of genes is involved in HTAP resistance than in all-stage resistance. The genes involved in HTAP resistance are induced more slowly and their expression induction is less dramatic than genes in-volved in all-stage resistance. The high diversity of genes and less dramatic induction may explain durability and the in-complete expression level of HTAP resistance.

40|$|Lactuca sativa (lettuce) is {{susceptible}} to Bremia lactucae (downy mildew). In cultivated and wild Lactuca species, Dm genes have been identified that confer <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance.</b> However, these genes were soon rendered ineffective by adaptation of the pathogen. Lactuca saligna (wild lettuce) is resistant to all downy mildew races and {{can be considered as}} a non-host. Therefore, L. saligna might be an alternative source for a more-durable resistance to downy mildew in lettuce. In order to analyze this resistance, we have developed an F 2 population based on a resistant L. saligna 2 susceptible L. sativa cross. This F 2 population was fingerprinted with AFLP markers and tested for resistance to two Bremia races NL 14 and NL 16. The F 2 population showed a wide and continuous range of resistance levels from completely resistant to completely susceptible. By comparison of disease tests, we observed a quantitative resistance against both Bremia races as well as a <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> to Bremia race NL 16 and not to NL 14. QTL mapping revealed a qualitative gene (R 39) involved in the <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> and three QTLs (RBQ 1, RBQ 2 and RBQ 3) involved in the quantitative resistance. The qualitative gene R 39 is a dominant gene that gives nearly complete resistance to race NL 16 in L. saligna CGN 5271 and therefore it showed features similar to Dm genes.

30|$|Two {{pairs of}} {{susceptible}} and resistant rice lines, each {{with the same}} genetic background, {{were used for the}} analysis. The first pair of rice lines comprised Rb 49 and IR 24. Transgenic line Rb 49 carries a MR gene Xa 3 /Xa 26 driven by its native promoter and encodes a plasma membrane–localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase–like protein conferring <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> to Xoo (Sun et al. 2004; Xiang et al. 2006). The wild-type Mudanjiang 8 is a japonica rice variety (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) and is susceptible to Xoo.

IRBB 13 carries a recessive MR gene xa 13, which confers <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> to Xoo, with the genetic background of IR 24; however, IR 24 is susceptible to Xoo (Chu et al. 2006 a). The xa 13 confers resistance by nonresponse to pathogen-induced expression, which leads to the maintenance of a concentration of copper that is toxic to Xoo in the xylem vessels (Chu et al. 2006 b; Yuan et al. 2010).|$|E

A superoxide-dependent hypersensitive response occurs during both the <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> response of tobacco cells challenged with incompatible zoospores of Phytophthora nicotianae and during non-specific elicitation of tobacco cells challenged with Phytophthora glucan elicitors extracted from the fungal cell wall. Inhibition studies are consistent with dependence upon endogenous Ca 2 + levels, and with involvement of NAD(P) H oxidase and peroxidases in production of ROS during both specific and non-specific elicitation.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between phloem-feeding insects (PFIs) and plants offers an intriguing {{example of a}} highly specialized biotic interaction. These insects have evolved to survive on a nutritionally imbalanced diet of phloem sap, and to minimize wound responses in their host plants. As a consequence, plant perception of and responses to PFIs differ from plant interactions with other insect-feeding guilds. Transcriptome-wide analy-ses of gene expression are currently being applied to characterize plant responses to PFIs in crop plants with <b>race-specific</b> innate <b>resistance,</b> {{as well as in}} compatible interactions with susceptible hosts. Recent studies in-dicate that PFIs induce transcriptional reprogramming in their host plants, and that plant responses to PFIs appear to be quantitatively and qualitatively different from responses to other insects or pathogens. Tran-script profiling studies also suggest that PFIs induce cell wall modifications, reduce photosynthetic activity, manipulate source–sink relations, and modify second-ary metabolism in their hosts, and many of these responses appear to occur within the phloem tissue. Plant responses to these insects appear to be regulated in part by the salicylate, jasmonate, and ethylene sig-nalling pathways. As additional transcript profiling data become available, forward and reverse genetic ap-proaches will be necessary to determine which changes in gene expression influence resistance or suscep-tibility to PFIs...|$|R
40|$|The {{cultivation}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) plants has raised several environmental concerns. One of these concerns regards non-target soil fauna organisms, which {{play an important role}} in the decomposition of organic matter and hence are largely exposed to GM plant residues. Soil fauna may be directly affected by transgene products or indirectly by pleiotropic effects such as a modified plant metabolism. Thus, ecosystem services and functioning might be affected negatively. In a litterbag experiment in the field we analysed the decomposition process and the soil fauna community involved. Therefore, we used four experimental GM wheat varieties, two with a <b>race-specific</b> antifungal <b>resistance</b> against powdery mildew (Pm 3 b) and two with an unspecific antifungal resistance based on the expression of chitinase and glucanase. We compared them with two non-GM isolines and six conventional cereal varieties. To elucidate the mechanisms that cause differences in plant decomposition, structural plant components (i. e. C:N ratio, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose) were examined and soil properties, temperature and precipitation were monitored. The most frequent taxa extracted from decaying plant material were mites (Cryptostigmata, Gamasina and Uropodina), springtails (Isotomidae), annelids (Enchytraeidae) and Diptera (Cecidomyiidae larvae). Despite a single significant transgenic/month interaction for Cecidomyiidae larvae, which is probably random, we detected no impact of the GM wheat on the soil fauna community.

40|$|The Arabidopsis genes EDS 1 and NDR 1 {{were shown}} {{previously}} by mutational analysis to encode essential components of <b>race-specific</b> disease <b>resistance.</b> Here, {{we examined the}} relative requirements for EDS 1 and NDR 1 by {{a broad spectrum of}} Resistance (R) genes present in three Arabidopsis accessions (Columbia, Landsberg-erecta, and Wassilewskija). We show that there is a strong requirement for EDS 1 by a subset of R loci (RPP 2, RPP 4, RPP 5, RPP 21, and RPS 4), conferring resistance to the biotrophic oomycete Peronospora parasitica, and to Pseudomonas bacteria expressing the avirulence gene avrRps 4. The requirement for NDR 1 by these EDS 1 -dependent R loci is either weak or not measurable. Conversely, three NDR 1 -dependent R loci, RPS 2, RPM 1, and RPS 5, operate independently of EDS 1. Another RPP locus, RPP 8, exhibits no strong exclusive requirement for EDS 1 or NDR 1 in isolate-specific resistance to P. parasitica, although resistance is compromised weakly by eds 1. Similarly, resistance conditioned by two EDS 1 -dependent RPP genes, RPP 4 and RPP 5, is impaired partially by ndr 1, implicating a degree of pathway cross-talk. Our results provide compelling evidence for the preferential utilization of either signaling component by particular R genes and thus define at least two disease resistance pathways.

40|$|In {{evolutionary}} sense {{no resistance}} lasts forever. The durability of a resistance {{can be seen}} as a quantitative trait; resistances may range from not durable at all (ephemeral, or transient) to highly durable. Ephemeral resistance occurs against fungi and bacteria with a narrow host range, specialists. It is characterised by a hypersensitive reaction (HR), major gene inheritance and many resistance genes, which often occur in multiple allelic series and/or complex loci. These resistance genes (alleles) interact in a gene-for-gene way with a virulence genes (alleles) in the pathogen to give an incompatible reaction. The pathogen neutralises the effect of the resistance gene by a loss mutation in the corresponding avirulence allele. The incompatible reaction is not elicited any more and the pathogenicity is restored. The pathogens can afford the loss of many avirulences without loss of fitness. Durable resistance against specialised fungi and bacteria is often quantitative and based upon the additive effects of some to several genes, the resulting resistance being of another nature than the hypersensitive reaction. This quantitative resistance is present to nearly all pathogens at low to fair levels in most commercial cultivars. Durable resistance of a monogenic nature occurs too and is usually of a non-HR type. Resistance against fungi and bacteria with a wide host range, generalists, is usually quantitative and durable. Resistances against viruses are often fairly durable, even if these are based on monogenic, <b>race-specific,</b> HR <b>resistances.</b> The level of specialisation does not seem to be associated with the durability of resistance...|$|R

40|$|<b>Race-specific</b> disease <b>resistance</b> {{in plants}} {{depends on the}} {{presence}} of resistance (R) genes. Most R genes encode NB-ARC-LRR proteins that carry a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR). Of the few proteins found to interact with the LRR domain, most have proposed (co) chaperone activity. Here, we report the identification of RSI 2 (Required for Stability of I- 2) as a protein that interacts with the LRR domain of the tomato R protein I- 2. RSI 2 belongs to the family of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs or HSP 20 s). HSP 20 s are ATP-independent chaperones that form oligomeric complexes with client proteins to prevent unfolding and subsequent aggregation. Silencing of RSI 2 -related HSP 20 s in Nicotiana benthamiana compromised the hypersensitive response that is normally induced by auto-active variants of I- 2 and Mi- 1, a second tomato R protein. As many HSP 20 s have chaperone properties, the involvement of RSI 2 and other R protein (co) chaperones in I- 2 and Mi- 1 protein stability was examined. RSI 2 silencing compromised the accumulation of full-length I- 2 in planta, but did not affect Mi- 1 levels. Silencing of heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90) and SGT 1 led to an almost complete loss of full-length I- 2 accumulation and a reduction in Mi- 1 protein levels. In contrast to SGT 1 and HSP 90, RSI 2 silencing led to accumulation of I- 2 breakdown products. This difference suggests that RSI 2 and HSP 90 /SGT 1 chaperone the I- 2 protein using different molecular mechanisms. We conclude that I- 2 protein function requires RSI 2, either through direct interaction with, and stabilization of I- 2 protein or by affecting signalling components involved in initiation of the hypersensitive response...|$|R

30|$|Plant {{cells are}} interacted with elicitors at {{metabolic}} level. Plants on pathogen attack or treatment of plants with elicitor causes {{an array of}} defense reaction which includes the accumulation {{of a wide range}} of secondary metabolites at enhanced level. Various mechanisms have been hypothesized for mechanism of elicitation. The binding of elicitor to a plasma membrane receptor is hypothesized by some researcher for elicitation process (Cheong and Hahn 1991; Cosio et al. 1990; Basse et al. 1993; Nürnberger et al. 1994; Braun and Walker 1996 and Hanania and Avni 1997). During the process of elicitation, elicitors are recognized by specific receptors in the plant cell which are localized either on the cell surface for a number of fungal elicitors or within the cell for certain bacterial elicitors (Ebel and Scheel 1997; Yang and Gabriel 1995 and Ackerveken et al. 1996). These receptors initiate signaling processes that activate plant defenses. The pathogen-plant interaction can be divided into two different categories viz. host or <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> and non-host interaction. In case of the host or <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance,</b> the pathogen interacts with a potential host that has acquired a resistance gene (R-gene).

We tested the ability of TIR and coiled-coil-class (also known as leucine-zipper-class) R genes to confer resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato or Peronospora parasitica in SA-depleted (NahG) and nim 1 /npr 1 plants. We found that all of the P. syringae pv. tomato-specific R genes tested were dependent upon SA accumulation, while none showed strong dependence upon NIM 1 /NPR 1 activity. A similar SA dependence was observed for the P. parasitica TIR and CC-class R genes RPP 5 and RPP 8, respectively. However, the P. parasitica-specific R genes differed in their requirement for NIM 1 /NPR 1, with just RPP 5 depending upon NIM 1 /NPR 1 activity for effectiveness. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that at least in Arabidopsis, SA accumulation is necessary for the majority of R-gene-triggered resistance, while the role of NIM 1 /NPR in <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> is limited to resistance to P. parasitica mediated by TIR-class R genes...|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora sojae is an oomycete {{which causes}} stem and root rot disease in soybean. Upon infection, P. sojae could deliver {{a series of}} virulent {{effector}} proteins into host cell to promote disease on susceptible plants (Tyler et al. 2008, Gyhre and Robatzek 2008). Avr 1 b is one such protein (Tyler et al. 2008). In this report, a soybean U-box protein, GmPUB 1 - 1, was isolated by interaction with P. sojae effector Avr 1 b in yeast. It has a homologous copy which was named GmPUB 1 - 2. These two GmPUB 1 proteins share 94 % identities. Pull-down assay confirmed the interaction between GmPUB 1 s and Avr 1 b in vitro. Mutations in Avr 1 b C-terminal conserved residuals abolished the interaction between Avr 1 b and GmPUB 1 proteins. These residuals are also known involved in Avr 1 b virulence activity. By linking GmPUB 1 genes with the GFP tag, GmPUB 1 -GFP fusion proteins was localized throughout soybean hypocotyl and onion epidermal cells. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) experiment suggests the interaction of GmPUB 1 and Avr 1 b, most likely predominantly occurs in nuclei. In vitro ubiquitination assay demonstrated that GmPUB 1 - 1 and GmPUB 1 - 2 possess E 3 ligase activities and mediated self-monoubiquitination. Gene silencing of the GmPUB 1 genes in cotyledons of the soybean cultivar Williams 82 showed loss of <b>race-specific</b> Phytophthora <b>resistance</b> encoded by Rps 1 -k. GmPUB 1 - 1 mRNA level was up-regulated following P. sojae infection. Eight candidate interactors of GmPUB 1 - 2 are identified from a yeast two-hybrid library screening. Overall, this study implicates that finctional E 3 ligase activities of GmPUB 1 proteins {{may be involved in}} Rps 1 -k mediated Phytophthora resistance in soybean...|$|R
40|$|Rusts are {{important}} pathogens of angiosperms and gymnosperms including cereal crops and forest trees. With respect to cereals, rust fungi {{are among the}} most important pathogens. Cereal rusts are heteroecious and macrocyclic requiring two taxonomically unrelated hosts to complete a five spore stage life cycle. Cereal rust fungi are highly variable for virulence and molecular polymorphism. Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina is the most common rust of wheat on a worldwide basis. Many different races of P. triticina that vary for virulence to leaf rust resistance genes in wheat differential lines are found annually in the US. Molecular markers have been used to characterize rust populations in the US and worldwide. Highly virulent races of P. triticina are selected by leaf rust resistance genes in the soft red winter wheat, hard red winter wheat and hard red spring wheat cultivars that are grown in different regions of the US. Cultivars that only have <b>race-specific</b> leaf rust <b>resistance</b> genes that are effective in seedling plants lose their effective resistance and become susceptible within a few years of release. Cultivars with combinations of race non-specific resistance genes have remained resistant {{over a period of years}} even though races of the leaf rust population have changed constantly...|$|R
40|$|Winter wheat Druchamp {{has both}} {{high-temperature}} adult-plant (HTAP) resistance and all-stage resistance to stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). The HTAP resistance in Druchamp is durable as the variety has been resistant in adult-plant stage {{since it was}} introduced from France to the United States in late 1940 s. To map the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stripe rust resistance, an F 8 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from cross Druchamp × Michigan Amber was phenotyped for stripe rust response in multiple years in fields under natural infection and with selected Pst races under controlled greenhouse conditions, and genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Composite interval mapping (CIM) identified eight HTAP resistance QTL and three all-stage resistance QTL. Among the eight HTAP resistance QTL, QYrdr. wgp- 1 BL. 2 (explaining 2. 36 - 31. 04 % variation), QYrdr. wgp- 2 BL (2. 81 - 15. 65 %), QYrdr. wgp- 5 AL (2. 27 - 17. 22 %) and QYrdr. wgp- 5 BL. 2 (2. 42 - 15. 13 %) were significant in all tests; and QYrdr. wgp- 1 BL. 1 (1. 94 - 10. 19 %), QYrdr. wgp- 1 DS (2. 04 - 27. 24 %), QYrdr. wgp- 3 AL (1. 78 - 13. 85 %) and QYrdr. wgp- 6 BL. 2 (1. 69 - 33. 71 %) were significant {{in some of the}} tests. The three all-stage resistance QTL, QYrdr. wgp- 5 BL. 1 (5. 47 - 36. 04 %), QYrdr. wgp- 5 DL (9. 27 - 11. 94 %) and QYrdr. wgp- 6 BL. 1 (13. 07 - 20. 36 %), were detected based on reactions in the seedlings tested with certain Pst races. Among the eleven QTL detected in Druchamp, at least three (QYrdr. wgp- 5 DL for <b>race-specific</b> all-stage <b>resistance</b> and QYrdr. wgp- 3 AL and QYrdr. wgp- 6 BL. 2 for race non-specific HTAP resistance) are new. All these QTL, especially those for durable HTAP resistance, and their closely linked molecular markers could be useful for developing wheat cultivars with durable resistance to stripe rust...|$|R

The dominant allele, Xa 13, is required for both bacterial growth and pollen development.

40|$|<b>Race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> in barley to the {{powdery mildew}} fungus (Erysiphe graminis f sp hordei) is {{associated}} with a cell death reaction (hypersensitive response [HR]). Genetically, it is dependent on dominant resistance genes (Mlx), and in most cases, it is also dependent on Rar 1 and Rar 2. Non-race-specific resistance to the fungus, which is {{due to the lack of}} the Mlo wild-type allele, is dependent on Ror 1 and Ror 2 and is not associated with an HR in the region of pathogen attack. However, the absence of the Mlo wild-type allele stimulates a spontaneous cell death response in foliar tissue. This response is also controlled by Ror 1 and Ror 2, as indicated by trypan blue staining patterns. Lack of Mlo enhances transcript accumulation of pathogenesis-related genes upon fungal challenge, and this response is diminished by mutations in Ror genes. Using DNA marker-assisted selection of genotypes, we provide evidence, via gene interaction studies, that Ror 1 and Ror 2 are not essential components of <b>race-specific</b> <b>resistance</b> and do not compromise hypersensitive cell death. Reciprocal experiments show that neither is Rar 1 a component of mlo-controlled resistance nor does it affect spontaneous cell death. We show that mlo- and Ror-dependent resistance is active when challenged with E. g. f sp tritici, a nonhost pathogen of barley. Our observations suggest separate genetic pathways operating in race-specific and non-race-specific resistance; they indicate also a separate genetic control of hypersensitive and spontaneous cell death in foliar tissue...|$|E

40|$|Triticale is the {{intergeneric}} hybrid between {{wheat and}} rye. With {{the expansion of}} the triticale growing area, powdery mildew has emerged and become a significant disease on this new host. Recent research demonstrated that this new' powdery mildew on triticale has emerged through a host range expansion of powdery mildew of wheat. Moreover, isolates sampled from triticale still infect their previous host, wheat, but isolates sampled from wheat hardly infect triticale. <b>Race-specific</b> and adult-plant <b>resistance</b> have been identified in triticale cultivars. The main objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the cellular basis of powdery mildew resistance in triticale. Commonalities with resistance responses in other cereals such as wheat, barley and oat are discussed. A detailed comparative histological study of various resistance responses during cross-inoculation of either virulent or avirulent wheat and triticale isolates on both hosts was carried out. The present data provide evidence that for incompatible interactions, the formation of non-penetrated papillae is the predominant resistance response, while the hypersensitive response (HR) acts as a second line of defence, to cut the fungus off from nutrients, if penetration resistance fails. It is not clear yet what causes the slower growth and reduced colony size of triticale isolates when inoculated on wheat. Possibly, post-penetration resistance mechanisms, other than HR, are switched on during these (semi-) compatible interactions. Molecular studies on gene expression and gene function of defence-related genes might reveal further insights into the genetic basis of these resistance responses...|$|R
40|$|Stripe rust {{resistance}} in the winter wheat cultivar Claire had remained effective in the UK and Europe since its release in 1999 and consequently has been used extensively in wheat breeding programs. However, in 2012, reports indicated that this valuable resistance may now have been compromised. To characterise stripe rust {{resistance in}} Claire and determine which genes may still confer effective resistance a cross was made between Claire and the stripe rust susceptible cultivar Lemhi. A genetic linkage map, constructed using SSR, AFLP, DArT and NBS-AFLP markers had a total map length of 1, 730 cM. To improve the definition of two quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified on the long arm of chromosome 2 D further markers were developed from wheat EST. Stripe rust resistance was evaluated on adult plants under field and glasshouse conditions by measuring the extent of fungal growth and sporulation, percentage infection (Pi) and the necrotic/chlorotic responses of the plant to infection, infection type (IT). Four QTL contributing to stripe rust adult plant resistance (APR) were identified in Claire, QYr. niab- 2 D. 1, QYr. niab- 2 D. 2, QYr. niab- 2 B and QYr. niab- 7 B. For Pi QYr. niab- 2 D. 1 explained up to 25. 4 % of the phenotypic variation, QYr. niab- 2 D. 2 up to 28. 7 %, QYr. niab- 2 B up to 21. 7 % and QYr. niab- 7 B up to 13. 0 %. For IT the percentages of phenotypic variation explained were 23. 4, 31. 8, 17. 2 and 12. 6 %, respectively. In addition to the four QTL conferring APR in Claire, a <b>race-specific,</b> seedling expressed <b>resistance</b> gene was identified on chromosome 3 B...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Leaf rust, {{caused by}} Puccinia triticina, {{is a common}} and {{widespread}} disease of wheat in the US. On an annual basis, over 50 races of the leaf rust fungus are detected. There are at least 5 major groups of genetically distinct P. triticina isolates in the US based on allelic variation at microsatellite loci. Distinct regional race populations of P. triticina {{are found in the}} US, due to the widespread use of <b>race-specific</b> leaf rust <b>resistance</b> (Lr) genes in different market classes of wheat. In the south-eastern States where soft red winter wheats are grown, races with virulence to Lr 9, Lr 11, and Lr 18 are predominant. In the southern Great Plains region where hard red winter wheats are grown, races with virulence to genes Lr 9, Lr 17, Lr 24, and Lr 26 are common. In the northern Great Plains region where hard red spring wheats are grown, races with virulence to Lr 2 a and Lr 16 are common. Due to the wide dispersal of P. triticina, some races are found in all regions of the US. Highly effective durable resistance to leaf rust has been difficult to achieve due to the high degree of virulence variation in the P. triticina population and the rapid selection of races with virulence to effective Lr genes in wheat cultivars. Hard red spring wheat cultivars with genes Lr 16, Lr 23, and Lr 34 have been highly resistant for more than 10 years in Minnesota and the Dakotas. Stem rust, caused by P. graminis f. sp. tritici, has not been a common disease of wheat in the US since the last major epidemics in the 1950 s. The low levels of stem rust infections in the US {{can be attributed to the}} increasing use of highly resistant winter and spring wheat cultivars, which has greatly reduced the overall level of stem rust urediniospores. Eradication of the alternate host, Berberis vulgaris, has reduced the number of race...|$|R
