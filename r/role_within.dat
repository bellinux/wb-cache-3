Cerebrates can be reincarnated by the Overmind upon death, though dark templar energies are capable of preventing this. The death of a cerebrate causes the Overmind to lose control of its respective brood, which will then run amok.|$|E
5|$|Design {{management}} {{has taken a}} more strategic <b>role</b> <b>within</b> business since 2000, and more academic programs for design management have been established. Design {{management has}} been recognized (and subsidized) throughout the European Union as a function for corporate advantage of both companies and nations. The main issues and debates included the topics of design thinking, strategic design management, design leadership, and product service systems. Design management {{was influenced by the}} following design trends: sustainable design, inclusive design, interactive design, design probes, product clinics, and co-design. It was also influenced by the later management trends of open innovation and design thinking.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} his {{business}} closure, McAloney was forced to seek alternate employment and he consequently enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 1 July 1936. Ranked aircraftman, he completed a fitters course and qualified as an aero fitter and turner before being attached to No.1 Squadron at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria, in September. He was employed in a maintenance <b>role</b> <b>within</b> the unit, working on the Jupiter Gipsy and Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines of Bristol Bulldog and Hawker Demon aircraft respectively. During 1937, McAloney completed a part-time air gunner course. His first child, a son named William, was born later that year.|$|E
5|$|Some RNA {{molecules}} play {{an active}} <b>role</b> <b>within</b> cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins.|$|E
5|$|Three {{important}} {{works were}} published in 1990: the Publication of Design Management – A Handbook of Issues and Methods by Mark Oakley (Editor), the book Design Management by French researcher Brigitte Borja de Mozota, and the Publication of Design Management – Papers from the London Business School by Peter Gorb (Editor). This new method-based design management approach helped to improve communication amongst technical and marketing managers. Examples of the new methods included trend research, the product effect triad, style mapping, milieus, product screenings, empiric design methods, and service design, giving design a more communicative and central <b>role</b> <b>within</b> organizations.|$|E

5|$|Back on the highway, an {{ambulance}} crew try to resuscitate Black, {{who has been}} outside his car through the night after his vision of Lee. After he comes to, he realizes this alternate reality was Lee showing him a life without the Millennium Group. However, he is left unsure whether his <b>role</b> <b>within</b> the Group is protecting his family from evil, or exposing them to it. Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E
5|$|By 1975, {{plans were}} laid {{to replace the}} Hunter in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. The Hunter {{remained}} in a key <b>role</b> <b>within</b> the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs {{and the ability to}} carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{included}} other literary sources {{within the}} poem: Stéphane Mallarmé, W. B. Yeats, Jonathan Swift, Arnaut Daniel, Nijinsky's dancing in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Shakespeare's Hamlet. Religious images {{were used to}} connect the poem to the writings of Julian of Norwich, to {{the life and death}} of Thomas Wentworth, to William Laud, to Charles I, and to John Milton. Eliot relied on theological statements similar to those of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam and Thomas Hardy's The Impercipient. The Bible also played a large <b>role</b> <b>within</b> the poem, especially in discussions on the Holy Spirit and Pentecost. Many commentators have pointed out the influence of George Herbert within the poem, but Eliot, in a letter to Anne Ridler dated 10 March 1941, stated that he was trying to avoid such connections within Little Gidding.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Levesque's {{role as an}} Executive Senior Advisor {{was officially}} formalized as he was given an office at WWE {{headquarters}} in Stamford, Connecticut. Levesque was named Executive Vice President, Talent and Live events in 2011. In this role he oversees the talent relations and talent development departments, training of performers and management of worldwide recruitment. Levesque's <b>role</b> <b>within</b> {{the company has been}} under much criticism since 2003, as many fans and some wrestlers view {{it as a way to}} keep him on top on-screen and to give him more television time. Levesque has spoken against this criticism and has denied all of it. Additionally, Levesque has been credited for losing in high-profile matches that helped elevate the careers of younger wrestlers including John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista, Jeff Hardy, Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{returned}} to Normandy, expecting {{to have been}} given both the Duchy and England, to find that William Rufus had crossed the Channel and been crowned king, as William II. The two brothers disagreed fundamentally over the inheritance, and Robert soon began to plan an invasion of England to seize the kingdom, helped by a rebellion {{by some of the}} leading nobles against William Rufus. Henry remained in Normandy and took up a <b>role</b> <b>within</b> Robert's court, possibly either because he was unwilling to openly side with William Rufus, or because Robert might have taken the opportunity to confiscate Henry's inherited money if he had tried to leave. William Rufus sequestered Henry's new estates in England, leaving Henry landless.|$|E
5|$|The Combine are {{frequently}} shown as harsh rulers over {{the citizens of}} Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, policing using violence and using invasive surgery to transform humans into either soldiers or slaves.

The atmosphere generated by the dystopian Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the artificial intelligence of the transhuman Combine characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in Half-Life 2.
