500|$|The {{doctrine}} of cy-près {{is a form}} of variation of trusts; it allows the original purpose of the trust to be altered. The doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy pres comme possible (as close as possible), and is typically used where the original purpose of the charity has failed, and results in the trust purpose being altered to the nearest realistic alternative. Prior to the Charities Act 1960, this [...] "failed purpose" [...] situation was the only time when cy-près could be applied; it required the original purpose to be impossible or impractical.

500|$|The case {{provided}} {{the basis for}} other challenges to restrictions imposed on LSC, such as bans against lobbying or class action. These challenges were rejected by the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit in separate suits. The challenges failed because the <b>relevant</b> <b>provisions</b> do not regulate a specific type of advocacy; for example, the restriction on LSC grantees from collecting attorney's fees would not raise a speech issue because there is no speech involved in such a process. The argument raised in these challenges was that the Court articulated a new [...] "conditions" [...] principle in Velazquez—a distortion-of-speech test—which, they argued, would require the restrictions to be struck down. Both courts of appeal reviewing this claim have rejected this reading of Velazquez. Instead of a distortion-of-speech test, the decision was based on the application of limited public forum principles: when the government provides funds to an entity, and this funding's purpose was to encourage a diversity of private views, it must act in a viewpoint-neutral way. Programs funded in this manner are treated as a public forum, where the ability of the government to restrict speech is highly limited.|$|E
500|$|The Minister may {{declare that}} any foreign {{broadcasting}} service which is rebroadcast in Singapore has been [...] "engaging {{in the domestic}} politics of Singapore". Rebroadcasting such a [...] "declared foreign broadcasting service" [...] is prohibited without the Minister's approval, which can be refused, revoked without reasons, or granted on conditions, which may include restrictions {{on the number of}} people permitted to receive the service and suspensions of the service for certain periods. Failing to comply with the above rules is a crime punishable by a fine of up to $100,000. Similar provisions exist in the NPPA to enable the circulation of foreign newspapers in Singapore to be restricted. In February 1987, the Asian Wall Street Journal was declared to have engaged in domestic politics and its circulation was limited to 400 copies. The newspaper's publisher, Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc., applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for certiorari to quash the Minister's orders. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Dow Jones argued that the Minister had acted irrationally and misinterpreted scope of his powers under the NPPA by not considering the right to free speech protected by Article 14(1)(a). The Court dismissed the argument on the ground that Dow Jones could not rely on the Article as it only applied to Singapore citizens. Furthermore, even if Dow Jones could raise the constitutionality of the <b>relevant</b> <b>provisions</b> of the NPPA on the basis that Singapore citizens were indirectly affected by it, it was not evident that the right to free speech included the right to receive information. In any case, even if the latter argument was accepted, it might be said that the right of Singapore citizens to receive information by reading the Asian Wall Street Journal had not been impaired since 400 copies of it were still in circulation. The Court interpreted the term domestic politics broadly, holding that in Singapore's context it included: ...|$|E

500|$|On 3 November, Frederick and {{his entourage}} {{departed}} for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while {{there was no immediate}} danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had [...] "unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn," [...] and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared {{on the right side of}} the larynx, and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, [...] "To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?" [...] Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering [...] "foreigner" [...] who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father [...] "whether he is ill or not, [...] whether the K is then unable permanently to perform his duties," [...] would then be determined per the <b>relevant</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Prussian Constitution. [...] Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.|$|E
