This involves manually looking for the card with the matching 'key' in the trays, sequentially looking in each date until found. A <b>reserved</b> <b>item</b> is flagged with a piece of colored card, so that when it is returned it can be set aside and checked against the file of reservations.|$|E

In addition to holding auctions he also <b>reserved</b> <b>items</b> for possible sale to private collectors and scholars. He maintained frequent correspondence with his network of collectors and he was often visited by museum professionals and scholars from institutions around the world. Oldman continued to deal in artifacts after 1913 but ceased to arrange auctions. Instead he sent out artefact lists to his contacts. These were also illustrated with photographs and were issued on a bi-weekly or monthly basis.|$|R

In the 2012 fiscal year, the acquisitions department at our university spent $ 6. 5 million on e-resources. The course reserves unit spent an additional $ 4, 000 towards copyright permissions to post electronic materials which exceed fair use guidelines. With the cost of electronic access to information in mind, in the Fall 2012 semester we ran a survey to assess user preferences.

30|$|Another related {{concern is}} {{with the loss of}} items and the content {{validity}} of the scales. As other reduced scales, ER 5 FP and IGFP- 5 R have a limited coverage of the constructs when compared with long scales. The loss of items {{as a result of the}} analyses could potentially reduce this coverage. However, the content of the factors of both ER 5 FP and IGFP- 5 R preserved some of the core aspects of the five-factor model—as described in The 100 Revised Synonym Clusters list (Goldberg, 1992; Goldberg & Rosolack, 1994). Concerning the ER 5 FP, the Extraversion factor contains items related to Gregariousness, Shyness, and <b>Reserve</b> (<b>items</b> 1 and 6) and Expressiveness and Silence (item 5). The Conscientiousness items are associated with Persistence (e.g., item 2) and Decisiveness, Indecisiveness, and Inconsistency (items 10 and 12). The items of the Agreeableness factor are linked to Empathy and Overcriticalness (item 4) and Amiability, Callousness and Rudeness (items 7 and 14). The Neuroticism items are related to Placidity and Fear (items 3 and 18). The Openness items are associated to Creativity and Unimaginativeness (item 8) and Nonconformity (item 15).|$|R

40|$|Correct {{estimation}} of the Outstanding Claims <b>Reserve,</b> an <b>item</b> that includes Incurred But Not Reported Claims (IBNR) as well as Incurred But Not Enough Reserved Claims (IBNER), {{is one of the}} most important issues currently facing actuarial science, due to its effect on the technical and financial stability of insurance companies. The purpose of this paper is to calculate the reserve in a decision-making environment, so that estimates can be made according to accurately defined and previously established rational criteria. Specifically, the estimating process enables a company’s particular situation to be taken into account, by incorporating its approach to the consequences arising from estimation errors into the model. The proposed calculation method gives rise to optimum link ratio estimators that can also be interpreted from a Bayesian perspective, with the advantages associated to such methodology.

Up until the mid-1800s convicts accounted for about one third of the population and with low literacy levels in the British colonies, Bookplates were reserved only for people who possessed personal libraries.|$|R
40|$|Forty-four Middle Bronze Age I weapons {{discovered}} at {{the sites of}} Byblos and Tell Arqa in Lebanon were investigated in order to study their copper quality and provenance. The evaluation of copper qualities is based on quantifying permanent inclusions such as copper sulfide and lead globules. The provenance of copper was studied using lead isotope analyses. For further discrimination between copper groups and sources elemental analyses by PIXE were performed {{on some of the}} weapons investigated. The results revealed two copper groups that could be qualified as “dirty” copper and “clean” copper. The former was used in most of the weapon types whereas the latter was <b>reserved</b> for <b>items</b> made of high-tin bronzes (> 11 wt%) which underwent heavy hammering during the manufacturing process. Even though several potential copper sources were identified, the data point to Iran and Oman as the most probable areas of origin for the metal used in these weapons.

50|$|Chesshyre {{has been}} {{credited}} with establishing the probable origins of the common error of using the term crest {{to refer to the}} whole achievement.

For this reason a number of publications appeared from the late 18th century through to the early 20th century which recorded only crests.
