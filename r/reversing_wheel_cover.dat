2500|$|The Budd Company {{kept the}} only {{prototype}} model, but later renamed it [...] "XR-Budd" [...] {{and used it}} for marketing purposes. The Rambler lettering on {{the rear of the}} trunk lid was removed, while the stamped steel wheels with full <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> were upgraded to chrome-plated <b>reverse</b> <b>wheels</b> with exposed lug nuts. Budd sold the prototype to The Henry Ford Museum in 1997. It is now at the museum and also displayed at major classic car shows.|$|R
50|$|Also new, (for 1978 only), were {{slightly}} revised standard Luxury <b>wheel</b> <b>covers,</b> with fewer ribs along the outside diameter of a slightly more-convex/bulging brushed center {{portion of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>cover.</b> This <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> style would then only appear one more time - on the downsized 1980 Lincoln Continental and Town Car and Town Coupé models.|$|R
5000|$|Specialty {{wheels of}} {{magnesium}} or aluminum alloy had come onto the market, and <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> were a cheap means of imitating their styling.

The first domestic automobile to use a full plastic <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> was the Chevy Monza that featured a [...] "wind blade" [...] design and came in several colors.|$|R

5000|$|In the U.S., {{during the}} age of custom cars (1950s-early 1960s), decorating one car with the <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> from another was common. Two very {{desirable}} <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> were those of the 1950 Cadillac (called the [...] "Sombrero") {{and that of the}} 1953 to 1955 Oldsmobile, which resembled a huge, three-tined spinner. Aftermarket suppliers included the [...] "Mooneyes" [...] brand (named after the firm's founder Dean Moon) hubcaps and <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> that were some of the first independently offered for hot rods and custom cars.|$|R
5000|$|A spare <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> or {{spare tire}} cover is an {{accessory}} that <b>covers</b> the spare <b>wheel</b> mounted on external {{part of a}} car or van.

Covers can be hard shells or soft vinyl <b>covers.</b> Spare <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> protects spare tires from the dirt and the sun's harmful UV rays in areas with many days of sunshine.

50|$|Another {{variant of}} the <b>wheel</b> <b>cover,</b> known also as wheel shrouds or rim blanking, is that {{commonly}} associated with the German wheelmaking brand BBS since the 1970s. These are attached onto the wheel first, then bolted on as if the driver or mechanic is bolting the wheel to his car {{in the manner of}} changing their wheel. Commonly made from aluminum, they are designed to distribute airflow to the brakes, thereby generating downforce depending on the shape. Thus, these <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> are functional rather than merely decorative.|$|R
