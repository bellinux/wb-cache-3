If 20 mM formate was added to the <b>reaction</b> <b>vials,</b> however, methane oxidation rates increased and inhibition of methane oxidation was observed in the presence of dichloromethane and trichloroethylene. In the presence of formate, dichloromethane acted as a competitive inhibitor, while trichloroethylene acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor.

These constants suggest that trichloroethylene competes with methane at some sites, although it can bind to others if methane is already bound. Whole-cell oxygen uptake experiments for active and acetylene-treated cells also showed that provision of formate could stimulate both methane and trichloroethylene oxidation and that trichloroethylene did not affect formate dehydrogenase activity. The finding that different chlorinated hydrocarbons caused different inhibition patterns can be explained by either multiple substrate binding sites existing in pMMO or multiple forms of pMMO with different activities.

2500|$|As {{noradrenaline}} is {{an intermediate}} {{on the path}} to adrenaline, dopamine is {{on the path to}} noradrenaline (and hence adrenaline.) In 1957 dopamine was identified in the human brain by researcher Kathleen Montagu. In 1958/59 Arvid Carlsson and his group in the Pharmacology Department of the University of Lund, including the medical students Åke Bertler and Evald Rosengren, not only found dopamine in the brain, but also – like noradrenaline in Marthe Vogt’s exemplary study – in uneven distribution, quite different from the distribution of noradrenaline. This argued for a function beyond an intermediate. The concentration was highest in the corpus striatum, which contained only traces of noradrenaline. Carlsson’s group had previously found that reserpine, which was known to cause a Parkinsonism syndrome, depleted dopamine (as well as noradrenaline and serotonin) from the brain. They concluded that ″dopamine is concerned with the function of the corpus striatum and thus with the control of motor function″. Thus {{for the first time the}} reserpine-induced Parkinsonism in laboratory animals and, by implication, Parkinson's disease in humans was related to depletion of striatal dopamine. A year later Oleh Hornykiewicz, who had been introduced to dopamine by Blaschko and was carrying out a colour reaction on extracts of human corpus striatum in the Pharmacological Institute of the University of Vienna, saw the brain dopamine deficiency in Parkinson’s disease ″with [...] own naked eye: Instead of the pink colour given by the comparatively high concentrations of dopamine in the control samples, the <b>reaction</b> <b>vials</b> containing the extracts of the Parkinson’s disease striatum showed hardly a tinge of pink discoloration″.|$|R
40|$|A {{recursive}} {{strategy that}} solves for the active {{members of a}} chemical library is presented. A pentapeptide library with an alphabet of Gly, Leu, Phe, and Tyr (1024 members) was constructed on a solid support by the method of split synthesis. One member of this library (NH 2 -Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu) is a native binder to a beta-endorphin antibody. A variation of the split synthesis approach is used to build the combinatorial library. In four vials, {{a member of the}} library's alphabet is coupled to a solid support. After each coupling, a portion of the resin from each of the four <b>reaction</b> <b>vials</b> was set aside and catalogued. The solid support from each vial is then combined, mixed, and redivided. The steps of (i) coupling, (ii) saving and cataloging, and (iii) randomizing were repeated until a pentapeptide library was obtained. The four pentapeptide libraries where the N-terminal amino acid is defined were screened against the beta-endorphin antibody and quantitated via an ELISA. The amino acid of the four pools that demonstrated the most binding was then coupled to the four tetrapeptide partial libraries that had been set aside and catalogued during the split synthesis. This recursive deconvolution was repeated until the best binders were deduced. Besides the anticipated native binder, two other members of the library displayed significant binding. This recursive method of deconvolution does not use a molecular tag, requires only one split synthesis, and {{can be applied to the}} deconvolution of nonlinear small-molecule combinatorial libraries and linear oligomeric combinatorial libraries, since it is based only on the procedure of the synthesis...|$|R
