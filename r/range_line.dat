30|$|Let F be the 2 D {{conventional}} image (reconstructed by the polar-format algorithm). Since {{we assume}} that the field to be imaged has a sparse structure (strong scatterers on a background of weak reflectivities), <b>range</b> <b>lines,</b> having much higher reflectivity values than the others, are likely to contain strong scatterers (belonging to moving and/or stationary objects). To find the <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> with strong scatterers, we first calculate the mean and standard deviation of reflectivities throughout the conventional image. The <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> in the image domain having at least one pixel with a reflectivity greater than the mean plus one standard deviation are selected as potential <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> including objects. To decide which of these <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> include moving objects, we use the idea of [20] which is based on the mapdrift autofocus technique [21]. First, two images are reconstructed from data corresponding to each of the two half apertures. While stationary objects lie in the same position in both images, moving objects will not appear in the same position since phase errors caused by moving objects will be different for each sub-aperture data. Therefore, if we compute the correlation coefficient for these <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> between the two sub-aperture images, we obtain small correlation coefficients for <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> including moving objects. Consequently, <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> having a correlation coefficient less than a pre-determined threshold are declared to be <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> with potential moving objects, i.e., the ROI. We have empirically chosen this threshold to be 0.7. When one is not sure how to choose this threshold, using a large value erring on the side of declaring more <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> as potentially containing moving objects would be the safe approach with a less reduction in computational cost with respect to the original version of our approach.|$|R

25|$|After {{the outer}} works fell, General Wilson led the 4th U.S. Cavalry Regiment in a mounted charge down the <b>Range</b> <b>Line</b> Road toward the {{unfinished}} inner line of works. The retreating Confederate forces, upon reaching the inner works, united and fired repeatedly together into the charging column.

25|$|Wilson's force {{arrived at}} the Selma fortifications at 2 p.m. He placed Gen. Eli Long's {{division}} across the Summerfield Road, with the Chicago Board of Trade Battery in support. Maj. Gen. Emory Upton's division was placed across the <b>Range</b> <b>Line</b> Road with Battery I, 4th U.S. Artillery in support. Wilson had 9,000 well-armed and well-trained troops available to make the assault. Wilson's plan was for Upton to send in a 300-man detachment after dark to cross the swamp on the Confederate right, enter the works, and begin a flanking movement toward the center moving {{along the line of}} fortifications. Then a single gun from Upton's artillery would fire the signal for an attack by the entire Federal Corps. At 5 p.m., however, the ammunition train in Wilson's rear was attacked by advance elements of Forrest's scattered forces who were moving toward Selma. Long and Upton had both positioned significant numbers of the troops in their rear to guard against such an event. However, Long decided on his own to begin an assault against the Selma fortifications to neutralize the attack in his rear.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, General Upton, observing Long's success, {{ordered his}} own {{division}} forward. Soon, U.S. flags {{could be seen}} waving over the works from <b>Range</b> <b>Line</b> Road to Summerfield Road. Once the outer works had fallen, General Wilson himself led the 4th U.S. Cavalry Regiment in a mounted charge down the <b>Range</b> <b>Line</b> Road toward the unfinished inner line of works. [...] The retreating Confederate forces, having reached the inner works, rallied and poured a devastating fire into the charging Union column. [...] This stopped the charge, and sent General Wilson sprawling to the ground when his favorite horse was wounded. Wilson quickly remounted his injured horse and ordered a dismounted assault by several regiments. Mixed units of Confederate troops at the Selma railroad depot and the adjoining banks of the railroad bed {{tried to make a}} stand next to the Plantersville Road (present day Broad Street). Fighting there was heavy, but by 7 p.m. the superior numbers of Union troops had allowed them to flank the Southern positions, causing the defenders to abandon the depot as well as the inner line of works.|$|E

At the latitude corresponding to this distance from the 49th parallel lay off 6.0750 mi ticks westwards from 110th meridian as you did at the 1st base line.

2500|$|The {{surveying}} of any regional area, {{such as a}} {{state or}} two, is a multi-step process. First, two controlling survey lines are established: a baseline, which runs east-west and a principal meridian, which runs north-south (Fig. 1). [...] The locations of the two are determined by a previously chosen initial point, where they originate and thus intersect. [...] Next, at a defined distance interval, commonly 24 or [...] depending on the year and location, standard parallels of latitude are established parallel to the baseline. [...] The meridian, baseline and standard parallels thus established form a lattice upon which all further surveying is then based. [...] Subsequent work divides the land into survey townships of roughly 36 square miles (~93km2) or 6 miles (~9.7km) on each side. This {{is done by the}} establishment of township and range lines. Township lines run parallel to the baseline (east-west), while range lines are true meridians and thus run north-south; each are established at six mile (10km) intervals. [...] Lastly, townships are subdivided into 36 sections of approximately one square mile (640 acres, ~2.6km2) and sections into four quarter-sections of 0.25 square mile (160 acres, ~0.65km2) each. [...] (See [...] ). The intersection of a township line (or baseline) with a <b>range</b> <b>line</b> (or principal meridian) constitutes a township corner, of a section line with any other type of line a section corner, and a point halfway between any two section corners a quarter corner. [...] The federal government typically surveyed only to this quarter-section level, the subdivision of smaller parcels being carried out subsequently by private surveyors after original sale.|$|E
2500|$|A {{specific}} and terse location descriptor is always used, {{in which the}} townships and sections are indexed based on (1) the township's position relative to the initial point, (2) the section's location within the designated township, and (3) the principal meridian reference. [...] Township, range, and section are abbreviated as T, R, and S, respectively, and cardinal bearings from the initial point by N, S, E, and W; each principal meridian also has its established abbreviation. [...] Thus, for example, the description [...] "T1SR20E S13 MDM" [...] reads as follows: Township 1 South, Range 20 East, Section 13, Mount Diablo Meridian. [...] That is, the 13th section in the first township south of the baseline (in this case, the Mount Diablo Baseline) and the 20th township east of the principal meridian (the Mount Diablo Meridian). [...] Since township and range lines are six miles apart, the [...] "T1SR20E" [...] part of the designation instantly places the location somewhere between zero and six {{miles south of the}} baseline, and 114 and 120 miles east of the principal meridian. [...] Knowing how sections are numbered within townships, we identify section 13 as therefore occupying the one square mile located 2 to 3 miles south, and 119 to 120 miles east, of the Mount Diablo initial point (in central California). [...] Note that the sections within a township are numbered in an unconventional, Boustrophedon pattern (Fig. 2), in which alternating rows are numbered in opposite directions, starting from section 1 in the northeast corner and ending with section 36 in the southeast corner, as per Figure 2. Therefore, section 13 is adjacent to the eastern <b>range</b> <b>line</b> of the designated township. [...] Numbering in this pattern ensures that numerically sequential sections within the same township are physically adjacent, and share colinear boundaries.|$|E

5000|$|Range {{roads are}} {{commonly}} numbered in one-mile (1.6-km) increments west {{from the east}} <b>range</b> <b>line</b> of a given township. The range roads form {{the east and west}} boundaries (known as Section Lines) of the 1 mile x 1 mile square sections - 36 of which comprise a township (e.g. Range Road 12-2 would be between the second and third sections west of <b>Range</b> <b>line</b> 12, Range Road 6-0 is on <b>Range</b> <b>line</b> 6). In many counties, the dash between the <b>range</b> <b>line</b> number and the section line number is eliminated (Range Road 15-1 (151) might be called [...] "Range Road one-fifty-one"). Where a township road offset from a section line, it is often appended with a letter (Range Road 11-1A is just west of the first section line west of <b>Range</b> <b>line</b> 11). This system is useful for finding farmsteads (assuming one knows the legal address of the parcel).|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the survey}} design is {{two-dimensional}} (rectangular), while the actual earth is three-dimensional (~ spherical), adjustments to land areas {{must be made}} periodically to prevent error propagation; not all sections can be one square mile nor can all townships be exactly 36 square miles. [...] More specifically, all north-south running <b>lines</b> (all <b>range</b> <b>lines</b> and half of all section lines), as with the prime meridian, are always established with reference to true, geodetic north.
