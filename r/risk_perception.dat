25|$|A {{large portion}} of risk {{prevention}} focuses on adolescents. Especially with health <b>risk</b> <b>perception,</b> adolescence is {{associated with an increased}} frequency of risky health-related behaviors such as smoking, drugs, and unsafe sex. While adolescents are aware of the risk, this awareness does not change behavior habits. Adolescents with strong positive optimistic bias toward risky behaviors had an overall increase in the optimistic bias with age.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of marketing, {{behavioural}} experiments which have dealt with managerial decision- making, and <b>risk</b> <b>perception,</b> in consumer decisions have utilised the Bayesian model, or similar models, but found {{that it may not}} be relevant quantitatively in predicting human information processing behaviour. Instead the model has been proven as useful as a qualitative means of describing how individuals combine new evidence with their predetermined judgements. Therefore, “the model may have some value as a first approximation to the development of descriptive choice theory” in consumer and managerial instances.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{vulnerability}} of young people to HIV/AIDS {{continues to be a}} serious concern in South Africa, no research has used a representative sample of South African youth to examine whether individual Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> change over time and, if they do, what factors are associated with change. Using data from the Cape Area Panel Study, a multi-racial, longitudinal study of youth and their households, this study examined whether youth change their HIV <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> over a four-year period and whether sexual behaviors, knowing someone with HIV, gender and race are associated with any change. Overall, changes in HIV <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> tend to be small. As predicted, sexual activity is associated with increases in <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Contrary to predictions, condom use at last sex is associated with increases in <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> and knowing someone with HIV is associated with decreases in <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions.</b> In addition, there is variation by gender and by race in the factors associated with change in <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions.</b> This study serves as an initial examination of change in the HIV <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> of South African youth; further investigation of their HIV <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> over time is needed...|$|R
40|$|Moderating binge {{drinking}} {{among young people}} remains a major health policy focus of European Union (EU) member states. <b>Risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> toward alcohol are an important predictor of consumption behavior. We analyze how alcohol policies and various sources providing information about alcohol's effects impact adolescents' <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> about alcohol. We employ the 2008 Flash Eurobarometer survey, 'Young people and drugs', with 12, 312 (15 - 24 year old) resident citizens across the 27 EU member states. After adjusting for inter-country variation, most alcohol policies tested had no significant influence on <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Only the blood alcohol concentration limit for driving and health warnings on advertisements and/or alcoholic beverage containers showed a significant effect, increasing <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> among adolescents. Three sources of information dissemination about alcohol's risks and effects showed significant influence on <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions.</b> While information {{about the risks of}} alcohol from parents increased <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions,</b> information from friends decreased it. The influence of media campaigns was only marginal, though indicating a small decrease in <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions.</b> If the desire is to increase <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions,</b> policy makers should emphasize the short-term effects and externalities of alcohol consumption as well as focus on the clear and salient dissemination of risk information that may influence the normative environment...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Among 11 - 12 year-old {{girls who}} {{received}} the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, we explored, over the subsequent 30 months: (1) trajectories of knowledge about HPV/HPV vaccines and vaccine-related risk perceptions; (2) whether knowledge and <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> impacted sexual attitudes and sexual experience; (3) whether mothers, clinicians, and media influenced girls' <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions,</b> attitudes, and behavior. METHODS: Girls and mothers (n= 25 dyads) completed separate, semi-structured interviews within 2 days of, and 6, 18, and 30 months after, their first HPV vaccine dose. Knowledge, <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> related to HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and attitudes about sexual behaviors were assessed. Sexual experience was assessed at girls' 30 month interviews. Clinicians completed interviews at baseline. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using framework analysis. RESULTS: Girls' baseline knowledge was poor but often improved with time. Most girls (n= 18) developed accurate <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> about HPV but only half (n= 12) developed accurate <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> about other STIs by 30 months. The vast majority of girls thought that safer sex was still important, regardless of knowledge, <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions,</b> or sexual experience. Girls whose HPV knowledge was high at baseline or increased over time tended to articulate accurate risk perceptions; those {{who were able to}} articulate accurate <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> tended to report not having initiated sexual activity. Girls whose mothers demonstrated higher knowledge and/or communication about HPV vaccination tended to articulate accurate <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions,</b> whereas clinicians and media exposure did not appear to influence <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Higher knowledge about HPV vaccines among mothers and girls was linked with more accurate <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> among girls. Clinicians may {{play an important role in}} providing education about HPV vaccines to mothers and girls...|$|R
25|$|In health, {{the optimistic}} bias tends to prevent {{individuals}} from taking on preventative measures for good health. Therefore, researchers {{need to be}} aware of the optimistic bias and the ways it can prevent people from taking precautionary measures in life choices. For example, people who underestimate their comparative risk of heart disease know less about heart disease, and even after reading an article with more information, are still less concerned about risk of heart disease. Because the optimistic bias can be a strong force in decision-making, it is important to look at how <b>risk</b> <b>perception</b> is determined and how this will result in preventative behaviors. Risk perceptions are particularly important for individual behaviors, such as exercise, diet, and even sunscreen use.|$|E
25|$|Although most HIV-infected {{individuals}} in China are drug users, patients infected through sexual transmission are {{the fastest growing}} group, accounting for close to 50% of new infections in 2005. Overall, they represent 43.6% of total HIV/AIDS cases, including commercial sex workers or their clients (19.6%), partners of HIV-infected individuals (16.7%), and {{men who have sex}} with men (7.3%). As with drug use, sexuality is not openly discussed in Chinese society and is therefore neither easily targeted by health promotion campaigns, nor has it traditionally been taught in schools. Even among university students, levels of AIDS knowledge and <b>risk</b> <b>perception</b> are alarmingly low. On the other hand, attitudes towards sex are becoming increasingly more liberal and, as a result, premarital and extramarital sex are more commonly practiced. Although they are widely available, condoms are rarely used.|$|E

40|$|Few studies {{examine the}} use of family history to {{influence}} <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> in the African American population. This study examined {{the influence of a}} family health history (FHH) intervention on <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> for breast (BRCA), colon (CRC), and prostate cancers (PRCA) among African Americans in Pittsburgh, PA. Participants (n[*]=[*] 665) completed pre- and post-surveys and FHHs. We compared their objective and perceived risks, classified as average, moderate, or high, and examined the accuracy of <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> before and after the FHH intervention. The majority of participants had accurate <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> post-FHH. Of those participants who were inaccurate pre-FHH, 43. 3 %, 43. 8 %, and 34. 5 % for BRCA, CRC, and PRCA, respectively, adopted accurate <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> post-FHH intervention. The intervention was successful in a community setting. It has the potential to lead to healthy behavior modifications because participants adopted accurate <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions.</b> We identified a substantial number of at-risk individuals who could benefit from targeted prevention strategies, thus decreasing racial/ethnic cancer disparities...|$|R

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>risk</b> <b>perception</b> and behavior is multifaceted. [...] Risk management {{is most effective}} once the motivation behind the behavior of disposing unused pharmaceuticals is understood. [...] There was little correlation found between the perception of risk and knowledge regarding pharmaceutical waste {{according to a study}} conducted by Cook and Bellis in 2001. [...] This study cautioned against the effectiveness of attempting to change the public’s behavior on these health issues by warning them of the risks associated with their actions. [...] It is advised to take careful measures to inform the public {{in a way that does}} not impart guilt but rather public awareness. [...] For example, a study carried out by Norlund and Garvill in Sweden (2003) [...] that found that some people may make a personal sacrifice in terms of comfort because they feel that it would be helpful to reduce further environmental damage caused by the use of cars. [...] Awareness of air pollution problems was a factor in their decision to take action on a more environmentally favorable choice of transportation. [...] Thus, the goal of Bound’s project encapsulates whether the perception of risk associated with pharmaceuticals has an effect on the way in which medication is commonly disposed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} conduct this study, the {{pharmaceuticals}} were grouped by their therapeutic action {{in order to}} help participants identify them. [...] The eight therapeutic groups are listed below: antibacterials, antidepressants, antihistamines, antiepileptics, hormone treatments, and lipid regulators. [...] Next, a survey was created to examine the disposal patterns of the participants and their perception of the existing risk or threat against the environment. [...] Respondents were asked the following questions in part one of the survey: 1. When and how they disposed of pharmaceuticals. 2. How they perceive the risk to the environment posed by pharmaceuticals. 3. To differentiate between the risks associated with different classed of pharmaceuticals. [...] Part two of the survey involved each of the eight pharmaceutical groups described above individually. Finally, the third part asked information about the age, sex, profession, postcode, and education of participants. [...] The sample size of participants was precise in comparison to the actual distribution of males and females in the UK: Sample- 54.8 percent were female and 45.2 percent male vs. Actual- the UK of 51.3 percent female to 48.7 percent male. [...] Results showed that when a medication must be discarded, 63.2 percent of participants throw them in a bin, 21.8 percent return them to a pharmacist, and 11.5 percent dispose of them via the toilet/sink, while the remaining 3.5 percent keep them. [...] Only half of the respondents felt like pharmaceuticals could potentially be harmful to the environment. [...] Upon examination of factors relevant to <b>risk</b> <b>perception,</b> there was no definite link found between perception and education or income.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine how}} {{family history of}} {{prostate}} cancer, <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions,</b> and heuristic decision strategies influence prostate cancer screening behavior. METHODS: Men with a first-degree family history of prostate cancer (FDRs; n = 207) and men without a family history (PM; n = 239) completed a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) examining prostate cancer <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions,</b> PSA testing behaviors, perceptions of similarity to the typical man who gets prostate cancer (representativeness heuristic), and availability of information about prostate cancer (availability heuristic). A path model explored family history as influencing the availability of information about prostate cancer (number of acquaintances with prostate cancer and number of recent discussions about prostate cancer) to mediate judgments of risk and to predict PSA testing behaviors and family history as a moderator {{of the relationship between}} representativeness (perceived similarity) and <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions.</b> RESULTS: FDRs reported greater <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> and a greater number of PSA tests than did PM. <b>Risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> predicted increased PSA testing only in path models and was significant only for PM in multi-Group SEM analyses. Family history moderated the relationship between similarity <b>perceptions</b> and <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> such that the relationship between these variables was significant only for FDRs. Recent discussions about prostate cancer mediated the relationships between family history and <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions,</b> and the number of acquaintances men knew with prostate cancer mediated the relationship between family history and PSA testing behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Family history interacts with the individuals' broader social environment to influence <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> and screening behavior.

To test the nomological validity of the SEC-framework, this study investigates whether the SEC-products influence the (1) level of importance consumers place on retailer attributes, (2) level and types of risks consumers perceive, and (3) consumer patronage intentions for Internet and physical stores. The relationships between the (4) importance consumers place on retailer attributes and their <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions,</b> and (5) <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> and patronage intentions for Internet and physical stores are investigated. The findings indicate while the importance of retailer attributes is equally significant across the four product classes, the SEC-products influence consumer <b>risk</b> <b>perceptions</b> and purchase-intentions for online and physical-stores.
