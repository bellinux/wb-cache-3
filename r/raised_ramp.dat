50|$|Flow-through {{ventilation}} is {{the main}} ventilation circuit for the mine. Air enters the mine from surface via a shaft, ventilation raise or adit. The air is distributed through the mine via internal ventilation <b>raises</b> and <b>ramps,</b> and flows are controlled by regulators and permanently mounted ventilation fans. An auxiliary ventilation system takes air from the flow-through system and distributes it to the mine workings via temporarily mounted ventilation fans, venturies and disposable fabric or steel ducting. Auxiliary fan and duct systems may be either forcing systems, where fresh air is pushed into mine headings, or exhausting systems that draw out contaminated air.|$|R

Track creation tools allow the player to easily build courses using more than 1,000 different construction blocks, which can then be played in single or multiplayer modes.|$|R
50|$|Several other {{vertical}} boilers, {{such as the}} Straker, {{had similar}} arrangements for lifting their shells off the tube nest. The Sentinel though left the outer shell in place and instead dropped the tube nest downwards (having first removed the ashpan). This had the advantages that it required simpler lifting gear: the waggon would be <b>raised</b> on <b>ramps</b> or over a pit, the bolts removed and then the tube bank lowered with a block and tackle from a fixed beam, without requiring a mobile crane that could lift it and then move it sideways. Secondly the many pipe connections to the outer shell were left undisturbed, making the operation quicker.|$|R
50|$|A wider, deeper {{concrete}} replacement {{was built}} under the original masonry. The approaches were deepened {{to a new}} lower tunnel level. The grades were aligned for the cars to enter from a shallow subway just below street level. The subway was not built, concrete <b>ramps</b> <b>raised</b> the tracks up to street grade. George W. Jackson was the contractor for rebuilding the tunnel.|$|R

Since many Marine Corps ground vehicles can run on aviation fuel, a refueling V-22 could also service them. In late 2014, it was stated that such tankers could be operational by 2017, but a contract delay pushed IOC to late 2019.|$|R
50|$|The pukao was {{balanced}} as {{a separate}} piece {{on top of the}} head of a moai. They are believed to have been <b>raised</b> using <b>ramps</b> possibly requiring only several people. The ring-like indentations along the bottom and edges of the pukao support this theory as they postulate a ramp made out of logs being used to roll the pukao to the tops of moai statues. In addition, various physicists have made models indicating this as a possibility, and given the oblong shape of pukao, the structures would have been easier to roll up the statue than roll back down. However, no one theory can be accepted as correct because virtually any theorized method (such as the use of pulleys) is plausible.|$|R

PC-552 was among the first ships to reach waters off Omaha Beach. PC-552, primary control vessel for Fox Green sector of the beach, was forced into rescue efforts and recovery of bodies at the departure line for Fox Green when the Duplex Drive tanks that survived the initial disastrous launch were swamped at the line with only two surviving. The PC was diverted into this effort for forty-five minutes and ultimately only five tanks, the two that survived the launch disaster and three that were aboard LCT-600 whose commander <b>raised</b> his <b>ramp</b> when the first off foundered and instead landed them on the beach, reached the beach.|$|R
2500|$|At 09:40 {{the signal}} to {{withdraw}} was sent to all the assault forces - [...] "Vanquish 1100 hours". This presented great difficulties for the LCAs as they were designed best to beach on rising tides and the tide would not rise again for some hours. A few soldiers managed to swim out and {{be picked up by}} friendly craft but many more were killed in the attempt. Unarmoured craft could not come near the beach because the fire was too heavy. Several LCAs went in to evacuate troops, including the four surviving craft of the 10th LCA Flotilla, but suffered due to the intense fire from mortars and machine-guns; two 10th Flotilla craft were sunk. When Ferguson saw that {{there was no sign of}} life on the beach, he reluctantly obeyed an order to withdraw. Only one craft, LCA 209, managed to touch down on Blue Beach for the evacuation and while taking wounded aboard it was unable to <b>raise</b> its <b>ramp</b> before it pushed off the beach. Grenades and mortar bombs added more casualties, and with men hanging on to LCA 209's sides, mortar bombs finally sank it. By 08:30 the Royal Regiment had surrendered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the Lane Hall began with the laying of the cornerstone in 1963, {{although there was no}} formal ceremony. The principal façade of the Lane Hall, from the north, is of four floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a <b>raised</b> carriage <b>ramp</b> and parapet, thus the façade appears to be of three floors. The central three bays are behind a prostyle portico (this was a later addition to the hall, built in 1970) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a porte cochere. The hall's southern façade is a combination of the Palladian and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is rusticated in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the façade is a neoclassical projecting triangular point of four bays. The point is flanked by two bays, the windows of which, as on the north façade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bows cover two staircase levels leading to a colonnaded loggia, next to Pettengill Hall. Lane Hall was constructed at a totaled cost of $630,000 ($4.8 million in 2016 U.S. dollars.) ...|$|R
5|$|The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was {{appointed}} {{to carry out the}} rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and <b>raise</b> the access <b>ramps,</b> reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|R
25|$|The {{size of the}} Cross of Sacrifice, a {{standard}} Commission structure used for cemeteries with over 40 graves, varies according {{to the number of}} burials in a cemetery. For this cemetery, a Type-A Cross, around 4 metres wide at the base and 6 metres high, would be used. Carved from Massangies, a French limestone, the shaft of the cross alone would weigh four tonnes, while the entire raised stone terrace would weigh many more tonnes. To support the weight of the Cross and the raised terrace on which it would stand, special foundations of twenty-six vertical 7-metre deep concrete piles were prepared, each capable of supporting ten tonnes, four of which would support the Cross itself. A connecting network was also built between the piles to ensure the load was spread evenly. The <b>raised</b> terrace includes <b>ramps</b> to allow access by wheelchair, and bastions for flower displays.|$|R
50|$|Classified {{as heavy}} rail {{according}} to UIC standards, the Talent is a two-, three- or four-part articulated railcar with Jacobs bogies. Partially {{as a result}} of this, the interior of an entire unit is essentially a single, long cabin; it is possible to see or walk from end to end without opening doors or passing through narrower gangways. The sharing of bogies also means that a Talent unit cannot be easily disassembled or rearranged without the assistance of a railway yard. In those variants whose floor is 590 mm above the rails, this means that the articulation floor is <b>raised,</b> but with <b>ramp</b> access, since it needs to be higher than the wheel diameter, above rail level. In the variants with 800 and 960 mm floor height, the floor is flat from the first door to the last. The endsections have a raised floor in all variants, because the traction equipment installed underneath requires more space than unpowered bogies.|$|R

After a three-day stopover at the Tunisian port at the end of July, she moved on to Naples where she unloaded her cargo on 2 August. Except for a brief excursion on the 6th and 7th to carry troops, vehicles, and provisions down the Italian coast to Salerno, she remained at Naples readying herself for [...] "Operation Dragoon", the invasion of southern France. On 9 August the tank landing ship embarked elements of the Army's 45th Division and awaited the order to depart for southern France. The order came on 12 August, and she left Castellamare Bay as a unit of Task Force (TF) 85, under the command of Rear Admiral Rogers. The task force reached Bougnon Bay during {{the early morning hours of}} 15 August. By 0742, LST-288 had dispatched her LCVPs and DUKWs, which brought her infantrymen to Delta Beach at 0930. Two hours later, she began transferring vehicles to attending LCTs by marrying the landing craft to her bow. The last vehicle rolled into an LCT at 1525, prompting the landing ship to <b>raise</b> the <b>ramp,</b> close the bow doors and join a convoy bound for Ajaccio, Corsica. Before she departed the area for Bizerte on 29 October, LST-288 made nine voyages to southern France and two to Livorno, Italy. During this period, she transported over 3,100 soldiers and 600 vehicles and removed 1,000 German POWs from France.|$|R

Such two-level voltage waveforms are used in some types of spread spectrum systems. Of interest in this work {{is the effect of}} shaping the normally rectangular pulses of the binary sequence. An objective is to find and tabulate particular sequences and specific shapes having desirable autocorrelation functions and power spectra. A direct and versatile method of shaping binary sequences is presented. Photographs of sequences having triangular, <b>raised</b> sine and <b>ramp</b> shapes are included in the report. Photographs of the autocorrelation function and spectra of selected shaped sequences are presented. The computer programs used to search for sequences of interest and used to calculate the autocorrelation function and spectra of particular shaped sequences are described. Shaped sequences having interesting spectra were discovered. For example, some spectra have very small side lobe levels; others have no discernible nulls in the spectra; some spectra have nulls which are not simply related to the sequence clock frequency (pulse rate).

5000|$|Kelley's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads: [...] For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in the afternoon while serving as commander of River Assault Division 152 during combat operations against enemy aggressor forces. Lt. Comdr. (then Lt.) Kelley was in charge of a column of 8 river assault craft which were extracting 1 company of U.S. Army infantry troops on the east bank of the Ong Muong Canal in Kien Hoa province, when 1 of the armored troop carriers reported a mechanical failure of a loading ramp. At approximately the same time, Viet Cong forces opened fire from the opposite bank of the canal. After issuing orders for the crippled troop carrier to <b>raise</b> its <b>ramp</b> manually, and for the remaining boats to form a protective cordon around the disabled craft, Lt. Comdr. Kelley realizing the extreme danger to his column and its inability to clear the ambush site until the crippled unit was repaired, boldly maneuvered the monitor in which he was embarked to the exposed side of the protective cordon in direct line with the enemy's fire, and ordered the monitor to commence firing. Suddenly, an enemy rocket scored a direct hit on the coxswain's flat, the shell penetrating the thick armor plate, and the explosion spraying shrapnel in all directions. Sustaining serious head wounds from the blast, which hurled him to the deck of the monitor, Lt. Cmdr. Kelley disregarded his severe injuries and attempted to continue directing the other boats. Although unable to move from the deck or to speak clearly into the radio, he succeeded in relaying his commands through 1 of his men until the enemy attack was silenced and the boats were able to move to an area of safety. Lt. Comdr. Kelley's brilliant leadership, bold initiative, and resolute determination served to inspire his men and provide the impetus needed to carry out the mission after he was medically evacuated by helicopter. His extraordinary courage under fire, and his selfless devotion to duty sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.|$|R
