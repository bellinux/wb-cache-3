5|$|Scotland {{were the}} only home nation {{to qualify for the}} 1974 FIFA World Cup after {{finishing}} ahead of Czechoslovakia and Denmark in their group. However, Bremner was nearly not selected by manager Willie Ormond after Ormond found him drunk in a bar not long after Jimmy Johnstone had to be rescued by the Coast guard having gotten stranded in a <b>rowing</b> <b>boat</b> during a night out following a Home Internationals match with Northern Ireland. Having been selected, Bremner captained Scotland to a 2–0 win over Zaire at the Westfalenstadion. A highly creditable 0–0 draw with World Champions Brazil left Scotland with high hopes of qualifying to the Second Round. Yet a 1–1 draw with Yugoslavia sent Scotland out of the competition unbeaten due to Brazil and Yugoslavia finishing level on points but with superior goal difference.|$|E
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether {{the wind is blowing}} from one side or the other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a <b>rowing</b> <b>boat).</b> These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
5|$|Several {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} {{the construction of the}} bridge. A baulk of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped, and another died when he fell from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only {{a few days after the}} bridge's opening, a <b>rowing</b> <b>boat</b> trying to pass underneath was caught in a giant eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting hawser snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Tommy Docherty was {{appointed}} manager in 1971 {{and had a}} brief, but successful, time in charge. Docherty lost only three of his 12 matches as manager, but he left the job in late 1972 to become manager of Manchester United. Despite losing 5–0 to England in his first match in charge, Scotland qualified for the 1974 World Cup under the management of Willie Ormond. Scotland performed creditably at the finals, winning against Zaire and drawing against Brazil and Yugoslavia, but were eliminated on goal difference. Ormond suffered from player indiscipline during his tenure, which included an infamous incident where Jimmy Johnstone, after a night out drinking, sat in a <b>rowing</b> <b>boat</b> that was drifting out to sea. Two teammates attempted to rescue Johnstone, but eventually {{he had to be}} retrieved by local fishermen. Ormond left the Scotland job in 1977 to become manager of Hearts.|$|E

50|$|The park {{contains}} two large lakes, with one {{dedicated to the}} sailing of model boats, and the other larger lake historically having played host to <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> for hire to the general public.

50|$|Originally the <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> {{were located}} on a large {{artificial}} lake together with canoes. In 1976 the division between the <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> and canoes {{was replaced by a}} rope bridge. This rope bridge later became part of the decor of the Piraña. The Piraña was partly built on the rowing pond, so the boats had to be moved. The canoes were taken out of the park altogether with the coming of the Flying Dutchman. Later, the <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> were abolished aswell. The sight now hosts the Aquanura water show.|$|R

25|$|In 1920, a <b>rowing</b> <b>boat</b> (later hire {{boat and}} ferry) service {{operated}} across Cockle Creek, however a footbridge {{was constructed in}} 1928. In 1930 the steam tram service ceased operations, but {{was replaced by a}} private bus service in 1931. Two routes were opened by the government in 1937, whilst an industrial port bus service began operation in 1938. Sewerage systems were put in place in 1945, and two public schools opened in January 1957 and January 1959.|$|E
25|$|In Townsville {{until the}} {{completion}} of the Victoria Bridge in 1889, the only passage across Ross Creek was by ferry. First a <b>rowing</b> <b>boat</b> and later a larger vessel was introduced into service {{as a result of the}} increase in population. Circa 1923, Kuranda plied between Townsville and Cooktown calling at Palm Island, Lucinda, Mourilyan Harbour, Cairns, Port Douglas and Cooktown. After receiving passengers and mail the vessel left Townsville at 13:00. on Mondays, arriving at Cooktown on Wednesdays. It departed at 16:00 the same day and arrived back in Townsville on Fridays at 16:00 after calling at all ports mentioned.|$|E

25|$|<b>Rowing</b> <b>boat</b> races {{started in}} the city {{more than a hundred}} years ago. It was {{originally}} practiced by young men from traditional families, who spent their summer vacations there. The sport is a leisure option in Cidade Baixa (the lower part of the city). Esporte Clube Vitória and Clube São Salvador were the pioneers in the sport. Nowadays, these two entities and also Clube de Regatas Itapagipe lead the competitions that take place in the city. With the recent renovation of the Dique do Tororó area, Salvador received new lanes for the practice of the sport.|$|E
25|$|While he {{commanded}} at Jamaica, Hyde Parker sent regular reports of warships and merchant vessels captured or {{destroyed by the}} ships under his command. At various times from October 1799 to February 1800, Quebec seized American, French or Danish merchant ships bound for ports in the Americas or Caribbean with cargoes as diverse as cocoa, lumber, wine, soap & sundries, flour, sugar, cotton, honey and hides. A Spanish vessel, Nostra Senora del Carmen “laden with fustie and brazil” was captured in March or April. Between May and August 1800, Quebec took captive an armed <b>rowing</b> <b>boat</b> with a crew of 19 men, a small schooner (name unknown) and six small merchant vessels cut out at different times.|$|E

25|$|At the {{invitation}} of the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos he submitted a plan on 20 October 1919 {{for the creation of}} a new University at Smyrna in Asia Minor, to be named Ionian University of Smyrna. In 1920 Carathéodory was appointed Dean of the University and took a major part in establishing the institution, touring Europe to buy books and equipment. The university however never actually admitted students due to the War in Asia Minor which ended in the Great Fire of Smyrna. Carathéodory managed to save books from the library and was only rescued at the last moment by a journalist who took him by <b>rowing</b> <b>boat</b> to the battleship Naxos which was standing by. The present day University of the Aegean claims to be a continuation of Carathéodory's original plan.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt was}} made in the 1870s to {{introduce}} academic rowing after the Oxbridge model. The Stockholm Nation acquired a <b>rowing</b> <b>boat</b> in 1877, soon followed by the Gothenburg Nation, and {{for a number of years}} rowing competitions were held between teams from the two nations. Although rowing never got the strong position it has at the English universities, an annual Uppsala-Lund regatta has been arranged since 1992, between rowing teams from Uppsala and Lund University. The race is held on the Fyris River in Uppsala on even years, and on a river in the vicinity of Lund on odd years. Each year there is at least one full eight crew with cox competing, with both men's and women's teams present. With the recent victory for Uppsala in 2005, the score stands 24–23 in Uppsala's favor.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 1862, in a <b>rowing</b> <b>boat</b> {{travelling}} on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow for {{a picnic}} outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story. As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole. The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Mr. Dodgson {{to write it down}} for her. He promised to do so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.|$|E
