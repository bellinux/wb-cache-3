Methods: Data derived from the California Health Interview Survey 2007, which was a random-digit-dial population-based survey, were used. Latina (n[*]=[*] 3513) and Asian American (n[*]=[*] 2538) women were included in this study. Breast and cervical cancer screenings were measured by recent mammography and Pap smear examinations, respectively.

40|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years, HIV has become a {{worldwide}} epidemic. Given the surge {{in the rate of}} sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, this sheds light as a new worry for sexually active older adults, raising questions about <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors</b> among this group. The issues facing older adults are three-fold in that they are 1) not identifying themselves as being at risk; 2) not identifying risk behaviors; and 3) are not largely being identified in the public realm as participating in <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors.</b> For these reasons, understanding both environmental and individual factors and their unique influences on HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors</b> among older adults is very important. A study was undertaken to develop an understanding of the environmental and individual population factors that predict HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors</b> among older adults using population- based data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and eight state level data sources, guided by Andersen 2 ̆ 7 s Behavioral Model of Health Utilization (2007). The model investigated the predictive ability of social and environmental factors in addition to individual factors on HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Methods: The research design for the study was a multilevel repeated cross-sectional design with a three level nested structure. The software package MLwiN was used to conduct the multilevel analysis using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) analytical method to assess the fit of models with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation. Using a nationally representative sample of 23, 950 individuals from 2008 to 2011, nested in 51 states, the trend study allowed for an understanding of the state and individual-level factors that predict participating in HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Results: In each step, the model fit improved the DIC statistic. Overall, the results indicated that there were differences between states and their levels of HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors.</b> While HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors</b> decreased from 2008 to 2011, there was significant variation between and within states in the probability of individual HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors.</b> States that had a higher percentage white females, a higher percentage of persons uninsured, a higher percentage of whites with AIDS, a lower percentage of Asians with AIDS, and a lower percentage of Other races with AIDS had a higher probability of individuals participating in HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors.</b> All of the individual predictors of HIV <b>risk</b> <b>behaviors</b> were statistically significant.
