25|$|James Clerk Maxwell's 1862 {{insight that}} both light and radiant heat were forms of {{electromagnetic}} wave {{led to the}} start of the quantitative analysis of thermal radiation. In 1879, Jožef Stefan observed that the total <b>radiant</b> <b>flux</b> from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature and stated the Stefan–Boltzmann law. The law was derived theoretically by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1884.|$|E
25|$|Photon mapping {{is another}} method that uses both light-based and eye-based ray tracing; in an initial pass, {{energetic}} photons are traced along rays {{from the light}} source so as to compute an estimate of <b>radiant</b> <b>flux</b> {{as a function of}} 3-dimensional space (the eponymous photon map itself). In a subsequent pass, rays are traced from the eye into the scene to determine the visible surfaces, and the photon map is used to estimate the illumination at the visible surface points. The advantage of photon mapping versus bidirectional path tracing is the ability to achieve significant reuse of photons, reducing computation, at the cost of statistical bias.|$|E
25|$|As Huygens was {{primarily}} an atmospheric mission, the DISR instrument was optimized {{to study the}} radiation balance inside Titan's atmosphere. Its visible and infrared spectrometers and violet photometers measured the up- and downward <b>radiant</b> <b>flux</b> from an altitude of 145 kilometers down to the surface. Solar aureole cameras measured how scattering by aerosols varies the intensity directly around the Sun. Three imagers, sharing the same CCD, periodically imaged a swath of around 30 degrees wide, ranging from almost nadir to just above the horizon. Aided by the slowly spinning probe they would build up a full mosaic of the landing site, which, surprisingly, became clearly visible only below 25 kilometers altitude. All measurements were timed by aid of a shadow bar, which would tell DISR when the Sun had passed through the field of view. Unfortunately, this scheme was upset {{by the fact that}} Huygens rotated in a direction opposite to that expected. Just before landing a lamp was switched on to illuminate the surface, which enabled measurements of the surface reflectance at wavelengths which are completely blocked out by atmospheric methane absorption.|$|E
30|$|However, this is {{contradictory}} to {{the request of}} higher <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes,</b> which are favoured by larger globe-top sizes.|$|R
30|$|Nonetheless, if {{only one}} of these parameters, like colour {{maintenance}} or high <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> is of particular importance for a specific application, the size of the globe-top can be adjusted to meet these requirements at best.|$|R

These data are used to establish both the fractions of spectral components to global solar radiation and the proposed linear regression models. Verification {{results indicated that the}} proposed regression models predict accurately the spectral <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> at least for the Brazilian environment. Finally, results obtained in this analysis agreed well with most published results in the literature. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. FAPESPCAPESCNP...|$|R

40|$|The {{exchange}} of <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> between different surfaces in outdoor urban environment {{can be described}} based on the theoretical framework of enclosure theory (or net-radiation method) {{in order to have}} a general understanding of the relation between different surfaces and consequent <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> and hence the Tmrt within the enclosure. To apply the theory, the required enclosure could be constructed by including the real surfaces of building facade and the imaginary surface of sky dome. The mean radiant temperature at a point within the enclosure could be determined if each surface temperature Ti is solved given a known input energy flux qi is imposed to each surface. At any instant, the surface energy balance holds for every surface of the enclosure by energy conservation. However, the enclosure theory requires certain assumption, idealizations and computations. For example, each surface of the enclosure are assumed to be gray, diffuse and at a different uniform temperature. But most of the real materials are not black, gray nor diffuse. The area of the enclosure may also be subdivided into smaller areas on a basis of uniform surface temperature over those smaller areas. It may require excessive computational time by dividing an area into too many smaller ones as for each surface there are two equations to be solved (not shown in the text). A system of 2 N equations has to be solved if there are N surfaces ‘recognized’ in the enclosure, or in turn in the urban environment. This has also given rise to the difficulties in ‘recognizing’ individual ‘surface’ of uniform temperature in the real outdoor spaces surrounded by buildings with sunlit areas, tress with leaves, and so on. To put it simply, by treating the urban structure as a ‘black box’ and using regression analysis, the objective of this study is to identify and evaluate the empirical relation between <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> from directions within urban context in daytime. The urban environment will be captured in fish eye photos and decomposed into different components based on materials and properties. <b>Radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> will be measured and regressed on those view factors.

30|$|As {{evident from}} these studies, which were {{performed}} for LED packages with CCEs in globe-top configuration, optimized CCE design in regard of CCT maintenance, <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> and low thermal load may be counteractive. Considering {{the fact that}} the reflectivity of the substrate surface is prone to some long term reduction because of materials degradation, a globe-top of smaller size seems to be preferable in regard of CCT maintenance. On the other hand, a smaller globe-top size gives reason for much higher maximum temperatures within the globe-top during device operation and much larger temperature variations for different driving currents, which again may induce pronounced colour variations and may amplify long-term materials degradation. A compromise based on globe-top configurations of medium sizes therefore seems to be the best strategy to meet all the requirements of colour maintenance, <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes,</b> and low maximum temperatures at once.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an inverse {{model of the}} radiation transfer processes occurring in the solar domain in vegetation plant canopies. It uses a gradient method to minimise the misfit between model simulation and observed <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> plus the deviation from prior information on the unknown model parameters. The second derivative of the misfit approximates uncertainty ranges for the estimated model parameters. In a second step, uncertainties are propagated from parameters to simulated <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> via the model's first derivative. All derivative information is provided by highly efficient code generated via automatic differentiation of the radiative transfer code. The paper further derives and evaluates an approach for avoiding secondary minima of the misfit. The approach exploits the smooth dependence of the solution on the observations, and relies on a data base of solutions for a discretised version of the observation space. JRC.

40|$|High-density urban {{environment}} affects urban microclimate, and thermal comfort of outdoor spaces. Shading by urban structure {{is the primary}} measure to reduce daytime mean radiant temperature (MRT) by blocking direct solar radiation. However, {{it is believed that}} overly-restricted Sky View Factor (SVF) limits the radiative cooling by the sky of lower effective temperature. Therefore, this study aimed at examining the relationship between SVF and MRT in built environment. To investigate the dependence of MRT on SVF via <b>radiant</b> <b>ﬂuxes,</b> this study performed ﬁeld measurement of six directional long-wave, short-wave ﬂuxes and MRT across a number of outdoor spaces under shaded in densely built environment. Regression analysis was employed in examining desired relationships. Across different open spaces, MRT would increase by 1. 6 K per 10 W/m 2 increase of either long-wave or short-wave <b>radiant</b> <b>ﬂuxes.</b> Global solar radiation and air temperature are the most inﬂuential meteorological parameters affecting <b>radiant</b> <b>ﬂuxes</b> components in MRT. Besides, this study suggests the use of long-wave mean radiant temperature (LMRT) representing effective surface temperature of surrounding objects. LMRT generally follows the temporal pattern of reference air temperature. In a case study, if SVF is decreased by 0. 1, the weighted sum of long-wave ﬂuxes would be increased by 10 W/m 2. This would bring an increase of 1. 6 K in MRT. But, SVF has weak explanatory power to variations in short-wave ﬂuxes when under shaded. Larger SVF is preferred for cooling open space in hot and humid region if direct sunlight is already blocked by urban morphology...|$|R

In this regard, it is of essential importance to understand how geometrical, optical and thermal properties of the colour conversion elements (CCEs), which typically consist of phosphor particles embedded in a transparent matrix material, affect the constancy of a desired CCT value. In this contribution we use an LED assembly consisting of an LED die mounted on a printed circuit board by chip-on-board technology and a CCE with a globe-top configuration on the top of it as a model system and discuss the impact of the CCE size, the substrate reflectivity as well as the thermal load of the CCEs on CCT maintenance and the respective <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes.</b> It turns out that optimized solutions for CCT maintenance and high <b>radiant</b> <b>fluxes</b> in regard of one of the relevant influence factors {{do not need to be}} optimized solutions in regard of another one.|$|R
