Pitt Hyde {{purchased}} an existing tavern in about 1801, and expanded the premises, which included a mineral spring reputed to have restorative properties. When the main house burned in 1861, James K. Hyde, Pitt's son, built the present surviving main house. The complex continued to grow under Aruna Hyde, who added amenities, including a bowling alley, dance hall, and, in 1909, a nine-hole golf course designed by Horace Rawlins and George Sargent. The property declined due to changes in recreational habits after the world wars of the 20th century, and was sold out of the Hyde family in 1962. It closed permanently in 1973, although water from its spring continued to be bottled and sold. [...] The complex is now functionally abandoned and in deteriorated condition.|$|E

In the visually dominated strategy, subjects base their wayfinding decisions on visually recognizing decision points along a route; the decision points are not integrated into any kind of survey representation.

Each positive customer entering {{the network is}} character-ized {{by a set of}} stochastic parameters: customer route, the length of customer route, customer volume and his service length at each <b>route</b> <b>stage</b> as well.

Negative customers arriving at each node also form a Poisson flow. A negative customer entering a node with k customers in service, with probability 1 /k chooses one of served positive customer as a “target”. Then, if the node is of a type 0 the negative customer immediately “kills ” (displaces from the network) the target customer, and if the node is of types 1 – 3 the negative customer with given probability depending on parameters of the target customer route kills this customer and with complementary probability he quits the network with no service.

40|$|The {{choices that}} {{airlines}} make about the aircraft they fly, {{the number of}} seats they have on each aircraft, the routes they fly and the passenger segments they focus on have significant impacts on their environmental performance (which can be assessed {{in terms of an}} airline’s CO 2 emissions per passenger kilometre, fuel burn or other suitable metric). Each of the main airline business models (network, charter, low cost carrier (LCC), regional) involves practices that may improve or degrade environmental performance. This project analyses the factors that affect each business model’s environmental performance and considers the potential for changes to business models to improve the environmental sustainability of the aviation sector. The evolution of aircraft fuel consumption, average sector length and CO 2 emission levels (per passenger kilometre) were investigated. From 1986 to 2004 total fuel consumed by European airlines 1 increased by 220 %, while the amount of fuel consumed per passenger km has decreased by 27 % (or 2 % per year). Average distance flown has increased by 21 % and the average number of passengers carried per flight by 5 %. The CO 2 emissions of intra-EU air services from the UK generated by each business model (network, LCC, charter, regional) was established for the years 1997, 2000 and 2006. Emissions were estimated by <b>route,</b> <b>stage</b> length, aircraft type used, number of seats supplied on each aircraft and the distance flown, following the IPCC recommended approach to carbon dioxide calculation. The LCCs share of total emissions has risen to 46 % of all intra-EU routes originating in the UK in 2006 from 12 % in 1997. At 112 g/pkm this group’s CO 2 emissions are lower than either network carriers or regional airlines (at 144 g/pkms and 216 g/pkms respectively) in the EU market. However the lowest emissions level is achieved by charter airlines at 106 g/pkm. Some activities airlines have undertaken to reduce on-board weight were also considered. These include reducing water carriage, lowering tankered fuel levels and re-designing the duty free sales process. A calculator that estimates the carbon dioxide emissions that can be prevented by removing weight from a number of aircraft types was developed. It estimates that 456. 2 tonnes of CO 2 emissions can be prevented if an airline operating a daily North Atlantic service with a Boeing 747 - 400 could reduce 1 tonne (metric) from its takeoff weight. One of the main policy instruments that can internalise the environmental costs of aviation is the European Emissions Trading Scheme. Prior to its introduction the UK government has increased its Air Passenger Duty as a quasi-environmental taxation measure. The success of such fiscal measures in dampening the demand for air transport will largely depend on the price elasticity of demand and indicative ranges for long and short haul leisure and business passengers are given. A model of air transport CO 2 emissions, which was developed to test various scenarios, suggests that should current growth rates continue, emissions for the global aviation market may grow by over 50 % between 2009 and 2020. With high growth rates, the share of emissions for low cost carriers would also grow significantly, however, {{it is also clear that}} network carrier’s growth of long haul flying also means that the absolute emissions levels of this group is also likely to rise. The output of the model is used to test the sensitivity of changes to business model, such as increasing load factors, increasing the number of seats on board an aircraft, and differing growth rates for each business model. A stakeholder workshop and seminar for this project and a sister Omega project “Passenger Expectations” was held in December 2008. Key outcomes of the seminar was that passengers seem to have little appetite for changes in behaviour (such as willingness to take fewer longer overseas holidays or to holiday within the UK) that might reduce the demand for air services and that further passenger education regarding the relative impact of flying compared to other GHG generating activities is required. Further research is required to assess passenger willingness to forego service levels, timetable frequency, flight times to maximise load factors, minimise aircraft weight and therefore fuel consumption. Future studies may extend this work in two ways: assessing the feasibility of fully adopting the various weight reduction strategies suggested for airlines; and by investigating network carriers’ freight operations as a source of carbon dioxide emissions.

40|$|The recent {{progress}} in VLSI process technologies {{enables us to}} integrate {{a large number of}} transistors on one chip, and significantly improves the circuit performance. On the other hand, due to the ever-increasing design complexity of the VLSI, we could never design any competitive SoCs within practical time-to-market without automated design techniques. One of the major automated design methodologies for designing VLSIs is the cell-based design. In this design flow, we use a standard-cell library. The characteristics of cells including cell delay, area, and power as well as yield are used in the logic synthesis stage, and the physical layout of each cell is used in the place & <b>route</b> <b>stage.</b> As is clear from this design flow, standard cells are the most fundamental components of VLSI, and provide the building blocks for creating large complex functions in both application-specific and semi-custom domains. Therefore, their performance has significant effects on the final performance of the synthesized VLSI. This thesis focuses on the optimization methods for standard-cell layouts. We propose minimum-width transistor placement and intra-cell routing via Boolean satisfiability to optimize the area of the cell layouts. We also propose a comprehensive cell layout synthesis method and a cell layout de-compaction method for yield optimization. //Chapter 2 proposes a minimum-width layout synthesis method for dual CMOS cells via Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). Cell layout synthesis problems, i. e., the transistor placement and the intra-cell routing problems are first transformed into SAT problems by this formulation. The proposed method guarantees to generate the minimum-width cells with routability under our layout styles. This method places complementary P and N type transistors individually during transistor placement, and can generate smaller width layout compared with the case of pairing the complementary P and N type transistors. Our method generates the cell layouts of 30 static dual CMOS logic circuits in 58 % runtime with only 5 % area increase compared with the commercial cell generation tool with cell layout compaction. This result shows that our cell layout styles defined for the SAT formulation is practical enough to generate the layout quickly with a little area overhead. Since this method still has a restriction in gate connection style between P and N type transistors, it is applicable only to dual CMOS cells. The extension of the transistor placement method to non-dual cells is explained in Chapter 4. //Chapter 3 describes a hierarchical extension of the cell layout synthesis method proposed in Chapter 2 for the cell layout synthesis of large dual CMOS cells. This method partitions a given transistor-level netlist into blocks considering the transistor connections by diffusions. Intra-block placement uses an exact transistor placement method proposed in Chapter 2, and hierarchically generates the transistor placement with routability. The comparison results with the flat cell layout synthesis method for 30 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method generates the same width layout as the flat method except one circuit and drastically reduces the runtime for cell layout synthesis. The comparison results with the commercial cell generation tool without cell layout compaction show that the total cell width of the proposed method is increased about 4 % due to the layout style restriction, whereas the runtime is only about 3 % of that of the commercial tool. From these results, we can conclude that the proposed method {{can be used as a}} quick layout generator in the area of transistor-level circuit optimization such as on-demand cell layout synthesis. //Chapter 4 shows flat and hierarchical approaches for generating a minimum-width transistor placement of CMOS cells in presence of non-dual P and N type transistors, whereas the cell layout synthesis methods proposed in the previous chapters are only for dual cells. This chapter targets the minimum-width transistor placement, and does not take the intra-cell routings into consideration. Our approaches are the first exact transistor placement method which can be applied to CMOS cells with any types of structure, whereas almost all of the conventional exact transistor placement method is applicable only to dual CMOS cells. Since non-dual CMOS cells occupy a major part of an industrial standard-cell library, the exact minimum-width transistor placement should be applied even to non-dual CMOS cells. The flat single-row approach generates smaller width placement for 29 out of 103 dual cells than the transistor placement method for dual cells explained in Chapter 2 which theoretically generates the smallest width placement among the existing exact methods. The experimental results show that it is not only applicable to CMOS cells with any types of structure, but also more effective even for dual CMOS cells compared with the transistor placement method only for dual cells. The hierarchical single-row approach which is based on circuit partitioning reduces the runtime drastically and generates 81 % of 340 cells in an industrial standard-cell library of a 90 nm technology within one hour for each cell, whereas the flat approach and the exact method for dual cells generates 43 % and 32 %, respectively. This chapter also shows the generalization results of the single-row transistor placement method into the multi-row placement and proposes an exact minimum-width multi-row transistor placement method for general CMOS cells. The experimental results of the multi-row placement method show that the proposed method generates more area-efficient placement than the conventional method only for dual cells by using the gate connection style which is more suitable for multi-row transistor placement than the conventional style, and can solve the cells with up to 26 transistors in reasonable runtime. //Chapter 5 introduces a cell layout synthesis technique to optimize the yield. The yield cost metric used in the proposed method is the sensitivity to wiring faults due to spot defects. The sensitivity to faults on intra-cell routings is modeled with consideration to the spot defects size distribution and the end effect of critical areas. The effect of the sensitivity reduction on the yield is also discussed in this chapter. The minimum-width cell layout of CMOS logic cells are comprehensively generated using the transistor placement method proposed in Chapter 2 and the comprehensive intra-cell routing method proposed in this chapter. The yield optimal layouts are selected from the exhaustively-generated layouts by using the proposed sensitivity to wiring faults as a cost function. Our cell layout synthesis technique generates the minimum width layouts of CMOS logic cells comprehensively, and selects the optimal layouts based on the cost functions. The experimental results on our comprehensive layout synthesis method to 8 CMOS logic circuits which have up to 14 transistors show that the fault sensitivities are reduced about 15 % on an average by selecting the minimum-sensitivity layouts rather than selecting the minimum-wire-length layouts. Our layout synthesis method is applicable for deriving the optimal cell layouts by some other cost metrics, such as power, delay, and signal integrity, if reasonable cost functions are given. //Chapter 6 proposes a timing-aware cell layout de-compaction method for yield optimization using Linear Programming (LP). The proposed method performs a de-compaction of the original layout in order to improve the yield by minimizing the Critical Area (CA) inside the cell. This yield improvement procedure is executed under given timing constraints. To formulate the timing constraints as LP, a new accurate linear delay model which approximates the difference from the original delay is also proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method for OPC mask data volume reduction is also shown in this chapter. This timing-aware de-compaction framework is extended to the redundant contact insertion adjacent to the original single contacts to minimize the yield loss due to contact failure. To take the parametric yield into account, the proposed method is also extended to the gate layout pattern regularity enhancement to reduce the systematic variation of the gate critical dimensions (CD). Experimental results show that the developed delay model is accurate enough to constrain the delay during de-compaction. The CA is correctly minimized under given timing constraint, and the maximum CA reduction is about 25 % on an average of 8 cells. Experimental results on a 90 nm cell layouts show that the proposed method is also effective for OPC mask data volume reduction and reduces the fractured mask data size 4. 28 % on an average in the case that 10 % delay increase is allowed. The proposed redundant contact insertion method under the timing-aware de-compaction framework inserts the redundant contacts as many as possible under given timing and area constraints using LP. The extension of the de-compaction method to a gate layout pattern regularity enhancement is also shown to be effective to reduce the systematic variation of the gate CD. With 10 % allowable delay increase, 73. 7 % gates of 25 cells in a 90 nm technology are placed perfectly on-pitch by the proposed method. Experiment on the edge placement error (EPE) estimation shows that the standard deviation of the gate CD EPE distribution is reduced by about 28 % compared with that of the original layouts. The proposed timing-aware yield enhancement method enables us to explore the trade-off between performance and yield. We can pick up the yield/performance variants from the trade-off curve and provide a yield-enhanced library. The proposed method is the essential technique to realize the yield-aware VLSI design methodologies. //We are sure that these results in this thesis such as the exact minimum-width cell layout synthesis techniques, the comprehensive cell layout synthesis method, and the cell layout de-compaction method for yield optimization will be used for standard-cell layout optimization in terms of area, delay, and yield, and contribute to the VLSI performance and reliability improvements. 報告番号: 甲 22286; 学位授与年月日: 2007 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 6491 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電子工学専...|$|E
