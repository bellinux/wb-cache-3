40|$|The method {{involves}} using a {{collimated light}} beam with a circular cross-section, which is transferred into a convergent light beam with an annular cross-section. The light beam is directed onto the cylindrical component mantle surface at an acute angle to its longitudinal axis, for uniform illumination of a cylindrical {{section of the}} component surface. The radially dispersed light received from the illuminated area of the mantle surface of the component is detected and evaluated. the beam may {{be divided into two}} partial beams, each of which illuminates a half-cylinder surface of the cylindrical section. The light beam from a collimated source (1) may be converted into a convergent beam directed by a semi-reflective mirror (6) onto the mantle surface of the component. The dispersed light from the cylindrical component may be reflected by a rotationally symmetrical reflector (10) and fed through the semi-reflective mirror onto a detector, e. g. a camera (13).

50|$|The {{locomotive}} had {{an inner}} main frame similar to steam engine practice, with the axles supported by springs {{attached to the}} frame by tensioned <b>rods,</b> the center <b>axle</b> had 0.5 in side play. The jackshaft was mounted in horn guides with the reduction gear totally enclosed {{on the left side}} of the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|A cage gear, {{also called}} a lantern gear or lantern pinion has {{cylindrical}} rods for teeth, {{parallel to the}} axle and arranged {{in a circle around}} it, much as the bars on a round bird cage or lantern. The assembly is held together by disks at each end, into which the tooth <b>rods</b> and <b>axle</b> are set. Cage gears are more efficient than solid pinions, and dirt can fall through the rods rather than becoming trapped and increasing wear. They can be constructed with very simple tools as the teeth are not formed by cutting or milling, but rather by drilling holes and inserting rods.|$|R

50|$|The {{channel section}} chassis had {{suspension}} by leaf springs {{at the front}} and a mix of leaf springs and torsion bars at the rear. At the front semi-elliptical springs were used with radius arms controlling fore and aft movement of the axle. The radius arms were joined by a torsion bar {{across the front of}} the chassis to act as an anti-roll bar. At the rear the quarter-elliptical springs had their front ends mounted in a boss that was attached to a short transverse torsion bar which controlled the rotation of the boss making the suspension a hybrid arrangement. As at the front linked radius <b>rods</b> provided <b>axle</b> location and anti-roll properties.|$|R
50|$|Following on from {{previous}} designs of London taxi, the FX3 had a traditional 3-door body, {{with an open}} luggage platform rather than a front passenger seat beside the driver. The FX3 was fitted with mechanical brakes, with <b>rod</b> operation, beam <b>axles</b> on leaf springs and a built-in Jackall hydraulic jacking system. Like all London taxis, it has a tight turning circle of 25 ft (7.6m) diameter, {{as required by the}} Conditions of Fitness.|$|R
50|$|The New York Central had two L-1 {{locomotives}} rebuilt by Alco in 1922 {{with three}} cylinders {{to help determine}} if three-cylinder drive was worthwhile. They were substantially {{more powerful than the}} two cylinder locomotives but it was debatable if the additional maintenance headaches of that third, hard to reach central cylinder, valve gear, main <b>rod</b> and crank <b>axle</b> were worthwhile. The NYC must have come down on the negative side of that question, for no more were built.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s, VEB Lokomotivbau Karl Marx in Babelsberg built diesel {{locomotives}} for industrial and field railways, which were also suited to various (narrow) gauge uses (s = Schmalspur or narrow gauge). The first engines of Type Ns 3 were delivered in 1952. A total of 280 locomotives of this class were built. The locomotive drive {{was achieved by}} means of a mechanical, three-stage gear train with friction clutch via a jackshaft lying between the <b>axles</b> and connecting <b>rods</b> to the <b>axles.</b> The locos were with equipped with water-cooled, four-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engines generating a nominal 60 horsepower.|$|R
50|$|The body {{consisted}} of three major mouldings and the entire front was rear hinged and could be raised for engine access. The doors were aluminium. Suspension was independent at the front using coil springs with a Panhard <b>rod</b> located rigid <b>axle</b> and leaf springs at the rear. A choice of wire spoked or steel disc wheels with centre lock fitting was offered. At first the car had servo assisted 11 in drum brakes but from 1956, the newly introduced 541 Deluxe version featured Dunlop disc brakes both front and rear—the first British four seater thus equipped.|$|R
5000|$|One {{example was}} the Italian State Railways class 640 2-6-0. The frontmost axle did not carry a {{conventional}} pony truck. Instead this axle {{along with the}} front driven axle together carried a bogie. This driving axle had a lateral play of about 20 mm, and spherical bearings were used on the cranks and coupling <b>rods</b> to this <b>axle.</b> (The engine used inside cylinders driving the middle set of drivers.) The first two axles worked together to guide the locomotive, similar to a conventional leading bogie. The Dovregubben class 2-8-4 on the Norwegian State Railways also used this [...] "Zara" [...] truck.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{presented}} as an all-new design. It shared a six-light (three windows on each side) profile with its predecessor, but was more streamlined. Standard fittings included a sliding roof, opening windscreen and leather upholstery. The bonnet (hood) was now one piece and hinged at the rear, rather than opening at the sides. The body was 3 in longer than the earlier car, despite having a wheelbase that was (initially) 5.5 in shorter. It was also 0.5 in wider. A conventional chassis frame was retained, and the brakes were mechanical, with operation by a system of <b>rods.</b> Rigid beam <b>axles</b> were retained front and rear with conventional leaf springs.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1905, a {{replacement}} locomotive was considered and W G Bagnall were {{asked for a}} design. This {{was similar to the}} Lewins design, but more conventional. A saddle tank was used and conventional cylinders with connecting <b>rods</b> to the <b>axle.</b> The power cylinders were however mounted inside the frames and the Bagnall-Price valvgear and slide valves mounted outside. [...] This new locomotive was never constructed, although Bagnalls did instead build two new boilers for the existing locomotives. Both survived the closure of the mine, but were scrapped in 1935, some years afterwards. also there is a Diesel locomotive called wasp which worked in a mine in cornwall ...|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} were articulated, {{with one}} large traction motor {{on each of}} the two bogies at each end. The jackshaft was thus placed above and between the driving wheels. To maximise the length of its drive rod and reduce its angulation, this was connected near to the furthest driven <b>axle.</b> The coupling <b>rod</b> between those <b>axles</b> was 'triangular', with an additional bearing mounted on its top edge, taking the thrust of the jackshaft drive rod. Unlike most connecting rods, this allows it to be mounted in the same plane as the coupling rod bearings. This reduces the overhung lengths of the crankpins and their bending loads.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} of Type V 10 C {{were further}} developed by LKM Babelsberg from the Ns 4, production {{of which had}} ceased in 1958. The first engines were delivered in 1959. They inherited the drive concept from the Ns 4, which was achieved once again via a jack axle under the driver's cab with coupling <b>rods</b> to the <b>axles.</b> Once again four gears were provided. On locomotives up to [...] gauge the axles had an outside frame, on larger gauges they had an inside frame.The engines were equipped with air-cooled diesel engines, 6 KVD 14.5 SRL generating , made by the VEB Diesel Engineering Works at Schönebeck.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the railway}} began with pony haulage, {{a pair of}} steam {{locomotives}} were delivered from Stephen Lewin of Poole in 1877. Ant and Bee were 0-4-0 tank locomotives made unusually narrow, in order to fit within the adit. They were 4 ft 9in high and only 3 ft wide. Their two 4×6in inside cylinders had Bagnall-Price valve gear and a geared drive to the rear <b>axle,</b> but coupling <b>rods</b> between the <b>axles.</b> The arrangement of the water tanks was particularly unusual, being a front tank ahead of the smokebox, {{in order to reduce}} width. The boilers were launch-type, as were commonly used for small locomotives with insufficient space between the frames for a conventional firebox.|$|R
50|$|Around 1860, when Beugniot was {{the chief}} {{engineer}} at the firm of Köchlin, he developed a system whereby wheelsets are housed in pairs in the locomotive frame, with side-play, and connected by a lever. These levers are fixed to the frame in the centre and thus enable the sideways movement of the connected axles in opposite directions. In this way, instead of being fixed in the frame, the axles are able to move sideways rather like a bogie, but clearly nowhere near as much. On locomotives with a side <b>rod</b> drive, the <b>axle</b> side-play is balanced using longer coupling pins (Kuppelzapfen) on which the coupling rods are also able to move sideways.|$|R
25|$|San Francisco's {{population}} growth increased {{along with the}} demand for iron products, and {{with the growth of}} railroads and street cars on the west coast, the output from PRM doubled, and doubled again. By 1873, the mill turned out <b>rod,</b> wire, shafts, <b>axles,</b> I-beams, wrought iron and hammered iron of every type needed by the growing metropolis. By the end of the 1880s the mill had five main buildings along three blocks of waterfront and employed a thousand men. Potrero Point quickly became the site for some of California's most important heavy industries, including shipbuilding and the manufacture of mining machinery, while the hill continued to be cut and the bay mudflats filled. Submarines were built nearby the Potrero Union Iron Works shipyards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{research}} the mechanical performance and vibration modes of current longitudinal thrust <b>rod</b> of rear <b>axle,</b> the {{finite element model}} of original thrust rod is established and analyzed with NASTRAN codes. The simulation results demonstrate: the maximum stress of original thrust rod of dump truck is {{in the limit of}} the yield strength of material, which satisfies with the design requirements; the first step modal frequency of the component under free conditions is greater than upper limits value of the excited frequency of roads, which can evade the resonance excited by irregular roads. But there is structural stress concentration area in the thrust rod, so the structure of thrust rod is modified to ameliorate the stress state of this area. The maximum structural stress is reduced by 35. 1 % on the basis of reduction by 4. 7 % in total weight, which indicates the modification improves the mechanical and modal performance greatly. The research above has significant reference values for mechanical performance analysis and lightweight design of complicated automotive components...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the design and {{implementation}} of a control algorithm for balancing of a two-wheeled robotic machine (TWRM). The machine comprises a <b>rod</b> on an <b>axle</b> incorporating two wheels. The balancing of the rod in the upright position is achieved using a proportional-derivative (PD) controller. The Newton-Euler dynamic formulation is used to develop a mathematical model of the system. Matlab Simulink {{is used as a}} simulation environment. The intermediate body (IB) is considered to be in the upright position. An external disturbance force is applied at different locations of the IB in order to test the robustness of the developed controller. A payload is considered, and this is attached at different locations along the rod. Investigations are carried out on the effect of changing the duration and location of disturbance force, and changing the location of the payload on the system in the balancing mode. Two PD controllers are developed, one for the angular position of the rod and one for the cart linear displacement. Simulation results are presented assessing the performances of the controllers...|$|R
50|$|The first multiple-cylinder {{locomotive}} {{to demonstrate}} {{some of the}} principles of the steam motor was the Midland Railway's Paget locomotive of 1907. This was one of many attempts to build a balanced locomotive, so avoiding the problems of hammer blow. It also followed contemporary advanced stationary engine practice in using single-acting cylinders. The locomotive has been variously described as either inspired by, or actually using, the design of the Willans engine that represented the peak of steam engine design at this time. In fact, the rotary valves used for the locomotive were entirely different from the Willans' characteristic central valve spindle, even though they did both use single-acting trunk pistons. Eight cylinders were used, two driving the front axle of the three driving axles, four the middle axle and two the rear axle. All three axles were coupled by external coupling <b>rods.</b> The central <b>axle</b> was a complicated forging as a four-throw internal crank axle, although following traditional Stephenson practice. To provide additional space for the cylinders, the locomotive was outside framed.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is {{to design and fabricate}} the steering system for electric go kart. Usually, majority of the go kart available at the market are based on petrol engine. The functional for this steering system are based on available product which is evaluated by research on the available source such as Internet. The basic part for the steering system such as steering column, track <b>rods</b> and stub <b>axle</b> are being research thoroughly to understand the function of each part. Before the fabrication process, some research for the milling, lathing, drilling and welding process are done to make sure it is suitable for the material used. To obtain the best designs, it has to be parallel with the scope of the project and suited with the criteria needed. Three concepts design are generated and final design are choose based on the Evaluation Table and discussion between team members and supervisor. Material selection is chose by surveying the available raw material from the store. Materials based on mild steel are choose due to its characteristic which can be weld and fabricate easily. Measuring, cutting, drilling, turning, milling, bending, welding, grinding and finishing process are done to complete this project. The final phase of this project is to assemble all the components and parts of the electric go kart fabricate from the team members. The purpose of this project is to allow the driver of go kart to change the direction during handling...|$|R
