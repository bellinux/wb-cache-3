50|$|Proustite is a sulfosalt mineral {{consisting}} of; silver sulfarsenide, Ag3AsS3, known also {{as light}} red silver or <b>ruby</b> <b>silver</b> <b>ore,</b> {{and an important}} source of the metal.

50|$|In 1865, {{he founded}} with John H. Boalt an assay office and {{consulting}} firm in Austin, Nevada. There, after a failure involving construction of a lead smelter, {{he turned his attention}} to processing <b>silver</b> <b>ores.</b> The <b>silver</b> <b>ores</b> of the Reese River district were treated by preliminary chloridizing roasting and then pan amalgamation with the aid of chemicals. After experimentation, Stetefeldt introduced a new type of furnace in Reno, Nevada. The Stetefeldt furnace was a metallurgical milestone. After the introduction of this furnace, most of his career revolved it. The invention made him widely known in mining districts.
