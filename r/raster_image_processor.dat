50|$|The first commercially {{successful}} laser imagesetter, able to {{make use}} of a <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> <b>processor</b> was the Monotype Lasercomp. ECRM, Compugraphic (later purchased by Agfa) and others rapidly followed suit with machines of their own.|$|E
25|$|<b>Raster</b> <b>image</b> <b>processors</b> (RIPs) {{are used}} to convert PDF files into a raster format {{suitable}} for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and prepress in {{a process known as}} rasterisation. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine from Adobe Systems and Jaws and the Harlequin RIP from Global Graphics.|$|R
50|$|PostScript is {{noteworthy}} for implementing on-the fly rasterization; everything, even text, is specified {{in terms of}} straight lines and cubic Bézier curves (previously found only in CAD applications), which allows arbitrary scaling, rotating and other transformations. When the PostScript program is interpreted, the interpreter converts these instructions into the dots needed to form the output. For this reason PostScript interpreters are occasionally called PostScript <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> <b>processors,</b> or RIPs.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, digital negatives {{are made}} from an inkjet printer using black ink only, {{adjusted}} to the proper density to suit the process. This can be achieved simply with curves or other adjustments in Photoshop, for example, or using special printer drivers (or <b>Raster</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Processors)</b> such as QuadToneRip. [...] A comprehensive beginner's guide to creating digital negatives using black ink for various processes is the book Digital Negatives [...] by Brad Hinkel and Ron Reeder.|$|R

40|$|Historically, in the 35 {{years of}} digital {{printing}} research, <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> processing has always lagged behind marking engine technology, i. e., {{we have never}} been able to deliver rendered digital pages as fast as digital print engines can consume them. This trend has resulted in products based on throttled digital printers or expensive <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> <b>processors</b> (RIP) with hardware acceleration. The current trend in computer software architecture is to leverage graphic processing units (GPU) for computing tasks whenever appropriate. We discuss the issues for rendering fonts on such an architecture and present an implementation...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} an algorithm {{for color}} halftoning using stochastic screening. This algorithm has three distinguished features: it uses clustering, it performs error diffusion and it employes an adaptive criteria {{to change the}} cluster size according to the variation of the image color values. Therefore, the method incorporates features from the traditional amplitude modulated (AM) digital halftoning methods, along with {{the advantages of the}} frequency modulated (FM) techniques, recently introduced into the <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> <b>processors</b> of high resolution phototypesetters...|$|R
5000|$|In {{traditional}} offset {{and digital}} printing, {{the concept of}} workflow represents the process, people and usually software technology (RIPs <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> <b>processors</b> or DFE digital front end) controllers that {{play a part in}} pre/post processing of print-related files. e.g. PDF pre-flight checking to make certain that fonts are embedded or that the imaging output to plate or digital press will be able to render the document intent properly for the image-output capabilities of the press that will print the final image.|$|R

50|$|Computers {{excel at}} {{automatically}} typesetting and correcting documents. Character-by-character, computer-aided phototypesetting was, in turn, rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> <b>processor</b> to render an entire page {{to a single}} high-resolution digital image, now known as imagesetting.|$|E

Monotype Systems Ltd. was the adopted name for the new organization with Peter Purdy as Chairman, the name Monotype was under license from Monotype Typography Ltd which retained the trademark Monotype.

50|$|In the 1980s, Adobe drew most of {{its revenue}} from the {{licensing}} fees for their implementation of PostScript for printers, known as a <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> <b>processor</b> or RIP.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new method and file format which allows to create, store and {{manipulate}} multiresolution <b>raster</b> <b>images.</b> “Classic ” <b>raster</b> <b>images</b> are built up by rasters (pixels) where in the same <b>image</b> each <b>raster</b> (pixel) has the same size. Multiresolution <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> (mri) are unlike the “classic ” <b>raster</b> <b>images.</b> An mri file is a regular text file, conformed xml 1. 0 standard and allows: 1) to store <b>raster</b> based <b>images</b> with different resolution in the same file {{and in the same}} time (i. e., allows to contain rasters with different size in the same image); 2) to export easily any part of the image as a separate <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> and to import an image {{as a part of a}} raster; 3) to define geographical reference for a <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> and use this <b>image</b> as a <b>raster</b> based GIS model; 4) to perform computations (i. e., image manipulation) on the content of the file. It is an important characteristic of the mri format that mathematical operations could be per-formed always in the same resolution as the current resolution of the given part of the image. To confirm this statement we present how to perform a convolution on an mri file...|$|R

Digitized <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> preserves the original drawing in its exact visual form, whereas additional vector data {{can be used for}} resolution-independent reproduction, image editing, analysis and indexing operations. We introduce two techniques for utilizing the vector features in context-based compression of the <b>raster</b> <b>image.</b> In both techniques, Hough transform is used for extracting the line features from the <b>raster</b> <b>image.</b> The first technique utilizes the line features to improve the prediction accuracy in the context modeling. The second technique uses a feature-based filter for removing noise near the borders of the extracted line elements. This improves the image quality and results in more compressible <b>raster</b> <b>image.</b> In both cases, we achieve better compression performance...|$|R
