40|$|The paper {{discusses}} an algorithm {{for assessing}} online the static equilibrium of walking robots with quasi-static locomotion. The robot under discussion can have {{any number of}} legs; ropes connect the robot frame to ground. When legs and <b>rope</b> <b>winches</b> are blocked, the robot is a hyperstatic system; the equilibrium problem is statically undetermined. Moreover, both the foot-ground and the frame-rope constraints are unilateral. Firstly, the paper proposes an algorithm for solving the equilibrium problem under bilateral con-straints; then, this algorithm is run iteratively for solving the equilibrium problem under unilateral constraints; at each iteration step, suitable constraints are one by one released. The running time is very low and makes the algorithm useful for real-time control. As explanatory example the method is used for mapping the workspace static stability of the four-legged, two-roped climbing robot Roboclimber. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{laterally}} placed gallery (net weight 45 t) can be tilted upwards {{with the}} means of two electromechanical <b>rope</b> <b>winches</b> in about 5 min. The segmented hall floor (net weight 300 t) can be elevated {{by means of a}} spiral lift mechanism. An electric motor slides a steel strip continuously into a steel spiral to build up a vertical pedestal. In discharged condition the spiral and the rolled-up steel strip including the elevating structure take up the complete height of 50 cm and enable a total raise of the Hall-floor of about 5 m. The resulting room underneath the hall floor is used to store tables and chairs and can be accessed through a transport platform. With service loads of 500 kg/m2 at rest and 250 kg/m2 in motion the platforms can be moved with a speed between 2 and 8 cm/s.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} fast method {{to solve the}} {{equilibrium}} problem of statically indeterminate walking and climbing robots with quasi-static locomotion and whatever number of legs and ropes connecting the robot frame to the ground. The configuration is instantaneously assigned. Legs and <b>rope</b> <b>winches</b> are imagined blocked. Due {{to the number of}} legs and ropes, the robot is a statically indeterminate system under unilateral constraints: in order to solve the system of the equilibrium equations, it is necessary {{to take into account the}} compliance of the robot and of the terrain. This can be done by non-linear analysis of a finite element model of the robot, including the ground characteristics, but this is very time consuming. The method presented in the paper seems an effective alternative. To assess its performances, the method is applied to the heavy-duty climbing robot Robo-climber with satisfactory results. The running time is low enough to allow the application for the online gait planning and for real-time control of the robot. The method will be soon used as decision support for online gait planning within the remote control system of Roboclimber...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increase}} of importance of bioenergy, the whole tree harvesting system was reconsidered. As a simple way of a whole tree harvesting system, this study analyzed two winching procedures in terms of productivity and influence from terrain conditions. One of the winching procedures was observed on flat terrain, where the felled trees were scattered and then, one-by-one, attached to the <b>winch</b> <b>rope.</b> The other was observed on a steep terrain, where the felled trees were concentrated in a line and then attached, at one time, to the <b>winch</b> <b>rope.</b> A significant difference caused by slope conditions appeared only in the reeling velocity. When increasing the harvested volume in a cycle, the productivity increased. The difference in productivity between two sites was slight with the same harvested volume. By the one-by-one procedure, the full volume harvested in a cycle was only skidded from the nearest felling points, while the bundled procedure skidded the full volume from various points including the farthest point. The one-by-one procedure will save the <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> tension and reduce engine acceleration. Fuel consumption, therefore, will be decreased by applying the one-by-one procedure instead of the bundled procedure. Additionally, reducing the weight of felled trees by natural drying in a forest is effective for reducing fuel consumption not only in transportation but also in winching operation, and for enhancing the calorific value of bioenergy...|$|R

40|$|Proper winding of {{the steel}} <b>rope</b> around the <b>winch</b> drum is great importance, mostly for: prolonging the service life of the rope, {{reduction}} of deformations {{of the body and}} the sides of the drum if the winding of the rope is multilayered, increasing of the safety factors, easier unwinding of the rope while lowering the load, even running of the drive unit, etc. The focus of this paper is on the analysis of the friction which occurs in the process of winding and unwinding the <b>rope</b> around the <b>winch</b> drum. Friction force is in its highest intensity when the rope passes from one layer to another, if the winding of the rope is multilayered.

50|$|An Auxiliary Lifting Attachment (ALA) - a davit with a <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> roller - {{fitted to}} the inside of the {{earthmoving}} bucket was used for lifting loads of up to 4tonnes. Loads such as Medium Girder Bridge pallets could be lifted vertically to a height of 1.8m. This then allowed a cargo vehicle to back under the suspended load, the CET could not travel or turn with a suspended load on the ALA due to lateral weakness of the ALA and the proximity of the load to the earthmoving bucket. Use of the ALA was discontinued in the 1990s due to difficulties in annual testing of the safe working load, and a reduced requirement for its use.|$|R
50|$|A {{train is}} a form of rail {{transport}} consisting of a series of connected vehicles that usually runs along a rail track to transport cargo or passengers. Motive power is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in self-propelled multiple units. Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most common modern forms are diesel and electric locomotives, the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails. Other energy sources include horses, engine or water-driven <b>rope</b> or wire <b>winch,</b> gravity, pneumatics, batteries, and gas turbines. Train tracks usually consist of two running rails, sometimes supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails, with a limited number of monorails and maglev guideways in the mix. The word 'train' comes from the Old French trahiner, from the Latin trahere 'pull, draw'.|$|R
