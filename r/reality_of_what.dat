5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E

25|$|The {{calculation}} of $24 also fails {{to recognize that}} the concepts of property trading and ownership held by the 17th-century Dutch and East Coast natives were both different from modern conceptions. Comparisons to modern land dealing distort the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Minuit was trying to do. Both the Dutch and the Indians undoubtedly included intangibles along with any hard goods in their concept of the total transactional value. For Indians and Minuit alike, both sides felt they were getting far more than a mere 60 guilders. For instance, the natives most certainly would have thought the trade included the value of the Dutch as potential military allies against rival Indian nations—a 'good' that could not be valued in currency alone. In addition, the value of the sale to Dutch and Indians alike would have included the prospect of future trade.|$|E

500|$|The cover artwork was {{designed}} by Los Angeles-based Smog Design, following a concept sent by Roth. Smog co-owner John Heiden picked the image, featuring a New York Central Railroad J-3A Dreyfuss Hudson [...] steam locomotive, photographed by Robert Yarnall Richie, from the Southern Methodist University's photo library, stating he chose it because [...] "Richie's angle on the photo makes it look like the locomotive is in motion and coming off the page". Aside from the reversed angle of the train, the artwork is shares similarities to the 1975 Commodores album Movin' On. The booklet includes Roth's hand-written lyrics for the songs. Regarding the title, Eddie stated that he liked it because [...] "there's always their <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> other people think, and there's just the different kind of truth, which is the real truth." ...|$|E

[...] The Harvard man, apparently oblivious to the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was happening around him, showed him the proper road without thinking. [...] (He was later compelled {{to leave the country}} for inadvertently supporting the enemy.) [...] Percy's troops arrived in Lexington at about 2:00 p.m. [...] They could hear gunfire in the distance as they set up their cannon and deployed lines of regulars on high ground with commanding views of the town. [...] Colonel Smith's men approached like a fleeing mob with the full complement of colonial militia in close formation pursuing them.

500|$|The clip portrays {{sexual assaults}} mostly against women, {{and how they}} cope after the incident. The {{black-and-white}} video opens with a warning message: [...] "The following contains graphic content that may be emotionally unsettling but reflects the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is happening daily on college campuses." [...] It then shows a girl walking through an empty corridor, followed by young people in various activities in a college campus: reading (portrayed by actress Nikki Reed), a trans man adjusting his chest binder in the bathroom, attending a party (one of the partygoers being portrayed by actress Kiersey Clemons). However they are all sexually assaulted, {{with one of the}} scenes showing a couple of young girls being drugged and raped at the party. The heartbroken girls and the trans man cry, while alternate images show them expressing their emotions by inscribing words on themselves. Ultimately they find solace and hope in friendship, and leave the college with their friends, as the words inscribed on their bodies change to positive messages. Near its ending, the music video displays the message: [...] "One in five college women will be sexually assaulted this year unless something changes", following which the message points the audience to the Facebook page for The Hunting Ground and Itsonus.org, the White House support website for people who have endured a sexual crime. A portion of the earnings from the song's digital sales will be donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault.|$|E
500|$|Alex Rees from Cosmopolitan {{felt that}} the video {{contained}} [...] "uncomfortable footage", but added that the [...] "emotionally unsettling" [...] images were able {{to reflect on the}} actual <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happens on college campuses. Claire Hodgson from the same publication described the clip as a [...] "beautifully shot, brilliantly acted short film", which [...] "really does not hold back when it comes to portraying the real horror of sexual assault in the most graphic way possible". Emily Shire from The Daily Beast was positive about the clip, calling it: [...] "both chilling and beautiful. The overall effect is as much, if not more, a credit to acclaimed director Catherine Hardwicke. The brutality of these snapshot scenes are remarkably moving in the scariest and most sickening way possible". However, Shire was disappointed with one aspect of the PSA – that the victims are supported by their friends and close-ones and that was enough to cope through the trauma. Instead Shire wanted to see the legal ramifications of such traumatic incidents, with the victims going to the police. Shire concluded the review saying: [...] "Gaga and Hardwicke deserve props for creating such a powerful, visceral, and aesthetically striking PSA. They've brought a tremendous amount of attention to rape and sexual assault. Yet, attention alone is inadequate balm for the victims of rape." [...] Conversely, Dan Solomon of Fast Company believed the video to be an [...] "important statement" [...] from Gaga and believed that it would direct further attention to The Hunting Ground.|$|E

I intend to write a letter to the parents of British soldiers telling them the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they died for." [...] Choudary's open letter was published on 3 January 2010. [...] It explained his reasons for proposing the march, endorsed his religious beliefs, and claimed that UK politicians had been lying about the war. [...] Choudary wrote that the proposed march was to [...] "engage the British public's minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in body bags and the real cost of the war." [...] In an interview with Sky News, he stated that the location was chosen to effect a level of media attention which [...] "it would not have gained anywhere else". [...] The proposal was condemned by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said that to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be [...] "completely inappropriate". [...] The Minhaj-ul-Quran International UK centre in Forest Gate also condemned the proposal, as did the Muslim Council of Britain, which stated that it [...] "condemns the call by the fringe extremist group Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett." [...] The planned march was cancelled by the group, on 10 January 2010.|$|E

500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

After some serious thinking they decided to ask Lindsay Cooper to leave and fulfilled their last outstanding concert obligations (a tour of the Netherlands) as a quartet.

Upon arrival of Ripley, and with increasing suggestions of the Alien presence, the monk inhabitants believe it {{to be some sort of}} religious trial for their misdemeanors, punishable by the creature that haunts them. By having a woman in their monastery, they wonder if their trial is partially caused by sexual temptation, as Ripley is the only woman to be amongst the all-male community in ten years. To avoid this belief and (hopefully) the much grimmer <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> she has brought with her, the Monks of the [...] "wooden satellite" [...] lock Ripley into a dungeon-like sewer and ignore her advice on the true nature of the beast. The monks believe that the Alien is in fact the Devil. Primarily though, this story was about Ripley's own soul-searching complicated by the seeding of the Alien within her and further hampered by her largely solo attempts to defeat it. Eventually Ripley decides to sacrifice herself to kill the Alien. Fox asked for an alternate ending where the character survived, but eventually Sigourney Weaver said she would only do the movie if Ripley died.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{films have}} magical realist {{narrative}} {{and events that}} contrast between real and magical elements, or different modes of production. This device explores the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> exists. Fredrick Jameson, in [...] "On Magic Realism in Film", advances a hypothesis that magical realism in film is a formal mode that is constitutionally dependent on a type of historical raw material in which disjunction is structurally present. Like Water for Chocolate (1992) begins and ends with the first person narrative to establishing the magical realism storytelling frame. Telling a story from a child's point of view, the historical gaps and holes perspective, and with cinematic color heightening the presence, are magical realist tools in films. Some other films that convey elements of magic realism are The Green Mile (1999), Amélie (2001), The Mistress of Spices (2005), Undertow (2009), Biutiful (2010), Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012), Birdman (2014), a number of films by Woody Allen (including The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), Alice (1990), Midnight in Paris (2011), and To Rome With Love (2012)). Additionally, most of the films directed by Terry Gilliam are strongly influenced by magic realism, the animated films of Hayao Miyazaki often utilize magic realism, {{and some of the}} films of Emir Kusturica contain elements of magical realism, the most famous of which is Time of the Gypsies (1988).|$|E

In October 2014, the ANU Council announced that it would divest from seven companies, two of which, Santos and Oil Search, performed poorly in an independent review undertaken by the Centre for Australian Ethical Research. This decision provoked a month-long controversy with the Australian Financial Review publishing over 53 stories criticising the decision including 12 front pages attacking the ANU, with its editor-in-chief, Michael Stutchbury, prouncing the decision to be as [...] "disingenuous" [...] as banning the burqa.

I argue that it is useful to treat the various ways of being a species (species modes) as traits of clades.
