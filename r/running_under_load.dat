Shortly after the output was reduced further to 600MW.|$|R
5000|$|The {{support plates}} {{fixed to the}} valve spindle also have a piston ring. This slows down {{the closing of the}} movable valve heads.Narrow gauge {{locomotives}} (such as the DR Class 99.23-24) do not have these piston rings. As a result, when the locomotive switches from running light to <b>running</b> <b>under</b> <b>load</b> there is a characteristic clicking noise as the pistons close. This piston ring on the support body was a further refinement by the former Meiningen repair shop.|$|E
50|$|The Trofimoff valve {{comprises}} the valve spindle, the piston valve heads slotted onto {{them and the}} two supporting plates (Stützplatten). When the engine is <b>running</b> <b>under</b> <b>load</b> the valve heads are forced by steam pressure onto the support plates and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a steam locomotive, the regulator is closed, the pressure drops, the valve heads remain in the inside dead centre position near {{the centre of the}} cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The valve spindle continues to move backwards and forwards with the support plates attached to it, without disturbing the valve heads. In this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} of the expanded steam is {{less than that of}} steam supplied directly from the boiler. An engine working with an expansion valve set to an early cut-off is thus less powerful than with the valve fully open. Accordingly, the engine must now be driven, so that the valve is manually adjusted as the load on the engine changes. An engine <b>running</b> <b>under</b> light <b>load</b> may be operated efficiently with an early cut-off, an engine <b>under</b> heavy <b>load</b> may require a longer cut-off and the cost of more steam consumption.|$|R
30|$|The {{centrifugal}} chiller compressor has high efficiency when operating at 40 %– 100 % load and {{the phenomenon of}} ‘surge’ {{is more likely to}} occur when it works <b>under</b> 40 % <b>load.</b> Meanwhile, the efficiency of screw-type chiller compressor may sharply decrease while <b>running</b> <b>under</b> 50 % <b>load.</b> Therefore, by adopting the proposed control strategy, each chiller unit of the building’s NCSCAC system is assigned to operate at the load not less than 40 %.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} core losses in induction motors <b>running</b> <b>under</b> different <b>loading</b> conditions. The investigation is conducted using 2 -D finite-element methods incorporating two different core-loss models. The simplified model disregards the minor loops and skin {{effect in the}} lamination. The second approach solves the magneto-dynamic problem in the lamination taking hysteresis and viscosity effects into account. The simulation {{results show that the}} core losses increase significantly with loading and the effect of slot harmonics on the eddy-current loss and minor loops can be remarkable. The distribution of the fluxes change dramatically with loading, leading to an overall increase in the harmonic content and a general decrease in the amplitude of the fundamental flux components. Therefore, even though the fundamental flux components decrease by increasing the load, the core losses rise {{as a result of the}} increase in the flux distortions and higher harmonics...|$|R
50|$|Today's {{computers}} {{are far from}} energy proportional for two primary reasons. A critical issue is high static power, {{which means that the}} computer consumes significant energy even when it is idle. High static power is common in servers owing to their architectural, circuit, and manufacturing optimizations that favor very high performance instead of low power. High static power relative to the maximum loaded power results in low dynamic range, poor energy proportionality, and thus, very low efficiency at low to medium utilizations. This can be acceptable for traditional high-performance computing systems and workloads, which try to extract the maximum utilization possible out of the machines, where they are most efficient. However, in modern datacenters that run popular and large-scale cloud computing applications, servers {{spend most of their time}} around 30% utilization, and are rarely <b>running</b> <b>under</b> maximum <b>load,</b> which is a very energy-inefficient operating point for typical servers.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike other {{air-cooled}} cars (such as the Volkswagen Beetle and the Fiat 500) the 2CV's engine had no {{thermostat valve}} in its oil system.

This removes the risk of overheating from a jammed thermostat that can afflict water- and air-cooled engines and the engine can withstand many hours of <b>running</b> <b>under</b> heavy <b>load</b> at high engine speeds even in hot weather.

This paper {{introduces}} {{the importance of}} the bolster spring in railroad traffic safety, and the present situation of detection about the free length of the bolster spring has been reviewed. For overcoming the shortcomings of the detection in accuracy and efficiency, a new method is proposed to detect and sort the free length of different specifications of bolster springs fast and high-precision,which based on laser scanning ranging principles and PC software programming. It will highly enhanced the detection precision and the accuracy of material selection. 1 Introduction Bolster spring of railroad track is an important interchangeable parts in railway trucks,which play a very important role in the truck's running process. In both sides of the railroad track bogies paired spring sets respectively, this spring sets were <b>running</b> <b>under</b> all <b>load.</b> The load balance of each spring sets will directly affect the working life of railway trucks and traffic safety[1, 2]. In the truck travel,one group of spring sets may carry a few tons to dozens tons of pressure.

It not only requires that we must to measure and sort the qualified products, but also need an accurate management and classification of th...|$|R
40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{are widely used}} in many systems. Because they provide a power source to the whole system, their state-of-health (SOH) {{is very important for}} a system’s proper operation. A direct way to estimate the SOH is through the measurement of the battery’s capacity; however, this measurement during the battery’s operation is not that easy in practice. Moreover, the battery is always <b>running</b> <b>under</b> randomized <b>loading</b> conditions, which makes the SOH estimation even more difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes an indirect SOH estimation method that relies on indirect health indicators (HIs) that can be measured easily during the battery’s operation. These indicators are extracted from the battery’s voltage and current and the number of cycles the battery has been through, which are far easier to measure than the battery’s capacity. An empirical model based on an elastic net is developed to build the quantitative relationship between the SOH and these indirect HIs, considering the possible multi-collinearity between these HIs. To further improve the accuracy of SOH estimation, we introduce a particle filter to automatically update the model when capacity data are obtained occasionally. We use a real dataset to demonstrate our proposed method, showing quite a good performance of the SOH estimation. The results of the SOH estimation in the experiment are quite satisfactory, which indicates that the method is effective and accurate enough to be used in real practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{detection}} of distributed faults in ball bearings. In literature most of the authors focus their attention on the detection of incipient localized defects. In that case classical techniques (i. e. statistical parameters, envelope analysis) are robust in recognizing {{the presence of the}} fault and its characteristic frequency. In this paper the authors focalize their attention on bearings affected by distributed faults, due to the progressive growing of surface wear or to low-quality manufacturing process. These faults can not be detected by classical techniques; in fact, in this case the signal does not contain impulses at the fault characteristic frequency, but more complex components with strong non-stationary contents. Distributed faults are here detected by means of advanced tools directly derived from the theory of cyclostationarity. In particular three metrics - namely Integrated Cyclic Coherence (ICC), Integrated Cyclic Modulation Coherence (ICMC) and Indicator of Second-Order Cyclostationarity (ICS 2 x) - have been calculated in order to condense the information given by the cyclostationary analysis and to help the analyst in detecting the fault in a fast fault diagnosis procedure. These indicators are applied on actual signals captured on a test rig where a degreased bearing <b>running</b> <b>under</b> radial <b>load</b> developed accelerated wear. The results indicated that all the three cyclostationary indicators are able to detect both the appearance of a localized fault and its development in a distributed fault, whilst the usual approach fails as the fault grows...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} hoop {{stresses}} in reducing {{cylindrical roller bearing}} fatigue life was determined for various classes of inner ring interference fit. Calculations were performed for up to seven interference fit classes for each of ten bearing sizes. Each fit was taken at tightest, average and loosest values within the fit class for RBEC- 5 tolerance, thus requiring 486 separate analyses. The hoop stresses were superimposed on the Hertzian principal stresses created by the applied radial load to calculate roller bearing fatigue life. The method was developed {{through a series of}} equations to calculate the life reduction for cylindrical roller bearings based on interference fit. All calculated lives are for zero initial bearing internal clearance. Any reduction in bearing clearance due to interference fit was compensated by increasing the initial (unmounted) clearance. Results are presented as tables and charts of life factors for bearings with light, moderate and heavy loads and interference fits ranging from extremely light to extremely heavy and for bearing accuracy class RBEC 5 (ISO class 5). Interference fits on the inner bearing ring of a cylindrical roller bearing can significantly reduce bearing fatigue life. In general, life factors are smaller (lower life) for bearings <b>running</b> <b>under</b> light <b>load</b> where the unfactored life is highest. The various bearing series within a particular bore size had almost identical interference fit life factors for a particular fit. The tightest fit at {{the high end of the}} RBEC- 5 tolerance band defined in ANSI/ABMA shaft fit tables produces a life factor of approximately 0. 40 for an inner-race maximum Hertz stress of 1200 MPa (175 ksi) and a life factor of 0. 60 for an inner-race maximum Hertz stress of 2200 MPa (320 ksi). Interference fits also impact the maximum Hertz stress-life relation...|$|R
