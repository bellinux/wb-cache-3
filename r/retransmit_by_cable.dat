40|$|The {{accuracy}} of ranging measurements depends critically {{on the knowledge}} of time delays undergone <b>by</b> signals when <b>retransmitted</b> <b>by</b> a remote transponder and due to propagation effects. A new method determines these delays for every single pulsed signal transmission. It utilizes four ground-based reference stations, synchronized in time and installed at well-known geodesic coordinates and a repeater in space, carried by a satellite, balloon, aircraft, and so forth. Signal transmitted {{by one of the}} reference bases is <b>retransmitted</b> <b>by</b> the transponder, received back by the four bases, producing four ranging measurements which are processed to determine uniquely the time delays undergone in every retransmission process. A minimization function is derived comparing repeater’s positions referred to at least two groups of three reference bases, providing the signal transit time at the repeater and propagation delays, providing the correct repeater position. The method is applicable to the transponder platform positioning and navigation, time synchronization of remote clocks, and location of targets. The algorithm has been demonstrated by simulations adopting a practical example with the transponder carried by an aircraft moving over bases on the ground...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A lossy {{radio link}} may reduce TCP perfor-mance considerably. Radio blocks which are damaged and <b>retransmitted</b> <b>by</b> the radio link layer cause random delays on the IP-level. This paper {{describes}} an analytic {{model for a}} radio link used in UMTS. The delay experienced by IP-packets traversing the link is analyzed, and the deteriorating effects on TCP are described. It is shown that even if these delays and their variations are not extraordinary, they may still trigger fast retransmits or timeouts, and thereby reduce the throughput...|$|R
