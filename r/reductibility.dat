40|$|Due to {{convenience}} and powerfulness {{in dealing with}} vagueness and uncertainty of real situation, hesitant fuzzy set has received more and more attention {{and has been a}} hot research topic recently. To differently process and effectively aggregate hesitant fuzzy information and capture their interrelationship, in this paper, we propose the hesitant fuzzy reducible weighted Bonferroni mean (HFRWBM) and present its four prominent characteristics, namely, <b>reductibility,</b> monotonicity, boundedness, and idempotency. Then, we further investigate its generalized form, that is, the generalized hesitant fuzzy reducible weighted Bonferroni mean (GHFRWBM). Based on the discussion of model parameters, some special cases of the HFRWBM and GHFRWBM are studied in detail. In addition, to deal with the situation that multicriteria have connections in hesitant fuzzy information aggregation, a three-step aggregation approach has been proposed {{on the basis of the}} HFRWBM and GHFRWBM. In the end, we apply the proposed aggregation operators to multicriteria aggregation and give an example to illustrate our results...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissolution}} of copper in 1 M chloride solution was studied by steady-state (current-voltage curv s for various disk rotation rates) and transient [frequency {{analysis of the}} electrochemical and electrohydrodynamical (EHD) impedance] measurements. The anodic polarization curves have presented one region of mixed kinetic and another of mass-transport control characterized by a current plateau. The limiting current is a tl 1 / 2 function throughout {{the whole range of}} rotation rates. From the EHD impedance diagrams observed below the anodic plateau, it was shown that the limitation by mass transport is due to CuCI~. On the current plateau, the presence of two time constants on the EHD impedance diagram and the <b>reductibility</b> of the curves have been attributed to the existence of a salt layer covering the surface, the rate of formation of this layer being identical to the rate of dissolution. A layer mode l has been developed. Anodic {{dissolution of}} copper in chloride media has prompted numerous tudies. 1 -n The dissolution is mass-transport limited and leads to the formation of CuCI~. Nev-ertheless, the diffusion step was ascribed by different au-thors either to C]- transport o the surface " or to the transport 'of CuCI ~ to the bulk solution. 2 -...|$|E

In this report, a novel method is proposed to prepare MnO/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites via calcining the precursors (i. e. δ-MnO 2 /graphene oxide composites) at 500 °C in Ar using no external reducing gas, in which graphene oxide (GO) successfully serves as a reductant by releasing CO during its thermolysis for the first time. By controlling the initial ratios of GO to KMnO 4, differently composed precursors can be obtained via the redox reaction between GO and KMnO 4, then leading {{to the formation of}} composites with different MnO/rGO ratios and dispersion of MnO on the rGO surface (denoted as MGC 1 and MGC 2). When applied as an active material in lithium ion batteries, MGC 1 shows excellent cycling performance and capacity retention. Under 100 and 200 mA g− 1, MGC 1 could deliver reversible capacities as high as 900 and 750 mA h g− 1, respectively, after more than 100 cycles. Considering the simple operation and low energy consumption in the whole material synthesis processes, the present strategy is feasible and effective for practical application. Even more importantly, the <b>reductibility</b> of graphene oxide upon thermolysis is utilized for the first time, which is meaningful for its extension in synthesis of functional nanomaterials.

40|$|The optimal {{operation}} of the blast furnace depends considerably on {{the properties of the}} sinter fed into the furnace. As a result, the optimization of the sintering processes has a direct effect on the overall effectiveness of the iron making processes. In order to produce a good sinter special care needs to be taken in order to assure it has a good permeability and reducibility and it is able to retain these properties for a certain time. If the sinter starts to melt down early in {{the upper part of the}} blast furnace, where its solid state reduction is essential, permeability decreases, the gas channels get blocked, <b>reductibility</b> diminishes and serious problems may also follow. Among the factors that influences the above mentioned sinter properties are the oxygen potential and fluxing components. Nevertheless, their effect on the phase relations during sintering and sinter reduction conditions has not yet entirely clarified and confusion exists in literature. This quantification becomes even more important today where many new minor components such as Al 2 O 3 and MgO enter the sinter through raw materials. This work quantifies the effect of oxygen potential and fluxing components such as alumina and magnesia on the liquidus and phase relations of the sinter primary melts in the iron rich portion of CaO-FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system at sintering conditions. This is carried out by the means of new type of industrial diagrams in the form of Fe/CaO vs. SiO 2 that can directly help the optimization of the sintering processes...|$|E
40|$|Series of {{catalysts}} {{consisting of}} MoO{sub 3 }, V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }, TiO{sub 2 }, and SnO{sub 2 } impregnated onto oxide supports consisting of SiO{sub 2 } (Cab-O-Sil), TiO{sub 2 } or SnO{sub 2 } were previously prepared and {{tested for the}} selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates, and {{it was found that}} the V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }/SiO{sub 2 } catalyst was the most active and most selective toward the formation of formaldehyde. These catalysts have been characterized by laser Raman spectroscopy after dehydration and during the methane oxidation reaction with a CH{sub 4 }/ 02 = 10 / 1 reaction mixture at 500 {degrees}C in a continuous flow in situ reaction cell. With the V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }/SiO{sub 2 } catalyst (the most active catalyst among those studied), no significant structural changes were revealed by in situ Raman analyses, indicating that the fully oxidized surface sites were related to the high formaldehyde selectivivity. Over the V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }/TiO{sub 2 } and V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }/SnO{sub 2 } catalysts, CO and CO{sub 2 } were the principal products produced by oxidation of methane. For the first time, in situ Raman analysis clearly showed that for these latter catalysts, the surface vanadium(V) oxide species were partially reduced under the steady-state reaction conditions. The performance of the V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }/TiO{sub 2 }/SiO{sub 2 } catalyst was similar to that of the V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }TiO{sub 2 } catalyst, consistent with the earlier observation that vanadia was largely bound to the titania overlayer. It appears that formaldehyde selectivity decreased with increasing catalyst reducibility, but no direct correlation of catalyst activity with <b>reductibility</b> was observed...|$|E
