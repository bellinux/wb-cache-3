Through the system vibra-tion is applied on the ring-traveller, which has effects on the centrifugal force of the traveller and helps the traveller to rotate around ring with intermittent contact. The effect of vibration on yarn tension as well as friction between the ring and the traveler and the corresponding raise in temperature of the ring during spinning are measured. An external facility is designed and incorporated in a miniature <b>ring</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> to generate and apply vibration to the ring. The minia-ture <b>ring</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> has the facility to vary twist and count of yarn and is modified to vary the spindle speed.

It is found that yarn tension and friction between the ring and the traveller reduce significantly {{depending on the type of}} vibration. Therefore it can be concluded that application of vibration may be a way to reduce friction between the ring and the traveler and thus the mechanical process of twisting and winding can be done at higher speed for higher productivity which is a limiting factor of ring spinning system...|$|E

The wave equation governing the twist propagation is solved by using the complex exponential representation of the rotating angle of a yarn cross-section.
