Their feasts at lifestyle ritual functions remain vegetarian. But trade once had them criss-crossing the southern reaches of peninsular India and absorbing non-vegetarian influences from the Malabar Coast, where Christians of the Orthodoxy of West Asia and Muslims lived in large numbers and Hindus too tended to non-vegetarianism. Further non-vegetarian influences became entrenched in Chettiar food habits from the late 18th Century after they established businesses in Ceylon, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, French Indo-China and what is now Malaysia and Singapore. So did non-vegetarian fare {{from other parts of}} India through which they traveled en route to their overseas businesses.Writer Guy Trebay adds in the foreword of the same book:One is lucky to eat like a Chettiar, they say in South India. Chettiars say it themselves. They say it because a Chettiar table is a groaning board but also because the cuisine is uncommonly subtle and aromatic, a heritage of Chettiar participation in the centuries-old spice trade, the global import and export of pungent seeds and fruits and barks from places like Cochin and Penang, the Banda Islands, Arab ports in the Straits of Hormuz. To the coconut and <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> <b>legumes</b> that are staples of South Indian cooking they added Tellicherry pepper, Ceylon cardamom, Indonesian nutmeg, Madagascar cloves and blue ginger, or galangal, from Laos and Vietnam.In places like Penang, in what is now Malaysia, the Chettiars developed a liking for the sweet-sour piquancy of Straits Chinese cooking, In Saigon, they adapted their cuisine to absorb the herbs that perfume Vietnamese food. In Buddhist Ceylon, they relaxed their dietary prohibitions typical of orthodox Hindus and came to enjoy meat.Thus, the Chettinad region -- a semi-arid zone comprising scores of villages, sleepy and agrarian, studded with important ancient temples yet far from major commercial centers -- became an unlikely locus of internationalized tastes.|$|E

30|$|In many {{economically}} important {{plants such}} as cereals (rice, maize, wheat, sorghum), legumes (chickpea, soybean) and oil crops (rapeseed, oil palm), seed development is the major contributing factor towards quality and yield traits. The seed development process is dependent on growth environment conditions such as photoperiod, seasonal and diurnal rhythms, temperature fluctuations, water availability and mineral nutrition. The process is systematically coordinated by the gene products bearing functions involving metabolic enzyme activity, transport and gene expression regulation (Harmer et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2002 a; Swindell et al. 2007; Hao et al. 2011). For example, late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) genes that are expressed during seed desiccation are also expressed in leaves undergoing dehydration (Sivamani et al. 2000).

40|$|Modelling-based {{studies to}} assess the extent and {{magnitude}} of ozone (O 3) risk to agriculture in Asia suggest that yield losses of 5 – 20 % for important crops may be common in areas experiencing elevated O 3 concentrations. These assessments have relied on European and North American dose–response relationships and hence assumed an equivalent Asian crop response to O 3 for local cultivars, pollutant conditions and climate. To test this assumption we collated comparable dose–response data derived from fumigation, filtration and EDU experiments conducted in Asia on wheat, rice and leguminous crop species. These data are pooled and compared with equivalent North American dose–response relationships. The Asian data show that at ambient O 3 concentrations found at the study sites (which vary between w 35 – 75 ppb 4 – 8 h growing season mean), yield losses for wheat, <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> <b>legumes</b> range between 5 – 48, 3 – 47 and 10 – 65 %, respectively. The results indicate that Asian grown wheat and rice cultivars are more sensitive to O 3 than the North American dose–response relationships would suggest.

This study evaluated the productivity of traditional upland <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> <b>legume</b> intercrops planted singly and in combinations under a coconut-based farming system. A split-plot design composed of two factors with three replications was used. The main plots were traditional upland rice varieties (Kalutak, Malido, Mansanaya, San Pedro, and PSB Rc 10 as check variety) while sub-plots were legume intercrops (peanut, mungbean, soybean, and no intercrop as control). Growth and yield of crops and return on investment (ROI) were gathered to determine productivity. Results revealed that Malido with no intercrop produced the tallest plant, while most tillers were from plots without intercrop. Highest dry grain yield of rice (1. 42 t ha- 1) was taken from plots grown to San Pedro with no intercrop.

(2004]) found that incorporation of rice residue for 7 [*]years increased soil organic carbon content of the sandy loam soil significantly in comparison with straw burning or removal. In another long-term study, [Yadvinder-Singh et al. (2004]) reported that wheat straw incorporation increased organic C content from 0.40 [*]% {{in the control}} treatment to 0.53 [*]% in the straw incorporation treatment. On the contrary, [Naklang et al. (1999]) reported no significant effect of rice straw incorporation for 3 [*]years on total and labile C content of a sandy soil. In a rice-barley rotation under dry land conditions in northern India, [Kushwaha et al. (2000]) reported that incorporation of crop residues increased soil organic carbon significantly by 28 [*]% in comparison with crop residue removal after one annual cycle.|$|R

Old Malda, the town which lies just east of the confluence of the Mahananda and Kalindi rivers, is part of the English Bazar urban agglomeration. The town rose to prominence as the river port of the old capital of Pandua. During the 18th century it was the seat of prosperous cotton and silk industries. It remains an important distributing centre for <b>rice,</b> jute, <b>and</b> wheat. The area between the historical monument of Jame Masjid (1566) and the landmark of Nimasarai tower across the river Mahananda, constituted a municipality in 1867. <b>Rice,</b> jute, <b>legumes,</b> <b>and</b> oilseed are the chief crops in the surrounding area.
