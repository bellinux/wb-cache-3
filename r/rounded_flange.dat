50|$|IEC flanges are {{identified}} by an alphanumeric code consisting of; the letter U, P or C for Unpressurizable (plain cover), Pressurizable (with a gasket groove) and Choke (with both choke gasket grooves); a second letter, indicating {{the shape and}} other details of the flange and finally the IEC identifier for the waveguide. For standard rectangular waveguide the second letter is A to E, where A and C are <b>round</b> <b>flanges,</b> B is square and D and E are rectangular. So for example UBR220 is a square plain cover flange for R220 waveguide (that is, for WG20, WR42), PDR84 is a rectangular gasket flange for R84 waveguide (WG15, WR112) and CAR70 is a <b>round</b> choke <b>flange</b> for R70 waveguide (WG14, WR137).|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the 8th and 7th centuries BC saw the {{introduction}} of the so-called Phrygian bow fibulae in Asia Minor. These fibulae had a near-perfect semi-circular arch sometimes decorated with knobs or <b>round</b> <b>flanges.</b> In the same period, the Hand or Arm fibula spread from Cyprus, where it appears to have originated, to Syria, Assyria and Persia. In this design the bow was bent 90 degrees at the apex giving the fibula a triangular shape when viewed from the side. The bow was usually decorated with a series of rings and dots. The catch plate usually had the form of a hand, making the entire fibula resemble an arm.|$|R
25|$|While {{working the}} {{attachment}} in Philadelphia, House {{was asked if}} he could help one of Union's western branches in making the paper dishes, as they had trouble in drying them. When House produced samples with a <b>round</b> <b>flange,</b> the design was accepted and he was given a contract to build a machine that would make twenty thousand paper dishes in 10 hours. Much work was required to maintain the heat at 800 to 900 degrees, which was necessary to dry a dish in two (2) seconds. Mr. House involved a system of using superheated steam which kept the dies at red heat. The press was first tested at his factory in Bridgeport before being shipped to Clinton, Iowa.|$|R

50|$|Mudfishes are small, {{growing to}} a maximum of 180 mm. They have a tubular, highly flexible, scaleless body with <b>rounded</b> fins, {{well-developed}} <b>flanges</b> on the caudal peduncle, tubular nostrils, small or absent pelvic fins, and mottled brown colouration. Adults are active at night and are usually found in the benthic zone, while juveniles are active during the day and are found in open water.|$|R
5000|$|In plumbing, {{a closet}} flange (also {{known as a}} toilet flange) is a pipe fitting (specifically, a type of flange) that both mounts a toilet {{to the floor and}} connects the toilet drain to a drain pipe. The name comes from the term [...] "water closet", the {{traditional}} name for a toilet. A typical closet flange is composed of an ABS or PVC hub with a <b>round</b> steel mounting <b>flange</b> attached to the top. Other styles are made from copper, brass, stainless steel, or pure plastic.|$|R
5000|$|Typically galaxiid in form, scaleless, with an elongated, tubular body, and {{moderately}} sized mouth, it may {{be distinguished}} from other galaxiid species by the small eye and the blunt, rounded head shape with protruding tubular nostrils over the upper lip. [...] Pectoral fins are rounded. [...] The pelvic fins are small and set at about {{the midpoint of the}} fish's length, and the dorsal and anal fins are set right back with the dorsal fin slightly ahead of the anal. [...] Caudal fins are <b>rounded</b> with well-developed <b>flanges</b> along the caudal peduncle reaching nearly to the posterior edges of the dorsal and anal fins. [...] Greenish brown in colour, sometimes golden, they are greyish on their ventral surfaces, and marked with irregular darker mottled bands and blotches over the back, sides, and fin bases. [...] Its length is up to 140 mm; commonly it grows to 80 mm.|$|R
