5|$|<b>Regular</b> <b>pruning</b> is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. As most cultivated forms of this species have a lignotuber, dormant buds exist below the bark that respond to pruning or fire, and hard-pruning is possible almost to ground level as a plant can readily sprout from old wood. This {{is not the case}} for var.cunninghamii which should not be pruned below foliage. Flowering may take up to eight years from germination; buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia spinulosa can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of the}} (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E

30|$|The {{relationship}} between PLI {{and the percentage}} of clear timber was reasonably strong, therefore the PLI could be considered to be a good measure of pruned log quality in redwood as it is in radiata pine. The {{relationship between}} log SED and pruned log value was also reasonably strong. Despite the low yield of high-value grades, pruned logs accounted for more value than the unpruned logs. Large DOO values and the presence of epicormic shoots in some lower stems reduced the volume of clear timber grades. The PLI scores for the 13 study trees were much lower than those for radiata pine, mainly {{because of a lack of}} strict control over the defect core (early <b>pruning)</b> and <b>regular</b> removal of epicormic shoots. Higher PLI values (and hence value recovery) can be expected from redwood stands grown under strict management practices (<b>regular</b> thinning, <b>pruning</b> and epicormic removal).|$|R

40|$|To {{construct}} an algorithm which does {{well in a}} board game, one {{must take into account}} the time spent on each move and the ability to evaluate the state of the board. There are multiple ways to handle these issues, but only a few are covered in this analysis. AIs using the algorithms minimax, minimax with alpha-beta pruning and minimax with knowledge-based alpha-beta pruning are being compared when playing Kalaha with a 30 second time limit per move. Each algorithm is in addition paired up with two different methods of evaluating the games state. The first one only compares the amount of counters in each players store, while the second, knowledge-based method, extends this with an evaluation of the counters in play. A tournament was held between the AIs where each match-up played twelve games against each other. The regular minimax algorithm is appearing to be inferior to the improved variations. The knowledge-based alpha-beta pruning is unexpectedly unsuccessful in outperforming the <b>regular</b> alpha-beta <b>pruning</b> and a discussion covers possible errors with the implementation and possible improvements.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} mining {{frequent}} sequences satisfying a given regular expression.

40|$|Agroforestry {{has been}} widely practiced in the Loess Plateau region of China because of its {{prominent}} effects in reducing soil and water losses, improving land-use efficiency and increasing economic returns. However, the agroforestry practices may lead to competition between crops and trees for underground soil moisture and nutrients, and {{the trees on the}} canopy layer may also lead to shortage of light for crops. In order to minimize interspecific competition and maximize the benefits of tree-based intercropping systems, we studied photosynthesis, growth and yield of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) by measuring photosynthetically active radiation, net photosynthetic rate, soil moisture and soil nutrients in a plantation of apple (Malus pumila M.) at a spacing of 4 m × 5 m on the Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that for both intercropping systems in the study region, soil moisture was the primary factor affecting the crop yields followed by light. Deficiency of the soil nutrients also {{had a significant impact on}} crop yields. Compared with soybean, peanut was more suitable for intercropping with apple trees to obtain economic benefits in the region. We concluded that apple-soybean and apple-peanut intercropping systems can be practical and beneficial in the region. However, the distance between crops and tree rows should be adjusted to minimize interspecies competition. Agronomic measures such as <b>regular</b> canopy <b>pruning,</b> root barriers, additional irrigation and fertilization also should be applied in the intercropping systems...|$|R
40|$|The pruning {{of olive}} (Olea europaea L.) trees is an {{expensive}} practice in olive growing. In this paper {{we report on the}} 20 year performance of an olive orchard managed by coppicing. This alternative method was developed to minimize pruning costs and simplify orchard management. Trees were planted at 6 x 6 m distance in spring 1969 and trained to a vasebush by <b>regular</b> annual <b>pruning</b> until spring 1980, when the orchard was divided into 10 plots of about 20 trees each and all trees in one plot were cut off at ground level. In the following years coppicing was extended to one additional plot per year until 1989. In 1990 the plot first coppiced in 1980 was coppiced again to begin a second cycle of coppicing. During the 10 years of each cycle, pruning was limited to the elimination of a few suckers in the centre of the canopy on the third year after coppicing. Thus, the coppiced system required a maximum of 14 min/plant of pruning over 10 years corresponding to 6. 5 h ha(- 1) year(- 1) of unskilled labour. The onset of fruit production occurred the third or the fourth year after coppicing. Fruit yield of the coppiced orchard was 85 % of that of an adjacent orchard trained to vasebush (control). Alternate bearing was less in the coppiced orchard than in the control orchard. No effect of coppicing was found on fruit or oil quality, or occurrence of pests and diseases. The coppicing method is not only suitable to rejuvenate old olive trees but also to manage orchards sustainably at a minimum cost for pruning. The main disadvantage is the unsuitability for mechanical harvesting by trunk shakers because the plant canopy is formed by multiple stems...|$|R

40|$|Our {{investigation}} comprised {{a plot of}} 0. 58 ha in a stand {{established by}} afforestation of farmland during spring 2007. The stand includes 16 different tree species (listed below), ten of which were planted at establishment, while the remaining six species were introduced as replacement planting or invaded spontaneously. Based on their frequency in this stand and their potential economic importance, we consider sycamore, cherry, walnut and Sorbus torminalis as the main species. The plot included a total of 116 Sorbus torminalis trees. The soil developed on sandy glacial till (type luvisol, or similar) with a fragipan {{at a depth of}} 40 cm (Figure 1). During the first five years after planting the height growth of Sorbus torminalis was almost the same as for ash and Norway spruce (Figure 3). Sycamore and cherry grew faster and ranged at the same level as Sitka spruce. For walnut the variation in height growth was substantial, but the best walnut trees grew almost as fast as ash. In 2010 and 2011 the average annual height growth of the 50 tallest trees ranged at 111 - 156 cm for sycamore, 90 - 126 cm for cherry, 71 - 113 cm for wild service tree, 87 - 96 cm for ash, 86 cm for walnut and 48 - 89 cm for Port Orford cedar / Lawson cypress (Table 2). So far, we have been unable to detect any statistically significant influence of topography or depth to the fragipan on height growth. The mortality of Sorbus torminalis was low (9 percent). The most significant problem for Sorbus torminalis was browsing by hare during a period of high snow cover in the winter of 2010 (Table 1 and Figure 2). This effectively reduced the height of the affected trees to 35 - 40 cm (Figure 3). No other tree species were browsed (the area was fenced). In 2012 we pre-selected 100 evenly distributed potential future crop trees per ha and 100 reserve trees. Out of these, only 9 trees were Sorbus torminalis, 23 were walnut, 31 were sycamore and 53 were cherry. During the selection, sycamore and cherry were avoided in favour of Sorbus torminalis and walnut. In the discussion we emphasize the challenge of managing a mixture of 16 different tree species. We point out the urgent need for timely regulation of the light conditions to favour Sorbus torminalis as well as walnut (Figure 4) and the need for early formative pruning as well as subsequent, <b>regular</b> high <b>pruning</b> to avoid inferior timber quality for the main species (Figure 5). We also point out that many of the 'additional' species should be regarded only as serving {{for the benefit of the}} hardwood timber species (sycamore, cherry, walnut, Sorbus torminalis). Finally, we conclude that the stand includes a suitable share of high-quality stems of sycamore and cherry, if Sorbus torminalis or walnut should fail completely...|$|R
40|$|With a genome {{composed}} of a small (246 - 401 nt), single-stranded, circular RNA, viroids are a special class of replicons infecting plants, including some ornamentals, in which they may induce specific diseases. In striking contrast to plant viruses, which encode proteins mediating their own replication and movement, viroids depend on host factors for these purposes and {{can be regarded as}} parasites of their host transcription machinery. The about 30 known viroids are classified into the families Pospiviroidae, type species Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), and Avsunviroidae, type species Avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd). PSTVd and ASBVd replicate (and accumulate) in the nucleus and the chloroplast, respectively, and the other members of both families most likely behave as their type species. Viroids replicate through an RNA-based rolling-circle mechanism that entails reiterative transcription of the incoming circular template to generate complementary longer-than-unit strands that, by themselves or after cleavage and ligation, prime {{the second half of the}} cycle finally leading to the mature circular forms. Remarkably, processing of the multimeric replicative intermediates is catalyzed by hammerhead ribozymes in the family Avsunviroidae. To complete their infectious cycle, viroids must recruit host factors for intracellular, cell-tocell and long-distance movement within the plant. Viroid-derived RNAs with the typical properties of the small interfering RNAs, the hallmarks of RNA silencing, have been detected in plants infected by members of both families. This finding indicates that viroids are inducers and targets (and perhaps even suppressors) of RNA silencing, a regulatory layer that may mediate many aspects of viroid biology including pathogenesis. Chrysanthemum stunt was one of the first diseases in which the inciting agent was identified as a viroid, Chrysanthemum stunt viroid, a member of the family Pospiviroidae that also infects other ornamentals. Chrysanthemum was additionally suspected to host a second viroid, although identification and characterization of the corresponding RNA, Chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid (CChMVd), a member of the family Avsunviroidae, had to wait more than 20 years due to its low accumulation level. There are CChMVd non-symptomatic strains that cross-protect against challenge inoculation with severe strains, with the pathogenicity determinant mapping at a tetraloop of the CChMVd branched conformation. Other viroids infecting ornamentals include Columnea latent viroid, Iresine viroid and Coleus blumei viroid 1, 2 and 3, all belonging to the family Pospiviroidae. Additionally, a retroviroid-like element has been found in carnation. Some ornamental viroids are seed-transmissible. Viroids are usually detected by nucleic acid-based techniques (PAGE, molecular hybridization and RT-PCR). Control measures include the use of viroid-free propagating material together with the <b>regular</b> decontamination of <b>pruning</b> tools. Some viroids can be removed from infected material by in vitro micrografting.
