40|$|Modes with {{transverse}} {{electric field}} (TE-modes) in the NSLS-II multipole vacuum chamber can be generated at frequencies above 450 MHz due to its geometric dimensions. Since the NSLS-II BPM system monitors signals within 10 MHz band at RF frequency of 500 MHz, frequencies of higher-order modes (HOM) can be generated within the transmission band of the band pass filter. In order to avoid systematic errors in the NSLS-II BPM system, we introduced frequency shift of HOMs by using <b>RF</b> metal <b>shielding</b> located in the antechamber slot. We demonstrated numerical modeling and experimental studies of the spurious TE modes in the NSLS-II vacuum chambers with antechamber slot.

40|$|A novel <b>rf</b> <b>shield</b> {{structure}} for bellows chambers or gate valves in high-current accelerators is proposed.

We present an experimental evaluation of a commercially available <b>RF</b> <b>shield</b> in the MRI environment. All tests were performed on 1. 5 T and 3. 0 T clinical MRI scanners. The tests were repeated with and without the <b>RF</b> <b>shield</b> present in the bore, for comparison. Effects of the shield, placed within the scanner bore, on the RF fields generated by the scanner were measured directly using tuned pick-up coils. Attenuation, by as much as 35 dB, of RF field power was found inside the <b>RF</b> <b>shield.</b> These results were supported by temperature measurements of metallic leads placed inside the shield, in which no measurable RF heating was found. In addition, there was a small, simultaneous detectable increase (~ 1 dB) of RF power just outside the edges of the shield. For these particular scanners, the autocalibrated RF power levels were reduced for scan locations prescribed just outside the edges of the shield, which corresponded with estimations based on the pick-up coil measurements. Additionally, no significant heating during MRI scanning was observed on the shield surface. The impact of the <b>RF</b> <b>shield</b> on the RF fields inside the magnet bore is likely to be dependent on the particular model of the <b>RF</b> <b>shield</b> or the MRI scanner. These results suggest that the <b>RF</b> <b>shield</b> could be a valuable tool for clinical MRI practices.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, we’ve been {{learning}} about some important mechanisms that can combine to cause radio frequency (RF) interference to sound systems. They are: 1. An audio cable will be excited as an antenna by radio signals that are nearby, and current will flow along its length. Most of this current will flow on the shield. Antenna action will also cause a voltage to be impressed {{along the length of}} the cable, which can appear as a common-mode component on the signal conductor(s). 2. Improper termination of cable shields within equipment (the Pin 1 problem) injects <b>RF</b> <b>shield</b> current directly into the equipment, where it is detected. 3. Inadequate balancing of shielded cable converts <b>RF</b> <b>shield</b> current to a differential voltage on the signal pair – “shield-current-induced noise ” (SCIN). 4.
