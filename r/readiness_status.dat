40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 29 -November 02, 1990 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaCurrent {{telemetry}} {{instrumentation systems}} {{are subject to}} space and weight limitations for use in bombs, dispensers, submunitions, projectiles and other tactical weapon systems. It is not now feasible to instrument submunitions and projectiles for weapon effectiveness data because state-of-the-art telemetry devices cannot be rapidly and cost effectively installed in unmodified munitions. Furthermore, aircraft modifications for flutter/loads testing are extremely expensive and time consuming. This program will develop a low cost telemetry chip-set consisting of integrated sensors, signal conditioning, transmitters and encryptors. “Peel-and-Stick” (See Figure 1) telemetry devices, containing a specific chip-set with integrated sensors, a battery, and antenna in an extremely small package, will also be developed. Subminiature Telemetry Technology (SMT) will directly impact all future tactical submunition development programs during pre-production RDT&E. This program will also support compatibility and safe separation testing done in the Air Force SEEK EAGLE program. Conventional and kinetic energy projectile programs and advanced missile programs will have long-term benefit. Telemetry and encryption designs developed in this program will advance the state-of-the-art in telemetry fabrication from hybrid to monolithic providing smaller, more shock resistant systems {{at a much lower}} cost. Subminiature telemetry devices could be integrated with the weapon system during its development allowing for a non-destructive, non-contaminating test of the system.

We focus on three areas of analysis: (i) general financing for REDD+ readiness especially M&MRV; (ii) capacity and information for REDD+ implementation and M&MRV; (iii) prospects and challenges for REDD+ and M&MRV readiness in terms of financing and capacity. For the first area of analysis, a REDD+ and M&MRV readiness financing database was created {{based on the information}} from the REDD+ voluntary database and Internet searches. For the second area of analysis, a qualitative approach to data collection was adopted (semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, surveys and observations). All 10 countries were visited between 2010 and 2012. We find that: (i) a significant amount of REDD+ financing flows into the Congo Basin (+US$ 550 million or almost half of the REDD+ financing for the African continent); (ii) across countries, there is an important disequilibrium in terms of REDD+ and M&MRV readiness financing, political engagement, comprehension and capacity, which also appears to be a key barrier to countries receiving equal resources; (iii) most financing appears to go to smaller scale (subnational) REDD+ projects; (iv) four distinct country groups in terms of REDD+ <b>readiness</b> and M&MRV <b>status</b> are identified; and (v) the Congo Basin has a distinct opportunity to have a specific REDD+ financing window for large-scale and more targeted national REDD+ programmes through a specific fund for the regionREDD+ voluntary database, the UN-REDD Programme and the Congo Basin Forest Fund.

The <b>readiness</b> or developmental <b>status</b> of a child when he or she makes the transition from home to school {{is the result of a}} complex web of interactions between the child’s genetic endowment and the environment around the child. This study explored several aspects in school readiness and the importance of it to the personal development of the child in schooling life. A rural school from Batu Pahat was selected as a location of the research. Year One students were selected as the respondents of the study. In order to measure their school readiness several inventories for school readiness were used for the basic reference such as School Readiness Scale by Brackon (1984) and Nurture Group Reintegration Readiness Scale by Doyle (2001). This is very important for the study to develop a comprehensive Model of School Readiness. To gain more information about the respondents’ personal experience especially in upbringing their child, the interview session was conducted. The data explored a personal involvement of the respondents in the readiness process of the child as well as a supplement of the quantitative data. The study have identified five major aspects that should be included in defining the student readiness are physical well-being and motor development, emotional health and a positive approach to new experiences, social knowledge and competence, language skills, and general knowledge and cognitive skills.

40|$|Information Security is {{becoming}} a high-priority issue in most organizations. Management {{is responsible for the}} implementation of security in the organization. Information Security is a multi-dimensional discipline. A well-defined Information Security Management strategy will enable managers to manage security effectively and efficiently in the organization. Management must be able to assess the current security status of the organization. Currently, no comprehensive, integrated assessment tool or model exists to assess the total security posture of an organization. The study will address the problem by proposing a high-level integrated assessment model for Information Security. The study is divided into 4 parts. Part one: Introduction to Information Security Management consists of three chapters. Chapter 1 provides the user with an introduction and background to the study. In chapter 2, the study discusses Information Security as a multi-dimensional discipline. The dimensions identified are the Corporate Governance (Strategic and Operational), Policy, People, Risk Management, Legal, Compliance and Technology dimensions. Information Security is no longer a technical issue, it must be managed. The need for an Information Security Management strategy is discussed in chapter 3 of the study. A successful management strategy should be based on a well-defined Information Security Architecture. Part 2 : Information Security Architectures, of the study consists of one chapter. Chapter 4 of the study discusses and compares different Information Security Architectures. The study uses the information gathered from the comparative study and best practices: CobiT and ISO 17799, to propose a new Information Security Architecture: RISA. The study uses this architecture as a framework for the assessment model. Part 3 : Assessing security consists of five chapters. Chapter 5 discusses the characteristics of assessment and proposes an assessment framework. The study recognizes that assessment on the different levels of an organization will be different, as the assessment requirements on management level will differ from the requirements on a technical level. It is important to use best practices in the assessment model as it enables organizations to prove their security <b>readiness</b> and <b>status</b> to business partners. Best practices and standards enable organizations to implement security in a structured way. Chapter 6 discusses the ISO 17799 and CobiT as best practices and their role in the assessment process. Chapter 7 of the study discusses various factors that will influence security assessment in an organization. These factors are the size of the organization, the type of organization and the resources that need to be secured. The chapter briefly discusses the various dimensions of Information Security and identifies deliverables to assess for every dimension. The chapter proposes a high-level, integrated assessment plan for Information Security, using the deliverables identified for each dimension. The study refines the assessment plan for the Policy Dimension in chapter 8. The chapter proposes various checklists to determine the completeness of the policy set, correct format of every documented policy and if supporting documentation exist for every documented policy. A policy status result will be allocated to each policy that the organization needs. The status results of all the individual policies will be combined to determine the security status of the Policy dimension. The study proposes an integrated high-level assessment model in chapter 9 of the study. This model uses the RISA and assessment plan as proposed in chapter 7. It includes all the specified dimensions of Information Security. The assessment model will enable management to obtain a comprehensive high-level picture of the total security posture of an organization. Chapter 10 will summarize the research done and propose further research to be done. Prof. S. H. von Solm...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} focuses on {{customer}} relationship management initiatives in different organizations and in different countries. A proposed CRM model was adopted and {{used to evaluate the}} CRM initiatives of the chosen organizations in both Saudi Arabia and the UK. The scope of this research was affected by the differing levels of cooperation received from the organizations which participated in the case studies, thereby resulting in differing sizes of the said case studies. The adopted CRM conceptual model was used to evaluate the level of CRM maturity in the organizations studied. This model is believed to be a significant contribution to the theory and field of CRM. This model could be used by organizations to evaluate their CRM initiatives and assess their CRM <b>readiness</b> and <b>status.</b> The proposed CRM model specifies the basic parameters of the CRM sequential stages and their essential supporting conditions. Another important contribution of the study is that it identifies and highlights the potential effects of the cultural disparities existing between Saudi Arabia and the UK on CRM initiatives yet to be undertaken in both countries. In depth open-ended questions were used to collect the data. The analysis of the data gathered went through two main stages. The first stage was to transcribe the data collected from all the organizations chosen and produce detailed write-ups for each case. In every case the write-ups were similarly structured to help the researcher in the second stage, the cross-case analysis. The cross-case analysis was based on the researcher’s proposed conceptual CRM model. The central research question for this study is: Why and how do CRM initiatives succeed or fail? In order to answer this question, the following research questions were formulated and answers were deduced from the findings and results of the qualitative analysis conducted: RQ 1 : What are the critical success factors of CRM initiatives? The answers received resulted in the emergence of some critical success factors, such as: 1. Senior Management Support 2. Business Plan and Vision 3. Making the Change in Small Steps 4. Inter Departmental Collaboration 5. Clear Ownership of Data 6. Training for End-users 7. End Users' Acceptance of Change 8. Degree of Analysis and Customer Segmentation 9. Degree of Alignment 10. Language Considerations 11. Internet Presence RQ 2 : What are the common difficulties when adopting a CRM initiative? The answers came up with the following common difficulties: 1. Resistance to Change 2. Human Errors in Feeding the System 3. Governmental Legislation 4. Cultural Barriers RQ 3 : What does CRM mean for different organizations? The answers exposed a common interesting finding that different organizations considered CRM to be different things. Some considered CRM to be branded CRM software, others as call-centers, yet others as loyalty programs and/or simple tools to manage and satisfy customers. This confirmed that CRM meant different things to different organizations. RQ 4 : Is CRM the right solution for every organization? The answers proved that if branded software from recognized vendors only was to be recognized as CRM, then this standard and rigid kind of CRM could not always be implemented by all organizations. On the other hand, if the managerial concepts behind CRM were to be taken into consideration, then CRM could indeed be implemented by every organization.
