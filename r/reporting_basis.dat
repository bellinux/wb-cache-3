There has been an ongoing effort at RHIC to implement reliable betatron tune feedback as a tool for ramp development, and possibly to control tune during routine operations. Vertical orbit fluctuations in the chromaticity correction sextupoles during ramping are sufficient to fully couple the tunes. This complicates tune control, and with tune feedback causes the basis in which tune errors are reported to not match the basis used to correct the quadrupole currents, leading to feedback instability. This problem has been overcome by using realtime measurements of the coupling projections of both betatron eigenmodes to close feedback loops onto two skew quadrupole families.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} what causes a firm to choose between a business segment and a geographic segment as a primary segment for its segmental information disclosure. It seeks to examine Malaysian firms' experiences as they disclose segmental information under the new accounting standard known as FRS 114, Segment Reporting. Design/methodology/approach – The paper involves 374 Malaysian public-listed companies which disclosed segmental information in their 2006 annual reports. Four hypotheses are developed to examine the influence of these five factors, namely the size of the company, listing status, financial leverage, financial performance, and industrial membership. The non-parametric test is employed to test the formulated hypotheses. Findings – The results reveal two important outcomes: first, size of company, financial performance, and industrial membership are significantly associated with the choice of a primary segment; and financial leverage of a company and listing status are not significantly associated with the choice of a primary segment. Research limitations/implications – The limited number in the sample and inherent segmental reporting problems present limitations. Practical implications – The paper implies extensive auditing work as the new standard requires more extensive disclosure for the primary segment, although the standard allows the adoption of primary segment reporting at management's discretion. Originality/value – The paper's value lies in determining what motivates a company to disclose a business segment or a geographic segment as its primary segmental <b>reporting</b> <b>basis.</b> Accounting standards, Information disclosure, Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{worldwide}} expect {{access to}} safe seafood products {{regardless of its}} origin. Each country judges imported products against its own residue and contaminant standards coupled with differing testing capability, sample collection, sample preparation and data reporting strategies. Australian exporters of finfish whether it is farmed or wild capture origin have to negotiate {{their way through a}} series of regulatory hurdles and gate keeper organisations in each market they wish to target. Detention or destruction of product at border control stations can occur if importing country standards are not met. This thesis outlines five separate case studies of how this has been successfully done with select high value Australian finfish species by tackling different issues of public health and market access concern The General Introduction provides an overview of the researched finfish species and introduces the key residues and contaminants addressed in this thesis. Chapter two introduces dioxins and PCBs data for single season grow- out farmed Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) SBT. The mean concentration of dioxins found was 0. 53 pg WHO TEQ/g (range 0. 2 - 1. 1) while the mean concentration of PCBs found was 32 µg/kg (range 13 - 55). Chapter three more comprehensively addresses single season grow-out farmed Australian SBT not just for dioxins and PCBs, but pesticides, antibiotics and metallic elements. Japanese port of entry official sampling methods are discussed. The mean concentration of dioxins in wild SBT was 0. 14 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 07 - 0. 32) and in farmed SBT was 0. 2 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 06 - 0. 8). The mean concentration of the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in wild SBT was 0. 27 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 18 - 0. 45) and in farmed SBT was 1 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 2 - 4). Mean PCB concentration in wild SBT was 0. 13 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 1 - 0. 21) and in farmed SBT was 0. 8 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 17 - 3. 5). Mean PCB total concentration in wild SBT was 0. 47 µg/kg (range 0. 4 - 0. 6) and in farmed SBT was 6. 6 µg/kg (range 0. 8 - 41). The mean concentration of total mercury in wild SBT was 0. 34 mg/kg (range 0. 28 - 0. 42) and in farmed SBT was 0. 31 mg/kg (range 0. 18 - 0. 45). There were no detectable levels of any pesticide or antimicrobial compounds in any sample of SBT. Chapter four introduces farmed Yellowtail Kingfish (Seriola lalandi) YTKF and Mulloway (Argyrosomus hololepidotus). Data on dioxins, PCBs, pesticides, veterinary medicines and metallic elements are presented and discussed in terms of Australia, Japanese and European regulatory standards. The mean concentration of dioxins in YTKF was 0. 6 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 22 - 0. 8) and in Mulloway was 0. 16 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 16 - 0. 16). The mean concentration of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the YTKF was 2. 6 pg TEQ/g (range 1. 4 - 3. 5), while the Mulloway had a mean concentration of 0. 67 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 57 - 0. 76). The mean concentration of PCBs in YTKF was 21 µg/kg (range 8. 6 - 29) and in Mulloway was 5. 4 µg/kg (mean 4. 7 - 6). The mean concentration of dioxin-like PCBs in YTKF was 2. 1 pg TEQ/g (range 1. 2 - 2. 8) and in Mulloway was 0. 51 pg TEQ/g (Range 0. 41 - 0. 61). The mean mercury concentration in YTKF was 0. 03 mg/kg (range 0. 02 - 0. 05) and in Mulloway it was 0. 023 mg/kg (range 0. 02 - 0. 04). There were no detectable levels of any pesticide or antimicrobial compounds in any sample of YTKF or Mulloway. Chapter five addresses total mercury content in wild Australian SBT. Results are discussed in terms of international regulatory standards and compared with bluefin tunas available in the Japanese market. Mean total mercury concentration was 0. 43 mg/kg (range 0. 24 - 0. 72). A dietary exposure assessment found that pregnant women and women planning pregnancy could consume one 150 g serving per week, the rest of Australian general adult population could consume up to three 150 g servings per week and children (up to 6 years) could consume one 75 g serving of Australian wild SBT per week. Chapter six investigates total mercury content of canned wild Skipjack Tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) products. The mean total mercury content found in 2005 was 0. 10 mg/kg (range 0. 07 - 0. 15) and in 2006 was 0. 09 mg/kg (range 0. 02 - 0. 22). Testing of condiment canning ingredients identified low levels of mercury in black pepper and cinnamon. A dietary exposure assessment found that pregnant women and women planning pregnancy could consume seven 150 g servings per week, {{while the rest of the}} Australian adult general population could consume up to 14 150 g servings per week and children (up to 6 years) could consume eight 75 g servings of these canned tuna products per week. The use of fixed body weight values in exposure assessments may bias results when compared to actual current body weight values of the Australian population. These issues are discussed in conjunction with the inability of consumers to readily identify low mercury content tuna species from back of packaging labelling. Chapter seven describes the causes of detentions and rejections of Australian seafood products in international trade. On a numerically basis, cadmium in Australian crustaceans is ranked the highest notification category. However, caution is urged when assessing these lists without access to qualifying information on frequency of testing, number of tests undertaken, sampling methodology, laboratory analytical techniques and <b>reporting</b> <b>basis.</b> Standards in each notification instance are compared between the importing country and those in Australia. Fish names are discussed and their application to identification of product in trade is highlighted. The General Discussion summarises outcomes of research covered in this thesis and identifies future product integrity research needs and priorities for the Australian seafood industry to meet current and future market access needs...|$|E

40|$|What factors {{contribute}} to subjective experiences of familiarity, and are these subject to unconscious selection? We investigated {{the circumstances under which}} judgments of familiarity are sensitive to task-irrelevant sources using the artificial grammar learning paradigm, a task known to be heavily reliant on familiarity-based responding. In 2 experiments, we manipulated ‘free-floating feelings of familiarity’ by subliminally priming participants with either a subjectively familiar stimulus (their surname) or unfamiliar stimulus (a random letter string). In Experiment 1, after training on an artificial grammar, participants were required to rate the familiarity of a new set of grammar strings where the subliminal priming manipulation preceded each rating. Under these instructions the manipulation significantly altered ratings of familiarity. In Experiment 2, the training, the request for familiarity ratings, and the subliminal manipulation were all unchanged. In addition, however, participants were informed about the presence of rules dictating the structure of the training strings and were required to judge both whether each test-string conformed to those rules and to <b>report</b> the <b>basis</b> for their judgment. This broader decision context eliminated the effect of subliminal primes on ratings of familiarity even when participants’ <b>reported</b> <b>basis</b> for their judgments revealed no conscious knowledge of the rule structure. These results demonstrate that unconscious sources of familiarity can be selected or excluded according to conscious task contexts. The findings are incompatible with theories that equate familiarity with automaticity and those that state people must always be aware of the structural antecedents of metacognition...|$|R
