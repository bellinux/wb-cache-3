5|$|P90 USG:The P90 USG (United States Government) {{model is}} similar to the {{standard}} P90, except the <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> housing is aluminium, and the sight has a revised reticle. The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight.|$|E
5|$|PS90 USG: The PS90 USG is now discontinued. In {{the same}} fashion as the P90 USG, this model has an {{aluminium}} <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> housing with a revised reticle. The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either an olive drab or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring Sights HC-14-62 <b>reflex</b> <b>sight,</b> but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, {{and it can be}} used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided {{on each side of the}} <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> housing.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} German Army {{versions of}} the G36 are equipped with a ZF 3×4° dual optical sight that combines a 3× magnified telescopic sight (with the main reticle designed for firing at 200 m and bullet drop compensation markings for: 200, 400, 600 and 800 m crosshairs and a range-finding scale) and an unmagnified <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> (calibrated for firing at 100 m) mounted {{on top of the}} telescopic sight. The <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> is illuminated by ambient light during the day and uses battery powered illumination for use at night. Electric illumination is activated automatically by a built in photo sensor and can be manually activated to boost the brightness of the reticle in daytime low contrast situations.|$|E
25|$|The first {{variants}} of the ACMS system {{had a total}} weight of 25 kilograms. The weight proved to be bothersome since it forced wearers to move less than one kilometer in the field. A 2002 revision reduced the weight to 12.5 kilograms. Currently, ACMS includes a soldier computer subsystem, which features a wearable computer and power pack, a communications subsystem supporting wireless radio and data connectivity through mesh networking, full color OLED based helmet mounted display and active noise diction hearing protection, indoor and outdoor navigation system with GPS support, and weapon-mounted camera with an ITL MARS <b>reflex</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|E
25|$|The export {{versions}} have {{a single}} telescopic sight with a 1.5× magnification and an aiming reticle fixed at 300 m. All rifles are adapted to use the Hensoldt NSA 80 third-generation night sight, which clamps into the G36 carry handle adapter {{in front of the}} optical sight housing and mates with the rifle's standard optical sight. The sighting bridge also functions as a carrying handle and features auxiliary open sights molded on top of the handle that consist of a forward blade and rear notch, but these can only be used with the <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> removed, as in the G36V. The optical sight system is produced by Hensoldt AG (a subsidiary of Carl Zeiss AG).|$|E
25|$|The FAMAS Infantry is an {{improvement}} of the FAMAS F1, obtained by retrofiting an accessory rail onto {{the top of the}} handguard. This allows mounting combat optics, most notably <b>reflex</b> <b>sights</b> or the 4× magnification SCROME J4 scope.|$|R

500|$|Reflector sights for {{military}} firearms (usually {{referred to as}} reflex sights) {{took a long time}} to be adopted. The US House Committee on Armed Services noted as far back as 1975 on the suitability of the use of <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> for the M16, but the US military did not widely introduce reflector sights until the early 2000s with the Aimpoint CompM2 red dot sight, designated the [...] "M68 Close Combat Optic".|$|E
500|$|A {{reflector}} sight or <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> is {{an optical}} device {{that allows the}} user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed {{on the field of}} view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated reticle) will look like it is {{sitting in front of the}} viewer at infinity. Reflector sights employ some sort of [...] "reflector" [...] to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer's eye position, removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices.|$|E

2500|$|The {{semi-automatic}} Tavor Carbine (TC-21) {{was first}} {{made available for}} civilian customers to purchase in [...] from 2008. The Canadian civilian version initially shipped with the Mepro <b>reflex</b> <b>sight</b> and a slightly longer barrel to meet the Canadian requirement for non-restricted semi-automatic centerfire rifles to have a barrel length of at least 470mm. Current version are shipped with a full length Picatinny rail, without optics. IWI started a new US subsidiary, IWI US, which is manufacturing the semi-automatic TC-21 as the Tavor SAR for U.S. sales. The weapon is manufactured {{with a combination of}} Israeli and US parts. IWI US had shipped 50,000 Tavor SARs to US civilian customers by early 2016.

Even reticles can be modified. There are more than one style for an attachment, which allows for a lot more personalized weaponry; for example, the player can choose between a red dot sight or a <b>reflex</b> <b>sight,</b> both of which share {{many of the same}} traits, although the red dot fills up less of the screen (something desired by many players). Character models depend on the first tier perk instead of the weapon's type. Furthermore, face paints can be unlocked. New custom killstreak rewards include explosive R/C cars, guided missiles and controllable attack helicopters.|$|E
