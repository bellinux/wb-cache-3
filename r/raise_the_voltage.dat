5000|$|High {{generator}} output resistance: In {{order to}} get voltage output levels in the range required by digital electrical devices, a common approach is to place many thermoelectric elements in series within a generator module. The element's voltages add, but so do their individual output resistance. The maximum power transfer theorem dictates that maximum power is delivered to a load when the source and load resistances are identically matched. For low impedance loads near zero ohms, as the generator resistance rises the power delivered to the load decreases. To lower the output resistance, some commercial devices place more individual elements in parallel and fewer in series and employ a boost regulator to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> to the voltage needed by the load.|$|E
50|$|The {{mid to late}} 1880s saw the {{introduction}} of alternating current (AC) systems in Europe and the U.S. AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, {{could be used to}} <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads. Increasing the voltage reduced the current in the transmission and distribution lines and hence the size of conductors and distribution losses.

AC and DC competed for a while, during a period called the War of Currents.

5000|$|Although the ac Josephson effect {{provides}} {{a much more}} stable voltage reference than Weston cells, the first single-junction Josephson standards [...] were difficult to use because they generated very small voltages (1-10 mV).

The most ambitious of theseused 20 junctions in series to realize a voltage of 100 mV with an uncertainty of a few parts in 109. Ensuring that every junction was on a constant voltage step required individually adjusting the bias current to each of the 20 junctions. The difficulty of this procedure makes arrays of significantly more than 20 junctions impractical.

These steps have become known as zero-crossing steps because they cross the zero-current axis of the I-V curve. The lack of stable regions between the first few steps means that for small dc bias currents, the junction voltage must be quantized. With a common bias current at or near zero, the voltage across a large array of these junctions must also be quantized. The possibility of obtaining constant-voltage steps at zero current over a wide range of junction and operating parameters suggested the possibility of building a voltage standard using large arrays of junctions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract‚ÄîNowadays in {{applications}} {{of renewable energy}} sources {{it is important to}} develop powerful and energy-saving photovoltaic converters and to keep the prescriptions of the standards. In grid connected PV converters the obvious solution to increase the efficiency is to reduce the switching losses. Our new developed control method reduces the switching losses and keeps the limitations of the harmonic distortion standards. The base idea of the method is the utilization of 3 -state control causing discontinuous current mode at low input power. In the following sections the control theory, the realizations and the simulation results are presented. II.

To maximize energy efficiency for storage (hEstorage), total leakage power is kept low by selecting the supercapacitors to charge sequentially, alternatingly, or in series {{based on their}} voltages. To maximize energy efficiency for driving load (hEdriving), residual energy is minimized by switching to series composition of the supercapacitors in order to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> above the minimum input voltage of the load-side dc-dc converter. Due to the nonlinear, stateful, load-dependent behavior of such harvesters, parameter sweeping is used for system-level optimization. A topology-reconfigurable structure consisting of two larger, symmetric ‚Äúreservoir ‚Äù supercapacitors and one voltage-raising ‚Äúbootcap ‚Äù prove to be efficient and practical for considering combinations of symmetric and asymmetric capacitance values. Experimental results on an actual implementation show that for charging, series topology is best when input power is high due to lower leakage, individual topology is best when input power is low due to lower voltage; for discharging, series topology is effective in reducing residual energy while individual topology with alternating discharging effectively minimizes leakage.

40|$|Ancillary {{services}} for distributed generation (DG) systems become a challenging issue to smartly integrate renewable-energy sources into the grid. Voltage control {{is one of}} these ancillary services which can ride through and support the voltage under grid faults. Grid codes fromthe transmission system operators describe the behavior of the energy source, regulating voltage limits and reactive power injection to remain connected and support the grid under fault. On the basis that different kinds of voltage sags require different voltage support strategies, a flexible control scheme for three-phase grid-connected inverters is proposed. In three-phase balanced voltage sags, the inverter should inject reactive power in order to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> in all phases. In one- or two-phase faults, the main concern of the DG inverter is to equalize voltages by reducing the negative symmetric sequence and clear the phase jump. Due to system limitations, a balance between these two extreme policies is mandatory. Thus, over- and undervoltage can be avoided, and the proposed control scheme prevents disconnection while achieving the desired voltage support service. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a control algorithm for reference current generation that provides flexible voltage support under grid faults. Two different voltage sags have been experimentally tested to illustrate the behavior of the proposed voltage support control scheme. Postprint (published version...|$|E
