5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E

50|$|Rarest {{and most}} {{collectable}} of all DS variants, a convertible was offered from 1958 until 1973. The Cabriolet d'Usine (factory convertible) were built by French carrossier Henri Chapron, for the CitroÃ«n dealer network. It was an expensive car, so only 1,365 were sold. These DS convertibles used a special frame which was reinforced on the sidemembers and <b>rear</b> suspension <b>swingarm</b> bearing box, similar to, but not {{identical to the}} Break (Station Wagon) frame.|$|R

5000|$|Standard V-Ixion {{which used}} the same engine, frame, transmission, wheels, and <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> as the {{previous}} version.|$|E
50|$|Plunger rear {{suspension}} was offered later, with a <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension frame available from 1954. The model continued in production until 1959, {{by which time}} the traditional Lucas magdyno {{had been replaced by}} an alternator and coil ignition.|$|R
5000|$|The Yamaha XS Eleven motorcycle, {{also called}} XS11 and XS1100, is a Japanese {{standard}} produced from 1978 to 1981, {{powered by a}} air-cooled [...] 4-stroke, DOHC inline four-cylinder engine mounted transversely in a duplex cradle frame with <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension, shaft drive, and telescopic forks.|$|R
50|$|Tamburini {{decided to}} {{streamline}} the bike and its 750cc motor in a close-fitting integral fairing that hid all mechanical parts - {{one of the first}} motorcycles to do this, along with the Honda CBR Hurricane series, introduced the same year. He also reversed the rear cylinder head in order to meet emissions and noise restrictions abroad. The Paso 750 was equipped with latest-generation technical features: square frame tubes made in chromoly steel, <b>rear</b> aluminium <b>swingarm</b> with progressive suspension, 16-inch wheels with radial tires, air-and-oil cooled engine, electronic ignition and a comprehensive dashboard.|$|R

5000|$|V-Ixion R which {{shared the}} same engine, frame, transmission, wheels, and <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> as the 2017 version of the YZF-R15. This variant has a wider rear tire and longer {{wheelbase}} compared to the standard version.|$|E
50|$|The FL {{model was}} given a new frame in 1958. This frame {{included}} a <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> suspended {{by a pair of}} coil-over-shock suspension units. In honor of this fully suspended chassis, the FL's model name was changed from Hydra-Glide to Duo-Glide.|$|E
50|$|The magneto on an AJS was {{in front}} of the cylinder, and the Matchless magneto was behind.A design {{originating}} in the 1930s, the Matchless was updated with a spring frame (<b>swingarm)</b> <b>rear</b> suspension in 1949, becoming the G80S. The suspension was a vast improvement on the bouncy rigid rear end but wheel travel was limited.|$|R
5000|$|Mustang {{introduced}} the Thoroughbred in 1960. Based on the Stallion, the Thoroughbred had a revised frame featuring <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension, a dual seat, and optional storage under the seat. The engine was uprated to [...] and powered the Stallion's four-speed transmission. The handlebars of the Thoroughbred were welded to the forks, preventing adjustment or {{replacement of the}} bars.|$|R
5000|$|AMC {{had adopted}} Velocette's twin-shock <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> {{suspension}} design for its top models. Vertical shock absorber units {{were introduced in}} 1949. The initial [...] "Candlestick" [...] shocks held only 50 cc of SAE 20 weight oil. Leak prone, they were replaced by the [...] "Jampot" [...] shocks in 1951, and by Girling shocks in 1956. In 1957, AMC switched from Burman gearboxes to their own make.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the maintenance-free lifters, the Madura had a self-adjusting hydraulically actuated clutch, and a low-maintenance, shaft final drive. The rear suspension was a sophisticated monoshock arrangement that used a single <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> tube to carry the driveshaft as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} frame for the Powerplus had a conventional rigid rear wheel mounting, but the Powerplus was also available with Indian's Cradle Spring Frame. Introduced in 1913, the Cradle Spring Frame had a <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> linked to trailing leaf springs.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{triangulated}} {{rigid frame}} {{was introduced in}} 1920, it was ahead of its time. By 1939, when the sprung heel and <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> frames had begun to appear so rigid frames had seen their day [...] Vincent had patented a cantilever frame in 1928.|$|E
5000|$|A de-luxe {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1926 with <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension controlled by quarter-elliptic leaf springs, a bucket seat with air cushions, and a fairing with an adjustable Triplex windshield and an instrument panel. A countershaft concentric with the swingarm pivot was driven by a chain from the transmission and drove the rear wheel. The addition of rear suspension increased the wheelbase of the de-luxe model to 68.5 in ...|$|R
50|$|The moped chassis is {{constructed}} from two pressed-steel halves welded together down the centre-line, with pressed steel leading link fork front, and <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension with telescopic dampers. The under seat 3 litre petrol tank is single sided {{on the left}} of the machine. A plastic toolbox takes the position of a dummy fuel tank on the right hand side. Behind the single seat is a useful pressed steel carrier rack.|$|R
5000|$|The Trail Machine was {{introduced}} in 1961. Unlike earlier Mustangs, it was powered by an upright Briggs & Stratton 5.75 hp engine; this was coupled to the usual 3-speed Burman motorcycle transmission and a rear tyre with a tractor tread. These components were mounted in a new, specialized frame constructed of heavy duty 7/8" [...] tubular steel. Originally available only with a rigid rear end, the Trail Machine gained a version with a <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension in 1964.|$|R
50|$|The FZ6 in 2006 has {{a revised}} engine, frame, subframe, grabhandle, <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> and wheels are painted in black. It had a metal {{honeycomb}} type catalytic converter satisfies EU2 and CARB emissions standards, and optimized fuel injection (FI) system mapping to increase torque at lower engine speeds.|$|E
50|$|On a {{motorcycle}} with a mono-shock rear suspension, a single shock absorber connects the <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> to the motorcycle's frame. Typically this lone shock absorber {{is in front}} of the rear wheel, and uses a linkage to connect to the swing arm. Such linkages are frequently designed to give a rising rate of damping for the rear. Honda refers to its mono-shock designs as Pro-link suspensions, Kawasaki as Uni-Trak, Suzuki as Full-Floater, and Yamaha as Monocross. Honda's Unit Pro-Link, used first on the Honda RC211V MotoGP racer, and then on the 2003 Honda CBR600RR sport bike, is intended to isolate the frame and the steering head from undesirable forces transmitted by the rear suspension by having the dampers upper mount contained within the <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> subframe, rather than connecting it to the frame itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} a 180-degree {{parallel}} twin, with the cylinders inclined forwards at 15 degrees from vertical and a chain-driven single overhead cam. The fuel tank holds 10 L of petrol (with a 1.8 L reserve capacity). A diamond frame is used, with telescopic front forks and a <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1974, the YZ250 {{has had a}} single backbone steel frame. For the 2005 model year, however, the YZ250 has a new frame made entirely from aluminum, which brought the dry weight down to 212 lb, and more recently in 2010, to 211 lb. The bike has a <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension system {{with more than a}} foot of travel, as well as telescopic inverted forks with 11.8 in of travel. Front and rear hydraulic disc brakes round out the YZ.|$|R
50|$|Although the S {{model is}} a sport bike with clip-ons and rear-set footrests, the bike is {{nevertheless}} comfortable and capable of touring with a pillion passenger. Its engine is a liquid-cooled 999 cc DOHC 8-valve 4-stroke 40Â° inclined parallel twin with a 180Â° crankshaft, and a balance shaft. It has electronic fuel injection, and wet-sump lubrication. It has Nissin brakes, Marzocchi male-slider forks, and an alloy cantilever <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension. Although the engine is compact, the bike is fairly heavy at 208 kg (dry).|$|R
50|$|A {{single-sided}} swingarm {{is a type}} of swingarm which lies along only one side of the rear wheel, allowing the rear wheel to be mounted like a car wheel (unlike the conventional motorcycle double-sided swingarm). Single-sided swingarms are traditionally found on small motorcycles or scooters, where a robust chain case doubles as the swingarm linking the engine and <b>rear</b> wheel. Single-sided <b>swingarms</b> need to be much stiffer than the double-sided versions, to accommodate the extra torsional forces, and as a result, they are usually heavier than double-sided arms. Having a single mounting point guarantees proper wheel alignment.|$|R
50|$|In October 2006, Yamaha {{announced}} an updated FZ6 for the 2007 model year.The FZ6 received optimized fuel injection (FI) system mapping, redesigned fairing and windscreen, new instrument cluster with analog tachometer and digital speedometer (similar to the FZ1), new four-piston monoblock brake calipers {{for the front}} brake, alumite-finished front forks with revised damping, a three-way catalytic converter, a new seat design, a new <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm,</b> and new passenger footpegs.|$|E
5000|$|Sporty-styled or racing {{motorcycles}} sometimes come with, or {{have added}} as an aftermarket accessory, a [...] "hugger" [...] rear fender, {{attached to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> and {{very close to the}} tire, rather than attached to the rear subframe and away from the tire. [...] Conversely, the practice of removing the front fender and reducing the size of the rear fender produced the bobber customization style of the 1950s onwards.|$|E
5000|$|The S3 Thunderbolt sport-touring {{model was}} {{produced}} from 1997 until 2003, {{along with a}} mechanically identical S3T [...] "Touring" [...] model that ran through model year 2000. The 1,203 cc air-cooled V-Twin engine was mounted as a stressed member in a tubular frame. The powerplant output [...] in 1997 and jumped to [...] in the following years due to revised cam profiles and the new Thunderstorm cylinder heads. While the bike's overall look was the same throughout the model run, there were significant changes made in 1999 that set it, and later models, apart from the 1997 and 1998 bikes. The early bikes used a rectangular section steel <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm,</b> WP Suspension front forks and rear shock, a Keihin 40 mm CV carburetor, and a Performance Machine six-piston front brake caliper. Beginning in 1999 a new cast aluminum <b>rear</b> <b>swingarm</b> was utilized along with Showa front suspension forks and rear shock. The front brake caliper, while still a six-piston unit, was now made by Nissin. The most technological change came in the new Dynamic Digital Fuel Injection (DDFI) system, replacing the old carburetor.|$|E
50|$|Alongside {{the fast}} and proven single {{cylinder}} engine, Simson {{also developed a}} 250 cc parallel twin. It had long-stroke dimensions of 50.5 mm x 56 mm and produced more than 30 bhp at 10,000 rpm. Like the single, the twin's valves were in a V-formation {{and it had a}} six-speed transmission and chain final drive. The twin made its first appearance in 1958 with chain driven double overhead camshafts, but for the following season the engine was revised with shaft-driven overhead cams. Simson developed a new motorcycle frame for racing, with a leading link front suspension and long <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension. The twin proved to be fast but was plagued with teething troubles.|$|R
50|$|Several {{competition}} {{versions of}} the 425 were built. In 1953 a racing version of the plunger-framed model was produced as the AWO 425 R. It was not offered for sale {{to the public and}} only 15 examples were built. Power output from the race-tuned version of the pushrod overhead valve engine was 24 bhp. A version with chain-driven double overhead camshafts appeared in 1955 and produced about 28 bhp. By 1958 Simson's racing team found it necessary to switch from shaft drive to chain drive, which meant that it had to develop a new engine as well. For the 1958 season the Simson single had a telescopic front fork and <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of <b>swingarm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension on the factory race team in 1937, Veloce introduced the Mark VIII KTT in 1938, {{which was the first}} production motorcycle to use a swinging-arm rear fork with enclosed suspension units ('shocks'), although these were 'oleo pneumatic' and used air as the springing medium, and not spring/oil shocks as adopted by the motorcycle (and car) industry postwar. The system was developed by Veloce designer Harold Willis, who flew a light plane with Oleo suspension legs; he contacted the Oleo company for a special pair of air shocks, which were used by Veloce for their factory racing motorcycles from 1937 onwards, and appeared on the production KTT Mark VIII in 1938. Production of the Velocette Mark VIII KTT ended in 1949, with around 238 models built. Around 1000 KTTs were produced in total from 1929 - 1950.|$|R
