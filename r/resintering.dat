50|$|Blue frit, {{also known}} as Egyptian blue, was made from quartz, lime, a copper compound, and an alkali flux, all heated to a {{temperature}} between 850 and 1000°C. Quartz sand {{may have been used}} to contribute silica to the frit. The copper content must be greater than the lime content {{in order to create a}} blue frit. Ultimately the frit consists of cuprorivaite (CaCuSi4O10) crystals and “partially reacted quartz particles bonded together” by interstitial glass. Despite an argument to the contrary, scientists have found that, regardless of alkali content, the cuprorivaite crystals develop by “nucleation or growth within a liquid or glass phase.” However, alkali content—and the coarseness of the cuprorivaite crystals—contribute to the shade of blue in the frit. High alkali content will yield “a large proportion of glass,” thereby diluting the cuprorivaite crystals and producing lighter shades of blue. Regrinding and <b>resintering</b> the frit will create finer cuprorivaite crystals, also producing lighter shades.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} grinding protocols and <b>resintering</b> on flexural fatigue limit and surface characterization of LavaTM Y-TZP. Bar-shaped specimens (20 × 4. 0 × 1. 2 mm, n= 40; 20 × 4. 0 × 1. 5 mm, n= 80) were obtained. Half of the thinner specimens (1. 2 mm) constituted the as-sintered group (AS), while the thicker ones (1. 5 mm) were ground with diamond burs under irrigation (WG) or not (G). The other half of thinner and half of ground specimens were resintered (1000 ºC, 30 min), forming the groups ASR, WGR and GR. Fatigue limit (500, 000 cycles, 10 Hz) was evaluated by staircase method in a 4 -point flexural fixture. Data were analyzed by 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05). Surface topography (n= 3) and fracture area (n= 3) were evaluated by SEM. X-ray diffraction data (n= 1) was analyzed by Rietveld refinement. ANOVA revealed significant differences (p< 0. 001) for the grinding protocol, <b>resintering</b> and their interaction. Grinding increased the fatigue limit of non-resintered groups. There {{was no significant difference}} among the resintered groups. <b>Resintering</b> significantly increased the fatigue limit of the AS group only. Both protocols created evident grooves on zirconia surface. The failures initiated at the tensile side of all specimens. The percentages (wt%) of monoclinic phase were AS (8. 6), ASR (1. 2), G (1. 8), GR (0. 0), WG (8. 2), WGR (0. 0) before, and AS (7. 4), ASR (6. 5), G (3. 2), GR (0. 2), WG (4. 6), WGR (1. 1) after cyclic loading. Grinding increased the fatigue limit of non-resintered Y-TZP and formed evident grooves on its surface. <b>Resintering</b> provided significant increase in the fatigue limit of as-sintered specimens. In general, grinding and <b>resintering</b> decreased or zeroed the monoclinic phase...|$|E
40|$|Instrumented fuel {{assembly}} (IFA) - 431 was irradiated in the Halden Boiling Water Reactor (HBWR) {{for the purpose}} of extending the steady-state data base. Rod 6 of this assembly began irradiation with UO{sub 2 } fuel of 92 % theoretical density (TD) that was unstable with respect to in-reactor densification. Thermal <b>resintering</b> tests resulted in a final density of 95. 3 % TD while post-irradiation examination (PIE) indicated a final density of 96. 5 % TD. Observed microstructural changes were consistent with published densification studies; there was a marked depletion of submicrometer diameter pores and total pore volume. However, grain size increased only slightly, indicating that internal pellet temperatures did not reach the 1875 K applied in <b>resintering</b> tests. Oensification was observed to increase the temperatures in rod 6, but temperatures did not become as high as for a sibling rod that simulated instantaneous densification.

40|$|Magnetic {{disaccommodation}} phenomena are {{studied in}} YIG polycrystalline samples. The compouads were prepared by a ceramic technique and sintered at temperatures ranging from 1350 °C to 1450 °C in air and CO 2 atmospheres. The {{results are presented}} as isochronal spectra of the relative time variation of the initial magnetic permeability after specimen demagnetization. For samples sintered in air atmosphere, it can be observed a clear positive relaxation peak around 125 K. When the sintering temperature is increased, the amplitude of this peak decreases slightly and a new process appears at higher temperatures (around 180 K). On the contrary, a drastic change is produced when samples are <b>resintered</b> in CO 2 atmosphere. In this case, relaxation spectra exhibit negative peaks (accommodation processes) around 115 K. Also, the relaxation features of these processes seem {{to be influenced by}} sintering temperature.

The mechanical {{properties of the}} composites were measured to investigate the influence of processing parameters, SiC particle characteristics and metallic coating (copper) of the SiC particles. It {{was found that the}} mechanical properties of the composites prepared by pressing, sintering, re-pressing, and <b>resintering</b> are superior to those of composites prepared by the pressing and sintering route, and that sintering temperature was an important factor in controlling composite properties. Changes in hardness, theoretical density, ultimate tensile strength, and wear resistance of composites containing SiC of varying silicon carbide content were observed.

40|$|A novel method using a {{high power}} diode laser to {{selectively}} remove cobalt binder from the outermost layer of Co-cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co 5. 8 wt. %) is hereby discussed. A continuous 940 -nm wavelength diode laser source at power of 600 - 1500 W and scanning speed of 1 mm/s {{was used to}} perform the thermal treatments. Hot Filament-Chemical Vapour Deposition (HF-CVD) was then used to deposit PolyCrystalline Diamond (PCD) coatings. Increasing the laser fluence, Co-binder was progressively and selectively evaporated from the WC-Co substrate. The selective removal of the Co-binder from the outermost layer of WC-Co induces a significant corrugation of the substrate, very promising to deposit on it high quality diamond with improved adhesion. Indeed, too much high laser fluence must be avoided, as it would tend to induce the <b>resintering</b> or the local melting of the tungsten carbide grains. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In this review, {{particulate}} {{materials are}} studied using the Discrete Element Method (DEM), where the particles keep their identity throughout. Loose particles can sinter due to time-, stress- or temperature-dependent forces. Large deformations of sintered samples will then lead to damage. Self-healing of damaged samples can be activated through <b>resintering,</b> {{a process that}} increases further the contact adhesion between particles. Initially, the particle-samples are prepared by applying isotropic (hydrostatic) pressure. The spherical particles deform plastically at contact and stick to each other due to strong, non-linearly increased van der Waals forces. Such pres-sure-sintering results in a solid sample with (after releasing pressure) zero conflning stress - on which uni-axial tension or compression can be applied. Damage can occur through loss of contacts and/or loss of adhesion and more damage will occur with increasing deformation. In order to trigger "self-healing at different damage levels, the mechanical loading is first stopped, second, the system is resintered (so that the adhesion at existing contacts in the damaged sample becomes stronger than originally), and third, mechanical loading is continued with the healed sample, in order to study the material properties after the healing event...|$|E

The process {{consists of three}} steps. Firstly a Bi 2 -xLixPb 0. 3 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +δ sample was sintered {{in the air at}} 850 °C for 50 hrs; subsequently the sintered sample was regrind and sintered again at 850 °C for another 50 hrs. While in the third step the sample <b>resintered</b> it at 830 °C for 40 hrs, and then slowly cooled in furnace with a rate of 2 ºC/min. The process enhances growing a superconducting phase unidirectional and suppresses the high phase intrusion which leading to the production of well textured samples.

The phase formation and the microstructure were studied for different amounts of Li. It was found that sample with x = 0. 3 Li showed the highest Tc-zero at 130 K. Increasing Li content to 0. 5 decreases the critical temperature to 113 K. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, and DC electrical resistivity.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{magnetic}} Praseodymium (Pr) substitutional doping at varying concentration into the Strontium (Sr) {{site in the}} Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu- 0 (BSCCO) high temperature superconductor is investigated. The samples are prepared via solid state reaction method and underwent sintering, annealing and <b>resintering</b> process. The two measured properties are the electrical and the structural properties according to the stoichiometric formula (Bii 6 Pbo. 4) -(Sri. JtPrt) 2 -Ca 2 -Cu 3 - 05 where x = 0. 0 - 0. 5. For all series of doping concentration, x = 0. 0 - 0. 5, Tc (onset) decreased for x = 0. 1, then slightly increased at x = 0. 2. The Tc then gradually decreased as x is increased and approaches zero as x > 0. 5. The onset of critical temperature Tc and zero resistance critical temperature Tc (R=O) as x increases indicated the superconductivity destructive trend. Interestingly, at x = 0. 2, the destructive trend was reversed, but as x > 0. 2, critical transition temperature is lowered. Critical current density, jc was also optimised for x = 0. 2 samples. Longer sintering and annealing also improves the Tc and this is shown in x - 0. 2 sample.

40|$|Microstructural {{evolution}} and fracture behavior of zirconia (ZrO 2) -based thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were investigated under thermal exposure. New ZrO 2 granule with 8 wt. % yttria (Y 2 O 3) with a deformed hollow morphology was developed through a spray drying process and employed to prepare TBCs. The thermal exposure {{tests were conducted}} at 1210 °C with a dwell time of 100 h till 800 h. The residual stress at the interface between top coat and thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer was measured using a nanoindentation technique before and after thermal exposure. Vertical cracks on the top coat were newly formed and interlamellar cracks at the interface were enhanced after the thermal exposure of 800 h. Especially, partial delamination was observed at the interface after the thermal exposure of 800 h in TBC samples tested. The microstructural evolution in the top coat could be defined through load–displacement curves, showing a higher load or a less displacement after the thermal exposure of 800 h. The stress state was strongly dependent on the TGO geometry, resulting in the compressive stresses at the "valleys" or the "troughs," and the tensile stresses at the "crests" or peak areas, in the ranges of - 500 to - 75 MPa and of + 168 to + 24 MPa, respectively. These stress terms incorporated with <b>resintering</b> during thermal exposure affected the mechanical properties such as hardness and elastic modulus of the top coat.

40|$|Abstract. The bonding {{strength}} of top coat in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with different bond layers has been measured with thermal fatigue and its fracture behavior {{has been investigated}} considering {{the effects of a}} thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer and <b>resintering</b> of the top coat. Two kinds of TBCs with different thicknesses of approximately 80 and 280 µm in bond layer were prepared by two different methods of air plasma spray (APS) and high velocity oxygen flow (HVOF). Top layer (3 Y-TZP) was coated on both bond layers using the APS process. Thermal fatigue tests were conducted at temperature of 1100 o C with dwell time of 10 hr, which tests were done till 20 cycles. The HVOF process provides a relatively homogeneous microstructure in the bond layer, compared with the APS process. The formation of TGO layer is influenced by the exposed time, independent of the bond layer thickness and the bond layer species. TBCs with the bond layer prepared by the APS process show higher {{bonding strength}} than those by the HVOF process in as-prepared TBCs (before thermal fatigue), showing 15 – 18 MPa for the APS process and 13 – 16 MPa for the HVOF process. Whereas the fracture in TBCs with the HVOF bond coat are originated at the interface between the top coat and the bond coat, the fracture within the top coat in TBCs with the APS bond coat However, after the thermal fatigue, the bonding strength value is increased to 18 – 20 MPa in both cases even though the TGO layer is formed, showing the fracture paths within the top coat in both cases...|$|E
40|$|Solid state {{electrochemical}} {{systems such}} as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are attractive for power generation, carbon capture, hydrogen and syngas production. YSZ and LSM have been extensively studied as electrolyte and electrode materials respectively for solid oxide cells operating in 800 - 1000 °C temperature range. During the fabrication and operation of these systems, significant degradation in performance has been reported due {{to the formation of}} electrically insulating phases La 2 Zr 2 O 7 and SrZrO 3 at the LSM-YSZ interface. The contradictory dada in literature, the limited information about effect of sintering atmosphere and the porosity urged a necessary systematic research of the LSM-YSZ composite system. This thesis includes a systematic study of reaction between LSM and YSZ, the role of oxygen pressure, porosity, raw power, sintering temperature and time on the air electrode densification, microstructural evolution and interaction of LSM-YSZ composite. In addition, the effect of zirconate phase on the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the composite cathode was studied. Also, the reversibility of the reaction was studied, namely the La 2 Zr 2 O 7 formed in lower PO 2 can be reversed back into LSM and YSZ when <b>resintered</b> in higher PO 2. The prevention of the detrimental LSM-YSZ reaction was discussed thermodynamically and successfully demonstrated by Mn-doped YSZ powder. Long term degradation remains an issue for SOEC development. Anode delamination has been frequently observed and considered as one of the largest contributor to the cell performance degradation. Previous study found the resistive compound La 2 Zr 2 O 7 formed at the air electrode side, and La 2 Zr 2 O 7 formation degrades the cell performance. So the understanding from the study of the LSM-YSZ composite was applied in a symmetric solid electrolysis cell to alleviate the LSM-YSZ reaction. The SOEC electrochemical performance was improved by introducing a Mn-doped YSZ interlayer between LSM and YSZ. The delamination of air electrode was mitigated by a porous sol-gel Mn-doped YSZ interlayer. The sol-gel structure with high surface area and porosity {{is believed to be the}} possible reason for the prevention of delamination by release the oxygen pressure at the air electrode side...|$|R
