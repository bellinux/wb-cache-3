40|$|AbstractHeat {{recovery}} from exhaust gas streams is applicable {{to a wide}} variety of industries. However, high heat transfer resistance of gases and the presence of entrained particulate matter that readily fouls limits industry uptake of current heat recovery technology. Improvements to standard heat exchanger designs are needed. In this study Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to investigate the effect of ten different tube cross-sections on heat transfer resistance, gas flow resistance and foulability. The average wall shear stress around the shape is used to predict foulability and an estimated asymptotic fouling resistance is used to calculate an equivalent fouled Coulburn j factor, jf. CFD results show the best tube for exhaust heat recovery is an elliptical tube closely followed by the flattened <b>round</b> <b>tube.</b> The ellipse shape produced fouled Coulburn j factor, jf values, expressed as a ratio of tube bank friction factor f, over 100 % higher than that of standard <b>round</b> <b>tube.</b> A flattened <b>round</b> <b>tube</b> is also promising, given enough spacing between the tubes, and may be the practical economic optimum...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{recovery}} from exhaust gas streams is applicable {{to a wide}} variety of industries. Two problems encountered in exhaust gas heat recovery are: the high heat transfer resistance of gases and the presence of entrained particulate matter, which can limit the use of extended surface area. Standard heat exchangers use <b>round</b> <b>tube.</b> This study uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to investigate whether round or another shape is the best tube selection for exhaust heat recovery. Tube shape rankings are based on taking into account heat transfer, gas flow resistance and foulability. Foulability is inferred from the average wall shear stress around the front or back of each shape. An estimated asymptotic fouling resistance is used to calculate an equivalent fouled j factor, jf. CFD results suggest the best tube for exhaust heat recovery is an elliptical tube. The ellipse shape produced j/f and jf/f ratios (where f is the tube bank friction factor) over 1. 5 times larger than that of standard <b>round</b> <b>tube.</b> A flattened <b>round</b> <b>tube</b> is also promising and may be the practical and economic optimum...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the early}} {{electronic}} TV systems, from the mid-1930s onward, shared the same aspect ratio of 4:3 which was chosen to match the Academy Ratio used in cinema films at the time. This ratio was also square enough to be conveniently viewed on round cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), which were all that could be produced given the manufacturing technology of the time. (Today's CRT technology allows the manufacture of much wider tubes, and the flat-screen technologies which are becoming steadily more popular have no technical aspect ratio limitations at all.) The BBC's television service used a more squarish 5:4 ratio from 1936 to 3 April 1950, when it too switched to a 4:3 ratio. This did not present significant problems, as most sets at the time used <b>round</b> <b>tubes</b> which were easily adjusted to the 4:3 ratio when the transmissions changed.|$|E

In 1982 Honda introduced the VF series, which used a V4 rather than inline-four motor configuration. The first model year only cruiser style bikes were offered, but in 1983 the first sport bike based on the V4 became available:the Honda VFR-750 Interceptor. AMA rules for Superbike racing were changed in 1983 to decrease maximum engine size from 1025cc to 750cc. The Honda Interceptor was ready to compete in this new category. In addition to the innovative V4 engine configuration, it was liquid cooled, and it sported a rectangular tube steel frame, to increase stiffness, {{as opposed to the}} more traditional <b>round</b> <b>tubes</b> of the UJM era.
