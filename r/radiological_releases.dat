In {{the event of an}} attack, our role is to respond to fires, chemical, biological or <b>radiological</b> <b>releases,</b> building collapse and other rescue situations. Fire and Rescue NSW previously jointly funded and operated a BK 117 helicopter in partnership with the NSW Police Force Aviation Support Branch.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to identify the preliminary design basis events (DBEs) for consideration {{in the design of}} the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR). For external events and natural phenomena (e. g., earthquake), the objective is to identify those initiating events that the MGR will be designed to withstand. Design criteria will ensure that radiological release scenarios resulting from these initiating events are beyond design basis (i. e., have a scenario frequency less than once per million years). For internal (i. e., human-induced and random equipment failures) events, the objective is to identify credible event sequences that result in bounding <b>radiological</b> <b>releases.</b> These sequences will be used to establish the design basis criteria for MGR structures, systems, and components (SSCs) design basis criteria in order to prevent or mitigate <b>radiological</b> <b>releases.</b> The safety strategy presented in this analysis for preventing or mitigating DBEs is based on the preclosure safety strategy outlined in ''Strategy to Mitigate Preclosure Offsite Exposure'' (CRWMS M&O 1998 f).

40|$|After the Fukushima Daiichi {{nuclear power}} plant accident, the Korean {{government}} and nuclear industries performed comprehensive safety inspections on all domestic {{nuclear power plant}}s against beyond design bases events. As a result, a total of 50 recommendations were defined as safety improvement action items. One of them is installation of a containment filtered venting system (CFVS) or portable backup containment spray system. In this paper, the applicability of CFVS is examined for OPR 1000, a 1000 [*]MWe PWR with large dry containment in Korea. Thermohydraulic analysis results show that a filtered discharge flow rate of 15 [*][kg/s] at 0. 9 [*][MPa] is sufficient to depressurize the containment against representative containment overpressurization scenarios. <b>Radiological</b> <b>release</b> to the environment is reduced to 10 - 3 considering the decontamination factor. Also, this cyclic venting strategy reduces noble gas release by 50 % for 7 days.
