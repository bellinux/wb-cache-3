2500|$|Pathology of F. magna {{infection}} varies {{according to}} host type but some features are shared by all three types. Primary lesions usually occur in the liver and are associated with mechanical damage due to migrating juvenile flukes or fibrous encapsulation of sedentary adult flukes. The most common feature of F. magna infection is black pigmentation in abdominal or thoracic organs, especially in the liver. The hematin pigment is produced by flukes as a byproduct of feeding on blood. Pigment within tissues {{is a result of}} migrating of juvenile flukes and it accumulates within hepatic cells without resorption. F. magna has also been associated with <b>Red</b> <b>Water</b> <b>disease</b> in bovine. F. magna causes liver damage, which allows the bacteria Clostridium haemolyticum to cause secondary infection in hepatic tissue. The infection will decrease the livers function, and the host's urine will become red, hence the name [...] "Red Water" [...] disease.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{bacteria}} in the occasional emergence of <b>red</b> <b>water,</b> which has been documented worldwide, {{has yet to be}} determined. To better understand the mechanisms that drive occurrences of <b>red</b> <b>water,</b> the bacterial community composition and the relative abundance of several functional bacterial groups in a water distribution system of Beijing during a large-scale <b>red</b> <b>water</b> event were determined using several molecular methods. Individual clone libraries of the 16 S rRNA gene were constructed for three <b>red</b> <b>water</b> samples and one sample of normal water. Beta-, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria comprised the major bacterial communities in both <b>red</b> <b>water</b> and normal water samples, in agreement with previous reports. A high percentage of <b>red</b> <b>water</b> clones (25. 2 to 57. 1 %) were affiliated with or closely related to a diverse array of iron-oxidizing bacteria, including the neutrophilic microaerobic genera Gallionella and Sideroxydans, the acidophilic species Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, and the anaerobic denitrifying Thermomonas bacteria. The genus Gallionella comprised 18. 7 to 28. 6 % of all clones in the three <b>red</b> <b>water</b> libraries. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the 16 S rRNA gene copy concentration of Gallionella spp. was between (4. 1 +/- 0. 9) x 10 (7) (mean +/- standard deviation) and (1. 6 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (8) per liter in <b>red</b> <b>water,</b> accounting for 13. 1 % +/- 2. 9 % to 17. 2 % +/- 3. 6 % of the total Bacteria spp. in these samples.

Among them, ten species including Dictyocha fibula, Gonyaulax polygramma, Gymnodinium type-' 65 (causative organisms of the <b>red</b> <b>water</b> of this bay in the past), Gymnodinium nelsoni, unknown species of Gymnodinium (specimen No. 57 in Plate II), and Ceratium fusus were selected as important organisms and their movement was pursued in the present study.

40|$|Ghana's Upper Region {{provides}} {{an excellent example of}} the beneficial effects of improved water security provided by hand-pump tube wells. Following a Ghana-Canada bilateral development project that installed some 2500 pumps, protection rates against guinea worm disease may be estimated as 88 % in the west, and 96 % in the east. Survey comparisons between ca 1960 and 1990 show that dracunculiasis declined in 32 of a total of 38 areas. The shadow of guinea worm has been lifted from the land and, in many areas, a true "vanishing" has occurred. The few areas of disease increase are characterized by the lowest population densities, pioneer settlement for cotton farming, and an absence of bore holes. Vagaries of development have inadvertently produced disease transformations or "metamorphoses" from dracunculiasis to elephantiasis (lymphatic filariasis) in one area, and to <b>red</b> <b>water</b> <b>disease</b> (schistosomiasis hematobium) in other areas. Correlative associations between pump densities and guinea worm disease are weakened by the large size of areas for which disease is reported in 1990. One preliminary finding is that geographical distance to the pump is a stronger influence than demographic pressure on pumps, regarding dracunculiasis. Diminishing returns on higher pump densities in many areas support the idea of making fuller, safer use of supplementary non-pump water. Despite crises of fee payment and pump maintenance, the rural bore hole project has struck a mortal blow against guinea worm, and permanently raised {{the quality of life in}} the Upper Region. guinea worm dracunculiasis bore holes tube wells hand pumps disease control Ghana...|$|E

(1) The water mass lacking in dissolved oxygen occurred owing to the rising of water temperature, to the extension of thermocline by rainfall and to the stagnation of water mass by semiclosure, such being natural status of Omura Bay.

40|$|The first <b>red</b> <b>water</b> {{appeared}} in the south-western coast of Omura Bay from middle July to early August, and the second one spread all over {{the southern part of}} the Bay from latter August to middle September 1965. Both bloomings were due to Gymnodinium sp. This paper mainly deals with the second one. This blooming was accompanied by the phenomenon that dissolved oxygen in the bottom water-mass dwindled into zero, and also by the mass-mortality of fishes―goby, blenny, globefish, common eel, octopus, dragonet, anchovy, gray mullet, conger eel, etc. Nevertheless the distribution of blooming was limited to the southern part and the water-mass without dissolved oxygen and the mass-mortality extended all over the bay.

From the status of the <b>red</b> <b>water,</b> the dissolved oxygen content in the bottom water-mass and the progress of decomposition above the ark shell, it was assumed that the mass-mortality of fishes and invertebrates was not caused by the <b>red</b> <b>water,</b> but primarily by the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water-mass all over the Bay...|$|R

The alkaline hydrolysis was used for remediation 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene and <b>red</b> <b>water</b> at pH = 10. 9. Nevertheless, the hydroxyl radicals would be generated by ozone decomposition with ozone dose of 0. 177 g/L. The samples were subjected to chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon analysis to monitor pollutants removal. The rate of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene and <b>red</b> <b>water</b> pollutants degradation were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography. 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene synthetic solution resulted 55. 5 % chemical oxygen demand removal by 3 h direct ozonation. Following direct ozonation the biological treatment twenty four hours chemical oxygen demand reached 98. 9 % and 98. 7 % removal using humic acid and river water 1 % (v/v) inoculation singly and respectively. Conventional direct ozonation showed non significant change in total organic carbon degradation. While on using multi-stage ozone-biological treatment process where humic acid and/or river water were used as inoculums singly and respectively, total organic carbon fulfilled 73 % and 98. 3 % removal. The process was one hour direct ozonation and followed by three days multi-stage ozone-biological treatment. In multi-stage ozone-biological treatment process, ozonation was effective to decompose total organic carbon and to produce biodegradable dissolved organic carbon easily removed by ozone oxidation up to 98. 3 % in 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene synthetic solution.
