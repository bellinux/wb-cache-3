50|$|There is an {{extended}} sequence where {{the film is}} superimposed over itself in <b>reverse.</b> By <b>running</b> the film forwards and backwards at the same time, parallels are created, such as Danny walking in on his father and the previous caretaker as they discuss Danny's murder.|$|R
50|$|Despite some {{operational}} problems, such as slopes with {{a maximum}} grade of 2.38% in the Thuringian forest {{and the need to}} <b>reverse</b> trains <b>running</b> to Würzburg in Schweinfurt, the line was a major long-distance north-south link until 1945. It was the shortest route between Berlin and Stuttgart.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} specifically {{for use on}} the Natal South Coast and the Richmond branch, where <b>reverse</b> <b>running</b> was required due {{to the absence of}} turning facilities such as turntables or triangles. In SAR service, the Class E was mainly used for shunting work.|$|E

50|$|Backward running, {{also known}} as {{backwards}} running, running backwards, <b>reverse</b> <b>running,</b> retro running, or retro locomotion is the act of running in reverse, so that one travels in the direction one's back is facing rather than one's front. It is classed as a retro movement, the reverse of any normal movement.|$|E
5000|$|Flooding {{refers to}} a fluid flow {{phenomenon}} whereby counter-current two-phase flow is reversed and runs concurrent {{in the direction of}} the initial gas/vapor phase flow when filling, or [...] "flooding", a nuclear reactor core with coolant. [...] This phenomenon is generally discussed with respect to a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). As this phenomenon proceeds, annular flow running counter-current begins as liquid water is inserted into the system. Then if conditions are correct, the frictional force at the gas-liquid interface begins to reverse the flow of the liquid. Finally, the flow of the liquid <b>reverses,</b> <b>running</b> concurrently in a slug (or other) flow regime. The significance of this phenomenon is that, if not properly designed for, it can present issues when trying to fill the core with liquid (the phenomenon works against gravity, forcing liquid out of the core).|$|R
40|$|Blood gas {{analysis}} {{studies have been}} made in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. It has been shown that oxygen tensions are reduced when fluid has been run into the peritoneal cavity and that this fall in Pao 2 is <b>reversed</b> after <b>running</b> out the dialysate. The change in Pao 2 is greater with 2 -litre than with 1 -litre cycles...|$|R
50|$|Depending on the contaminant, {{catalyst}} poisoning {{can sometimes be}} <b>reversed</b> by <b>running</b> the engine under a very heavy load {{for an extended period}} of time. The increased exhaust temperature can sometimes vaporise or sublimate the contaminant, removing it from the catalytic surface. However, removal of lead deposits in this manner is usually not possible because of lead's high boiling point.|$|R
50|$|By {{means of}} the {{application}} of a pressure exchange system, which is already used in other domains, a considerably higher efficiency of energy recovery of reverse osmosis systems may be achieved than with the use of <b>reverse</b> <b>running</b> pumps or turbines.The pressure exchange system is suited, above all, for bigger plants i.e. approx. ≥ 2000 m3/d permeate production.|$|E
50|$|The German Class 23 (Baureihe 23 or BR 23) {{engines of}} the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) were {{standard}} (Einheitslokomotiven) steam engines that were {{conceived as a}} replacement for the Prussian P 8 by the Schichau Works. They were given the same boiler as the Class 50s which were developed in parallel and, like them, the newly developed 2'2' T 26 tender with its front wall that protected train crews during <b>reverse</b> <b>running.</b>|$|E
50|$|A single Railmotor was {{delivered}} to the Cape Government Railways (CGR) in 1906. The railmotor was a self-contained motor-coach in which the locomotive and coach were embodied in a single vehicle, with a driver's station at the rear end of the coach for <b>reverse</b> <b>running.</b> The locomotive part was a 0-4-0 side-tank engine which was built by North British Locomotive Company, while the coach part on a single bogie was built by Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage & Wagon.|$|E
50|$|Using the countersteam brake, {{experienced}} locomotive drivers can <b>reverse</b> the <b>running</b> {{direction of}} a steam locomotive {{almost as if it}} hasn't been brought to a stop, because the actual changeover point occurs whilst the locomotive is still moving in the initial direction of travel. This technique requires detailed knowledge and experience because if it is not carried out correctly, damage to the locomotive engine may result.|$|R
50|$|Southbound trains can {{terminate}} at Tooting Broadway {{on occasion}} rather than continue {{on to the}} end of the line at Morden, which is three stations to the south. To return north, out of service trains run south from the southbound platform into a reversing siding between the two <b>running</b> tunnels before <b>reversing</b> and <b>running</b> north through points on to the northbound platform where they return into service.|$|R
25|$|In {{any given}} country, rail traffic {{generally}} runs {{to one side}} of a double-track line, not always the same side as road traffic. Thus in Belgium, China, France (apart from the former German Alsace and Lorraine), Sweden, Switzerland and Italy for example, the railways use left-hand running, while the roads use right-hand running. In countries such as Indonesia, it is the <b>reverse</b> (right-hand <b>running</b> for railways and left-hand running for roads).|$|R

50|$|Problems often {{arise in}} {{incorporating}} a Walschaerts valve gear {{into the design}} of tank and narrow gauge locomotives because of space limitations. The reversing rod (with its lifting arm), needed to change between forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>running,</b> is therefore mounted {{at the same level}} as the pivot of the expansion link. This enables the lifting link (German: Hängeeisen) to be dispensed with, and the lifting arm to be connected directly to the radius rod. To ensure the required horizontal movement, the back end of the radius rod is designed as a slide (the 'Kuhn slide') which fits into a rotatable crosshead (Gleitstein) in the lifting arm.|$|E
5000|$|Sherman McCoy is a Wall Street {{bond trader}} who makes {{millions}} while enjoying {{the good life}} and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin, a Southern belle gold digger. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and {{find themselves in the}} [...] "war-zone" [...] of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman {{gets out of the car}} to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in <b>reverse,</b> <b>running</b> over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed.|$|E
30|$|The error {{correction}} {{term in the}} industrial sector is negative and statistically different from zero, implying that there is long-run causality running from electricity consumption to industrial output. However, this causality is not existent {{in the short run}} as the explanatory variables are jointly insignificant. Moreover, there is no <b>reverse</b> causality <b>running</b> from industrial output to electricity growth as the {{error correction}} term is positive, signifying a lack of long-run convergence.|$|R

50|$|Classica Corsica is {{an elite}} men's road bicycle racing event held {{annually}} {{on the island}} of Corsica, a region of France. It is run two days before the Critérium International stage race, which has been held on Corsica every year since 2010. The Classica itself is a legacy event of the 2013 Tour de France, when the race held its Grand Départ and first three stages on the island. The event is UCI 1.1 rated and is part of the UCI Europe Tour. The route varies from year to year, but in its first edition, 2015, the race will depart Ajaccio and finish in Bastia after 204 km taking in the Col de Vizzavona and the Col de Bellagranajo, before flattening out {{in the second half of}} the stage, which represents essentially a <b>reverse</b> <b>running</b> of the second stage from the 2013 Tour.|$|E
5000|$|Last, but by {{no means}} least, is a {{spectacular}} gold series of high artistic merit probably from Volsini, with marks of value 20 and 5. The unique Apollo-like head/majestic bull walking 20-unit piece is reminiscent of the bronze issues of the Latin colonies of Aesernia, Cales, Compultaria, Suessa Aurunca and Teanum in Campania [...] dated to the mid-3rd century BC. The <b>reverse</b> <b>running</b> dog 5-unit coin is reminiscent of the Chiana Valley male head/dog running struck bronze of uncertain date in the 3rd century. This is an isolated series with a gold unit of approximately 0.225 grams, which places it before the main gold issue of Populonia with a gold unit of 0.056 grams issued in the earlier part of the 3rd century, and possibly related to the intervention of Rome {{at the time of the}} slave rebellion at Volsini in 265/4.|$|E
5000|$|Panastar II (1987): The Panastar II is an MOS 35 mm {{motion picture}} camera. It {{is capable of}} 4-120 fps both forward and reverse, though <b>reverse</b> <b>running</b> {{requires}} a reversing magazine, with camera timing crystal-controlled at one-frame increments. It has a focal-plane shutter which can be adjusted between 45° and 180° while the camera is running, either by using an external remote control or manually turning a knob. Improvements over the original Panastar include a weight reduction of 5 lb, a more accurate digital shutter angle readout, {{the inclusion of the}} Panaglow ground glass illuminator, and the ability to adjust the speed of the camera in single-frame increments without need for an external speed control, rather that being tied to the preset running speeds of the first Panastar. At high speeds, the Panastar II is incredibly loud, often leading those unfamiliar with its operation to question whether it is functioning properly.|$|E
