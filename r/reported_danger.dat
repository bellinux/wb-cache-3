From these open landfills the commonly <b>reported</b> <b>danger</b> to the human health is by consuming the groundwater contaminated by leachate (Jhamnani and Singh 2009). The leachate generated from dumpsite contain elements like ammonia, nitrogen, potassium, calcium and magnesium, trace metals like lead, nickel, chromium, manganese, iron copper and organic compounds like chloroform, toluene, acetone, benzene, phenols, hydrocarbons, etc. (Freeze and Cherry 1979).|$|E
30|$|The {{generation}} {{of solid waste}} has become an increasing environmental and public health problem everywhere in the world, particularly in developing countries. The fast expansion of urban, agricultural and industrial activities spurred by rapid population growth and the change in consumer habits has produced vast amounts of solid wastes (Akoteyon et al. 2011). Open dumps are the oldest and the most common way of disposing of solid waste. In recent years thousands have been closed, while many still are being used. In many cases, they are located wherever land is available, without regard to safety, health hazard and esthetic degradation. The waste is often piled as high as equipment allows. In some instances, the refuse is ignited and allowed to burn. In others, the refuse is periodically leveled and compacted (Sabahi et al. 2009). The dumping of solid waste in uncontrolled landfills can cause significant impacts {{on the environment and}} human health (Dong et al. 2008). The most commonly <b>reported</b> <b>danger</b> to the human health from these landfills is from the use of groundwater that has been contaminated by leachate (Jhamnani and Singh 2009).|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{relationship}} between perceived organizational support and health support from supervisors and workmates, and ‘safety citizenship behaviour’ (SCB) in offshore employees. It is hypothesised that high levels of support reflecting care in the organization about employee well-being {{will lead to more}} positive safety behaviour in the workforce. Data were collected from 703 offshore workers on 18 UKCS installations (35 % response rate) using a cross-sectional questionnaire design. Scales measuring perceptions of organizational support, supervisor support for health, workmates support for health and SCB were found to have good psychometric properties and were used as the basis for further analysis. The results indicate that high levels of support at both an organizational and supervisor level reflecting care and concern for the well-being of workers leads to a reciprocal relationship in terms of increased SCB. This shows that appropriate social exchanges within an organization may lead to unanticipated benefits in terms of employee safety behaviours that go beyond normal compliance. In this study, general support from the organization and specific support from the supervisor in relation to health issues appear have an impact on safety performance outcomes such as intervening to assist work colleagues and <b>reporting</b> <b>dangers...</b>|$|R
