40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High {{pressures}} around implants {{can cause}} bone lysis and loosening. We investigated how pressures are generated around cemented femoral stems. METHOD: We compared the pressures generated by rough and polished tapered stems at their cement interfaces, in an in vitro model, {{before and after}} 1 million load cycles. RESULTS: At {{the start of the}} study, the loading of both polished and <b>rough</b> <b>stems</b> generated interface pressures that were not statistically significantly different. After 1 million load cycles, the <b>rough</b> <b>stems</b> generated greater interface pressures than at the start (p = 0. 03), with maximum pressure wave amplitudes of 450, 000 Pa or 3, 375 mm Hg. The pressures generated by polished stems were similar before and after 1 million load cycles, and were lower than the pressures generated by the <b>rough</b> <b>stems</b> (p = 0. 01). Stem loading caused micromotion between the stem and cement. Polished stems migrated distally in the cement but retained rotational and axial stability. The <b>rough</b> <b>stems</b> also migrated distally and wore the cement mantle, leading to increased rotational instability. INTERPRETATION: The change in the rotational micromotion of the <b>rough</b> <b>stem</b> {{is likely to be the}} principal cause of the increased stem pump output and to be a key factor in the longevity of cemented femoral implants...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Under {{physiological}} loads, debonded cemented femoral stems {{have been}} shown to move within their cement mantle and generate a fluid pump that may facilitate peri-prosthetic osteolysis by pressurizing fluid and circulating wear debris. The long-term physiological loading of rough and polished tapered stems in vitro has shown differences in performance, with greater interface pressures generated by the <b>rough</b> <b>stems.</b> In this study we investigated the individual effects of stem surface finish, degree of mantle wear, and mode of loading on the stem pump mechanism. METHOD: <b>Rough</b> and polished <b>stems</b> were loaded under different regimes in artificially worn cement mantles that permitted either 2 or 5 degrees of rotational stem movement, and the interface pressures were compared. RESULTS: The pressures generated by the <b>rough</b> and polished <b>stems</b> were similar in either type of mantle. The pattern of pressure generation in the 2 -degree mantles was similar to the pressures generated by <b>rough</b> <b>stems</b> after long-term loading, but the high posterior wall pressures fell and the tip pressures increased in the 5 -degree mantles. The torsional loads were principal drivers of pressure generation in all areas of the interface other than the implant tip, where axial loading predominated. INTERPRETATION: Femoral stems with rotational instability under cyclic torsional loads generate elevated interface fluid pressures and flows independently of stem surface finish. The rough surface finish is only important in creating this instability in tapered stems...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{fluid flow}} at the stem-cement {{interface}} of bonded and debonded, polished and rough model femoral components. In a first series of experiments, fluid flow along {{the interface between}} bone cement and well-fixed model femoral components, differing in surface finish, and in shape, was measured. Fluid migration along the bone-cement interface of <b>rough</b> <b>stems</b> (Ra 3 microm) was greater than that on polished stems (p < 0. 001). This was true of cylindrical and conical tapered stems. On stems with the same surface finish, shape did not influence fluid migration. In a second series of experiments, fluid flow along the stem-cement interface of 5 highly polished and 10 rough-finished (5 of Ra approximately 1. 5 microm and 5 of Ra approximately 3 microm), debonded, tapered circular stems was measured. None of the <b>rough</b> <b>stems</b> could prevent fluid flow along the stem-cement interface. Polished tapered stems sealed the interface and, after 48 hrs of continuous pressure, no fluid flow was observed. This difference {{in the ability to}} seal the stem-cement interface between <b>rough</b> and polished <b>stems</b> was significant (p < 0. 001). The difference in fluid migration along the stem-cement interface of <b>rough</b> and polished <b>stems</b> which we observed offers a plausible explanation of the occurrence of osteolysis distal to the articulation of cemented THR in the presence of cement mantle defects.

40|$|Although stress {{analyses}} {{have shown}} that the mechanical endurance of cemented femoral THA reconstructions is served by stems that firmly bond to their cement mantles, retrieval studies suggest that this may be difficult to achieve. Clinical studies with roentgen stereophotogrammetric analyses {{have shown that}} stems may gradually debond from their cement mantle. Accepting the fact that stem debonding is unavoidable, stem subsidence and cement stresses can be reduced by increasing stem-cement friction, as indicated by finite element stress analyses. Hence, it can be hypothesized that debonded stems with high surface roughness values would damage the cement mantle to a lesser extent as compared to polished ones. To confirm this hypothesis, tapered stems with polished and rough surface finishes were implanted in cement mantles and cyclically loaded for 1. 7 million times. It was investigated how surface roughness affected the damage in the cement mantle, and how it was related to prosthetic subsidence. The polished taper subsided considerably more than the rough one (630 vs. 270 m {{at the end of the}} experiments). In addition, it was found that the polished taper displayed step-wise subsidence, which is probably due to the interaction of stick-slip processes at the interface, associated with creep of the acrylic cement. The rough taper subsided monotonously. Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) analysis of the taper-cement structures showed that the rough taper was completely debonded from the cement mantle, creating a gap at the interface, and that many large cement cracks and particles were created. Around the polished taper, only a few cracks were found and the taper-cement interface seemed undamaged. It was concluded that an increased surface roughness does not necessarily lead to a reduction in cement damage. On the contrary, compared to polished ones, debonded <b>rough</b> <b>stems</b> may produce more cement cracks and acrylic cement debris, and provide routes to transport these wear products. Hence, after failure of the stem-cement interface, straight-tapered stems with an increased surface roughness accelerate the failure process due to inferior fail-safe features. Consequently, in vivo subsidence patterns at the stem-cement interface should he considered in combination with the surface finish of the implant. An amount of post-operative subsidence of a <b>rough</b> <b>stem</b> may be much more damaging for the reconstruction than the same amount for a polished stem.

40|$|Abstract A {{rainfall}} interception {{study was}} conducted in Oakland, California to determine the partitioning of rainfall and the chemical composition of precipitation, throughfall, and stemflow. Rainfall interception measurements were conducted on a gingko (Ginkgo biloba) (13. 5 mtall deciduous tree), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) (8. 8 m tall deciduous), and lemon tree (Citrus limon) (2. 9 m tall broadleaf evergreen). The lemon, ginkgo, and sweet gum intercepted 27. 0 %, 25. 2 % and 14. 3 % of gross precipitation, respectively. The lemon tree was most effective because it retained its foliage year-round, storing more winter rainfall than the leafless ginkgo and sweet gum trees. Stemflow was more important for the leafless sweet gum. Because of its excurrent growth habit and smooth bark, 4. 1 % of annual rainfall flowed to the ground as stemflow, compared to less than 2. 1 % for the lemon and 1. 0 % for the ginkgo. Water samples were collected from throughfall, stemflow, and a nearby control site to measure concentrations of nutrients and heavy metals. Compared to the control, samples from under trees had higher concentrations of nutrients and metals (e. g., N, P, K, Zn and Cr), indicating that atmospheric deposition to tree crowns was a major source of pollutants. Nutrient and metal concentrations were highest in gingko tree’s throughfall.

40|$|As implant {{survival}} extends {{into the}} second and third decades focal osteolysis around cemented femoral components in total hip replacement is emerging as an important failure mechanism. Whilst the problem of focal osteolysis is well recognised, there are many aspects of its development which are poorly understood. The broad aim of this thesis is to try to provide some insights into how, why and where focal osteolysis develops around the cemented femoral component. There are broadly two sections to this thesis, chapters 2 - 5 present clinical and geometrical studies and chapters 6 - 10 a series of experimental studies. The aim of the first section was to establish what is observed in clinical practice, the aim of the second to try to explain these findings. A mid-term clinical study showed that focal osteolysis is more common with <b>rough</b> than polished <b>stems</b> that differed in no aspect other than their surface finish. Further studies established that focal osteolysis is probably always associated with defects in the cement mantle. These defects occur anteriorly at the mid-stem of the prosthesis and posteriorly at the component tip. The distribution of focal osteolysis and its strong association with cement mantle defects suggests the importance of the stemcement interface as a pathway for fluid and debris to reach the distal femur. However, at 15 - 25 years, osteolysis rarely develops with the polished Exeter stem even in the presence of confirmed defects in the cement mantle, suggesting that the stem seals the stem-cement interface against fluid and debris. In an attempt to explain the clinical findings a series of bench top experiments were undertaken. These studies showed that the behaviour of fluid and dye at the stemcement interface was significantly influenced by component surface finish. Bonded and debonded stem-cement interfaces of <b>rough</b> <b>stems</b> provided an incomplete barrier to fluid movement along this interface. In contrast, polished stems both bonded and debonded were able to provide a seal at the stem-cement interface. The seal at this interface was improved with component subsidence in the presence of rotational stability. It is believed that this thesis provides a rationale explanation for why focal osteolysis rarely develops around the Exeter stem in clinical practice. It also explains how, where, and why osteolysis develops around certain designs of cemented femoral components used in total hip replacement. </p...|$|R
