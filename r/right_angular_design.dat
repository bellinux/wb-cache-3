40|$|International audienceFunctional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) was applied to determine {{the involvement of the}} angular gyri in the processing of categorical and coordinate spatial relations. In a categorical task, subjects were asked to judge whether a dot was presented above or below a horizontal line. In a coordinate task, they were asked to judge whether or not the distance between the dot and the bar was within a reference distance. Results showed stronger activation of the left than of the <b>right</b> <b>angular</b> gyrus in the categorical task, and stronger activation, initially, of the right than of the left angular gyrus in the coordinate task. In addition, in the latter task, the involvement of the <b>right</b> <b>angular</b> gyrus decreased with practice while that of the left angular gyrus increased. These results are interpreted in terms of the development of new categorical representations with practice in the coordinate task...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePatients with first-rank {{symptoms}} (FRS) {{of schizophrenia}} do not experience {{all of their}} actions and personal states as their own. FRS {{may be associated with}} an impaired ability to correctly attribute an action to its origin. In the present study, we examined regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography during an action-attribution task in a group of patients with FRS. We used a device previously used with healthy subjects that allows the experimenter to modulate the subject's degree of movement control (and thus action attribution) of a virtual hand presented on a screen. In healthy subjects, the activity of the <b>right</b> <b>angular</b> gyrus and the insula cortex appeared to be modulated by the subject's degree of movement control of the virtual hand. In the present study, the schizophrenic patients did not show this pattern. We found an aberrant relationship between the subject's degree of control of the movements and rCBF in the <b>right</b> <b>angular</b> gyrus and no modulation in the insular cortex. The implications of these results for understanding pathological conditions such as schizophrenia are discussed...|$|R

Architect Yaroslav Korsunsky of Minneapolis designed the church, employing the Byzantine-Ukrainian style of 11-13th century Ukraine.

The rounded gold dome, along with a strong preference for circular patterns—avoiding almost all <b>angular</b> <b>design</b> elements—is also typical of this style.|$|R

5000|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated the}} possibility that stimulation of the <b>right</b> <b>angular</b> gyrus {{is the cause of}} out-of-body experiences. [...] Stimulation of the left angular gyrus in one experiment caused a woman to perceive a shadowy person lurking behind her. The shadowy figure is actually a perceived double of the self. [...] Another such experiment gave the test subject the sensation of being on the ceiling. This is attributed to a discrepancy in the actual position of the body, and the mind's perceived location of the body.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{voxel-based morphometry}} (VBM) studies have {{revealed}} that meditation is associated with structural brain changes in regions underlying cognitive processes that are required for attention or mindfulness during meditation. This VBM study examined brain changes related {{to the practice of}} an emotion-oriented meditation: loving-kindness meditation (LKM). A 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner captured images of the brain structures of 25 men, 10 of whom had practiced LKM in the Theravada tradition for at least 5 years. Compared with novices, more gray matter volume was detected in the <b>right</b> <b>angular</b> and posterior parahippocampal gyri in LKM experts. The <b>right</b> <b>angular</b> gyrus has not been previously reported to have structural differences associated with meditation, and its specific role in mind and cognitive empathy theory suggests the uniqueness of this finding for LKM practice. These regions are important for affective regulation associated with empathic response, anxiety and mood. At the same time, gray matter volume in the left temporal lobe in the LKM experts appeared to be greater, an observation that has also been reported in previous MRI meditation studies on meditation styles other than LKM. Overall, the findings of our study suggest that experience in LKM may influence brain structures associated with affective regulation. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
