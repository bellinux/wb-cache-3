40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{reconcile}} results of previous studies, several theorists have suggested that object recognition performance should <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>viewpoint</b> invariant to highly viewpoint dependent depending on {{how easy it is}} to differentiate the objects in a given recognition situation. The present study assessed recognition across depth rotations of a single general class of novel objects in three contexts that varied in difficulty. In an initial experiment, recognition in the context involving the most discriminable object differences was viewpoint invariant, but recognition in the least discriminable context and recognition in the intermediate context were equally viewpoint dependent. In a second experiment, utilizing gray-scale versions of the same stimuli, almost identical viewpoint-cost functions were obtained in all three contexts. These results suggest that differences in the geometry of stimulus objects, rather than task difficulty, lie at the heart of previously discrepant findings. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Due to self-occlusion an individual range image provides {{only a partial}} model of an object surface. Therefore multiple <b>range</b> images <b>from</b> differing <b>viewpoints</b> must be captured and merged to extend the surface area that can be captured.

40|$|Abstract. Recovering a 3 -D {{scene from}} {{multiple}} 2 -D views is indispensable for many computer vision applications <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> free <b>viewpoint</b> video to face recognition. Ideally the recovered depth map should be dense, piecewise smooth with fine level of details, and the recovery procedure shall be robust {{with respect to}} outliers and global illumination changes. We present a novel variational approach that satisfies these needs. Our model incorporates robust penalisation in the data term and anisotropic regularisation in the smoothness term. In order to render the data term robust with respect to global illumination changes, a gradient constancy assumption is applied to logarithmically transformed input data. Focussing on translational camera motion and considering small baseline distances between the different camera positions, we reconstruct a common disparity map that allows to track image points throughout the entire sequence. Experiments on synthetic image data demonstrate the favourable performance of our novel method...|$|R
40|$|Velocity {{smoothing}} benefits some migration algorithms by stabilizing {{ray tracing}} and improving images. From {{the fact that}} a smooth velocity must have small derivatives, I develop an algorithm for velocity smoothing based on the damped least-squares (DLS) method. Unlike other convolutional-type approaches, the computational cost in the proposed smoothing method is independent of the length of the smoothing operator, so the DLS method works efficiently for applications to migration. Moreover, this method allows flexibility for changing the length of the smoothing operator at different spatial locations. A velocity smoothing process can be viewed as an averaging process over a specific <b>range.</b> <b>From</b> this <b>viewpoint,</b> I define the concept of length for a general smoothing operator which sets up a standard to measure smoothing parameters of different smoothing methods. Migration image may suffer if the velocity used in migration is oversmoothed. In order to judge if a velocity field is oversmoo [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Building {{environment}} maps from sensory data is {{an important}} aspect of mobile robot navigation, particularly for those applications in which robots must function in unstructured environments. Ultrasonic range sensors are, superficially, an attractive sensor modality to use in building such maps, due mainly to their low cost, high speed and simple output. Unfortunately, these sensors have a number of properties that make map building a non-trivial process. In particular, standard sensors have very poor angular resolution and can generate misleading range values in specular environments. The first of these problems can be largely overcome by combining <b>range</b> measurements <b>from</b> multiple <b>viewpoints.</b> Elfes [1] and Moravec [2] describe an approach in which <b>range</b> measurements <b>from</b> multiple <b>viewpoints</b> are combined in a two-dimensional `occupancy grid'. Each cell in the grid is assigned a value indicating the probability that the cell is occupied. Unfortunately, the occupancy grid approach does not work well in specular environments. Specular reflection may occur whenever an ultrasonic pulse encounters a smooth extended surface. In such cases the pulse may not be reflected back to the ultrasonic sensor; in effect, the surface may appear to be invisible. In ordinary office environments which contain smooth walls and glass doors specular reflection is common. In this research, we have improved on earlier grid-based approaches by introducing the concept of a `response grid'. The intent of the response grid framework is to produce an approach which has the advantages of the occupancy grid framework, but also performs well in specula...|$|R

In this paper, an automatic method has been developed to efficiently align 3 D range maps acquired by an active stereo vision system. The methodology is based on referring range maps to a global frame of fiducial markers captured by the stereo system. The procedure includes a refinement of the marker frame in order to globally minimise the misalignment errors. The methodology optimises the overall accuracy of 3 D reconstructions regardless of the scanning strategies, even processing large data sets.

It is evident that the interconnection between the two acquires a special interest when folk music is characterized by a high level of development and a wide genre-stylistic <b>range.</b> <b>From</b> this <b>viewpoint</b> Georgia is a unique country, as its musical folklore is truly poly-lingual and in its best specimens achieves a level of perfection where professional creative mastery is present. The principles of folk polyphony are refracted in the music of Georgian classics multifariously and consistently; I shall try to analyze the stylistic aspects of the transformation of folk polyphony in those works of Georgian composers, which took shape and evolved in the beginning the 1960 s. If in the works of founders of Georgian classical music folklore was used as a basic and real artistic-intonational reference point, beginning from the 1960 s the transformation of folklore as a primary source undergoes qualitative alteration and as a rule is used in an indirect form. Examples of the evolutionary process mentioned above are quite numerous in the works of different composers belonging to the Georgian professional school.
