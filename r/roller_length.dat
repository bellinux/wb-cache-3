40|$|This paper {{concerns}} dynamic free-surface measurements {{performed in}} hydraulic jumps with Froude numbers between 3. 1 and 8. 5 using non intrusive ultrasonic probes. The interest was first {{focused on the}} characteristics of mean (d) and turbulent (d’) levels of the air-water interface. Then they were coupled with phase-detection conductivity probes to assess the accuracy of the sensors. This allowed an accurate definition of the exact level detected by the ultrasonic displacement meters. The results showed a regular increase of the mean level over the jump (<b>roller</b> <b>length).</b> A peak of turbulent fluctuation was found on the roller whose amplitude depends upon the Froude number. Comparisons with previous studies showed a good agreement in terms of shapes and <b>roller</b> <b>length</b> estimation. Frequency analysis of the free-surface fluctuations revealed that highest frequencies in the jump are around 4 Hz.

40|$|The {{streamwise}} {{flow structure}} of a turbulent hydraulic jump over a rough bed rectangular channel has been investigated. The flow is divided into inner and outer layers, where upstream supercritical flow changes to downstream subcritical flow. The analysis is based on depth averaged Reynolds momentum equations. The molecular viscosity on the rough bed imposes the no slip boundary condition, but close to the wall the turbulent process in inner layer provides certain matching conditions with the outer layer, where molecular viscosity has no dominant role. It is shown that the bed roughness in the inner layer has a passive role in imposing wall shear stress during formation of hydraulic jump in the outer layer. The Belanger’s jump condition of rectangular channel has been extended {{to account for the}} implications of the drag attributable to channel bed roughness, kinetic energy correction factor, and coefficient of the Reynolds normal stresses. For depth averaged Reynolds normal stress, an eddy viscosity model containing gradient of depth averaged axial velocity is considered. Analytical solutions for sequent depth ratio, jump length, <b>roller</b> <b>length,</b> and profiles of jump depth and velocity were found to depend upon the upstream Froude number, drag owing to bed roughness, and kinetic energy correction factor. On the basis of dynamical similarity, the <b>roller</b> <b>length</b> and aeration length were proposed to be of the same order as the jump length. An effective upstream Froude number, introduced in the present work, yields universal predictions for sequent depth ratio, jump length, <b>roller</b> <b>length,</b> jump profile, and other hydraulic jump characteristics that are explicitly independent of bed roughness drag. Thus, results for hydraulic jump over a rough bed channel can be directly deduced from classical smooth bed hydraulic jump theory, provided the upstream Froude number is replaced by the effective upstream Froude number. These findings of universality have been supported by experimental data over a rough bed rectangular channel...|$|E

The optical {{intensity}} {{signals from}} surf zone waves {{in a laboratory}} flume are analyzed using several different phase-averaging techniques, and a methodology is developed for estimating wave <b>roller</b> <b>lengths</b> and local wave dissipation. The intensity signals (i. e., phase-averaged intensity profiles) of individual breaking waves are compared with the wave profiles measured by in situ wave gauges, and the optical signal of the wave roller is shown to ramp up from the toe of the wave roller on the front face of the wave to a maximum intensity at the wave crest. The remote sensing observations capture the growth, equilibrium, and decay phases of the roller as it propagates over a fixed bed arranged in a bar/trough morphology. Next, for the regular wave conditions considered here, the local maxima of the phase-averaged intensities are shown to better indicate the initial onset of wave breaking and the occurrence of wave breaking in the bar trough, {{as compared to the}} more commonly used time-averaged mean intensity. In addition, the phase-averaged profiles are used to measure the size of the roller, and these measurements are compared to previous observations of smaller-scale rollers in equilibrium. The observed <b>roller</b> <b>lengths</b> are shown to agree with predictions from a wave roller model and to provide a new physical link between the remotely sensed signal and roller dissipation. Finally, as an example application of these new data, a simple wave height inversion model is presented that allows an estimation of surf zone wave heights from the remotely sensed <b>roller</b> <b>lengths...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study carried out to investigate the effect of geometric and hydraulic parameters on energy dissipation and location of the hydraulic jump, with a change in the height of roughness elements and the divergence of walls in different discharges. Experiments were conducted in a horizontal rectangular basin with gradual expansion 0. 5 m wide and 10 m long. Four physical models were fixed in the flume. The measured characteristics of the hydraulic jump with different divergences ratio (B = b 1 /b 2 = 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1) and the inflow Froude numbers (6 < Fr 1 < 12) were compared {{with each other and with}} the corresponding values measured for the classical hydraulic jump. The results showed that the tailwater depth required to form a hydraulic jump and also the <b>roller</b> <b>length</b> of the hydraulic jump and the length of the hydraulic jump on a gradual expansion basin with the rough bed were appreciably smaller than that of the corresponding hydraulic jumps in a rectangular basin with smooth and rough bed.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Wave {{breaking}} is {{the largest}} forcing mechanism in the surf zone. Therefore, quantifying energy dissipation due to wave breaking is important for improving models that seek to predict nearshore circulation, wave-current interactions, air-sea gas exchange, erosion and accretion of sediment, and storm surge. Wave energy dissipation is difficult to measure with in situ instruments, {{and even the most}} reliable estimates are limited to point measurements. Using remote sensing technologies, specifically infrared (IR) imagery, the high spatial and temporal variability of wave breaking may be sampled. Duncan (1981) proposed a model (D 81) for dissipation on a wave-by-wave basis, based on wave slope and <b>roller</b> <b>length,</b> the crest-perpendicular length of the aerated region of a breaking wave. The wave roller is composed of active foam, which, in thermal IR images, appears brighter than the surrounding water and the residual foam, the foam left behind {{in the wake of a}} breaking wave. Using IR imagery taken during the Surf Zone Optics 2010 experiment at Duck, NC, and exploiting the distinct signature of active foam, a retrieval algorithm was developed to identify and extract breaking wave <b>roller</b> <b>length.</b> <b>Roller</b> <b>length</b> was then used to estimate dissipation rate via the D 81 formulation. The D 81 dissipation rate estimates compare reasonably to in situ dissipation estimates at a point. When the D 81 estimates are compared to the bulk energy flux into the surf zone, it is found that wave breaking dissipates approximately 25 - 36 % of the incoming wave energy. The D 81 dissipation rate estimates also agree closely with those from a dissipation parameterization proposed by Janssen and Battjes (2007) (JB 07) and commonly applied within larger nearshore circulation models. The JB 07 formulation, however, requires additional physical parameters (wave height and water depth) that are often sparsely sampled and are difficult to attain from remote sensing alone. The power of the D 81 formulation lies in its dependence on surface signatures alone, and with the methods developed here and those proposed for future work, wave energy dissipation rate maps could be produced for any imageable coastline...|$|E

Further, given the ratio of axial to radial force, an optimal contact angle exists which maximizes the static capacity of the bearing pair, regardless of the actual bearing size and ratio of roller diameter to pitch diameter.

40|$|International audienceA {{conservative}} hyperbolic two-parameter {{model of}} shear shallow-water flows {{is used to}} study the classical turbulent hydraulic jump. The parameters of the model, which are the wall enstrophy and the roller dissipation coefficient, are determined from measurements of the <b>roller</b> <b>length</b> and the deviation from the Belanger equation of the sequent depth ratio (experimental data by Hager & Bremen, J.

Stationary solutions to the model describe with a good accuracy the free-surface profile of the hydraulic jump. The model is also capable of predicting the oscillations of the jump toe. We show that if the upstream Froude number is larger than similar to 1. 5, the jump toe oscillates with a particular frequency, while for the Froude number smaller than 1. 5 the solution becomes stationary. In particular, we show that for a given flow discharge, the oscillation frequency is a decreasing function of the Froude number...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{integral}} conservation of linear and angular {{momentum in the}} steady hydraulic jump in a linearly converging channel, following the recent research line of the authors concerning the same phenomenon in a linearly diverging channel. The flow is considered divided into a mainstream, that conveys the total liquid discharge, and a roller, where no average mass transport occurs. No macroscopic rheological relationship is assumed, so mass, momentum and angular momentum integral balances are independent relationships. Normal stresses are assumed hydrostatically distributed on each vertical and viscous stresses are assumed negligible with respect to turbulent stresses. Horizontal velocity is considered uniform in the mainstream and horizontal momentum and angular momentum in the roller are neglected {{with respect to their}} mainstream counterparts. Using such simplified assumptions an analytical solution is obtained for the free surface profile of the flow, which is fundamental for finding the sequent depths and their positions. Such solution permits to compute the jump length, which is assumed equal to the <b>roller</b> <b>length.</b> Mainstream and roller thicknesses can also be derived. The model may also be used to theoretically derive the average shear stresses exerted by the roller on the mainstream and the power losses per unit weight. This final relationship, which returns the well-known classical expression for total power loss in the jump, demonstrates {{the internal consistency of the}} mechanical model...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHydrodynamic {{rolling force}} and moments in point contact {{have been studied}} in detail using isoviscousrigid (IVR) and elastohydrodynamic (EHL) models. Using fully flooded assumptions, curve-fitted {{relationships}} are given for calculating the IVR and EHL hydrodynamic rolling forces. Both are proportional (or almost proportional in the IVR case) to 2 a, the Hertzian contact length being perpendicular to the rolling direction, and are also functions of the dimensionless speed parameter. A single curve-fitted relationship has been derived to cover {{the full range of}} operating conditions with a smooth transition from IVR to EHL regime of lubrication. The results obtained are slightly higher than those previously published (the ratio being of the order of 1. 5 for usual operating conditions). Point contact and line contact (with a contact length L being equal to the point contact length 2 a) hydrodynamic rolling forces have also been compared. The point contact forces are about 26 per cent larger than those obtained using line contact relationship (published in part 1) because of a larger domain of integration in the lateral direction. By limiting the width of the integration domain to L (<b>roller</b> <b>length</b> or ball diameter), the effect of 2 a/ L on the hydrodynamic rolling force has been studied, leading to the derivation of a truncation factor C. As the load increases, 2 a increases and the truncation factor decreases until reaching a limit when ellipse truncation starts because 2 a/ L is equal to or larger than one. Using the truncation factor and limiting the 2 a/ L ratio to one, it was found that point contact and line contact hydrodynamic forces are the same within a few per cent. A single point contact relationship can therefore be suggested, covering the IVR to EHL operating conditions with a smooth transition between these lubrication regimes, and also a smooth transition from point contact to line contact as the load increases and contact ellipse truncation occurs. Finally, calculations of power losses due to the Poiseuille flow in the rolling direction x and in the perpendicular direction z show that the power loss in the z direction is usually very small for wide elliptical contacts and that most of the power is dissipated in the inlet and outlet, with a 26 per cent contribution of the integration domain defined out the range -a < z < a. This result is in line with the truncation factor defined previously...|$|E

40|$|With annual global {{sales of}} {{approximately}} $ 5 billion [1], {{tapered roller bearing}} consumers increasingly valued energy efficient products [2]. Two of the world’s largest bearing producers, SKF [3] and Timken [4] promoted energy efficient bearings based on their abilities to grind rollers to reduced radial deviation from round (OOR).

Testing under shop floor conditions at Timken, the researcher discovered a positive linear regression between roller nominal diameter and OOR. The basis for the regression was under geometric roller rounding conditions found to exist when through feed centreless grinding tapered rollers, synchronous regulating wheel vibrations transferred at higher amplitude to larger nominal diameter rollers. This research pointed energy efficient bearing design in a new direction. For example, tapered roller bearing designers typically specified <b>rollers</b> of minimum <b>length</b> to reduce problems associated with rolling contact. Bearings assembled from shorter rollers, to retain the same load capacity, required fewer rollers of larger nominal diameter.

This thesis {{presents the results}} of a theoretical and experimental investigation concerned with the hydrodynamic stability of extensional flows. In particular, model extensional flows in the class of two-dimensional linear flows are considered. These flows may be classified by a parameter [ [...] . ] ranging from [ [...] . ] for simple shear flow to [ [...] . ] for pure extensional flow. In Chapter I, a linear stability analysis is given for an unbounded Newtonian fluid undergoing two-dimensional linear flows. The linearized velocity disturbance equations are analyzed to yield the large-time asymptotic behavior of spatially periodic initial disturbances. The results confirm the established fact that simple shear flow [ [...] . ] is linearly stable. However, it is found that unbounded extensional flows in the range [ [...] . ] are unconditionally unstable. Spatially periodic initial disturbances which have lines of constant phase parallel to the inlet streamline of the basic flow and have sufficiently small wavenumbers in the direction normal to the plane of the basic flow must grow exponentially in time. A complete analytical solution of the vorticity disturbance equation is obtained for the case of pure extensional flow [ [...] . ]. Chapter II presents a linear stability analysis for an Oldroyd-type fluid undergoing two-dimensional linear flows throughout an unbounded region. The effects of fluid elasticity on extensional-flow stability are considered. The time derivatives in the constitutive equation can be varied continously from corotational to co-deformational as a parameter [ [...] . ] varies from 0 to 1. It is again found that unbounded flows in the range [ [...] . ] are unconditionally unstable with respect to spatially periodic initial disturbances that have lines of constant phase parallel to the inlet streamline in the plane of the basic flow. For small values of the Weissenberg number, only disturbances with sufficiently small wavenumbers [ [...] . ] in the direction normal to the plane of the basic flow give rise to instability. However, for certain values of [ [...] . ], there exist critical values of the Weissenberg number above which flows are unstable for all values of the wavenumber [ [...] . ]. The results of an experimental investigation of the flow of a Newtonian fluid in a four-roll mill are found in Chapter III. The four-roll mill may be used to generate an approximation to two-dimensional linear flow in a central region between the rollers. A photographic flow-visualization technique was employed to study the stability of a pure extensional flow [ [...] . ]. Two four-roll mills with different ratios of <b>roller</b> <b>length</b> to gap width between adjacent rollers (namely, L/d = 3. 39 and 12. 73) were used in order to study end effects on flow stability. At sufficiently small Reynolds numbers the flow in both devices is essentially two- dimensional throughout most of the region between the rollers, except near the top and bottom bounding surfaces where three-dimensional flow involving four symmetrically positioned vortices appears. The vertical extent of this two- dimensional flow gradually diminishes and the vortices grow in size and strength as the Reynolds number is increased up to a quasi-critical range. An increase in Reynolds number through this quasi-critical range results in an abrupt transition to a steady three-dimensional flow throughout the entire region between the rollers. The three-dimensionality is significantly less pronounced in the device with L/d = 12. 73, however. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers beyond the quasi-critical range, the flow becomes unsteady in time and eventually turbulent...|$|E

40|$|The complex {{interactions}} between turbulence {{and the free}} surface, including air entrainment processes, in boundary layer shear flows created by vertical surface-piercing plates are considered. A laboratory-scale device was built that utilizes a surface-piercing stainless steel belt that travels in a loop around two vertical <b>rollers,</b> with one <b>length</b> of the belt between the rollers acting as a horizontally-moving flat wall. The belt is operated both as a suddenly-started plate to reproduce boundary layer flow or at steady state {{in the presence of}} a stationary flat plate positioned parallel to the belt to create a Couette flow with a free surface. Surface profiles are measured with a cinematic laser-induced fluorescence system in both experiments and air entrainment events and bubble motions are observed with stereo underwater white-light movies in the suddenly started belt experiment. It is found that the RMS surface height fluctuations, η, peak near the boundaries of the flows and increase approximately linearly with belt speed. In the Couette flow experiments, a dominant peak in the spectrum of ∂η/∂ t is found at the dimensionless frequency fH/U≈ 0. 7. In the suddenly started belt experiment, surface fluctuations appear to be strongly influenced by sub-surface turbulence within the boundary layer, while ripples propagate freely when farther from the belt.

40|$|The complex {{interaction}} between turbulence {{and the free}} surface in boundary layer shear flow created by a vertical surface-piercing wall is considered. A laboratory-scale device was built that utilizes a surface-piercing stainless steel belt that travels in a loop around two vertical <b>rollers,</b> with one <b>length</b> of the belt between the rollers acting as a horizontally-moving flat wall. The belt is accelerated suddenly from rest until reaching constant speed {{in order to create}} a temporally-evolving boundary layer analogous to the spatially-evolving boundary layer that would exist along a surface-piercing towed flat plate. Surface profiles are measured with a cinematic laser-induced fluorescence system and sub-surface velocity fields are recorded using a high-speed planar particle image velocimetry system. It is found that the belt initially travels through the water without creating any significant waves, before the free surface bursts with activity close to the belt surface. These free surface ripples travel away from the belt before appearing to become freely-propagating waves. From sub-surface velocity measurements, it is found that close to the surface, transition to turbulence happens sooner than far from the surface, leading to an overall thicker boundary layer in the vicinity of the free surface. A secondary peak in streamwise velocity fluctuations accompanies this transition to turbulence and this peak reaches a maximum value a short time later before smoothing outward. Using momentum thickness as a length scale and the streamwise velocity fluctuations at the location of this outer peak as a velocity scale, free surface bursting and air entrainment onset are found to depend in some way on Weber number and agreement is found with scaling arguments for air entrainment presented by Brocchini and Pregrine (J.

40|$|Magnetic {{tape storage}} which is {{primarily}} used for long-term archival and backup of digital data, {{has historically been}} the most efficient, high-capacity and least expensive storage technology for huge quantities of data. Tape storage applications are in diverse fields such as corporate and government financial records, satellite imagery, credit card databases and patient medical records. Recently, the Linear Tape-Open (LTO) Ultrium format {{has emerged as the}} most dominant tape technology option in the mid-range tape drive market, with the LTO generation 5 (LTO- 5) being capable of holding as much as 1. 5 TB of uncompressed data on a single cartridge. Tape storage however has been traditionally challenged by competing technologies like hard disk drives (HDD), consumer optical storage devices which include CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray disk technologies, optical library systems and holographic storage systems. Thus, one of main goals of the tape industry is to design and manufacture advanced tape storage technologies that aim at reducing the price per unit data storage (/GB). In commercial tape drives, a flexible magnetic tape is transported between the supply and take-up packs at a fixed axial tension and transport speed and over edge and surface guides and read/write heads. The tape decks must assure accurate guiding and transport of the tape while it accelerates and decelerates by holding the axial tension constant. During transport, lateral in-plane vibration of tape 2 ̆ 7 s narrow edge causes misalignment between data tracks on the tape and position of read/write head and leads to reduced storage capacity. Lateral vibration (low and high frequency) is caused by excitation sources viz. pack run-out, flange impacts, pack tilts and tape edge weave. High frequency lateral vibration is more detrimental as it is difficult to move the read/write head to follow the tape 2 ̆ 7 s high frequency motion. To attenuate this vibration, surface guides (rollers or stationary guides) which control the lateral displacement of tape by applying friction on its wider surface, are used. Choice of an appropriate surface guide (or roller) is possible with an understanding of the physics involved in the surface friction between magnetic tape 2 ̆ 7 s wide surface and the roller. This thesis is motivated by the need to conduct a detailed investigation into the frictional interaction between roller surface and magnetic tape and contribute towards the advancement of tape technology to meet the growing market needs. A parametric study is carried out with respect to the tape 2 ̆ 7 s axial tension and axial velocity in the following two aspects: *	An experimental setup is used to control these tape parameters and obtain lateral vibration measurements at two points equidistant from the tape-roller interface to understand the effect of stick-slip friction at the interface on tape 2 ̆ 7 s lateral vibration *	A numerical model is developed to study stick-slip friction between the roller surface and the tape that travels over it. The tape is modeled as an axially moving, tensioned, viscoelastic Euler-Bernoulli beam subjected to boundary disturbances arising from supply and take-up pack run-out and stick-slip friction between tape and roller surface. These analyses are used to predict the possibility of sticking or slipping between the surfaces in contact, as a function of parameters viz. axial tension, axial velocity, surface roughness of <b>roller</b> and span <b>length.</b> A `dynamic phase diagram 2 ̆ 7 is constructed to determine the regions in the stiffness-velocity phase-space where steady stick-slip motion occurs and its effects on lateral vibration of the magnetic tape...|$|R
