50|$|Two taxa {{formerly}} considered subspecies of the Diana monkey {{have recently}} been elevated to full species status: the <b>roloway</b> <b>monkey</b> (C. roloway) is found in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, and the Dryas monkey (C. dryas) found in the DR Congo.|$|E
50|$|The <b>roloway</b> <b>monkey</b> (Cercopithecus roloway) is an {{endangered}} species of Old World monkey endemic to tropical West Africa. It was previously considered a subspecies of the Diana monkey (C. diana). It is classified as Endangered due to habitat loss and continued hunting for the bushmeat trade.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>roloway</b> <b>monkey</b> {{has been}} {{classified}} as Endangered by the IUCN due to rapid population declines {{over the last}} few decades (50%-80%+), mostly driven by habitat loss and hunting. This species is among the most threatened primates on the African continent, although exact figures for the species are not available. Recent surveys could not find evidence of it in Ghana's Bia National Park, where it was probably eliminated between the mid-1970s and 1990.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roloway</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{consume a}} {{diverse array of}} varying insects, fruit, seeds, and flowers. They can feed on the plant parts of roughly 130 species of trees, climbers, and epiphytes. Like many omnivores, <b>roloway</b> <b>monkeys</b> also consume mature fruit pulp, arthropods, oil-rich seeds- and young leaves.|$|R
50|$|As of 2016, {{the park}} is home to 32 species of primate, {{including}} Peruvian squirrel monkeys, black howler monkeys, Geoffroy's marmosets, red titi monkeys, white-faced saki monkeys, geladas, bonobos, ring-tailed lemurs, crowned lemurs, red ruffed lemurs, black-and-white ruffed lemurs, red-faced spider monkeys, pileated gibbons, western lowland gorillas, lesser spot-nosed monkeys, eastern black-and-white colobus monkeys, pygmy marmosets, mandrills, <b>roloway</b> <b>monkeys,</b> southern white-cheeked gibbons, golden-headed lion tamarins, emperor tamarins, white-belted black-and-white ruffed lemurs, black lemurs, red-bellied lemurs, yellow-breasted capuchins, barbary macaques, western chimpanzees, white-throated capuchins, golden-handed tamarins, silvery marmosets, golden lion tamarins, brown spider monkeys and woolly monkeys.|$|R
5000|$|The {{old-growth forest}} habitat {{required}} by the species continues to be reduced by large-scale deforestation through logging and agricultural conversion. In addition to predation by natural enemies such as crowned eagles, leopards, and chimpanzees, <b>roloway</b> <b>monkeys</b> are also frequent targets of human hunting for the bushmeat trade. Over 800 tons of bushmeat is sold in Ghana's markets every year. The roloway monkeys’ conspicuous colours and loud calls make them very susceptible to hunting. Their habitat is also becoming increasingly fragmented due {{to a decline in}} forest habitats and deforestation as human settlements expand and farming increases. In the past 100 years, Ghana has lost 80% of its forested lands. The species is listed as one of [...] "The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates".|$|R
50|$|The <b>roloway</b> <b>monkey</b> {{is similar}} to other species of guenons. Like its closest relative, the Diana monkey (C. diana), its face and much of its fur are black, but is {{distinguished}} by its lengthy beard and broader diadem-like browband. It has a white beard, chest, and throat; there are a white stripe along each thigh and a deep reddish or orange patch on its back. On {{the inside of the}} thighs, the fur is whitish, yellowish, or reddish. The body length ranges from 40 to 55 cm, with a tail of 50=75 cm. Its weight is between 4 and 7 kg.|$|E
50|$|Roloway monkeys {{typically}} diurnally active only, {{and spend}} the night sleeping high in the canopy. The species forms social groups of 15-30 individuals, typically with a single male, around 10 females and their children. Males may change between groups, while females generally stay with the same group they were born into, a habit that may impose restrictions on {{the recovery of the}} species in areas where populations have been reduced. Females give birth typically to one child at a time, after a gestation period of around 5 months. The life span of a <b>roloway</b> <b>monkey</b> is about 20 years in the wild, while individuals in captivity live for more than 30 years.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge on {{the impacts}} of logging {{activity}} on inhabitant primate species in Kwabre Rainforest, Ghana, is vital {{for the development of}} a comprehensive conservation and management plan. With this background, primate density and diversity were recorded along line transects in logged and unlogged areas (strata) to assess the impact of logging activity on these parameters. Six distinct primate species were confirmed including <b>Roloway</b> <b>monkey</b> (Cercopithecus roloway, listed as endangered in the IUCN List of Threatened Species), white-naped mangabey (Cercocebus lunulatus, vulnerable), and Geoffroy’s black-and-white colobus (Colobus vellerosus, vulnerable). There was a significant difference (Mann-Whitney U test: U= 36. 0, p< 0. 01) in primate encounter rates between the logged and unlogged strata with higher species diversity in unlogged stratum (H= 2. 91) compared to the logged stratum (H= 1. 44). Regression analysis indicated a significant effect (r 2 = 0. 945, p< 0. 01) of logging on primate encounter rates. Our results suggest that logging activity can alter composition of primate communities. One option to forestall further forest degradation and its adverse effects on primates would be to grant the Kwabre Rainforest protected area status under Ghanaian law and manage it under an integrated conservation plan that includes neighbouring Ankasa Conservation Area in Ghana and Tanoé Forest in Cote d’Ivoire...|$|E
