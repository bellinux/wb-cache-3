40|$|Q-learning {{can greatly}} improve its {{convergence}} speed if helped by immediate <b>reinforcements</b> {{provided by a}} trainer able to judge the usefulness of actions as stage setting {{with respect to the}} goal of the agent. This paper experimentally investigates this hypothesis studying the integration of immediate <b>reinforcements</b> (also called training <b>reinforcements)</b> with standard delayed <b>reinforcements</b> (namely, <b>reinforcements</b> assigned only when the agent-environment relationship reaches a peculiar state, such as when the agent reaches a target). The paper proposes two new algorithms (TL and MTL) able to exploit even locally wrong and misleading training <b>reinforcements.</b> The proposed algorithms are tested against Q-learning and other algorithms (AB-LEC and BB-LEC) described in the literature 1 which also make use of training <b>reinforcements.</b> Experiments are run in a grid world where a Q-agent, a simple simulated robot, must learn to reach a target.

5|$|The British defeat was {{the worst}} the Royal Navy {{suffered}} during the entire war, and it left the Indian Ocean and its vital trade convoys exposed to attack from Hamelin's frigates. In response, the British authorities sought to reinforce the squadron on Île Bourbon under Josias Rowley by ordering all available ships to the region, but this piecemeal <b>reinforcement</b> resulted {{in a series of}} desperate actions as individual British ships were attacked by the more powerful and confident French squadron. In December 1810 an adequate <b>reinforcement</b> was collected, with the provision of a strong battle squadron under Admiral Albemarle Bertie, that rapidly invaded and subdued Isle de France.|$|E

In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems. The forward-facing <b>reinforcement</b> speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{faced the}} most {{important}} decision of his career: to prevent <b>reinforcement</b> at Fort Sumter or to let it take place. He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, {{to use military force}} to prevent <b>reinforcement</b> before the fleet arrived. Major Anderson did not surrender. With Jefferson Davis's endorsement, Beauregard began the bombarding of the fort in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one was killed in the artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fortress meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up state militia to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.|$|E

50|$|In FireArms, {{players are}} divided into a red and a blue team and are to {{complete}} objectives. Objectives can vary from controlling areas to destroying objects. The main objective in all maps {{is to reduce the}} number of the opponent team's <b>reinforcements</b> to zero. <b>Reinforcements</b> determine the number of times players on a team can respawn. A team loses <b>reinforcements</b> when killed players respawn. The loss of <b>reinforcements</b> on a team can be stifled by completing map objectives and the direct and indirect actions of medics on the team. As long as a team has more than 0 <b>reinforcements,</b> players can respawn instantly. FireArms was the first FPS game to feature player-deployed parachutes.|$|R

5|$|In March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division was one {{of several}} Allied units {{deployed}} to Greece to help prepare for an expected invasion by Italian and German troops. When the invasion began on 6 April 1941, the 20th Battalion briefly saw action at Thermopylae before being withdrawn, but Hinton missed this fighting as he was with the division's <b>reinforcement</b> battalion, which was initially based in Athens before it moved to the port of Kalamata. It had been decided that the Allied forces would abandon Greece; at Kalamata, the <b>reinforcement</b> battalion, along with several thousand other, mainly Australian, troops, was awaiting evacuation. On 28 April, the New Zealanders were waiting for transport when advance units of the German 5th Panzer Division began to attack the town with machine-gun fire and self-propelled 6-inch guns.|$|E
