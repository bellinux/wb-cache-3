5|$|Restrictive N-terminal truncation: The {{approximately}} 30 {{amino acids}} N-terminal extension of cTnI is an adult heart-specific structure. The N-terminal extension contains the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23/Ser24 and {{plays a role}} in modulating the overall molecular conformation and function of cTnI. A restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal hearts of all vertebrate species examined including human and significantly increases in adaptation to hemodynamic stress and Gsα deficiency-caused failing mouse hearts. Distinct from the harmful C-terminal truncation, the restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI selectively removing the adult heart specific extension forms a <b>regulatory</b> <b>mechanism</b> in cardiac adaptation to physiological and pathological stress conditions.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a <b>regulatory</b> <b>mechanism</b> is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate {{them from the}} rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This <b>regulatory</b> <b>mechanism</b> occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.|$|E

Many PPs that regulate nuclear events, are often enriched or exclusively present in the nucleus. In neuronal cells, PPs are present in multiple cellular compartments and play a critical role at both pre- and post-synapses, in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus where they regulate gene expression.|$|E
25|$|Total {{body iron}} averages {{approximately}} 3.8 g {{in men and}} 2.3 g in women. In blood plasma, iron is carried tightly bound to the protein transferrin. There are several mechanisms that control human iron metabolism and safeguard against iron deficiency. The main <b>regulatory</b> <b>mechanism</b> is situated in the gastrointestinal tract. When loss of iron is not sufficiently compensated by adequate intake of iron from the diet, a state of iron deficiency develops over time. When this state is uncorrected, it leads to iron deficiency anemia. Before anemia occurs, the medical condition of Iron Deficiency without anemia is called Latent Iron Deficiency (LID) or Iron-deficient erythropoiesis (IDE).|$|E

Specifically, Section 303 of the Clean Water Act requires each state to generate a TMDL report for each body of water impaired by pollutants. TMDL reports identify pollutant levels and strategies to accomplish pollutant reduction goals. EPA has described TMDLs as establishing a pollutant budget then allocating portions of the overall budget to the pollutant's sources. For many coastal water bodies, the main pollutant issue is excess nutrients, also termed nutrient over-enrichment.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthesis of {{cholesterol}} is directly {{regulated by the}} cholesterol levels present, though the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main <b>regulatory</b> <b>mechanism</b> is the sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2). In the presence {{of cholesterol}}, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) and INSIG-1. When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to understand the signaling pathways between arbuscular mycorrhizae and plant roots. In 2003 it was shown how the AM undergoes physiological changes in the presence of exudates from potential host plant roots, to colonize it. Host plant root exudates trigger and turn on AM fungal genes required for the respiration of spore carbon compounds. In experiments, transcription rate of 10 genes increased half-hour after exposure and at an even greater rate after 1 hour. after 4 hours exposure AM respond with morphological growth. Genes isolated from that time are involved in mitochondrial activity and enzyme production. The fungal respiration rate, measured by O2 consumption rate, increased by 30% 3 hours after exposure to root exudates, indicating that host plant root exudates stimulate AMF spore mitochondrial activity. It may be part of a fungal <b>regulatory</b> <b>mechanism</b> that conserves spore energy for efficient growth and the hyphal branching upon receiving signals from a potential host plant.|$|E

25|$|TK1 is {{synthesized}} by {{the cell}} during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly {{and does not}} pass to body fluids after normal cell division. There is a feed-back regulation of the action of thymidine kinase in the cell: thymidine triphosphate (TTP), {{the product of the}} further phosphorylation of thymidine, acts as an inhibitor to thymidine kinase. This serves to maintain a balanced amount of TTP available for nucleic acid synthesis, not oversaturating the system. 5'-Aminothymidine, a non-toxic analogue of thymidine, interferes with this <b>regulatory</b> <b>mechanism</b> and thereby increases the cytotoxicity of thymidine analogues used as antineoplastic drugs. The reaction kinetics of thymidine and thymidine analogues phosphorylation is complicated and only partly known. The overall phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine triphosphate does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the various phosphates of thymidine and uridine interfere with the phosphorylation of each other. The kinetics of TK from different species differ from each other's and also the different forms from a given species (monomer, dimer, tetramer and serum form) have different kinetic characteristics.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogenase is {{the most}} {{important}} enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation. Azotobacter species have several types of nitrogenase. The basic one is molybdenum-iron nitrogenase. An alternative type contains vanadium; it is independent of molybdenum ions and is more active than the Mo-Fe nitrogenase at low temperatures. So it can fix nitrogen at temperatures as low as 5°C, and its low-temperature activity is 10 times higher than that of Mo-Fe nitrogenase. An important role in maturation of Mo-Fe nitrogenase plays the so-called P-cluster. Synthesis of nitrogenase is controlled by the nif genes. Nitrogen fixation is regulated by the enhancer protein NifA and the [...] "sensor" [...] flavoprotein NifL which modulates the activation of gene transcription of nitrogen fixation by redox-dependent switching. This <b>regulatory</b> <b>mechanism,</b> relying on two proteins forming complexes with each other, is uncommon for other systems.|$|E
