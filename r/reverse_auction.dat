40|$|The United States {{now spends}} around $ 7 billion on {{universal}} service programs—subsidies intended {{to ensure that}} the entire country has access to telecommunications services. Most of this money supports telecommunications service in “high cost ” (primarily rural) areas, and the High Cost fund is growing quickly. In response to this growth, policymakers are considering using <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions,</b> or bids for the minimum subsidy, as a way to reduce expenditures. While the U.

First, <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> are akin to standard government procurement procedures, which call for firms to bid on government contracts to keep prices down.

2500|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>auction</b> {{is a type}} of {{auction in}} which the roles of the buyer and the seller are reversed, with the primary {{objective}} to drive purchase prices downward. While ordinary auctions provide suppliers the opportunity to find the best price among interested buyers, reverse auctions give buyers a chance to find the lowest-price supplier. During a <b>reverse</b> <b>auction,</b> suppliers may submit multiple offers, usually as a response to competing suppliers’ offers, bidding down the price of a good or service to the lowest price they are willing to receive. By revealing the competing bids in real time to every participating supplier, reverse auctions promote “information transparency”. This, coupled with the dynamic bidding process, improves the chances of reaching the fair market value of the item.|$|E

40|$|Online <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions,</b> {{in which}} a buyer seeks to select a {{supplier}} and suppliers compete for contracts by bidding online, revolutionized corporate procurement early this century. Shortly after they had been pioneered by General Electric, many companies rushed to adopt <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> but the adoption soon slowed down due to {{the negative effects of}} auction-induced competition. Today, as firms continue to experiment with the <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions,</b> {{it is important to understand}} how the interplay of the auction context, the service characteristics, and buyer-supplier relationships affects auction outcomes and the success of the auctioned projects. This PhD dissertation investigates online <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> in service industries (e. g. software development, building construction). The differences between services and products (services can be more difficult to describe and require more intensive communication) challenge theories that try to explain auction outcomes. We study several aspects of auctioning service contracts: the buyer’s choice between auctions and negotiations; the contract allocation decisions in auctions; the heterogeneity of buyers’ procurement behaviour; and the effect of auction outcomes on buyer-supplier relationships and project performance during the project execution. Some of the key findings are: 1) that the buyer’s repeat exchange interaction with vendors as well as the satisfaction with a vendor’s past performance lead to the buyer’s preference for using bilateral negotiation to allocate the next project; 2) that there are five buyers’ tactics that allow to increase the likelihood of contract allocation; 3) that the outcomes of online <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> can aggravate project managers’ role constraints and that project managers can use relational exchange competences to overcome these constraints. Overall, buying services through online <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> is quite different from buying products. This thesis makes the first steps to develop theoretical knowledge to account for that difference...|$|R

40|$|The Internet {{has made}} a wealth of new tools {{available}} to the industrial buyer. However, researchers have suggested that computer mediated interaction with suppliers may not be conducive to strong supplier relationships in general and to trust in particular. This paper compares two computer-mediated sourcing tools (email negotiation and Internet <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions)</b> with face-to-face negotiation. Information richness theory suggests that the different media will produce different impacts relating to sellers’ trust in buyers. Data are generated with a simulation experiment using 117 subjects. We found that information richness affects seller-buyer trust: Sellers who used face-to-face negotiation, the richest medium in the study, always reported higher trust in their buyer counterparts than did sellers using Internet <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions.</b> There were also some trust advantages of face-to-face negotiation over email and limited advantages of email over <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions.</b> We also found that procurement complexity influences the relationship between information richness and trust. As hypothesized, when face-to-face negotiation is used, procurement complexity {{has no effect on}} seller trust. When <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> are utilized, the greater the complexity of the purchase, the less the seller trust. However, when email is used, greater procurement complexity is associated with greater seller trust, and there are no differences in trust between the email and face-to-face channels. Finally, we found that sellers’ trust in buyers is positively associated with sellers’ desire for future dealings with the buyer...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of commercial companies are using online <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions</b> for their sourcing activities. In <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions,</b> multiple suppliers bid for a contract from a buyer for selling goods and/or services. Usually, the buyer has to procure multiple items, which are typically divided into lots for auctioning purposes. By steering {{the composition of the}} lots, a buyer can increase the attractiveness of its lots for the suppliers, which can then make more competitive offers, leading to larger savings for the procuring party. In this paper, a clustering-based heuristic lotting method is proposed for <b>reverse</b> <b>auctions.</b> Agglomerative clustering is used for determining the items that will be put in the same lot. A suitable metric is defined, which allows the procurer to incorporate various approaches to lotting.
