The poetry of Hester Pulter (1596 ? 1678) is remarkable for a sophisticated use of terms, images and conceits drawn from alchemy. As such, it provides important evidence of one woman's imaginative and intellectual engagements with the experimental, esoteric and emblematic traditions in alchemy. Paying particular attention to a cycle of poems entitled 'The Circle', I show how Pulter tirelessly worked and reworked alchemical concepts and images, and, just like an alchemist, transformed them into something new.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in ten primary health facilities in Bahi District in Dodoma region-Tanzania between October and December, 2013.

40|$|Katherine Jones, {{better known}} to {{scholars}} as Lady Ranelagh, {{was one of}} the most eminent, politically influential and intellectually respected women in seventeenth-century England. By the time of her death in 1691, she had the rare honour of having been esteemed by every ruler and his government from Cromwell to William and Mary. She was active in diverse intellectual networks across most of the seventeenth century, including the Great Tew Circle, the Hartlib Circle, and the ‘invisible college’, and was associated with many Fellows of the Royal Society during the first three decades of the Society’s existence. As pious as she was intellectually dexterous, Lady Ranelagh elicited respect and admiration from a group of contemporaries who were remarkably diverse in their political opinions, religious views and social status. Over the past decade, there have been several brief surveys of Lady Ranelagh’s life and works; this, however, is the first doctoral thesis to focus exclusively on her. By drawing on over one hundred of her letters and three <b>receipt</b> <b>books</b> associated with her, together with references to her in the diaries of her contemporaries and extant letters written to her, this study contextualises her medical and scientific writings in contemporary religious and socio-political thought. By manipulating generic conventions and employing a rhetoric of modesty, Lady Ranelagh presented her intellectual contributions in a manner appropriate for a gentlewoman. Her extant manuscripts make Lady Ranelagh a representative case study of how women could participate in the radical medical and scientific advances of seventeenth-century England. This interdisciplinary approach creates an informed conversation between two subjects which rarely interact — history of science and medicine, and early modern women’s literature — to consider the material practice and social networks of a remarkably important, but hereunto almost ‘lost’, woman.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. If you are {{the author of this}} thesis and would like to make it openly available in the Institutional Repository please contact: repository@lboro. ac. ukThis thesis is a study of appropriations of the early modern banquet course in plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries during the period 1590 - 1640. My interdisciplinary approach is evident in the range of sources used, including primary material such as accounts of entertainments, dietary literature, <b>receipt</b> <b>books,</b> household manuals and treatises on more broadly relevant topics. Secondary references consist of sources on hospitality, British culinary history, including studies on food and banqueting, and also a range of literary criticism. This work considers dramatic representations of the banquet consisting of wine and sweetmeats taken to aid digestion after a principal meal, and is not limited solely to an examination of banquet scenes in the plays. Other elements which pertain to the practice are also considered; these are progresses, the banquet itself, and the setting which supports the entertainment that usually accompanies it. The first section draws upon two broad definitions of `progress': as official visitation but also a more general definition which draws upon the notion that the `progress' of those seeking social advancement and inclusion constitutes a form of pilgrimage. This is used as a basis for its explanation of related social dynamics, including the interchangeability of the host-guest, patron-client and pilgrim-benefactor relationships. On these foundations, the thesis presents an argument for how conditions governing hospitality, particularly the tensions between its ideals of liberality versus the social exclusivity afforded by banqueting, manifest the patronage system. The next part considers rituals and functions of the banquet course, including the void, ' its corrective properties, and the display of taste, refinement and intellect through the edible, verbal and material conceits which constituted the sensual fare of this course. These functions supported the host's demonstration of mastery over nature to boost and maintain his social credit. Hence, the focus of the last section is the lord's creation of his banquet setting to fulfil this end; it includes his command over human intemperament, and the natural resources on his estate, which ideally represented a microcosm of the world. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the meanings of once common metaphors - particularly those pertaining to food and banqueting - which have become obscured over time, in order to produce substantial new readings of the plays...|$|E
40|$|The {{parameters}} delineating {{this study}} were chosen {{in order to accommodate}} the nature of the inquiry, allowing for fuller definitions, tracing, and consideration of the nature and role of domestic medicines and domestic medical provision in common use within the Anglo-American domestic sphere. As a result, the thesis has purposefully included manuscript evidence from the American colonies alongside those of English authors as a means of assessing the widespread Anglo-American cultural application of domestic medicine throughout the period. This strategy has three aims: first to consider more fully and flesh out the ‘greater British’ domestic knowledge and use of botanical medicines, and secondly, to examine what new medicines found their way into the European canon, with a consideration of how English materia medica changed, or not, {{as a result of this}} influx of new world flora. The third area of focus examines the retransmission of this British household use of indigenous American plants back to the American colonies, considering how trans-Atlantic practices adopted, and adapted, these botanicals by the end of the eighteenthcentury. It is by combining social history methods relative to chronology and geography in a cultural analysis of domestic plant-based medicines that a specific domestic practice is established. This thesis focuses on the domestic use of plant-based medicines within Early Modern English and Colonial American households, and establishes the defining framework of a domestic botanical culture. It reconstructs the relationship between domestic, popular, and learned medical cultures to reveal the breadth of that practice, demonstrating the unique characteristics of the domestic culture which are underpinned by a shared canon of herbs and a high degree of flexible adaptability by individual practitioners. The botanicals (medicinal plants and the remedies made from them) are themselves analysed through the genres of household receipt book manuscripts, private letters, and journals, as well as almanacs, vernacular medical books, travel writing and settler texts in order to explore more fully and expand our understanding of the domestic culture within a broad social setting. Oral, scribal, and print networks are reconstructed in order to demonstrate that domestic medical practitioners shared a distinctive and influential medical construct, commonly portrayed by current scholarship as a mere reflection of popular and learned practices. Close engagement with both Early Modern English and Colonial women’s <b>receipt</b> <b>books</b> in particular reveals a commonality of practice based upon a shared materia medica which was sensitive and responsive to individual adaptation. Old and new world herbs are examined as a means of providing ingress into this shared and communal domestic practice, as well as to highlight the prevalence and importance of household individualization. The clear commonality of plants in trans-Atlantic domestic use demonstrates a continuous, shared, inherited practice which ends only with eighteenth-century Colonial inclusion of indigenous plants not found in the shared canon. Contemporary views of Early Modern and Colonial domestic medical practice are explored in order to argue that far from simply reflecting learned medical thinking and practice, domestic knowledge and use of botanical medicines was uniquely practical, communal, and flexible in its administration and expression...|$|E
