40|$|This article {{presents}} a systematic and fully general model- based approach to compliant robot motion, {{taking into account}} uncertainties in the geometry of the manipulated object and the environment with which it is in contact. The emphasis is not on control but on modeling, instantaneous motion specification, and on-line uncertainty identification. The presented models are intuitive and yet sufficiently flexible to deal with multiple and time-varying motion constraints between nonpolyhedral objects. The description {{of the interaction between}} the manipulated object and its environment starts from first- and second-order approximations of the objects' geometry at the contact points. From these geometric descriptions, the manipulated object's motion freedomand its dual, the set of possible reaction forcesis modeled up to second order (i. e., accelerations) using the similarity with the kinematics of manipulators. Geometric uncertainties of the manipulated object and the environment, also up to second order (i. e., curvature), are integrated into these kinematic models. The on-line identification of uncertainties is based on the measured motion and/or the reaction forces. Two basic con cepts underlie the identification approach: consistency and reciprocity. These concepts give rise to linear identification equations in the uncertainty parameters by applying them to the first-order series expansions of the mathematical <b>representa</b> <b>tions</b> of the motion constraints. Both approaches are shown to be equivalent. The theoretical developments are illustrated by real-world experiments: the motion specification of a complex three-point contact situation between a cylindrical peg and the corresponding chamferless hole; and force-controlled 2 D contour tracking of an unknown object, with recursive identification of the curvature. Redundancy resolution and robot calibration are suggested as other potential applications. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|International audienceConstructing {{the united}} Nation's Norm in recent years, {{important}} political events have brought researchers in political sciences and com munication {{to work more}} explicitly with each other. the last Un General assembly, in September 2011, has confirmed the relevance of such a convergent perspective. Until now, academic research has not questioned the communicational dimension of inter national organizations taken as a highly complex phe nomenon. and yet, the Un is a perfect foundation for examining bordering topics such as authority and new mechanisms of political deliberation, decision and legitimization. Guillaume Devin defines interna tional organizations as meeting points between coo perative behaviour systems and constraining rules. this institutionalization process depends on three kinds of resources - legal, functional and also symbolic. their interdependence {{is the subject of}} this contribution, and more precisely the extent to which communi cational processes have become crucial in building and perpetuating what we would call the Un norm. our intellectual purpose is modest and questions the conditions of communication analysis in the field of international organizations. Taking inspiration from liberal institutionalism and constructivism schools in in ternational relations, this research examines the voca tion of these schools of thought to reveal their analytic potential by maintaining a dialogue with information and communication sciences, especially the theory of communicative action, rhetoric and discursive analysis. a multilateral construction of universalism that rests on procedural resources and values the consecration of multilateralism just after the Second World War was based on two presuppositions. First, it would be a specific discourse about values presumed as universal and indivisible, all of them concerning humanity as a whole. thus, this crucial contribution to the international relations civilization process has always been based on a highly normative judge ment. Second, multilateralism is based on a reiterated game, in other words on repeated and more or less codified procedures and rituals. Embodied in judi cially consecrated organs, multilateralism conceived as a method, tends to introduce so much reciprocity and foreseeable choices among the actors that they encourage the implementation of a certain kind of di plomacy. Most certainly, procedural formalism often prevails over the rationality or efficiency of the deci sions taken at the Un. But taken as a place for learning by experience and a source for diffusion of norms, the organization and Its bureaucracy generate spaces of common sense and conceptions in which member states' advantage lies in enrolling. this "communica tive action", spontaneously settled in language and discourse, coordinates their interactions so as to eva luate the situation in the same way and tends to har monize their strategies of action. Once seized by the information and communication sciences, the buil ding of this collective intentionality challenges one fa mous realist paradigm in international relations. inter national organizations can be conceived as agents of influence, reducing political violence, and not only as strategic agents of interests. the Word of the Un: the legitimacy for acting and ruling the Un legitima ting process depends on concrete modes of settle ment, among its external public, of a shared belief in what is fair and, thus, to be wished. in other words, the Un depends on its ability to produce a meanin gful and expressive discourse towards them. This first Un's Word, the San Francisco Charter of april 1945, fur nishes a specific rhetoric style in the sense that it mixes pragmatic and rhetorical criteria with a precise institu tional function - establishing the Un itself. Furthermore, considering that this charter intended to found a new world order, it gained another function for its "spea kers" - not only a rhetorical one, but also becoming a matrix capable of establishing norms of reference upon which a highly specific kind of debates could take place in the international arena. Study of the Un's communication strategy also furnishes evidence concerning the building of its identity. Since this com munication function has to reinforce the organization as a representative team, the organization frequently uses a meta-discursive posture. even if the Un's pro mise fluctuates between knowledge production and operational involvement on the ground, these textual forms can be given as rhetorical, interactional and communicational gestures. that is why the Un's poli tical action cannot be disconnected from its rheto rical and communicational matrix. thus, the ethic of consensus that determines the organization's dyna mic appears as a paradoxical motive for its legitimacy in acting and ruling. the Un as subject and instigator of a specific norm and order Last, but not least, the Un can be conceived as the subject and instigator of a specific norm and order in the sense that the pu blic sphere appropriates its normative and cognitive productions. in fact, it nourishes the circulation and promotion of key words ("human security", "common public goods", "peacekeeping operations", etc.) that engage specific convictions and mental <b>representa</b> <b>tions</b> of humanity. these norms of reference not only turn diplomatic debates towards specific bias, but also impregnate their media coverage. the refe rence to Human rights is a good example of this inter national relations' civilization process. Since the text of the San Francisco Charter and the Universal Declara tion of Human rights voted in December 1948, these rights are consecrated in both their moral and legal dimensions. This UN's contribution to "legalize" inter national relations is well known and studied by politi cal scientists. However, its ability to communicate this activity can only be questioned by the information and communication sciences. this focus on indivi duals establishes the fact that states' sovereignty now has strong limitations. Human rights are raised as fun damental "coordinates" of peace and inspire mental representations that are increasingly legitimate. thus, they nourish a normative activity which places the Un in keeping with the long time scope. the Un's values inspire the rhetorical expression of a vision of humanity and stabilize in some specific "texts" that also work as guarantees for their moral authority. Finally, each of these discursive practices also poses the problematic of its uses. in the beginning of the 21 st Century, this questions more fundamentally the function of univer sality itself for the institutions that promotes it and for contemporary society as a whole. Ces derniers temps, un certain nombre de phéno mènes politiques convergents invitent les recherches en SiC et celles en science politique à interagir plus explicitement. après une assemblée générale de l'ONU particulièrement médiatisée, en septembre 2011, une telle approche est pertinente. a ce jour, on ne trouve nulle trace, dans la recherche acadé mique, d'une approche communicationnelle véri table révélant toute ses dimensions au phénomène complexe des organisations internationales. or, une organisation telle que l'onU fournit un socle permet tant d'interroger des objets frontières comme l'auto rité et les nouveaux dispositifs de discussion, de déci sion et de légitimation politiques. Guillaume Devin y voit le point de rencontre entre des conduites coopé ratives plus ou moins complexes, et disposant d'une autorité et d'un pouvoir de contrainte de plus en plus indéniables. le processus d'institutionnalisation dont il s'agit s'appuie sur trois types de ressources: non seu lement juridiques et fonctionnelles, mais aussi symbo liques. C'est l'interdépendance dans laquelle fonc tionnent ces trois dimensions qui nous intéresse ici, et plus spécifiquement la part des processus communi cationnels dans la consolidation et la perpétuation de la norme onusienne. l'objectif de cette contribution est modeste et interroge les conditions d'analyse de la communication des organisations internationales. Prenant appui sur les analyses de l'école de l'interna tionalisme libéral et sur l'approche constructiviste en relations internationales, elle interroge leur vocation à révéler leur potentiel analytique en dialoguant avec les SIC, notamment la théorie de l'agir communica tionnel et les phénomènes rhétoriques et discursifs. Une construction multilatérale de l'universalisme ap puyée sur des ressources procédurales et des valeurs la consécration du multilatéralisme au lendemain du drame de la Seconde Guerre mondiale a reposé sur deux présupposés. Premièrement, il constitue un discours spécifique sur des valeurs présumées univer selles et indivisibles, et toutes liées à l'humanité. Cet apport essentiel au processus de civilisation des rela tions internationales s'appuie sur un jugement qui est donc très normatif. ensuite, il repose sur un jeu itératif, c'est-à-dire continu et répété selon des procédures de décision, implicites ou explicites, et des rituels. Concrétisé dans des organes juridiquement habili tés, le multilatéralisme, comme méthode, introduit entre les participants une norme de comportement faite de réciprocité diffuse qui est un facteur possible de réassurance, mais surtout contribue à la mise en œuvre d'une certaine diplomatie. Certes, le forma lisme procédural l'emporte souvent sur la rationalité substantielle, voire l'efficacité des décisions prises à l'onU. Mais en tant que diffuseurs de normes et lieux d'apprentissage, l'organisation et sa bureaucratie établissent des espaces de sens au sein desquels les etats ont intérêt à s'inscrire. Cet " agir communica tionnel ", ancré spontanément dans le langage et le discours, coordonne leurs interactions de façon à ce qu'ils interprètent ensemble la situation et tendent à s'accorder sur la conduite à tenir. appréhendée via les SiC, la construction de cette intentionnalité collec tive onusienne défie donc les paradigmes de l'école réaliste en relations internationales : les organisations internationales se donnent bien comme des agents d'euphémisation de la violence très sous estimés par la recherche, et pas seulement comme de simples agents d'intérêts. la parole onusienne : vers une figure de la légitimité à agir et à régir La légitimation de l'onU dépend à terme des modalités concrètes d'établissement, parmi ses publics externes, d'une croyance partagée dans ce qui est juste et donc sou haitable. C'est-à-dire de sa capacité à produire une parole et un discours performants et signifiants à leur attention. Première " parole " onusienne, la Charte de San Francisco d'avril 1945 fournit un genre rhétorique à part entière, en ce qu'elle associe des critères prag matiques et rhétoriques à une fonction institutionnelle cruciale (instituer l'organisation). en outre, dans la mesure où cette charte entendait fonder un nouveau monde commun, elle a acquis une seconde fonction pour les locuteurs, non plus rhétorique mais cette fois en se donnant comme une matrice susceptible de fournir un ensemble de référentiels à partir desquels s'est construit un ensemble spécifiques de débats dans l'arène internationale. l'étude de la commu nication de l'onU fournit également quelques indices solides concernant les modalités de sa construction identitaire. Cette fonction communication ayant pour mission de consolider l'organisation en tant qu'équipe de représentation, la tentation de la posture méta-dis cursive est y fréquente. Même si la parole onusienne oscille en permanence entre production de savoirs et opérationnalité sur le terrain, ces textes, dans leur visée morale et politique, s'appréhendent en tant que gestes rhétoriques, interactionnels et commu nicationnels. l'action politique de l'onU ne peut donc être déconnectée de sa matrice rhétorique, et donc communicationnelle. l'éthique du consensus qui l'anime se donne paradoxalement comme un moteur de sa légitimité non seulement à agir, mais aussi à régir. l'onU comme sujet et instigateur d'un ordre et d'une norme spécifiques L'ONU se conçoit enfin comme l'instigateur d'un ordre et d'une norme spécifiques par l'appropriation de ses productions normatives et cognitives dans l'espace public. elle nourrit en effet la circulation et la promotion de mots clefs (" sécurité humaine", " biens publics mondiaux ", " maintien de la paix " [...] .) qui engagent certaines représentations du monde. autant de normes qui tout en orientant les débats diplomatiques, imprègnent de plus en plus leur médiatisation. la référence aux droits de l'Homme fournit un exemple éclairant de ce processus de civilisation des relations internationales. Dès le texte de la Charte de San Francisco et dans la Déclaration Universelle des Droits de l'Homme votée en décembre 1948, ces droits sont consacrés dans leur dimension à la fois morale et juridique. Si la contri bution de l'onU à " juridiciser " les relations internatio nales est bien connue des politistes, la communicabi lité de cette dynamique est questionnée par les SiC. Ce recentrage sur les individus consacre le fait que la souveraineté des etats n'est plus sans limites. erigés en coordonnée de la paix à part entière et source de représentations perçues de plus en plus comme légitimes, les droits de l'Homme nourrissent une acti vité normative qui entend inscrire l'onU dans le temps long. ici, les valeurs onusiennes nourrissent donc l'ex pression rhétorique d'une vision de l'humanité et se stabilisent dans certains " textes " qui ont aussi pour fonction d'en garantir l'autorité morale. Enfin, cha cune de ces pratiques discursives pose aussi la ques tion de l'usage dont elles font l'objet. Ce qui, en ce début de XXième siècle, soulève la question du sta tut et de la fonction de l'universalité elle-même, non seulement pour les institutions qui la promeuvent, mais dans la société contemporaine toute entière...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Conceptual {{models have}} been {{developed}} for many domains and application types. Within each discipline, the mode and purpose of conveying the design is slightly different. For example, in the computing disciplines, the conceptual models are comprised of constructs that enable the domain expert and software engineer to represent an application with notations that permit understanding of the application domain {{and at the same time}} facilitate the mapping from this conceptualization to the code that implements it. Clear specification of the computational model along with the objects, structures, and rules is essential. In the engineering domain statis tical and mathematical models are used to permit concise and precise <b>representa</b> <b>tion</b> of the application to enable accurate analysis of the characteristics of the objects being modeled as well as an analysis of their performance. In the social sciences models utilize diagrammatic and verbal notations and attempt to describe the processes that effectively explain and predict human individual and group behaviors.

A simple model for nitrogen, that consists on a two centre Lennard- Jones fluid with point quadrupole was used [1]. The solid pore was modelled using Steel's 10 - 4 - 3 potential [2]. For large pores, adsorption occurs in layers regardless of the shape of the molecule, but as the pore size becomes smaller the molecular details become more important. At low densities we observe random orientations of the adsorbed molecules, but as the density becomes higher, different structures are observed, depending on the molecule shape and its polarity. Spherical molecules pack in a hexagonal arrangement whereas typical "t- shaped " structures are observed for quadrupolar fluids. Depending on the pore width it is possible to differentiate between t- shaped structures parallel or perpendicular to the surface. For diatomic molecules and non- quadrupolar fluids, packing considerations dominate at high densities. Correlations between molecular structure on a given layer and between layers are presented.

40|$|Understanding {{a natural}} {{language}} requires knowledge about that {{language as a}} system of representation. Further, when the task is one of understanding an extended discourse, world knowledge is also required. This thesis explores {{some of the issues}} involved in representing both kinds of knowledge, and also makes an effort to arrive at some under standing {{of the relationship between the}} two. A part of this exploration involves an examination of some natural language understanding systems which have attempted to deal with extended discourse both in the form of stories and in the form of dialogues. The systems exam ined are heavily dependent on world knowledge. Another part of this exploration is an effort to build a dialogue system based on speech acts and practical argu ments, as they are described in 2 ̆ 2 Recognizing Promises, Advice, Threats, and Warnings 2 ̆ 2, a Masters Thesis presented to Rochester Institute of Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology, in 1986 by Kevin Donaghy. This dialogue system includes a deterministic syntactic parser, a semantic representation based on the idea of case frames, and a context interpreter that recognizes and represents groups of sentences as practical arguments. This Prolog implementation employs a frame package developed and described in 2 ̆ 2 A Frame Virtual Machine in C-Prolog 2 ̆ 2, a Masters Thesis presented to Rochester Institute of Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology, in 1987 by LeMora Hiss. While this automated dialogue system is necessarily limited in the domain that it recognizes, the opportunity it allows to build a mechanism and a system of representation brings with it a range of issues from the syntactic, through the semantic, to the contextual and the pragmatic.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} involvement of the subnational government of Flanders in global and European decision-making on sustainable devel opment. It uncovers a variety of multi-level interactions, i. e. interact ions between Flemish, federal, European and global levels of governance. Subnational governments claim a role in governance for sus tainable development, not only within their own borders, but also in the ir relations with the outside world. Many of them are increasingly motiv ated to intensify their international sustainable development activities because of the role they play in the implementation of policies and bec ause of the particular international dimension of sustainable developmen t. They want to be recognized as crucial actors and take part in decidin g the international agenda. Yet subnational governments are rarely recog nized as negotiating parties at the international level and consequently not directly represented in international organizations that discuss in ternational sustainable development issues. As representatives of sovere ign countries, national governments are the main negotiating actors. Sub national governments need to find other ways than direct representation {{if they want to be}} involved. A single case-study is made of Fla nders and its involvement in the continuous international decision-makin g processes on sustainable development that take place in the UN, the OE CD and the EU. The research builds on four research questions. Two of th em are preliminary and examine how international decision-mak ing on sustainable development takes place and how it is coordinated in federal Belgium. The third research question provides a descr iptive analysis of the routes Flanders uses in order to be involved in t hose international decision-making processes. A route represe nts a way in which a subnational government is involved at the internati onal level and can be concretized in two or more different channels. &nbs p;Channels are either intra-state (cooperating with the national g overnment) or extra-state (bypassing the national government). The fourt h research question has an explanatory nature and seeks to analyze why F landers uses a particular channel. The research is situated in three strands of literature. First, it adds to the literature on governa nce for sustainable development where the role of subnational governmen ts in international decision-making had not yet been studied before by the application of a comprehensive, clearly defined and consistent analy tical framework. Second, a contribution is made to the multi-level gover nance literature, which embraces the idea of subnational mobilization by offering insights into how subnational governments try to be involved a t the European level. Starting from that literature, a conceptual framew ork with typologies of routes and channels for subnational governments t o global and European decision-making is developed, and used for answering the first three research questions. This research adds to the literat ure on multi-level governance by analyzing subnational mobilization in t he global arena. Third, the study is positioned within the literature st ream on new institutionalism. In a theoretical framework, insights offer ed by rational choice, sociological and historical institutio nalism are started from and complemented with insights from other litera ture streams for composing a toolbox of six potential explanatory factor s, i. e. Logic of consequentiality, Logic of appropriateness, Path d ependency, Sustainable development, Political context and Identity politics. That toolbox provides me with a theoretical focus in address ing the fourth research question. An exploratory research method is opte d for, allowing an exploration of all analytical factors that could expl ain how Flanders chooses to be active internationally with regard to sus tainable development issues. Based on the results of the exploratory res earch, hypotheses about the explanatory factors are formulated at the en d of the dissertation. The empirical analysis reveals that decision-making on sustainable devel opment in the UN, the OECD and the EU concerns continuous processes mark ed by multi-level interactions. Characteristics of governance, in partic ular non-governmental involvement, are also apparent. The entire process includes formal as well as informal rule systems. Informal interactions are crucial for the course of the decision-making process. The federal government in Belgium shares its decision-making competencies for intern ational sustainable development issues with the subnational governments and with the EU institutions. It can therefore not be seen as a unique a ctor anymore and it has also lost part of its control. However, it still has an important coordination role at the national level and <b>representa</b> <b>tion</b> role at the international level, and sometimes still acts as a gate keeper, especially for information flows. Flanders mobilizes in order to be involved in global and European decision-making on sustainable dev elopment. It uses a mix of routes, of which most concern intergovernment al cooperation at the national level, but of which some also imply that the Flemish government communicates directly with decision-makers at the international level. The findings suggest that most explanator y power comes from the new institutionalist explanatory factors Path de pendency and Logic of consequentiality. While the former explains to a large extent why Flanders used intra-state channels, the latter has la rge explanatory power for the Flemish use of extra-state channels. The f actor Logic of appropriateness only has partial explanatory power and was most useful for explaining the use of intra-state channels. The fact ors Political context and Identity politics are primarily relevant f or explaining the intensity by which Flanders used some of the channels. The explanatory power of the factor Sustainable development is on the whole negligible. The research indicates the importance of an additiona l factor, labelled Personalities, of which the potential impact could not be assumed in advance. That factor demonstrates how individuals can be driving forces in decision-making processes. Co nceptually, this research identifies a variety of concepts and, most importantly, it develops typologies of subnational routes and channels t o global and European decision-making, which can be used by future schol ars working on the international involvement of subnational governments. Theoretically, it fills a gap in the academic literature wit h regard to explanatory factors of the way subnational governments are i nvolved in international decision-making. Hypotheses are induced, which can be applied and tested for other subnational governments in further r esearch. This dissertation also contributes to the literature on new ins titutionalism, by examining the interchange among the three new institutionalisms. Furthermore, a basis for further research is created through propositions about the route (or mix of routes) a subnational government chooses to use in order to be involved in global and/or European decisi on-making. Overall, even when a subnational governmen t has set itself the policy goal to be involved in international decisio n-making, it is limited in many ways and it cannot use all channels that it theoretically would be able to use. Important limitations follow fro m the external institutional context. Yet, that context also provides th e subnational government with a variety of opportunities. It is up to th e subnational government to manage its use of all available opportunitie s. It can influence three critical elements: the capacity that is made a vailable, the development of expertise and institutional memory and the provision of political support. nrpages: 480 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Exploitation of 'sicko-chatting' by the Pharmaceutical industry: a {{strategy}} for the Normalization of drug use Pharmaceutical drugs are consumer goods. As such, they inscribe the transition from normality to pathology within the ambit of health marketing (Duclos, 2008, p. 109). It is now widely acknowledged that this pathology {{is not just a}} mere quantitative modification of the normal state, but that it also implies the patient's qualitative assessment of his or her experience (Canguilhem, 1943). This <b>representa</b> <b>tion</b> of pathology involves a certain degree of autonomy of action in the constitution of oneself as a suffering subject (Ehrenberg et al. 2005 / 6, p. 115). The level of subjectivity in volved in evaluating one's own health is no less dependent on the normative expectations of the social environment, expressed in terms of relief, comfort, welfare, produc tivity or performance. To be sure, the individual interna lizes and codifies his/her discomfort, but the language he/ she uses corresponds to the one that is conveyed in the media representations of sickness, through journalistic and fictitious medical narratives (Rose, 2007, p. 701). The pharmaceutical industry, well aware of the subjective and social nature of the meanings attached to the definition of a pathology, ensures that the marketing of its products is based not only on the dissemination of information but also on the media construction of a shared symbolic value. In a context where the advertising of health products is highly constrained [...] and in some cases prohibited [...] pharmaceu tical communication penetrates the market in two ways: first, it contributes to naturalizing standards of well-being and performance of the body and mind (as if they simply emanated from biological nature) and secondly, it norma lizes the use of drugs. Convincing the audience that phar maceuticals can help one reach an optimal level of physical and mental condition is not enough : consuming pharma ceuticals must be a way of life, and be part of the collective imagination. The daily uses of medication must become a shared practice. Beyond the inherent regulatory function of the remedy, the creation of normative discourses on the uses of the drug, within social networks, requires serious attention. More than ever, the insertion of pharmaceuticals in social processes is a central concern for the professionals in pharmaceutical marketing. Influencers marketing is still prominent. But there is a decrease in direct-to-prescri ber activities (in this case, for the physicians) in favor of activities aimed at peer influencers. The marketing depart ments of many major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have begun to focus more on multi-channel approaches to promote their products. The creation and maintenance of social networks quickly became a neces sity for them. It is not coincidental that, in recent years, there has been a rapid growth of associations of health care users' and of patients' groups, as well as of countless health-chat forums (or rather "sicko-chat" forums). The industry's contribution to the development of these asso ciations is often direct. Thus, Johnson & Johnson created the site "BabyCenter", McNeil Pediatrics (also a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) has created two Facebook pages, and UCB has partnered with the site "PatientsLikeMe. com" to create an online community about epilepsy. These initiatives fall within the scope of "conversational marke ting", a branch of marketing 2. 0 which aims to establish a "dialogue" with online forum participants through conver sational agents in order to make "friends" and to turn those friends into customers (Tuten, 2008, p. 33 - 54). The role of conversational agent is played by a real person, hired to interact with Internet users, or by a software mimicking human conversation. The possibility of creating a pseudo dialogue allows advertisers to provide Internet users with a list of arguments {{that can be used in}} their discussions with their families, thus transforming them into brand evange lists (also called "brand ambassadors"). The use of incentives to increase drug consumption is a cause of concern for public-health departments, but very little is known about the pressures experienced by indi viduals in their daily lives. Even less is known about how these pressures are related to the new so-called conver sational marketing strategies. To study the formation of normative discourse on drug use in the context of conver sational marketing, the analyst needs a grammar of action capable of relating linguistic agency to sociological agency. The method should also allow one to identify, within the content of the exchanges, the shifts in the registers of information, social support and advertising. A sentence like "Since my son is on medication, I know I am a good parent" could have been written with or without finan cial sponsorship. The reason why it might be considered as promotional depends on its inclusion in a set of clear representational patterns of the curative treatment, of the actors involved, and of the transformations that occurred. In the wake of works in critical analysis of discourse (Fowler, 1991; Van Dijk, 1993; Fairclough, 1995), espe cially that of Karmen Erjavec (2004), which aims to identify journal articles written for purely commercial purposes ("advertorials"), I deployed the systemic functional gram mar of transitivity of Michael Halliday (2004) to compare the contributions of Internet users to two different Facebook pages. This included one developed by the leading manu facturer of a drug for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and one created by a Bri tish citizen to form a discussion group on (ADHD). Accor ding to Halliday, studying transitivity involves analyzing the process of meaning represented by the verb in a clause, the relations between actors, and the circumstances of the action. Who recommends what to whom? What is good for whom and under which circumstances? What is appearing and on what? Who knows what's best? The study allowed me to identify how the promotional nature of the corporate Facebook page expresses itself in relation to agency in the texts of the Internet users: 1) through a representation that exaggerates the consumers' power, 2) through a sanctimonious image of the sick per son, 3) through remarks which are always favorable to pharmaceutical drugs 4) and through an emphasis on the judgment of the prescribers and other influencers. Overall, this paper will permit us to reflect on how the electronic media serve to standardize both our understanding of contemporary pain and our treatment of it. Les médicaments sont des biens de consommation. Ils ins crivent le passage du pathologique au normal dans " une optique de promotion thérapeutique marchande " (Duclos, 2008, p. 109). Il est aujourd'hui communément admis que l'état pathologique n'est pas qu'une " une modification quantitative de l'état normal ", mais qu'il relève aussi d'une évaluation qualitative que le malade fait de son expé rience (Canguilhem, 1943). Cette représentation de l'état pathologique implique une autonomie de l'action dans la constitution de soi-même comme sujet souffrant (Ehren berg et al., 2005 / 6, p. 115). La part de subjectivité dans l'évaluation que l'individu fait de son état de santé n'en est pas moins dépendante des attentes normatives du milieu, exprimées en termes de soulagement, confort, bien-être, productivité ou performance. L'individu intériorise et codi fie son malaise, certes, mais le langage qu'il utilise est celui-là même qui est véhiculé dans les représentations médiatiques de la maladie, au travers des récits médicaux tant journalistiques que fictifs (Rose, 2007, p. 701). L'indus trie pharmaceutique, bien au fait des dimensions subjec tives et sociales de la définition du pathologique, s'assure que la commercialisation de ses produits repose non seu lement sur la diffusion d'informations, mais aussi sur la construction médiatique d'une valeur symbolique parta gée. Dans un contexte où la publicité des produits de santé est fortement contrainte, voire dans certains cas interdite, la communication pharmaceutique pénètre le tissu social de deux manières: elle contribue d'une part à naturaliser les normes de fonctionnement du corps et de l'esprit et d'autre part, à normaliser le recours aux médicaments. Il ne suffit donc pas de convaincre le public cible que le médi cament peut l'aider à recouvrer un état physiologique et mental jugé nécessaire, encore faut-il que le produit phar maceutique entre dans les mœurs de la population, qu'il prenne place dans l'imaginaire collectif, que son usage devienne une pratique quotidienne partagée. Au-delà de la fonction régulatrice du remède, c'est la constitution dans les réseaux sociaux des discours normatifs sur les usages du médicament que nous désirons examiner. Plus que jamais, l'insertion du médicament dans les pro cessus d'inclusion sociale est au centre des préoccupa tions des professionnels du marketing pharmaceutique contemporain. Le marché en reste un de prescription, mais on assiste à une baisse des activités de promotion destinées aux prescripteurs absolus, soit ceux dont la recommandation d'un produit est impérative en l'occur rence les médecins, au profit d'activités destinées au prescripteurs relatifs, c'est-à-dire les personnes dont les recommandations ne sont qu'indicatives. Les directions de marketing des grandes entreprises biotechnologiques et pharmaceutiques ont donc entrepris de miser davantage sur les approches multicanal pour la promotion de leurs produits. La création et l'exploitation de réseaux sociaux sont rapidement devenues à leurs yeux une nécessité. Cette orientation n'est pas étrangère à la multiplication rapide, au cours des dernières années, des associations de personnes malades ou d'usagers de soins sanitaires, de même que d'innombrables groupes de " pathoclavardage " (clavardage sur la maladie). La contribution de l'industrie au développement des ces associations est souvent di recte. Ainsi, Johnson & Johnson a créé le site BabyCenter; McNeil Pediatrics (aussi une filiale de Johnson & Johnson) a créé deux pages Facebook; UCB a travaillé en partena riat avec le site PatientsLikeMe. com pour la création d'une communauté d'échange sur l'épilepsie. Ces initiatives sont des activités de " marketing conversa tionnel ", une approche subsidiaire du marketing 2. 0 qui vise à établir un " dialogue " avec le client par l'intermé diaire d'agents conversationnels, de s'en faire " un ami " (Tuten, 2008, p. 33 - 54). Le rôle d'agent conversationnel est joué par de véritables personnes chargées d'échanger avec les internautes ou par des logiciels imitant la conver sation humaine. La possibilité de donner l'apparence d'un dialogue permet de proposer aux internautes un argumen taire qu'ils pourront reprendre dans leurs discussions avec leurs proches. Les incitations à une consommation croissante de médica ments inquiètent les directions de santé publique, mais on en sait très peu sur la nature exacte des pressions vécues par les individus dans leur vie quotidienne et l'on en sait encore moins sur ce qui lie ces pressions aux nouvelles stratégies de marketing dit conversationnel. Pour étudier la constitution des discours normatifs sur l'usage des mé dicaments dans un contexte de marketing conversationnel, l'analyste doit donc se doter d'une grammaire de l'action qui lie l'agentivité linguistique à l'agentivité sociologique. La méthode utilisée doit aussi permettre de repérer dans le contenu même des échanges les glissements opérés entre les registres de l'information, du soutien social et de la publicité. Une phrase comme " Depuis que mon fils prend des médicaments, je sais que je suis un bon parent " peut avoir été écrite avec ou sans parrainage financier. Ce qui fait son caractère publicitaire c'est son insertion dans des modèles représentationnels récurrents de l'action curative, des actants impliqués et des transformations occasionnées. Dans la foulée des travaux en analyse critique de discours (Fowler, 1991; Van Dijk, 1993; Fairclough, 1995), et plus particulièrement du travail de Karmen Erjavec (2004) vi sant à identifier les articles de journaux rédigés pour des fins purement commerciales (advertorials), nous avons eu recours à la grammaire systémique fonctionnelle de la transitivité de Michael Halliday (2004) pour comparer les contributions d'internautes à deux pages Facebook diffé rentes dont l'une élaborée par le fabriquant d'un médi cament phare pour le traitement du trouble du déficit de l'attention avec ou sans hyperactivité (TDA/H) et l'autre, créée par une citoyenne britannique en vue de former un groupe de discussion sur le TDA/H. L'étude de la transiti vité chez Halliday consiste à analyser les procès de signi fication représentés par les verbes, les relations que les actants ont entre eux et les circonstances de l'action. Qui recommande quoi à qui ? Qu'est-ce qui fait du bien à qui et dans quelles circonstances ? Qu'est-ce qui apparaît et sur quoi ? Qui sait ce qui est bon ? Qu'est-ce qui permet de voir quoi? L'analyse a permis d'identifier à travers l'agir des protagonistes mis en scène dans les textes des internautes les procédés par lesquels s'exprime le caractère publici taire de la page Facebook corporative : une représentation exagérée du pouvoir des consommateurs, une image com plaisante de la personne malade, un propos favorable au médicament et une mise en valeur du jugement des pres cripteurs relatifs et absolus. Cette communication offrira l'occasion de réfléchir sur l'influence des médias électro niques dans l'uniformisation de notre compréhension du mal-être contemporain et des moyens que nous prenons pour remédier à celui-ci...|$|E
