25|$|The {{right to}} strike {{is one of the}} {{essential}} means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their economic and social interests. The Committee considers that this basic right is not really guaranteed when a worker who exercises it legally <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of seeing his or her job taken up permanently by another worker, just as legally. The Committee considers that, if a strike is otherwise legal, the use of labour drawn from outside the undertaking to replace strikers for an indeterminate period entails a risk of derogation from the {{right to strike}} which may affect the free exercise of trade union rights.|$|E
25|$|Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung {{argued that}} a father is very {{important}} to a boy's development of identity. In his book Absent Fathers, Lost Sons Canadian Jungian analyst Guy Corneau writes that the presence of the father's body during the son's developmental phases is integral in the son developing a positive sense of self as masculine. Corneau also argues that if the son does not develop positively towards the father's male body, then the son <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of developing negatively towards all bodies. Jacques Lacan argued that in the son's mind, the father's body represents the law, and that the role of the father's body is to break the attachment the son feels to the mother and by extension his own.|$|E
25|$|While {{the backs}} prepare {{to receive a}} kick, the other {{defenders}} will attempt to apply pressure to the kicker. It is usually rather predictable when a side is about to kick: normally {{one member of the}} attacking team is in charge of kicking, and as the team prepares to kick, he will drop back and make himself available deep behind the dummy half, to give himself space and time to set up for the kick. To limit the kicker's effectiveness, the defenders will often rush up out of the defensive line towards him. As well as giving him less time to set up, this action can cloud the kicker's mind, distracting him with thoughts of the upcoming tackle or encouraging him to consider switching to another attacking option due to the sudden change in the defensive line. This combination of physical and mental pressure may lead to a poor kick, giving an advantage to the non-kicking team. This manoeuvre could also result in a 'charge-down', if a defending player manages {{to get in the way}} of the ball very shortly after it is kicked (If the ball travels forward this is an exception to the knock-on rule). This often results in a line break or try to the previously defending team, however it <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of having the attacking team regather the ball for a new set of tackles.|$|E

25|$|Psychogenic amnesia is {{supposed}} to differ from organic amnesia {{in a number of}} ways; one being that unlike organic amnesia, psychogenic amnesia is thought to occur when no structural damage to the brain or brain lesion is evident. Psychological triggers are instead considered as preceding psychogenic amnesia, and indeed many anecdotal case studies which are cited as evidence of psychogenic amnesia hail from traumatic experiences such as World War II. As aforementioned however, aetiology of psychogenic amnesia is controversial as causation is not always clear (see above paragraph), and both elements of psychological stress and organic amnesia may be present among cases. Often, but not necessarily, a premorbid history of psychiatric illness such as depression is thought to be present in conjunction to triggers of psychological stress. Lack of psychological evidence precipitating amnesia doesn't mean there isn't any, for example trauma during childhood has even been cited as triggering amnesia later in life, but such an argument <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of psychogenic amnesia becoming an umbrella term for any amnesia of which there is no apparent organic cause. Due to organic amnesia often being difficult to detect, defining between organic and psychogenic amnesia is not easy and often context of precipitating experiences are considered (for example, if there has been drug abuse) as well as the symptomology the patient presents with. Psychogenic amnesia {{is supposed}} to differ from organic amnesia qualitatively in that retrograde loss of autobiographical memory while semantic memory remains intact is said to be specific of psychogenic amnesia. Another difference that has been cited between organic and psychogenic amnesia is the temporal gradient of retrograde loss of autobiographical memory. The temporal gradient of loss in most cases of organic amnesia is said to be steepest at its most recent premorbid period, whereas for psychogenic amnesia the temporal gradient of retrograde autobiographical memory loss is said to be quite consistently flat. Although there is much literature on psychogenic amnesia as dissimilar to organic amnesia, the distinction between neurological and psychological features is often difficult to discern and remains controversial.|$|E

500|$|U2's {{decision}} to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason. Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson believed it devalued music, saying U2 had [...] "sent a message to everyone that music is free, and that's disturbing. It's easy {{to do that when}} you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't really something that you worry about, but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing to see someone do that." [...] The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: [...] "This vindicates our view that giving away hundreds of millions of albums simply devalues music and <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy." ...|$|E

500|$|When Black {{opts for}} 10...Bxd2, he <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> {{to end up}} a tempo down over the 7.a3 {{variation}} and to be soon unable to meet White's positional threats on the queenside. White can avoid the push a2–a3 and continue with the standard plans of the 7.a3 variation. However, everything is not that bad for Black. First, to implement his plan White has to concentrate on development (9.Be2, 10.0-0) before he turns {{his attention to the}} queenside. That means Black has more time to organise his play than in the 7.a3 variation, notably to attempt a blockade of the c5-square. Moreover, as White does not put immediate pressure on Black's position, Black is not compelled to castle rapidly and he can keep his king in the centre for a longer time, or even castle queenside. Hence Lalic note that [...] "White has not wasted time with a2–a3, but in fact it is not so easy to capitalise on this extra tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|The United States warned Yugoslavia against {{shelling}} Albanian territory. State Department spokesman James Rubin {{told reporters}} that the alleged shelling was likely an attempt to prevent the insurgents from re-entering Kosovo. [...] "If true, the shelling represents an unacceptable violation of Albanian territory." [...] He continued. [...] "Belgrade must understand that such shelling <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of further escalating the current conflict." [...] Rubin said that the U.S. was opposed {{to the creation of}} a pan-Albanian state, and emphasized that calls for its establishment were a [...] "very dangerous development that could affect the stability of the region." [...] Russian officials accused KLA fighters of stoking the clashes, and called for peace talks between the militants and Yugoslav authorities. On July 19, Albanian officials requested that Greece—an important trading partner for Albania and traditional ally of Serbia—mediate to end the fighting. Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos issued a condemnation, saying [...] "these senseless acts of violence must stop." [...] The European Union condemned the militant incursion, as well as the alleged cross-border shelling.|$|E
500|$|Space Gun is an Arcade Rail Shooter {{in which}} the player views the {{on-screen}} action from a first person perspective. Players use a cabinet mounted light gun to target and shoot enemies. Enemies are either mechanical guns that descend from above the screen or aliens, several of {{which can only be}} defeated by first shooting away their limbs. The player must save human hostages from the creatures. Occasionally, a hostage will mutate into an alien. In addition to the standard rapid fire weapon, there are four other weapons: a flamethrower, grenade launcher, freeze bomb, and blade bomb. These weapons require ammunition which can be collected throughout the stages, and are activated by the player using the pump action of the mounted gun. The arcade cabinet features foot pedals (visible in picture) that, when pressed, reverse the player's direction. This is an essential feature, as it allows the player more time to fire upon an incoming enemy and to also help keep the number of enemies at a more manageable level and thereby keep from being overwhelmed. It also adds an element of strategy to the game, as over-use of the [...] "backpedal" [...] <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of running out of time on the level.|$|E
