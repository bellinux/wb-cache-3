25|$|In 2003, both {{countries}} discussed doubling their investment in their ongoing {{science and technology}} collaboration to $1 million each, starting in October 2004. In 2005, India and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding {{to set up a}} fund to encourage bilateral investment into industrial research and development and specific projects. Under the agreement, at least one Indian and one Israeli company must be collaborating on a project for that project to qualify for the fund. From 2006 to 2014, the fund, named i4RD, has been used in seven projects.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the moral force of exploitation in developing world <b>research</b> <b>agreements.</b> Taking {{for granted that}} some clinical research which is conducted {{in the developing world}} but funded by developed world sponsors is exploitative, it asks whether a third party would be morally justified in enforcing limits on <b>research</b> <b>agreements</b> in order to ensure more fair and less exploitative outcomes. This question is particularly relevant when such exploitative transactions are entered into voluntarily by all relevant parties, and both research sponsors and host communities benefit from the resulting agreements. I show that defenders of the claim that exploitation ought to be permitted rely on a mischaracterization of certain forms of interference as unjustly paternalistic and two dubious empirical assumptions about the results of regulation. The view I put forward is that by evaluating a system of constraints on international <b>research</b> <b>agreements,</b> rather than individual transaction-level interference, we can better assess the alternatives to permitting exploitative <b>research</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R

40|$|We analyze how {{contract}}ibility affects contract design. A {{major concern}} when designing <b>research</b> <b>agreements</b> is that researchers may use their funding to subsidize other projects. We show that, when research activities are not contractible, an option contract is optimal. The financing firm obtains {{the option to}} terminate the agreement and, in case of termination, broad property rights. The threat of termination deters researchers from cross-subsidization, {{and the cost of}} exercising the termination option deters the financing firm from opportunistic termination. We test this prediction using 580 biotechnology <b>research</b> <b>agreements.</b> Contracts with termination options are more common when research is non-contractible...|$|R
2500|$|Controversy arose {{over the}} drug [...] "Celebrex". Brigham Young University (BYU) {{said that a}} {{professor}} of chemistry, Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, discovered an enzyme in the 1990s that would later lead towards the development of Celebrex. BYU was originally seeking 15% royalty on sales, which would equate to $9.7 billion. The court filings show that a <b>research</b> <b>agreement</b> was made with Monsanto, whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin. The enzyme that Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems, which Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A battle ensued, lasting over six years, because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while Pfizer claims it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. This culminated in a $450 million amicable settlement without going to trial. Pfizer {{said it would take}} a $450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle.|$|E

40|$|Background. Research in {{northern}} Canada focused on Aboriginal peoples has historically benefited academia with little {{consideration for the}} people being researched or their traditional knowledge (TK). Although this attitude is changing, the complexity of TK {{makes it difficult to}} develop mechanisms to preserve and protect it. Protecting TK becomes even more important when outside groups become interested in using TK or materials with associated TK. In the latter category are genetic resources, which may have commercial value and are the focus of this article. Objective. This article addresses access to and use of genetic resources and associated TK {{in the context of the}} historical power-imbalances in research relationships in Canadian north. Design. Review. Results. Research involving genetic resources and TK is becoming increasingly relevant {{in northern}} Canada. The legal framework related to genetic resources and the cultural shift of universities towards commercial goals in research influence the environment for negotiating <b>research</b> <b>agreements.</b> Current guidelines for <b>research</b> <b>agreements</b> do not offer appropriate guidelines to achieve mutual benefit, reflect unequal bargaining power or take the relationship between parties into account. Conclusions. Relational contract theory may be a useful framework to address the social, cultural and legal hurdles inherent in creating <b>research</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{bioscience}} firms {{collaborate with}} public research universities to conduct innovative research through sponsored <b>research</b> <b>agreements.</b> Companies sponsoring this research usually require strict confidentiality from their academic partners {{in order to}} protect sensitive information that, if revealed, could put them at a competitive disadvantage and threaten their ability to obtain future patents. Yet, ambiguous disclosure requirements in the California Public Records Act preclude California 2 ̆ 7 s public research universities from guaranteeing that proprietary information provided in connection with sponsored <b>research</b> <b>agreements</b> will remain confidential. Entering into such agreements with public universities in California is therefore a risky proposition for the sponsors.
