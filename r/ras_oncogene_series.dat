Identifying the nature of such genetic mutations in thyroid neoplasms and their prevalence in the various tumor phenotypes is critical to the understanding of their pathogenesis. Mutational activation of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> has been associated with human thyroid neoplasia. We examined the expression of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> in benign hyperplastic or inflamatory lesions of the goiter, as well as in benign and malignant thyroid tumors.

BRCA 1 fits the model of a classic tumor suppressor gene, a hypothesis supported by recent work demonstrating that expression of BRCAi inhibits growth of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. The present {{study was designed to}} test the potential of BRCAi to reverse the transforming activity of the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene.</b> The v-Ha <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> was cloned downstream of the retrovirus LTR and stably expressed in Rat- 1 cells (Rat- 1 /ras). Rat- 1 /ras (R/R) cells were fully transformed as indicated by change in morphology, colony formation in soft-agarose and tumor induction in nude mice. BRCAi was stably expressed in R/R cells under the CMV promoter (R/R-BRCA 1). The expression of ras and BRCAi was confirmed by Western blot using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to ras and BRCA 1, respectively. R/R-BRCA 1 cells grew slower than the negative control, which was R/R cells transfected with vector alone (R/R-pCEP 4). R/R-BRCA 1 cells generated ~ 5 to 10 times less colonies in a soft-agarose assay compared to the negative control. When injected into nude mice, R/RBRCA 1 cells exhibited a delayed onset of tumorigenesis and generated smaller tumors compared to R/R or R/RpCEP 4 cells. These data strongly suggest that BRCA 1 partially reverses the transforming activity of the v-Ha <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> indicating that BRCA 1 can bypass the effects of the v-Ha <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> on cell growth. BRCA 1, therefore, may be used in therapy of tumors arising due to activation of v-Ha <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} the possible role of ras proteins in the secretory process, we have microinjected the proto oncogenic and oncogenic {{forms of the}} human H-ras protein into rat peritoneal mast cells. Mast cells are secretory cells which, upon appropriate stimulus, liberate histamine and other mediators of the acute inflammatory reaction by exocytotic degranulation. We report here that microinjection of the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> protein into mast cells induces exocytotic degranulation. In contrast, microinjection of similar amounts of the proto-oncogenic protein has little apparent effect on mast cells. Degranulation induced by injection of the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> protein occurs {{in the absence of}} an external stimulus and requires the presence of external calcium. The ultrastructural features of exocytotic degranulation in mast cells injected with the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> protein are similar to those seen when mast cells are activated by soluble ligands.

40|$|Abstract Background The Ras {{superfamily}} {{plays an}} important role in the control of cell signalling and division. Mutations in the Ras genes convert them into active <b>oncogenes.</b> The <b>Ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> form a major thrust of global cancer research as they are involved in the development and progression of tumors. This has resulted in the exponential growth of data on Ras superfamily across different public databases and in literature. However, no dedicated public resource is currently available for data mining and analysis on this family. The present database was developed to facilitate straightforward accession, retrieval and analysis of information available on <b>Ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> from one particular site. Description We have developed the RAS Oncogene Database (RASOnD) as a comprehensive knowledgebase that provides integrated and curated information on a single platform for <b>oncogenes</b> of <b>Ras</b> superfamily. RASOnD encompasses exhaustive genomics and proteomics data existing across diverse publicly accessible databases. This resource presently includes overall 199, 046 entries from 101 different species. It provides a search tool to generate information about their nucleotide and amino acid sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms, chromosome positions, orthologies, motifs, structures, related pathways and associated diseases. We have implemented a number of user-friendly search interfaces and sequence analysis tools. At present the user can (i) browse the data (ii) search any field through a simple or advance search interface and (iii) perform a BLAST search and subsequently CLUSTALW multiple sequence alignment by selecting sequences of <b>Ras</b> <b>oncogenes.</b> The Generic gene browser, GBrowse, JMOL for structural visualization and TREEVIEW for phylograms have been integrated for clear perception of retrieved data. External links to related databases have been included in RASOnD. Conclusions This database is a resource and search tool dedicated to <b>Ras</b> <b>oncogenes.</b> It has utility to cancer biologists and cell molecular biologists as it is a ready source for research, identification and elucidation of the role of these oncogenes. The data generated can be used for understanding the relationship between the <b>Ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> and their association with cancer.

40|$|Transplacental {{exposure}} of rats {{to a single}} dose of the direct acting carcinogen methylnitrosourea (MNU) results in the induction {{of a variety of}} neoplasias of neuroectodermal, epithelial, and mesenchymal origin. Molecular analysis of the oncogenes present in these tumors revealed a striking degree of tissue specificity. neu oncogenes were found to be reproducibly activated in tumors derived from the peripheral nervous system (PNS), but not in those arising from the central nervous system (CNS). No <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> were found in either PNS- or CNS-derived tumors. However, Ha-ras oncogenes were detected in each of three mammary carcinomas and Ki-ras oncogenes were present in each of five kidney mesenchymal tumors. These results illustrate that phenotypic expression of activated oncogenes in vivo is not a random process and suggest that normal developmental programs may {{play an important role in}} modulating the activation of specific oncogenes by chemical carcinogens. PCR analysis revealed that each of the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> detected in these transplacentally induced tumors became activated by the same G [...] A transition in the second base of codon 12. Since G [...] A transitions are the preferred mutations induced by MNU, it is likely that these <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> may have been directly targeted by MNU during embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{experiments}} have brought into question which {{amino acid sequence}} of the p 53 oncogene product should be considered wild type and whether the normal protein is capable of cooperating with the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> to transform cells in culture. To address these questions, a series of p 53 cDNA-genomic hybrid clones have been compared for the ability {{to cooperate with the}} <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> in transformation assays. From these experiments, it has become clear that the amino acid alanine at position 135, in either the genomic clone or the cDNA clone, failed to produce a p 53 protein that cooperated with the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> and transformed cells. Replacing alanine with valine at this position in either the genomic or the cDNA clone activated for transformation in this assay. Using restriction enzyme polymorphisms in the p 53 gene, it was shown that normal mouse DNA encodes alanine at position 135 in the p 53 protein. Thus, mutation is required to activate the p 53 protein for cooperation with the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene.</b> After cotransfection with the activated ras gene, the genomic p 53 DNA clone always produced more transformed cell foci (1. 7 -fold) than similar cDNA clones and these foci were more readily cloned (3. 6 -fold) into permanent cell lines. A series of deletion mutants of the genomic p 53 clone were employed to show that the presence of intron 4 in the p 53 gene was sufficient to provide much enhanced clonability of transformed foci from culture dishes. The presence of introns in the p 53 gene constructions also resulted in elevated levels of p 53 protein in the p 53 -plus-ras-transformed cell lines. Thus, qualitative changes in the p 53 protein are required to activate p 53 for transformation with the <b>oncogene</b> <b>ras.</b> Quantitative improvements of transformation frequencies are associated with the higher expression levels of altered p 53 protein that are provided by having one of the p 53 introns in the transforming plasmid...|$|R

About 25 % of the Tg-N-ras carcinomas displayed large, poorly differentiated areas, featuring vascular invasion and forming lung, bone or liver distant metastases. N-ras(Gln 61 Lys) expression in cultured PC Cl 3 thyrocytes induced thyroid-stimulating hormone-independent proliferation and genomic instability with micronuclei formation and centrosome amplification.

40|$|An {{important}} {{phenomenon in}} tumor immunology {{that has come}} under recent attention {{is the impact of}} oncogene activation in tumor cells on the sensitivity to lysis by immune effector cells. Several studies suggested that transfer of an activated <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> into cultured rodent fibroblasts induces susceptibility to natural killer cell (NK) -mediated lysis. Experiments using human tumor cells, however, have produced conflicting data on the effect of ras activation in this respect. In studying the activation of the oncogene c-myc, which is often overexpressed in human melanoma, we have found that in cell lines expressing high levels of Myc protein, the sensitivity to lysis by NK cells was dramatically increased due to reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen B locus products. Since the N-ras oncogene was found to be activated in 15 % of human melanomas, we examined the possibility that in melanoma, in analogy to the murine systems, the mutated <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> may influence NK susceptibility of human melanoma cells. Two N-ras genes harboring frequently found mutations were cloned into an expression vector. Transfection of the IGR 39 D melanoma cell line with wildtype and mutant N-ras constructs yielded several ras-expressing clones that were tested for NK sensitivity. Neither high expression of the wildtype N-ras protein, nor expression of two mutant proteins (N 61 -arg, N 61 -lys) was shown to result in enhanced NK-mediated lysis.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of ras (H-, K-, and N-ras) and c-myc oncogenes {{was investigated in}} multiple myeloma (MM). By means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) /oligonucleotide hybridization method, DNA from 56 tumor biopsies was analyzed {{for the presence of}} activating mutations involving codons 12 and 61 of the H-, K-, and N-ras genes and codon 13 of the N-ras gene. Mutations, involving the N- or K-ras genes, were detected in 18 of 56 (32 %) cases of which 12 / 43 (27 %) were at diagnosis and 6 / 13 (46 %) were after treatment. In some cases, multiple mutations affecting different ras alleles were detected. Direct nucleotide sequence analysis of PCR products indicated that a more heterogeneous nature of the base pair changes than previously shown for other tumors along with a preferential involvement of N-ras codon 61. The heterogeneity of MM cases with respect to the presence of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> prompted an analysis of possible correlations with different clinico- pathologic characteristics of MM from which a correlation between the presence of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> and a partial or complete lack of response to therapy emerged. The {{frequency of}} activating rearrangements or mutations of the c-myc gene were studied by Southern blot analysis and PCR sequencing, respectively. However, contrary to previous reports involving mostly MM cell lines, no structural alterations of the c-myc gene were found. These results indicate that ras, but not c-myc, oncogenes are activated in vivo in MM cells, representing the first oncogene alteration that has been associated at appreciable frequency with this type of malignancy. While the mechanism of occurrence and biological role of ras activation in MM remains to be elucidated, the preliminary correlations observed in this study between the presence of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> and poor therapeutic response suggest that further investigations of the possible prognostic significance of these alterations are necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} for transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) by transfected <b>ras</b> and myc <b>oncogenes</b> were explored. Under conditions of dense monolayer culture, neither oncogene {{was able to}} transform REFs on its own. However, {{the introduction of a}} <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> together with a selectable neomycin resistance marker into REFs allowed killing of the normal nontransfected cells and the outgrowth of colonies of ras transformants, 10 % of which survived crisis and became tumorigenic. These cells expressed greater than 10 -fold-higher levels of ras p 21 than tumorigenic cells cotransfected with <b>ras</b> and myc <b>oncogenes.</b> The myc oncogene similarly was unable to induce tumorigenic conversion of REFs unless especially refractile colonies of oncogene-bearing cells, produced by use of a cotransfected selectable marker, were picked and subcultured. Tumorigenic conversion of REFs by single transfected oncogenes appears to require special culture conditions and high levels of gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Study of {{expression}} of ras-related oncogenes in human premalignant polyps and malignant tumours of the colorectum, {{as well as}} in normal colorectal mucosa, shows a significant elevation in the premalignant and malignant tissues as compared to their respective colorectal mucosa. These results suggest that activation of the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> family occurs in the development of colorectal tumours and that elevated expression at a premalignant stage may well be critical in the process of carcinogenesis but not in itself sufficient...|$|R
