Following the season, he sought advice from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, but decided that he needed a second evaluation from them as the field of declared underclassmen became more clear with the thinking that [...] "I don't think it <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> sense to (leave school) early and get drafted in the second round". On April 21, LeVert announced that he would return for his senior season. According to CBSSports.com's Sam Vecenie, this would give LeVert a chance to improve his pick and roll decision making, his midrange offensive game and his defense, especially against screens.|$|E

500|$|The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter {{explores the}} {{references}} to history, legends, and literature in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. David Colbert, {{the author of the}} book, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the Harry Potter novels [...] "are [...] literary treasure hunts for [...] readers. What seem like funny-sounding names and places and excursions into fantasy all have a basis in either history, myth or legend." [...] He added, however, that he thinks Rowling has been able to turn these elements into her own, and concluded: [...] "A couple of times, every generation, some writer gets it exactly right and <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> it their own, and J.K.

500|$|A {{group of}} editors writing for People also praised the record's [...] "fresh and original" [...] melodies and [...] "quick-tempoed cool", adding, [...] "Kudos to Green Day, young punk's reigning purists, for {{sticking}} {{with what they}} know best." [...] Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "mature songwriting that <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> this album tick", noting that [...] "Naturally, a couple of thrash 'n' bash hard-core paeans are included, but they're surrounded by songs that are surprisingly varied in character and grounded in a pop aesthetic that evokes a gaggle of great tunesmiths." [...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If Green Day still has a loyal following, its fans are bound {{to find something to}} like on Nimrod; for all the attempts at diversity, the record is packed with mile-wide hooks and sing-along anthems." ...|$|E
500|$|Eleven {{days after}} Orsini's {{assassination}} attempt in France, Victoria's eldest daughter married Prince Frederick William of Prussia in London. They had been betrothed since September 1855, when Princess Victoria was 14 years old; {{the marriage was}} delayed by the Queen and Prince Albert until the bride was 17. The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging Prussian state. Victoria felt [...] "sick at heart" [...] to see her daughter leave England for Germany; [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> me shudder", she wrote to Princess Victoria {{in one of her}} frequent letters, [...] "when I look round to all your sweet, happy, unconscious sisters, and think I must give them up too – one by one." [...] Almost exactly a year later, Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen's first grandchild, Wilhelm, who would become the last German Kaiser.|$|E

500|$|Several game modes in Backbreaker {{can also}} be played as local or online multi-player over the Internet. In Exhibition mode, a second player can join the game and can play either against or with the first player. Two players may also compete against one another in Tackle Alley for the most points. Games against other players are played in splitscreen format {{as opposed to the}} usual single-camera view of other {{football}} game series. This is due to Backbreakers [...] "on the field" [...] camera angle, set close to the players, making it difficult for a single-camera two-player setup. Although this setup differs from most modern football games, the developers believe it would add realism to the player's experience. [...] "One of the benefits of having this down-on-the-field camera view is that it <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> playing as the quarterback like the passing mechanic feel really natural," [...] said producer Rob Donald.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B". Despite the moderate praise, however, Morgan {{did make a}} jest at the portrayal of the subway in the show, noting {{that it was not}} realistic; she wrote that the set was the [...] "cleanest, emptiest subway station in world [...] No urine. No trash. It's nicer than my apartment, really." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen gave the episode a mixed review and rated it two-and-a-half stars out of five. Despite writing that [...] "on paper [...] the right episode at the right time", the two criticized the episode, noting that [...] "the teaser never <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> sense in light of the relations offered, the appearance of the mute boy is a messy contrivance, and the ending is too abrupt." ...|$|E
500|$|Complex {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, writing {{that it was}} overshadowed by [...] "Leave It to Beaver", {{but that it was}} also a good episode by itself as well. [...] " [...] all comes to a head in the penultimate episode, which puts Veronica on the emotional rollercoaster until she gets to the uncomfortable truth." [...] The magazine also praised the reappearances of guest stars: [...] "what <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> the episode special is the way it trots out every supporting player and case-of-the-week guest star." [...] IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, saying that [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist'" [...] is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different people remember the same situation. The fact that Veronica has to threaten people who were at the party into telling her the truth is frakking painful. It's made even more sad when you realize that the version she believed to be the truth actually wasn't." ...|$|E

[...] The review called “How the Ghosts Stole Christmas,” [...] "an extremely creative, arguably bitter Holiday treat, perfect for [...] with its blend of horror, comedy and hints of romance." [...] Static Mass writer Patrick Samuel awarded the episode five stars and said, [...] "As [...] gleefully unwrap their presents at the end, this episode is something that <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> my own Christmases feel that little bit more complete." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson, {{in a review of}} [...] "Monday," [...] said, [...] "Season six included some more excellent episodes [...] classic comedy episodes including, [...] "How The Ghosts Stole Christmas."

500|$|Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. James Bernard of Entertainment Weekly preferred the album's Southern hip hop over [...] "Arrested Development's suspiciously peppy, idealized version of down-home" [...] and stated, [...] "it's about time someone told today's weed-obsessed youth to 'get up, {{get out and}} get something/Don't spend all your time trying to get high.'" [...] Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times cited [...] "Git Up, Git Out" [...] as the album's highlight and commended the duo's [...] "sauntering, hard-core tales of the 'hood", writing that they [...] "bristle with clever humor and sharp insights rather than rage." [...] Rob Marriott of The Source complimented the duo's [...] "organic" [...] P-Funk influence and praised their lyrics' honesty, commenting that [...] "while their rhyme style may swing {{a little too close}} to Hiero for my comfort, what <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> this album so listenable is that... truthfulness reigns." [...] However, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] rating in his consumer guide for The Village Voice.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

[...] "More than a Woman" [...] was replaced by George Harrison's [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] which is the only time in the UK singles chart's history where a dead artist has replaced another dead artist at number one. In July 2001, she allowed MTV's show Diary behind-the-scenes access to her life and stated [...] "I am truly blessed to wake up every morning to do something that I love; there is nothing better than that."

500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} general acclaim from critics and fans, and in 2010 {{it became the}} most-viewed video in YouTube history, up to that point. Tim Stack from Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "amazing" [...] and added, [...] "I don't think Gaga has ever looked prettier than in the close-ups where she's more stripped down." [...] Jennifer Cady of E! was also impressed by the video and commented, [...] "This music video <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> us appreciate everything Gaga actually brings to pop music. She's exciting to watch, plain and simple. ... We need someone like Gaga to really bring it. To put actual thought and care into her product so that it feels alive". Issie Lapowsky of New York Daily News thought Gaga laid the [...] "theatrics on thick" [...] in the video but complimented her for wearing minimal makeup, calling it [...] "refreshingly normal". Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times said that the video brought back his faith in performance art, and that [...] "Gaga brings enough [...] on her own, thank you very much." [...] He also thought the set for the video [...] "worthy of a feature-length film".

500|$|Nixon infused {{elements}} of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. [...] "There's a gothic quality to it", she said, {{referring to the}} couple. [...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write." ...|$|E

The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for 1984 were {{generally}} favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+. He explained that [...] "Side one is pure up, {{and not only}} that, it sticks to the ears" [...] and that [...] "Van Halen's pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops." [...] He also called side two [...] "consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'." [...] J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 {{four out of five}} stars. He called it [...] "the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus." [...] He stated that [...] ""Jump" [...] is not exactly the kind of song you'd expect from Van Halen", but that [...] "once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start sounding a little more familiar". Although he mentioned [...] "Jump" [...] as having [...] "suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia", he went on to state that [...] "Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined." [...] He concluded that [...] "what <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself" [...] and that [...] "despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock & roll. Believe me, that's no newspeak." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought that [...] "the out-takes [...] up to standard" [...] {{and said that the}} episode {{contains}} [...] "a number of great self-referential moments". Simone Knox praised its visual style in her article Reading the Ungraspable Double-Codedness of [...] "The Simpsons". The episode itself has been described by some critics as a kind of self-imposed benchmark of the show itself, with writer Bill Keveney commenting, [...] "the show picks its own benchmarks, as it did in 1995". Knox referred to it as not simply a clip show, but a clip show [...] "that looks at the series with a sense of hyper-self-consciousness about its own textuality". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said even though the episode is a clip show, it [...] "gussies up the concept with some interesting elements, and keeps repetitive material to a minimum. Instead, it offers lots of then-unseen footage as well as old snippets from The Tracey Ullman Show. It still feels like a cheap way to crank out a new episode, but it’s one of the better clip shows you’ll see." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+ grade and commented, [...] "apart from the creative material, what <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> this [...] shine is the hilarious hosting by Troy McClure." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times criticized the episode: [...] "Despite some interesting concepts such as a bored Troy McClure presenting to much amusement and the presence of deleted scenes and Tracey Ullman shorts amongst the clips, this is an episode that tries hard to find a hook but never quite manages, assuring it'll never make it into regular rotation on this viewer's watch." ...|$|E
