5|$|Nirjarā is {{possible}} through tapas, austerities and penances. Tapas {{can be either}} external or internal. Six forms of external tapas are—fasting, control of appetite, accepting food under certain conditions, <b>renunciation</b> of delicious food, sitting and sleeping in lonely place and <b>renunciation</b> of comforts. Six forms of internal tapas are—atonement, reverence, rendering of service to worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation.|$|E

50|$|To {{oppose the}} {{treaties}} themselves (with the <b>renunciations</b> {{contained in the}} appendix) with the body of fundamental laws of France and Spain is putting them {{on the same level}} as internal constitutional acts, even if France did not yet have a constitution at the time, and bilateral treaties acting on a foreign policy. And indeed, the legal act of application of <b>renunciations</b> in France as in Spain has been in the recording of such <b>renunciations.</b> The Parliament of Paris, that is to say the jurists, recorded such <b>renunciations,</b> and so did the parliaments of the French provinces. For their part, the Spanish Cortes made the same records, giving legal force to such <b>renunciations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, {{saw this}} {{constant}} {{allusion to the}} theatre as an indication that Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's <b>renunciation</b> of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} child <b>renunciations</b> factors, {{investigating}} the answers of nearly 1000 employees to a 2003 IPSOS-Chronopost survey. Numerous variables {{are taken into}} account simultaneously, evaluating their ¿caeteris paribus¿ influence through logistic models estimations. In a nutshell, people who frequently declare child <b>renunciations</b> or delayed conception moments because of working-life organisation, or feel children as a brake for career would be young people, women, without children. The higher the professional class, the more employees declare being concerned with these difficulties. Nevertheless, a finance constraint seems to hold : the higher their income, the less employees declare child <b>renunciations.</b> A better working-schedules visibility and a chosen working-time would moderate these difficulties. Parents declaring « <b>renunciations</b> » would more often face bad-adaptations of holiday-school rhythms with their life. JEL Codes : D 10, J 13, J 22. ...|$|R

At the same time, Brătianu kept a tight relationship with King Ferdinand.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja {{even though he had}} taken the vows of <b>renunciation</b> of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E

2500|$|These <b>renunciations</b> of American {{citizenship}} {{have been}} highly controversial, {{for a number}} of reasons. Some apologists for internment have cited the <b>renunciations</b> as evidence that [...] "disloyalty" [...] or anti-Americanism was well represented among the interned peoples, thereby justifying the internment.

5|$|There are {{two main}} themes running through the {{different}} discourses. One is the traditional theme of the early hesychasts and mystical theologians of the Christian East, especially the practices of faith (praxis) and asceticism (askesis) that they frequently taught as the way to reach direct experience of God (theoria). Specific practices discussed by Symeon include: repentance, detachment, <b>renunciation,</b> mercy, sorrow for sins, faith, and contemplation.|$|E
5|$|After <b>renunciation,</b> Tulsidas {{spent most}} of his time at Varanasi, Prayag, Ayodhya, and Chitrakuta but visited many other nearby and far-off places. He {{travelled}} across India to many places, studying different people, meeting saints and Sadhus and meditating. The Mula Gosain Charita gives an account of his travels to the four pilgrimages of Hindus (Badrinath, Dwarka, Puri and Rameshwaram) and the Himalayas. He visited the Manasarovar lake in current-day Tibet, where tradition holds he had Darshan (sight) of , the crow who is one of the four narrators in the Ramcharitmanas.|$|E
5|$|During the war it {{had become}} clear that private {{patronage}} {{was no longer a}} practical means of sustaining Britain's musical life; a state body, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts – the forerunner of the Arts Council – was established, and given a modest budget for public subsidy. The council made it a condition of sponsoring the LSO that the profit-sharing principle should be abandoned and the players made salaried employees. This <b>renunciation</b> of the principles for which the LSO had been founded was rejected by the players, and the offered subsidy was declined.|$|E

5|$|In the Vedic-era literature, {{only three}} ashramas (life stages) were mentioned, with Brahmacharya (student) {{as the first}} stage and the Grihastha (householder) as the second stage. The third stage of life, in the Vedic texts, {{combined}} Vanaprastha (retired or forest dweller) and Sannyasa (<b>renunciation)</b> as one ashrama. According to Soti Shivendra Chandra, a scholar at the Rohilkhand University, the separation of Vanaprastha and Sannyasa as two different stages of life is first mentioned in the Jabala Upanishad. However, Patrick Olivelle, {{a professor at the}} University of Texas at Austin, states that the Sannyasa ashrama as a separate stage is mentioned in Aruni Upanishad, which likely is a more ancient Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the {{north-western}} regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that {{were known as}} the mahajanapadas. The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling {{the life of the}} Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up <b>renunciation</b> as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire. The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's <b>renunciation</b> of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.|$|E
5|$|News of the Qurayzah's {{supposed}} <b>renunciation</b> of {{the pact}} with Muhammad leaked out, and Umar promptly informed Muhammad. Such suspicions were {{reinforced by the}} movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza. Muhammad became anxious about their conduct, and realised the grave potential danger the Qurayza posed. Because of his pact with the Qurayza, he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along the Muslims' border with the tribe. The Qurayza also possessed weaponry: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armour, and 500 shields.|$|E

5|$|Other critics view Motörhead as {{the first}} {{significant}} exponent of the movement and the first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal. Their fast music, the <b>renunciation</b> of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness, and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans. Motörhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour, and they also shared the stage with Lemmy's friends punk band The Damned. Motörhead's musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.|$|E
5|$|Some {{practitioners}} of Falun Gong {{both inside and}} outside China are also involved in the promotion of the Tuidang movement, a dissident phenomenon catalyzed by an editorial series in The Epoch Times in late 2004. The movement encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, including ex post facto renunciations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. Practitioners of Falun Gong outside China make phone calls or faxes to mainland China to inform citizens of the movement and solicit <b>renunciation</b> statements.|$|E
