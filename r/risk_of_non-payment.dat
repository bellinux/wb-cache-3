40|$|In {{the early}} stock market in London there were {{substantial}} <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-payment</b> and fraud. (Mortimer, 1801) According to Hobbesian theory, {{we would expect}} stock markets to develop only after government has implemented rules and regulations to eliminate these problems. The historical account, however, provides evidence that solutions to these problems {{did not come from}} the state. This article outlines the emergence of the London Stock Exchange, which was created by eighteenth century brokers who transformed coffeehouses into private clubs that created and enforced rules. Rather than relying on public regulation to enforce contracts and reduce fraud, brokers consciously found a way to solve their dilemmas by forming a self-policing club. ...|$|R

5000|$|Trade credit insurance, {{business}} credit insurance, {{export credit}} insurance, or credit insurance is {{an insurance policy}} and a risk management product offered by private insurance companies and governmental export credit agencies to business entities wishing to protect their accounts receivable from loss due to credit risks such as protracted default, insolvency or bankruptcy.

50|$|This {{points to}} the major role trade credit {{insurance}} plays in facilitating international trade. Trade credit is offered by vendors to their customers {{as an alternative to}} prepayment or cash on delivery terms, providing time for the customer to generate income from sales to pay for the product or service. This requires the vendor to assume non-payment risk. In a local or domestic situation as well as in an export transaction, the risk increases when laws, customs communications and customer's reputation are not fully understood. In addition to increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-payment,</b> international trade presents the problem of the time between product shipment and its availability for sale. The account receivable is like a loan and represents capital invested, and often borrowed, by the vendor. But this is not a secure asset until it is paid. If the customer's debt is credit insured the large, risky asset becomes more secure, like an insured building. This asset may then be viewed as collateral by lending institutions and a loan based upon it used to defray the expenses of the transaction and to produce more product. Trade credit insurance is, therefore, a trade finance tool.|$|E
30|$|We model {{an urban}} labour market in a {{developing}} economy, incorporating workers’ risk attitudes. Trade-offs between risk aversion and ability determine worker allocation across {{formal and informal}} wage employment, and voluntary and involuntary self employment. Greater <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> informal wage <b>non-payment</b> can raise or lower informal wage employment, depending on the source <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> Informal wage employment can be reduced by increasing detection efforts or by strengthening contract enforcement for informal wage payment. As the average ability of workers rises, informal wage employment first rises, then falls. Greater demand for formal production may lead to more involuntary self employment.|$|R
40|$|For two reasons, the {{conventional}} wisdom is that the poor are not heavy users of the insolvency system. First, creditors are reluctant to extend credit to the poor because the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-payment</b> are high. Not having been able to borrow, the poor are not over-indebted and are therefore not in need of bankruptcy protection. Second, some poor debtors - lone parents on social assistance for example - are judgment-proof meaning that judgments for money recoveries obtained by their creditors are of no effect because these debtors do not have sufficient non-exempt property or income to satisfy the judgment. Developments in two areas may challenge {{the conventional}} view. Undoubtedly, credit is now widely available across the spectrum of income groups. Even a short-term, low-wage job can bring a credit card to the doorstep of the poor and the slogan no credit, no problem testifies to the availability of retail credit. In addition, we now know that poverty is often a temporary state for many Canadians, with many moving in and out of low-income. Accordingly, the judgment-proof state is not a permanent condition, but a temporary status for many. While this may be welcome news in some respects, it means that debts can be accumulated during periods of relative economic well-being only to go unpaid when a job ends or when hard times return. These developments suggest the possibility that some of those who are poor at any point in time are in fact in need of bankruptcy protection. They have debts that they are unable to pay and little likelihood of being able to repay in the near future. We begin the paper by presenting evidence from the 1999 Survey of Financial Security on indebtedness among families in the lower income deciles. We then turn to the main question: should the Canadian bankruptcy process be more readily available to poor debtors. We draw on two sources to shed light on this question: a) a comparative analysis (considering England and Wales, the United States, Australia and New Zealand) and b) a series of semi-structured interviews with Canadian bankruptcy trustees and other insolvency professionals...|$|R

50|$|Sometime between 1908 and 1910, Samuel Skaggs {{brought his}} family from Missouri to Idaho. As a {{minister}} {{of a small group}} in a very small frontier town, American Falls, Idaho, he needed additional support for his large family. So, he decided to open a grocery store, but to favorably compete with the few that were already operating, he decided to change their business model from one of credit accounts, which were tailored to the sporadic and seasonal income of farmers, to a cash-only basis. Attracting customers to this simpler arrangement would make sense only if he could sell for much less than his competitors. While the margin would be lower, he would nevertheless avoid the substantial <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-payment</b> of accounts. To drive down the wholesale price of the groceries he needed, he would buy them in larger lots than his competitors. In those days large lots were defined by some fraction of a railroad carload and because American Falls was a stop on the Union Pacific Railroad, this afforded Sam Skaggs an opportunity to buy and sell for less. Perhaps more important to his expansion-oriented sons than to Sam, the savings of large-lot buying would only increase as more stores came on line.|$|E

To investigate {{the nature of}} the relationship between formal {{and informal}} institutions, we analyze bilateral trade patterns in a sample of 16 European countries between 1996 - 2009. Our results show that trust and rule of law are substitutes, as the positive effect of trust on trade is conditional on the quality of the rule of law. When the rule of law of the importing country increases relative to that of the exporter, the effect of trust on trade decreases. The decline in the effect of trust on trade is less for importers than for exporters, a result that can be attributed to the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-payment</b> that exporters run.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{empirical}} quantification of basis {{risk in the}} context of index-linked hedging strategies. Basis risk refers to the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-payment</b> of the index-linked instrument, given that the hedger’s loss exceeds some critical level. The quantification of such risk measures from empirical data can be done in various ways and requires special consideration of the dependence structure between the index and the company’s losses as well as the estimation of the tails of a distribution. In this context, previous literature shows that extreme value theory can be superior to traditional methods with respect to estimating quantile risk measures such as the value at risk. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} conduct an empirical analysis of basis risk using multivariate extreme value theory and extreme value copulas to estimate the underlying risk processes and their dependence structure in order to obtain a more adequate picture of basis risk associated with index-linked hedging strategies. Our results emphasize that the application of extreme value theory leads to better fits of the tails of the marginal distributions in the considered stock price sample and that traditional methods in regard to estimating marginal distributions tend to overestimate basis risk, while basis risk can in contrast be higher when taking into account extreme value copulas...|$|E

When it comes to the market of bonds, then it can be emphasized that a key limiting factor for its development is the non existence of a wide range of bonds. Except the government bonds, in the Republic of Macedonia there are also corporate bonds that are classified according to the type of issuer of bonds i. e. public enterprises, transport and industrial enterprises, bonds of banks, etc. This type of bonds contain a real <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-payment,</b> and they are not issued without pledge-collateral. Regarding the level of liquidity, they are with less liquidity than the government bonds, but on the other hand they offer significantly higher rates of return than long-term government, municipal and agency bonds.

40|$|Background. Pay for {{performance}} (P 4 P) incentive schemes are increasingly used world-wide to improve health system performance but results of evaluations vary considerably. A systematic {{analysis of this}} variation in the effects of P 4 P schemes is needed. Methods. Evaluations of P 4 P schemes from any country were identified by searching for and updating systematic reviews of P 4 P schemes in health care in four bibliographic databases. Outcomes using different measures of effect were converted into standardised effect sizes and each study was categorised {{as to whether or}} not it found a positive effect. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression and multilevel logistic regression were used to investigate factors explaining heterogeneity. Random-effects models were used because they take into account heterogeneity likely to be due to differences between studies rather than just chance. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the effect of different assumptions. Findings. 96 primary studies were identified; 37 were included in the meta-analysis and meta-regression and all 96 in the logistic regression. The proportion of observed variation in study results that can be explained by true heterogeneity (I 2) was 99. 9 %. Estimates of effect of P 4 P schemes were lower in evaluations using randomised controlled trials (SMD= 0 ∙ 08; 95 % CI: 0 ∙ 01 to 0 ∙ 15) compared to no controls (0 ∙ 15; 95 %CI: 0 ∙ 09 to 0 ∙ 21), and lower for those measuring outcomes (e. g. smoking cessation) (SMD= 0 ∙ 0; 95 %CI: - 0 ∙ 01 to 0 ∙ 01) compared to process measures (e. g. giving cessation advice) (0 ∙ 18; 95 %CI: 0 ∙ 06 to 0 ∙ 31). Adjusting for other design features and the evaluation method, the odds of showing a positive effect was three times higher for schemes with larger incentives (> 5 % of salary/usual budget) (OR = 3 ∙ 38; 95 %CI: 1 ∙ 07 to 10 ∙ 64). There were non-statistically significant increases in the odds of success if the incentive is paid to individuals (as opposed to groups) (OR= 2 ∙ 0; 95 %CI: 0 ∙ 62 to 6 ∙ 56) and if there is a lower perceived risk of not earning the incentive (OR= 2 ∙ 9; 95 %CI: 0 ∙ 78 to 10 ∙ 83). Schemes evaluated using less rigorous designs were 24 times more likely to have positive estimates of effect than those using randomised controlled trials (OR = 24; 95 %CI: 6 ∙ 3 to 92 ∙ 8). Interpretation. Estimates of the effectiveness of incentive schemes on health outcomes are probably inflated due to poorly designed evaluations and a focus on process measures rather than health outcomes. Larger incentives and reducing the perceived <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-payment</b> may increase the effect of these schemes on provider behaviour...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has three}} objectives: first, {{to examine the}} law {{relating}} to loss allocation resulting from fraud with consumer payment instruments and determine whether this allocation is efficient; second, to determine whether any right to stop or reverse payment associated with the payment instrument is efficient; and third, to suggest changes and reforms to achieve efficiency in these two areas. The basic test to determine efficiency of allocation of fraud loss {{to be used in}} the thesis involves looking at the following questions: which party in the transaction or system can, because of size, wealth, insurance, or the ability to pass on costs, best bear the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non–payment?</b> Which party can most easily avoid the loss? And which rule is the least costly rule to enforce? In regard to electric funds transfer it was found that the test in the current Electronic Funds Transfer Code (EFT Code), although purporting to be worked out on efficiency principles is, in fact, unduly complicated and the thesis recommends the adoption of simple failure to report loss theft or fraud by the consumer as a test for allocation of fraud loss. Signature credit cards are currently not covered by the EFT Code and fraud loss allocation is determined by contract law but, nevertheless, a similar test is advocated in regard to them too. In regard to cheques it was found the forgery rule as regards the drawer’s signature and the ancillary Ligget rule are basically efficient but the rule regarding indorser’s signature is inefficient - making cheques not transferable would help eliminate this inefficiency. As to fraudulent alterations, it was advocated that paying banks should bear total loss for fraudulent and material alterations with a right, of course, against the person who has made the alteration. In regard to financial institution cheques, the thesis recommends that the definition of a financial institution cheque (which covers bank cheques) should be extended to cover cheques drawn by one financial institution on another one. It recommends that where consideration has been provided at any stage for a bank cheque then it should be able to be enforced. It was also advocated that the gist of the Australian Paper Clearing System assurances needs to be enshrined in legislation (an example of the sort of legislative change that would hopefully ensure certainty of payment has also been suggested). To ameliorate the position from an efficiency perspective, the following is also advocated: a duty of care in regard to the safekeeping of bank cheques should be introduced; responsibility for alterations should also be placed on the issuing banks as a spur to devise alteration proof bank cheques; and when consumers buy bank cheques they should be asked for what purpose it is being purchased and this should be written by the banks on the front of the bank cheque. Whether a uniform rule for fraud loss allocation across different payment systems is a possibility is also explored. It was found that a uniform rule for fraud loss allocation would seem to be more efficient than making efficiency ameliorations to existing fraud allocation tests in the various payment systems. Allied with the problem of fraud loss allocation is the issue of whether consumers should have a right of stopping or reversing payment if consumers perceive they are the potential victims of fraud or sharp dealing. Again the thesis examined whether this is efficient. In regard to cheques it was found that the right to stop payment is efficient but that such a right could be ameliorated by allowing the drawer a right to set up any dispute against the vendor in the same action where the vendor/payee brings an action on the stopped cheque. Moreover, the right to stop cheques should be explicitly extended to stolen cheques. In addition banks should have to reaccredit the account in accordance with the stop payment order and banks should have the burden of proving that no loss stemmed from their error. On the other hand, in regard to financial institution cheques (including bank cheques) if they are to be effective cash substitutes, efficiency demands that purchasers not be allowed to use their disputes with the vendor, even if they may seem to involve fraud, to stop the banks paying out on the bank cheques, unless there is a court order. As to signature credit cards it is advocated the gist of American law on chargebacks absent any territorial restrictions should be put into Australian federal legislation. Allegations of contractual non compliance should require the buyer to send the goods back to the seller or, at least be able to show a bona fide attempt to do so, as a precondition to the exercise of chargeback rights and as part of a requirement that the buyer should make an attempt to first settle the matter with the seller. Proposed federal legislation covering chargebacks should also extend to other forms of electronic payment like BPAY as well as PIN credit cards. Chargeback rights should also apply where debit systems mimic cash but with a $ 150 threshold before they apply and subject to the goods being returned to the seller. Finally, the thesis explores whether a uniform right to stop payment would be more efficient than the inconsistency and inefficiency of current Australian stop payment rules and concludes that such right should be along the lines of the never enacted American Uniform New Payments Code since is clear, concise and efficient compared with other attempts to formulate uniform rules. ...|$|E
