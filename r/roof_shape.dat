25|$|Developed {{into its}} current form between 1890 and 1893 by the biologist, {{botanist}} and urban planner Patrick Geddes, Ramsay Garden started out as Ramsay Lodge, an octagonal house built by the poet and wig-maker Allan Ramsay the Elder in 1733. The house was also known variously as Ramsay Hut and Goosepie House (due to the <b>roof</b> <b>shape).</b> It was complemented {{by the addition of}} Ramsay Street, a short row of simple Georgian Houses in 1760.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory studies on mixing inhomogeneous multi-component granular pattern in a flow mixer. A ternary granular pattern {{was subject to}} mixing: yellow pea, sorghum and vetch. The mixer was equipped with <b>roof</b> <b>shaped</b> inserts. <b>Roof</b> <b>shaped</b> and double cone type inserts were used during tests. Mix quality was analysed in suc-cessive mixing steps {{on the basis of}} percentage analysis for each of the constituents. Then, the quality parameter of residual sum of squares was calculated. This provided grounds for determining mix quality changes in time, and insert impact on mixing process.

25|$|The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission reviews {{applications}} for new construction, including significant alterations to existing structures, in the Stockade District. It may consider, and request modification of, many {{elements of the}} proposed construction, including <b>roof</b> <b>shape,</b> walls and paving, {{in the interest of}} protecting the Stockade's historic character. The height of new buildings is limited to , or the base of the Old Dutch Church's steeple. The commission may also require the use of bluestone in sidewalks where it considers it historically appropriate, and that any newer construction be set back further from the street than neighboring historic buildings and screened from view with trees, possibly evergreens. Five percent of the area of all parking lots must be used for plantings to screen it.|$|E
2500|$|The Viper SRT-10 Coupe was {{introduced}} at the 2005 Detroit Auto Show as a 2006 model. It shares {{many of its}} body panels with the convertible, but takes its side and rear styling from the Competition Coupe. The coupe looks much like the previous Viper GTS and retains the [...] "double-bubble" [...] <b>roof</b> <b>shape</b> of the original along with the original GTS's tail lights, as well as offering the original GTS Blue with white stripes paint scheme on the initial run of First Edition cars like the original Viper coupe. The engine is SAE-certified to produce [...] and [...] Unlike the original coupe, the chassis was not modified. This makes the coupe heavier than the convertible, and thus slightly slower to accelerate. Handling and high-speed performance are improved by the coupe's stiffer frame, reduced drag, and increased downforce.|$|E
2500|$|The Baotuquan Campus is {{the former}} campus of Cheeloo University and was {{established}} in 1909. The design for the campus was made by Perkins, Fellows and Hamilton, an architectural firm from Chicago renowned for its school buildings in the [...] "Prairie School" [...] style. The American architects attempted to include Chinese architectural features into {{the design of the}} buildings on the new Cheeloo University campus in Jinan. They did, however, mistakenly assume that the <b>roof</b> <b>shape</b> was the only distinguishing feature of Chinese architecture. As a result, the buildings feature Chinese-style roofs on buildings that lack the matching support elements such as wooden Dougong brackets that characterize Chinese architecture. Historical buildings on the Baotuquan Campus include the [...] Bergen Science Hall ( [...] , formerly for Chemistry and Biology), the Mateer Science Hall (formerly for Physics and Physiology), the [...] McCormick Hall, and the Alumni Gate (the former main entrance, construction completed on June 17, 1924). Baotuquan Campus houses the schools of public health, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, and medicine.|$|E

2500|$|In response, activists {{organized}} the “Friends of West-Park” {{to protest the}} development while concurrently working toward a viable alternative plan as well as funds. The group principally feared the loss of air and light with the new tower. The co-chairman of Friends of West-Park stated that the group was not interested “in telling the church {{that it had to}} maintain itself for the community good without the community taking some role [...] formed a development company capable of doing what [...] say and working on a partnership with the church.” The [...] "Friends" [...] suggested selling Eidlitz's chapel for redevelopment to a non-profit, probably a school, to offset the cost of renovation, with neighboring buildings preparing to lease air rights. Most of the external walls would be preserved, restoring the sandstone and stained glass but not the original <b>roof</b> <b>shape</b> nor the forty-foot interior, which would be gutted. Its sanctuary would be raised to gallery level and fitted with movable seating; since divided windows already exist, the alteration would not be externally evident, leaving the commercially ideal ground floor for other uses, possibly social outreach or educational. One architect responsible for the sympathetic second plan explained that “successful rehabilitation allows the character and original intent of the first architect to come through. So the question is, If not every square inch is sacred turf, how much modification can the structure bear without losing what makes it special?” Rev. Brashear of West-Park was quoted as receptive to the community input but stated that the congregation, trustees, and various levels of the Presbytery are still deciding the unprotected church’s fate.|$|E

40|$|The European program HORIZON 2020 aims to have 20 % of {{electricity}} produced by renewable sources. The building sector represents 40 % of the European Union energy consumption. Reducing energy consumption in buildings {{is therefore a}} priority for energy efficiency. The present investigation explores the most adequate <b>roof</b> <b>shapes</b> compatible with the placement {{of different types of}} small wind energy generators on high-rise buildings for urban wind energy exploitation. The wind flow around traditional state-of-the-art <b>roof</b> <b>shapes</b> is considered. In addition, the influence of the roof edge on the wind flow on high-rise buildings is analyzed. These geometries are investigated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the turbulence intensity threshold for horizontal axis wind turbines is considered. The most adequate shapes for wind energy exploitation are identified, studying vertical profiles of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulence intensity. Curved shapes are the most interesting building <b>roof</b> <b>shapes</b> from the wind energy exploitation point of view, leading to the highest speed-up and the lowest turbulence intensity...|$|R
