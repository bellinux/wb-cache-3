40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare several physical, {{chemical}} and organoleptic properties of three types of dark chocolate with different contents of vegetable fat to identify if partial or total <b>replacement</b> of cocoa <b>butter</b> influences chosen parameters. Aroma compounds were determined by the solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography, fatty acids as methyl esters using gas chromatography, flavour and colour were evaluated sensorially, and texture by both instrumental and sensory analyses. Partial <b>replacement</b> of cocoa <b>butter</b> (up to 5 % allowed by the European legislation) had only negligible effect on the monitored properties, differences between the samples were statistically insignificant (P < 0. 05). However, total <b>replacement</b> of cocoa <b>butter</b> (as in various chocolate imitations) significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced the properties. All the monitored physical and chemical parameters were different, high concentration (341. 17 +/- 13. 49 mg. g(- 1)) of elaidic acid was found here. The most evident difference was in organoleptic properties, evaluated as less expressive, atypical for good chocolate, taste and aroma with strong oleic note, which is negatively perceived by consumers...|$|R

40|$|Intake of trans {{fatty acids}} unfavorably affects blood lipoproteins. As margarines are {{a major source of}} trans, claims for the {{advantages}} of margarines over butter need to be scrutinized. Here we review dietary trials that directly compared the effects of butter and margarine on blood lipids. We identified 20 studies in which subjects had stable body weights, and margarine and butter were exchanged in the diet at constant energy and fat intake. We calculated the changes in average blood lipid levels between study diets (49 comparisons) {{as a function of the}} percentage of calories as margarine substituted for butter. Replacing 10 % of calories from butter by hard high-trans stick margarines lowered total serum cholesterol by 0. 19, LDL by 0. 11, and HDL by 0. 02 mmol/l, and did not affect the total/HDL cholesterol ratio. Soft low-trans tub margarines decreased total cholesterol by 0. 25 and LDL by 0. 20 mmol/l, did not affect HDL, and decreased the total/HDL cholesterol ratio by 0. 20. Based on the total/HDL cholesterol ratio, replacement of 30 g of butter per day by soft tub margarines would theoretically predict a reduction in coronary heart disease risk of 10 %, while <b>replacement</b> of <b>butter</b> by hard, high-trans margarines would have no effect. Replacing butter by low-trans soft margarines favorably affects the blood lipoprotein profile and may reduce the predicted risk of coronary heart disease, but high-trans hard margarines probably confer no benefit over butter...|$|R

Casson viscosity, Casson yield stress, fat bloom and sensory acceptability were all measured. In fact, all samples had achieved a low Casson viscosity (ηCA) and Casson yield stress (τ_oCA), which indicates molding and enrobing as appropriate uses. In addition, some significant differences (p ≤ 0. 05) were found among samples. Fat bloom was accelerated in the samples relative to control, but high MKF proportions tended to retard appearance of fat bloom.

40|$|The American diet {{is high in}} {{saturated}} fat and cholesterol, partially contributing to the current obesity epidemic and increase in diet-related diseases. One {{solution to this problem}} is the substitution of high fat ingredients such as butter and oil with lower fat options in baked goods. This study examined the acceptability of non-fat yogurt and applesauce as <b>butter</b> <b>replacements</b> in brownies. Statistical analyses indicated that the applesauce and yogurt recipes were significantly different from the control in several sensory and objective tests and were generally less acceptable, p 3 ̆c 0. 05. Two sensory testing sessions gathered data from 51 total judges. The judges rated moistness, sourness, and chewiness, for each variation. The results showed a significant difference in chewiness and sourness between the three variations but no significant difference in moistness. Objective tests, using a TA. XT 2 Texture Analyzer, indicated that the yogurt and applesauce variations took significantly more force to penetrate and withdraw than the control. Our results, therefore, determined that applesauce and yogurt were not equivalent full-fat substitutes for butter in brownies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Since regaining of {{independence}} in 1990, Lithuania has been undergoing substantial political, economic, and social changes that affected the nutrition habits of population. Dietary changes might have {{impact on the}} trends of dietary related risk factors of chronic diseases. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare trends in diet and lipid profile of Lithuanian rural population aged 25 - 64 during two decades of transition period (1987 - 2007). Methods Four cross-sectional surveys were conducted within the framework of the Countrywide Integrated Noncommunicable Diseases Intervention Programme in five regions of Lithuania in 1987, 1993, 1999, and 2007. For each survey, a stratified independent random sample was drawn from the lists of the inhabitants aged 25 - 64 years registered at the primary health care centres. Altogether 3127 men and 3857 women participated in the surveys. 24 -hour recall was used for evaluation of dietary habits. Serum lipids were determined using enzymatic methods. Predicted changes of serum cholesterol were calculated by Keys equation. Results The percentage of energy from saturated fatty acids has decreased from 18. 0 to 15. 1 among men and from 17. 6 to 14. 8 among women over the period of 20 years. The average share of polyunsaturated fatty acids in total energy intake increased from 5. 3 % to 7. 1 % among men and from 4. 9 % to 7. 3 % among women. The mean intake of cholesterol declined among women. Favourable trends in fatty acids composition were caused by increased use of vegetable oil for cooking and <b>replacement</b> of <b>butter</b> spread with margarine. Since 1987, the mean value of total cholesterol has decreased by 0. 6 mmol/l. Total dietary effect accounts for a 0. 26 mmol/l (43. 3 %) decline in serum cholesterol among men and 0. 31 mmol/l (50. 8 %) decline among women. Conclusions Improvement in the quality of fat intake was observed in Lithuanian rural population over two decades of transition period. Positive changes in diet, mainly reduction in saturated fatty acids intake, contributed to decline in serum cholesterol level. Strengthening of favourable trends in nutrition habits in Lithuanian population should be one of the most important strategies of cardiovascular diseases prevention. </p...|$|R

To {{keep up with the}} huge demand of Honey Butter Chip, Haitai-Calbee has raise its production by three times and put its production line in full operation for 24 hours.

After Honey Butter Chip became famous, many companies have produced similar products which plagiarize the name, design, and flavor of its original [...] {{to take advantage of the}} {{popularity of}} Honey Butter Chip. The word ‘Honey Butter’ are used by companies to promote their food products to the consumers as if it is a magic spell for high sales of product. A major Korean food maker, Nongshim has launched ‘Sumi Chip Honey Mustard’ in December, whose taste is similar to Honey Butter Chip. Unlike Honey Butter Chip, Sumi chip was easier to find in many stores. Therefore, consumers started to buy Sumi chip as a replacement. The Sumi Chip became more popular than its original, and sold four times more than the Honey Butter Chip with average of ten thousands pack per day. Nongshim has achieved the new record of having the greatest monthly sales in the Korean snack industry. Because of the supply shortage and many other copy products, Honey Butter Chip which once had the highest sales during the last quarter of 2014 fell to the third place in the snack sales of January and February, 2015.|$|R
