40|$|How can {{inhalant}} abuse be recognized? See page 4. {{from the}} director: Although many parents are appropriately concerned about illicit {{drugs such as}} marijuana, cocaine, and LSD, they often ignore the dangers posed to their children from common household products that contain volatile solvents or aerosols. Products such as glues, nail polish remover, lighter fluid, spray paints, deodorant and hair sprays, whipped cream canisters, and cleaning fluids are widely available yet far from innocuous. Many young people inhale the vapors from these sources in search of quick intoxication without being aware that using inhalants, even once, can have serious health consequences. National surveys indicate that nearly 22. 3 million Americans have used inhalants {{at least once in}} their lives. NIDA’s Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey reveals that 14. 9 percent of 8 th-graders have used inhalants. Parents and children need to know that even sporadic or single episodes of inhalant abuse can be extremely dangerous. Inhalants can disrupt heart rhythms and cause death from cardiac arrest, or lower oxygen levels enough to cause suffocation. <b>Regular</b> <b>abuse</b> of these substances can result in serious harm to vital organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver. Through scientific research, we have learned much about {{the nature and extent of}} inhalant abuse, its pharmacology, and its consequences. This research has brought the picture of inhalant abuse in the Nation into focus and pointed to the dangers and the warning signs for parents, educators, and clinicians.

40|$|Background: Child {{abuse in}} South Africa is a {{significant}} public health concern with severe negative outcomes for children; however, {{little is known about}} risk and protective factors for child abuse victimisation. This thesis investigates prevalence rates, perpetrators, and locations as well as predictors of physical, emotional and sexual child abuse victimisation. It also examines the influence of potential mediating and moderating variables on the relationships between risk factors and child abuse. Methods: In the first study, a systematic review of correlates of physical, emotional and sexual child abuse victimisation in Africa was conducted. The review synthesised evidence from 23 quantitative studies and was used to inform the epidemiological study. For study two to four, anonymous self-report questionnaires were completed by children aged 10 - 17 (n= 3515, 57 % female) using random door-to-door sampling in rural and urban areas in two provinces in South Africa. Children were followed-up a year later (97 % retention rate). Abuse was measured using internationally recognised scales. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, multivariate logistic regressions, and mediator and moderator analyses. Results: The first study, the systematic review, identified high prevalence rates of abuse across all African countries. It identified a number of correlates which were further examined using the study data from South Africa. The second study found lifetime prevalence of abuse to be 54. 5 % for physical abuse, 35. 5 % for emotional abuse, 14 % for sexual harassment and 9 % for contact sexual abuse. Past year prevalence of abuse was found to be 37. 9 % for physical abuse, 31. 6 % for emotional abuse, 12 % for sexual harassment and 5. 9 % for contact sexual abuse. A large number of children experienced frequent (monthly or more <b>regular)</b> <b>abuse</b> victimisation with 16 % for physical abuse, 22 % for emotional abuse, 8. 1 % for sexual harassment and 2. 8 % for contact sexual abuse. Incidence for frequent abuse victimisation at follow-up was 12 % for physical abuse, 10 % for emotional abuse and 3 % for contact sexual abuse. Perpetrators of physical and emotional abuse were mostly caregivers; perpetrators of sexual abuse were mostly girlfriends/boyfriends or other peers. The third study found a direct effect of baseline household AIDS-illness on physical and emotional abuse at follow-up. This relationship was mediated by poverty. Poverty and the ill-person’s disability fully mediated the relationship between household other chronic illnesses and physical and emotional abuse, therefore placing children in families with chronic illnesses and high levels of poverty and disability at higher risk of abuse. The fourth study found that contact sexual abuse in girls at follow-up was predicted by baseline school drop-out, physical assault in the community and prior sexual abuse victimisation. Peer social support acted as a protective factor. It also moderated the relationship between baseline physical assault in the community and sexual abuse at follow-up, lowering the risk for sexual abuse victimisation in girls who had been physically assaulted from 2. 5 / 1000 to 1 / 1000. Conclusion: This thesis shows clear evidence of high levels of physical, emotional and sexual child abuse victimisation in South Africa. It also identified risk and protective factors for child abuse victimisation which can be used to inform evidence-based child abuse prevention interventions.

40|$|For {{my thesis}} I have chosen this topic Reasons {{and the extent}} of drug abuse within the {{children}} from social and cultural unfavourable environment. I was attracted by this theme during my school practical training. Drug experiments with the follow-up abuse within the children?s population {{are becoming more and more}} a serious problem not only in the Czech Republic but in the whole world too. Lately the age limit has cut down for the experiments related to legal as well as illegal drugs. The children from the social and cultural unfavourable environment are involved in drug abuse and other pathological phenomenon much sooner than the major society, which explains the lower age limit. When the child belongs to the social and cultural disadvantageous group of inhabitants, he/she comes into the social, health, economical and often criminal problems. To be a member of such excluded group can cause that the child is more likely exposed to frequently and risky drug abuse. The thesis refers to the drug abuse by the children from the social and cultural unfavourable environment. The data for the thesis were collected from the 14 and 15 year old children in special pedagogical institutions in the South Bohemian region. The quantity research was applied to get the data, via anonymous questioner enriched with the additional discussion with the therapists of the respective institution, and were analysed in quality. The previously stated hypothesis were verified and evaluated based on the results qualification. The thesis contains the theoretical part which explains the basic terms, describes models of drug addiction, as the base for the statement and the cause of drug experiments and abuse within the children?s population from disadvantageous environment. The theoretical part concludes the research results of this subject provided within the children?s ordinary population to be compared with this thesis research results. The practical part marks out the goals and describes the own steps of the research. The aim of this work is to find out the reasons and extent of the drug abuse by the children from the social and cultural unfavourable environment. The partial aim was to compare the reasons and extent of drug abuse within these children with the data previously obtained from the ordinary children?s population in the Czech Republic. The research results present higher segment of the respondents from the social and cultural unfavourable environment related to addictives, including higher frequency of the abuse, rather younger age of the first experience with addictives, even <b>regular</b> <b>abuse</b> and experience with various types of addictives compared to regular children?s population. Thanks to the research results we can point to the fact that the reasons of using addictives by the children from the social and cultural unfavourable environment differ from the reasons of the ordinary children?s population. It consists mainly in psychological and social deprivation of those children and absence of the basic psychological needs fulfilment. Such stigma subsequently influences the predisposition to addictives abuse by the children from the social and cultural unfavourable environment, who owing to the drug may be able ?to forget? their problems at least for a while. The thesis results can be used in practice, for teaching, for further research or as the source of information for general public as well as for experts...|$|E

40|$|Treatment for {{substance}} abuse and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection historically have come from different providers, often in separate locations, and have been reimbursed through separate funding streams. We describe policy and financing challenges faced by health care providers seeking to integrate buprenorphine, a new treatment for opioid dependence, into HIV primary care. Regulatory challenges include licensing and training restrictions imposed by the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 and confidentiality regulations for alcohol and drug treatment records. Potential responses include the development of local training programs and electronic medical records. Addressing the complexity of funding sources for integrated care will require administrative support, up-front investments, and federal and state leadership. A policy and financing research agenda should address evidence gaps in the rationales for regulatory restrictions and should include cost-effectiveness studies that quantify the “value for money ” of investments in integrated care to improve health outcomes for HIV-infected patients with opioid dependence. There are many challenges faced by HIV care providers seeking to integrate opioid dependence treatment into primary care. <b>Regular</b> substance <b>abuse</b> monitoring is important to assess drug use, adverse effects of medi...|$|R

50|$|During the 1970s, black footballers {{became an}} {{increasingly}} frequent presence in English football, mostly born to Afro-Caribbean immigrants who settled in Britain from 1948. With racial tension high {{in many parts}} of Britain and the far-right National Front peaking in popularity at the same time, many of these players were subjected to <b>regular</b> racial <b>abuse</b> from fans of rival teams, whose fans often pelted them with banana skins, as well as making monkey chants or shouting racist obscenities. Perhaps the most notable player to suffer this type of racial abuse during the 1970s was Viv Anderson, the Nottingham Forest full-back who became England's first black senior international player in 1978. Black players became an increasingly frequent feature in the English game during the 1980s, and with hooliganism still widespread, incidents of racial abuse continued on a large scale. John Barnes, who made his Football League debut for Watford in 1981, was soon targeted with racial abuse by rival fans, which continued after he joined Liverpool in 1987, soon after which he suffered severe racist abuse. In 1984, soon after breaking into the England national football team, Barnes was racially abused during a friendly match in Brazil by a section of England supporters identifying themselves as supporters or members of the National Front.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Previous {{reports on}} heroin and cocaine addicts showed drug-related and gender {{differences}} in psychiatric co-morbidity, which has relevant consequences for treatment. However, studies vary substantially with respect to methods and timeframes. Studies on German patient groups are scarce. Methods: Data on psychiatric and somatic comorbidity, substance addiction history, present intake patterns and socio-demography were obtained from 43 female (n= 11) and male (n= 32) heroin and cocaine addicts in acute inpatient de-toxification treatment or specified long-term treatment. A European Addiction-Severity-Index (EuropASI) based centre questionnaire and the Mini-DIPS were applied. Results: Treatment {{groups did not differ}} in psychiatric comorbidity. Female subjects, however, had a significantly higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbid diagnoses (p<. 05), mostly anxiety and affective disorders which significantly correlated with low occupational status (p<. 05).

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{neurobiology}} of moral cognition are often done by examining clinical populations characterized by diminished moral emotions and a proclivity toward immoral behavior. Psychopathy {{is the most}} common disorder studied for this purpose. Although cocaine abuse is highly co-morbid with psychopathy and cocaine-dependent individuals exhibit many of the same abnormalities in socio-affective processing as psychopaths, this population has received relatively little attention in moral psychology. To address this issue, the authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record hemodynamic activity in 306 incarcerated male adults, stratified into regular cocaine users (n = 87) and a matched sample of non-cocaine users (n = 87), while viewing pictures that did or did not depict immoral actions and determining whether each depicted scenario occurred indoors or outdoors. Consistent with expectations, cocaine users showed abnormal neural activity in several frontostriatial regions during implicit moral picture processing compared to their non-cocaine using peers. This included reduced moral/non-moral picture discrimination in the vACC, vmPFC, lOFC, and left vSTR. Additionally, psychopathy was negatively correlated with activity in an overlapping region of the ACC and right lateralized vSTR. These results suggest that <b>regular</b> cocaine <b>abuse</b> may lead to affective deficits which can impact relatively high-level processes like moral cognition. Moreover, they add to {{a growing body of research}} suggesting an important role for the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway in socio-affective processing...|$|R

Semi-structured interviews were conducted, in a community setting, with 19 suicide attempters aged 15 - 24 who had been consecutively hospitalized in an intensive care unit. In 12 of 19 cases, the first pressing, distinct and constant suicidal thoughts appeared less than one day before the suicide attempt in question. However, distress and mild, fleeting suicidal thoughts had been present {{up to six months}} before the suicide attempt in 16 cases. Five respondents had a suicide plan one to three days before attempting suicide. Altogether, 13 engaged in some form of suicidal communication before their attempt.

Eighteen of the respondents used pesticides or raticides in their suicide attempts. None sought advice or consultation in the community despite long-standing psychosocial problems. The strategy of reducing the availability of suicide means (e. g., pesticides or raticides) in Asian countries should be complemented with a long-term suicide-preventive strategy that targets school dropouts and domestic violence, and promotes coping abilities and communication about psychological and social problems as well as recognition of signs of distress and suicidal communication...|$|R

As no investigation on this problem has been performed in Serbia, the aim of our study was to establish the prevalence of tinnitus among Serbian adolescents and to investigate the relationship between their behavior and habits and tinnitus. This investigation was designed as a cross-sectional interview study among secondary school students in Belgrade, Serbia (277 boys and 494 girls). An anonymous questionnaire was self-administered at classes. The investigated variables were: The presence of tinnitus, sources of noise, night outs at noisy places, use of personal music players, smoking, second hand smoke (SHS), substance abuse, coffee and alcohol consumption. Spearman′s rank-order correlations and multiple logistic regressions were performed with variables related to behavior and habits as independent ones and tinnitus as a dichotomized dependent variable. Tinnitus was reported by 99 students (12. 8 %), more frequently among girls compared with boys (P = 0. 009).

40|$|Training and {{dissemination}} of the fundamental rules and principles of law of armed conflict (LOAC) {{is the first step}} in any process to ensure lawful military operations. A soldier, a military unit, an entire military must know the rules and parameters for appropriate, lawful and effective action during armed conflict. In the same manner, accountability for violations of LOAC — whether individual criminal accountability or state responsibility — is an equally essential tool for enforcing the law. Exploring the intersection between these two endpoints of the spectrum of LOAC implementation highlights how training and accountability can actually work together to maximize each one’s effectiveness. The way in which information about training contributes to accountability under command responsibility is a strong reinforcement of the message that commanders must ensure that their troops are properly trained in LOAC and that such training is effective and provided to all troops, regular or irregular. A commander’s commitment to providing training can also be evidence of his or her good character for purposes of mitigation.

40|$|Background: For {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the evolution of addictive disorders and the timely initiation of early intervention and prevention, we have to learn when and how quickly the critical transitions from first substance use (SU) to regular use and from first SU and <b>regular</b> SU to <b>abuse</b> and dependence occur. Little data are currently available on the transitions to substance use disorders (SUDs) across the spectrum of legal and illegal drugs taking into account gender differences. It is the aim of this paper to describe the high density incidence and transition periods of SU and SUD for alcohol, nicotine, cannabis and other illicit drugs for young males and females. Methods: A sample of (N = 3021) community subjects aged 14 - 24 at baseline were followed-up prospectively over 10 -years. SU and SUD were assessed using the DSM-IV/M-CIDI. Results: Ages 10 - 16 are the high risk period for first alcohol and nicotine use (up to 38 % of subjects start before age 14). Onset of illegal SU occurs later. Substantial proportions of transitions to regular SU and SUD occur in the first three years after SU onset. Only few gender differences were found for time patterns of SU/SUD incidence and transition. Conclusion: Except for alcohol the time windows for targeted intervention to prevent progression to malignant patterns in adolescence are critically small, leaving little time for targeted intervention to prevent transition. The fast transitions to abuse and dependence in adolescence may be indicative for the increased vulnerability to substance effects in this time period. Basic research on the determinants of transitions should thus target this period in adolescence...|$|R
40|$|Childhood {{trauma and}} post-childhood chronic/repeated stress could {{increase}} the risk of a substance use disorder by affecting 5 stages of addiction illness-course: (a) initial experimentation with substances; (b) shifting from experimental to regular use; (c) escalation from <b>regular</b> use to <b>abuse</b> or dependence; (d) motivation to quit; (e) risk of (re-) lapse. We reviewed the human literature on relationships between stress and addiction illness-course. We explored per illness-course stage (i) whether childhood trauma and post-childhood chronic/repeated stress have comparable effects, and (ii) whether effects cut across classes of substances of abuse. We further discuss potential underlying mechanisms by which stressors may affect illness-course stages for which we relied on evidence from studies in animals and humans. Stress and substances of abuse both activate stress and dopaminergic motivation systems, and childhood trauma and post-childhood stressful events are more chronic and occur more frequently in people who use substances. Stressors increase risk to initiate early use potentially by affecting trait-like factors of risk-taking, decision making, and behavioral control by diminished prefrontal functioning. Stressors also accelerate transition to regular use, potentially due to prior effects of stress on cross-sensitization of dopaminergic motivation systems with substances of abuse, especially in people with high trait impulsivity who are more prone to sensitization. Finally, stressors increase risk for abuse and dependence, attenuate motivation to quit, and increase relapse risk, potentially by intensified sensitization of motivational systems, by a shift from positive to negative reinforcement due to sensitization of the amygdala by corticotropin releasing factor, and by increased sensitization of noradrenergic systems. Stress generally affects addiction illness-course across childhood stressor types, and across classes of substances of abuse...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: University {{students}} face multiple stressors such {{as academic}} overload, constant pressure to succeed, competition with peers {{as well as}} concerns about the future. Stress {{should not be considered}} on its own, but should be associated with potential risk behaviors leading to onset of substance use and related problems heightened during the university period. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of main substance use and behavioral addictions among students in higher education in France and to examine the relationship with perceived stress. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was filled out by university student volunteers from Upper Normandy (France) either by anonymous online questionnaire or by paper questionnaire. Data collected included socio-economic characteristics, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis) and hazardous behaviors: alcohol abuse problems, smoking, consumption of cannabis, eating disorders, and cyber addiction. RESULTS: A total of 1876 students were included. Mean PSS score was 15. 9 (standard deviation[*]=[*] 7. 2). Highly stressed students (4 th quartile) were compared with lesser stressed students (1 st quartile). A positive relation was observed between female gender, <b>regular</b> smokers, alcohol <b>abuse</b> problems, risk of cyberaddiction and especially eating disorders (AOR[*]=[*] 5. 45, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 3. 42 - 8. 69), and increasing PSS score. PSS score however, was not significantly related to the curriculum, regular alcohol use, drunkenness or binge drinking even after additional controlling for use of other substances. We found a significant negative association between stress and practice of sport: students with the most physical activity were less likely to report perceived stress (4 th quartile: AOR[*]=[*] 0. 57, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 39 - 0. 80). CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study among university students in France revealed that perceived stress was associated not only with known risks such as alcohol misuse, but also with new risks such as eating disorders and cyber addiction. These results could help to develop preventive interventions focussing on these risk behaviors and subsequently improving stress coping capacity in this high-risk population...|$|R
40|$|<b>Regular</b> and {{irregular}} <b>abuse</b> of alcohol are global health priorities associated with diseases at multiple sites, including cancer. Mechanisms of diseases induced by alcohol {{are closely related}} to its metabolism. Among conventional markers of alcohol abuse, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes is prognostic of alcohol-related cancer and its predictivity increases when combined with functional polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH 1 B [rs 1229984] and ADH 1 C [rs 698]) and the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH 2 [rs 671]). Whether these genetic variants can influence abuse in alcohol drinking and MCV has never been examined in drunk-driving traffic offenders. We examined 149 drunk drivers, diagnosed as alcohol abusers according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and enrolled in a probation program, and 257 social drinkers (controls), all Caucasian males. Alcohol intake was assessed according to self-reported drink-units/d and MCV unadjusted and adjusted for age, smoking, and body mass index. Multivariable models were used to compute MCV adjusted means. Genotype analyses were performed by PCR on DNA from blood. The adjusted MCV mean was higher in drunk-driving abusers than in controls (92 vs. 91 fL; P <. 0001) and increased with the number of drink-units/d in both abusers and controls (P-trend =. 0316 and. 0089) already at intermediate quantities (0 - 1 vs. 2 - 4 drink-units/d: P =. 054 and. 024). Carriers of the common ADH 1 B* 1 /* 1 (rs 1229984) genotype {{were more likely to be}} drunk-driving abusers (P =. 008), reported higher drink-units/d (P =. 0126), and had larger MCV (P =. 035). The rs 698 ADH 1 C and rs 671 ALDH 2 polymorphisms were not associated with MCV. ADH 1 B* 1 /* 1 polymorphism is significantly associated with being a drunk-driving abuser, higher alcohol drinking, and MCV enlargement. This suggests that drunk drivers with augmented MCV modulated by the alcohol metabolic ADH 1 B* 1 /* 1 genotype may be at higher risk of driving incapability and of alcohol-related cancer.

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} sociodemographic correlates {{associated with}} transitions from alcohol use to disorders and remission in a Brazilian population. Methods: Data {{are from a}} probabilistic, multi-stage clustered sample of adult household residents in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area. Alcohol use, regular use (at least 12 drinks/year), DSM-IV abuse and dependence and remission from alcohol use disorders (AUDs) were assessed with the World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Age of onset (AOO) distributions of the cumulative lifetime probability of each alcohol use stage were prepared with data obtained from 5037 subjects. Correlates of transitions were obtained from a subsample of 2942 respondents, whose time-dependent sociodemographic data were available. Results: Lifetime prevalences were 85. 8 % for alcohol use, 56. 2 % for regular use, 10. 6 % for abuse and 3. 6 % for dependence; 73. 4 and 58. 8 % of respondents with lifetime abuse and dependence, respectively, had remitted. The number of sociodemographic correlates decreased from alcohol use to disorders. All transitions across alcohol use stages up to abuse were consistently associated with male gender, younger cohorts and lower education. Importantly, low education was a correlate for developing AUD and not remitting from dependence. Early AOO of first alcohol use {{was associated with the}} transition of <b>regular</b> use to <b>abuse.</b> Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that specific correlates differently contribute throughout alcohol use trajectory in a Brazilian population. It also reinforces the need of preventive programs focused on early initiation of alcohol use and high-risk individuals, in order to minimize the progression to dependence and improve remission from AUD.
