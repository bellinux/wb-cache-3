50|$|The {{provision}} of libraries by municipal councils in Queensland {{is a relatively}} new phenomenon, with most libraries currently operating having been established since the late 1940s. Previously, Schools of Arts and privately owned Reading Rooms provided books for loan by subscription. Schools of Arts or Mechanics Institutes were established in Britain in the early 1800s with the declared intention of assisting self-improvement and promoting moral, social and intellectual growth, by providing lectures, classes and lending libraries to a rising middle class. At the time there were no public libraries and books were expensive, so that providing access to them for a moderate subscription was an important educational and <b>recreational</b> <b>service.</b> Local councils had sometimes subsidised Schools of Arts and were granted authority in the Local Government Act 1878 to establish and operate libraries, although this was very uncommon until the twentieth century. Kurilpa Library was the first publicly funded municipal library in Queensland and South Brisbane Library opened soon afterwards. However, local councils did not become seriously involved in the construction of libraries in Queensland until after the Libraries Act 1943 was passed which provided {{for the establishment of a}} State Library Board and the improvement of library services throughout the state.|$|E

40|$|The current {{understanding}} of urban green space (UGS) <b>recreational</b> <b>service</b> is limited {{due to the}} lack of being examined under the logic that underlies the ecosystem service paradigm, leading to limitations in the application of ecosystem based management in urban land use planning. This paper offers a conceptual model of UGS <b>recreational</b> <b>service</b> that follows the logical flow of ecosystem service generation, supplementing the knowledge gap and supporting the use of ecosystem base management in urban land use planning. The model includes four categories; UGS features, population characteristics, recreational use behavior, and recreational benefits while considering the use behavior as the service carrier. A process analysis shows the role of each model component in generating the services, and highlights the important role of regulating service potentials and their mobilization. Ways of informing interventions for improving efficiency or equity have been suggested. Efficiency can be assessed by applying the dose-response mechanism in the model. Equity on the other hand, can be measured by exploring which predictors of use are dominant, which advances UGS access assessment by shifting from the spatial-based to the use-based. Survey design techniques and indicators measuring various variables of the model have also been proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The study found that the highest standard of living is typical for the municipalities where industrial and service-related functions dominate.  ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the effect brought about by the {{promulgation}} of the British Local Government Act of 1988 on the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services.</b> The Act made it compulsory to local authorities to expose the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> to a tendering process, commonly known as compulsory competitive tendering. The implementation of compulsory competitive tendering had to be done between the promulgation of the Act in 1988, and 1994. With regard to this period, a perception existed that the standard of the administration of the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> declined. The research was done to determine if the implementation of compulsory competitive tendering on the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> could have resulted in a decline in the standard of the administration of the services, and how it could have happened. It was determined that the motive of the British Government at the time of implementation of the compulsory competitive tendering was primarily to save money. The result of the implementation of compulsory competitive legislation on the maintenance of parks and <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> were amongst other things: - low morale of staff who were pressured to change - culture changes necessary to comply to compulsory competitive organisational structures - legislation that influenced the lives of traditional local authority employees drastically, and - the development of a new approach to financial management to comply to the government's expectations of saving money.

The purpose of this research was to assess whether <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> buffer the impact of stress on the well-being of noninstitutionalized frail elderly. Two samples were drawn based upon a functional assessment as measured by an activities of daily living (ADL) scale from the Study of Older People in Cleveland, Ohio. Multiple regression equations were utilized for each group to determine whether the effects of stress were reduced by participation in <b>recreational</b> <b>services.</b> The results revealed that <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> mediated and buffered the level of stress among both groups of elderly people. However, the more impaired ADL group benefitted the most. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. Given the increasing aged population, and therefore the increasing number of frail elderly, the task of maintaining elderly persons in the community requires specific social supports to minimize dependence and to assist in the promotion of well-being. The study of social supports, life stress, and well-being has been a major topic for research in the field of gerontology in recent years.

40|$|In Malaysia, {{the demand}} for island-based {{recreation}} is increasing rapidly, especially among foreign tourists. This study attempts to capture the non-market value of services provided by the ecosystem {{as a basis for}} arguing that island and beach resources in Malaysia are undervalued. Consequently, they are not considered seriously in decisions affecting resource use and allocation. This study estimates the economic value of Redang Island, using an environmental valuation technique - the Travel Cost Method (TCM). The <b>recreational</b> <b>service</b> flows of Redang Island, a popular destination located in the state of Terengganu, were estimated through the consumer surplus generated by the visitors during May and June, 2010. Annual consumer surplus per individual was estimated as USD 747 (RM 2, 286) while annual total benefit was USD 57. 89 mil (RM 177. 24 mil). The relatively high value of recreation suggests that the recreational functions of beaches ought to be seriously considered in decisions affecting the allocation and use of such resources. Valuation of natural resources would therefore lead to better resource-management decisions in Malaysia...|$|E

30|$|On a {{societal}} level, {{the development of}} <b>recreational</b> <b>services</b> within ECEC policies takes part in the broader process of defamilisation (McLaughlin and Glendinning 1994) that has progressively externalised the care of children.
