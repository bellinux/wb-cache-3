5000|$|A [...] "cold harbour" [...] was an {{uninhabited}} {{shelter for}} travellers, often along a well-known route, somewhat {{similar to a}} modern bothy.

At that point, Neri discharged his service firearm and mortally wounded Stansbury. Although Commissioner Kelly stated that the shooting appeared [...] "unjustified", a Brooklyn jury found that no criminal act occurred and that the event was a tragic accident.

A grand jury declined to indict Neri but Kelly later suspended him for 30 days without pay and permanently stripped him of his weapon.|$|E
50|$|LaBastille's {{most popular}} books, the Woodswoman series, were {{a set of}} four memoirs {{spanning}} four decades {{of her life in}} the Adirondack Mountains and chronicled her relationship with the wilderness. Inspired by Henry David Thoreau's Walden, LaBastille purchased land {{on the edge of a}} mountain lake in the Adirondacks, where she built a log cabin in 1964. At the beginning of her first book, Woodswoman (1976), she documented the process of obtaining materials and building the cabin with the help of a pair of local carpenters. To avoid cutting old growth forest on the property, she purchased pre-cut logs from a local sawmill and used store-bought lumber to build the floor joists, <b>roof,</b> <b>door</b> frames, and window frames. The remainder of Woodswoman records her adventures living in this log cabin without comforts such as electricity or running water, as well as her explorations into the wilderness of the Adirondacks. In her second book, Beyond Black Bear Lake (1987), she described how she built her smaller second cabin, Thoreau II, on a more remote area of her property in order to obtain a more Walden-like experience. Both the first and second books explored her friendships, romances, her previous marriage, her close bonds to her German Shepherd dogs, the ebb and flow of nature, and her conservation efforts.|$|E
