5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{accounting systems}} have no {{good way to}} identify the financial impact of the lean improvements taking place throughout the company. On the contrary, the financial <b>reports</b> will often <b>show</b> that bad things are happening when very good lean change is being made. One {{example of this is}} that traditional <b>reporting</b> <b>shows</b> a reduction in profitability when inventory is reduced. Lean companies always make significant inventory reductions and the accounting <b>reports</b> <b>show</b> negative results.|$|R

25|$|Microarray {{analysis}} from one <b>report</b> <b>shows</b> {{a significant decrease}} in myocardial arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) gene expression during the late-stage heart failure. This suggests that the reduced AGAT may correlate with loss of heart function. Increase of AGAT expression in the myocardium after heart failure due to increase in creatine synthesis was associated with favorable outcome.|$|E

Additionally, a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study that tracked the price of clear glass from 15 July – 2 August 1991, found that the average cost per ton ranged from $40 to $60 while a USGS <b>report</b> <b>shows</b> that the cost per ton of raw silica sand from years 1993 to 1997 fell between $17.33 and $18.10.|$|E
25|$|The Indian subcontinent has {{a history}} of devastating earthquakes. The major reason for the high {{frequency}} and intensity of the earthquakes is that the Indian plate is driving into Asia at a rate of approximately 47mm/year. Geographical statistics of India show that almost 54% of the land is vulnerable to earthquakes. A World Bank & United Nations <b>report</b> <b>shows</b> estimates that around 200 million city dwellers in India will be exposed to storms and earthquakes by 2050. National Disaster Management Authority says that 60% of Indian landmass is prone to earthquake and 8% susceptible to cyclone risks.|$|E

25|$|Moreton Bay's sea grass {{beds and}} corals {{are subject to}} ongoing threat from soil run-off caused by {{agriculture}} in the Lockyer Valley and construction activity in south east Queensland. Professor John Olley has noted that mud is now flowing out to Moreton Bay 10 {{times as fast as}} it did before Europeans settled in the region 120 years ago. The 2013 Healthy Waterways <b>Report</b> <b>shows</b> a downward trend in the ecosystem health of Moreton Bay over the period from 2012 to 2013, with water quality also affected by major flood events such as those in 2009 and 2011.|$|E

This study also found that between January and November (excluding August when the charge was temporarily suspended), all traffic related emissions were lower. PM10 decreased by 23%, particulate matter decreased by 18%, NH3 fell 47%, NOx was reduced by 15%, and CO2 emission were cut by 14%.|$|E
25|$|Ontario, however, has no {{concrete}} regulations regarding PGD. Since 2011, the Ministry of Children and Youth Services in Ontario {{advocates for}} the development government-funded 'safe fertility' education, embryo monitoring and assisted reproduction services for all Ontarians. This government <b>report</b> <b>shows</b> that Ontario not only has indefinite regulations regarding assisted reproduction services like IVF and PGD, but also does not fund any of these services. The reproductive clinics that exist are all private and located only in Brampton, Markham, Mississauga, Scarborough, Toronto, London and Ottawa. In contrast, provinces such as Alberta and Quebec not only have more clinics, but have also detailed laws regarding assisted reproduction and government funding for these practices.|$|E
