5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a <b>repairman</b> {{working on the}} cable line. They find {{hundreds}} of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable <b>repairman</b> near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a multi-repairmen machine repair problem {{comprising}} of M operating units {{together with}} k type of warm spares has been investigated. The failed units are immediately attended by <b>repairmen</b> if available. When {{there are no}} failed units in the queue for repair, the <b>repairmen</b> leave for a vacation of random length. When the vacation period is terminated, the <b>repairmen</b> return and check for any failed unit in the queue. If the queue is non-empty, the <b>repairmen</b> start repairing of failed units until the queue becomes empty, and again they leave for another vacation. The repair rate of the <b>repairmen</b> depends upon the workload. The caretaker of the failed machines may renege on finding all <b>repairmen</b> busy. The steady state queue size distribution and other important performance measures have been derived using matrix recursive approach. Furthermore, a numerical example provides a profound understanding of the sensitivity of parameters with respect to various performance measures...|$|R

5|$|Moon {{joined his}} local Sea Cadet Corps band {{at the age}} of twelve on the bugle, but found the {{instrument}} too difficult to learn and decided to take up drums instead. He was interested in practical jokes and home science kits, with a particular fondness for explosions. On his way home from school, Moon would often go to Macari's Music Studio on Ealing Road to practise on the drums there, learning his basic skills on the instrument. He left school at age fourteen, around Easter in 1961. Moon then enrolled at Harrow Technical College; this led to a job as a radio <b>repairman,</b> enabling him to buy his first drum kit.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} cold-standby machine repair problem {{consisting}} of M operating machines with S cold-standby machines, and R <b>repairmen</b> where machines have K(K {{greater than or}} equal to 1) failure modes under steady-state conditions. It is assumed that any one mode of failure is served by one or more <b>repairmen,</b> and that the K failure modes have equal probability of repair. failure time of the machines and repair time of the <b>repairmen</b> are assumed to follow a negative exponential distribution. A cost model is developed in order to determine the optimal values of the number of cold standbys and the number of <b>repairmen</b> simultaneously, while maintaining a minimum specified level of system availability. Numerical results are presented in which several system characteristics are evaluated for three and four failure modes under the optimal operating conditions.

5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the mind control device turns people's fears into paranoid delusions. Mulder tries to contact Dr. Stroman with no success. He traces Dr. Stroman's location to an empty hotel room where he finds cigarettes in the ash tray. Using the phone log for the room Mulder tracks Stroman to a house where he spots him meeting with the cable <b>repairman.</b> However, by the time Mulder enters, shots ring out, and Mulder finds both men dead, with X (Steven Williams) responsible for their murders. X used a third party to inform Mulder, knowing he had orders to kill the men, but Mulder {{was not able to}} piece things together in time. Mulder calls him a coward but X tells Mulder that Mulder needs him. Later, X meets in a car with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis).|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{were held}} {{six days a}} week at the Pushkin Theatre, usually from 10am to 1pm. They were {{frequently}} interrupted by air-raid sirens, and some musicians were required to undertake anti-aircraft or firefighting duties. To enable them to attend rehearsals, performers were granted orchestral ID cards to show at checkpoints. Members of the military orchestra (and some ordinary troops) were dispatched to the rehearsals to supplement the performers. Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June, and in late July were increased to 5–6 hours a day. Instruments were in poor condition and few repairmen were available; one oboist was asked for a cat in exchange for a repair, as the starving <b>repairman</b> had already eaten several.|$|E

5|$|As the {{vandalism}} {{had shut}} down {{service at the}} central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect <b>repairmen</b> while they fixed the overhead cables at the main terminal building. The <b>repairmen</b> and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and <b>repairmen</b> were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete shut down of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption of public transportation and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|R

5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused two fatalities in Louisiana: {{a utility}} <b>repairman</b> who was electrocuted {{while working on}} power lines damaged by strong winds, and a motorist {{who was involved in}} a storm-related traffic accident. Total monetary losses in the state was estimated $150 million. Overall, the hurricane spawned four confirmed tornadoes. One touched down near Brandon, Mississippi, destroying a barn and causing other damage. Another struck Kaplan, Louisiana, injuring one person. The storm's effects in Mississippi were described as minimal and were mainly confined to minor traffic accidents during bouts of heavy precipitation. Light to moderate rainfall from the storm extended as far east as Florida and Georgia and as far west as Oklahoma and Texas.|$|E

Entering Sloan's office, he is surrounded by Fox, Gunsmith and the remaining assassins. Wesley discloses Sloan's deception, to which Sloan reveals that {{the names of those}} present had legitimately come up in the Loom, and that he had acted to protect them. He gives the members a choice: kill themselves, per the code, or kill Wesley and use their skills to control the world. As the others choose the latter, Fox curves a bullet around the room, choosing to follow the code and kill everyone, including herself, but not before throwing her gun to Wesley. Sloan escapes in the mayhem.|$|E

40|$|In network virtualization, when a {{disaster}} hits a physical network infrastructure, {{it is likely}} to break multiple virtual network connections. So, after {{a disaster}} occurs, the network operator has to schedule multiple teams of <b>repairmen</b> to fix the failed components, by considering that these elements may be geographically dispersed. An effective schedule is very important as different schedules may result in very different amounts of time needed to restore a failure. In this study, we introduce the multiple traveling <b>repairmen</b> problem (MTRP) for post-disaster resilience, i. e., to reduce the impact of a disaster. Re-provisioning of failed virtual links is also considered. We first formally state the problem, where our objective is to find an optimal schedule for multiple teams of <b>repairmen</b> to restore the failed components in physical network, maximizing the traffic in restored virtual network and with minimum damage cost. Then, we propose a greedy (GR) and a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, and we measure the damage caused by a disaster in terms of disconnected virtual networks (DVN), failed virtual links (FVL), and failed physical links (FPL). Numerical result shows that both proposed algorithms can make good schedules for multiple <b>repairmen</b> teams, and SA leads to significantly lower damage in terms of DVN, FVL, and FPL than GR...|$|R
