25|$|The gorgonopsians {{still had}} some {{primitive}} features: no bony secondary palate (but other {{bones in the}} <b>right</b> <b>places</b> to perform the same functions); sprawling forelimbs; hindlimbs that could operate in both sprawling and erect postures. But the therocephalians ("beast heads"), which appear to have arisen {{at about the same}} time as the gorgonopsians, had additional mammal-like features, e.g. their finger and toe bones had the same number of phalanges (segments) as in early mammals (and the same number that primates have, including humans).|$|E
25|$|In {{the diagram}} of a Petri net (see top figure <b>right),</b> <b>places</b> are {{conventionally}} depicted with circles, transitions with long narrow rectangles and arcs as one-way arrows that show connections {{of places to}} transitions or transitions to places. If the diagram were of an elementary net, then those places in a configuration would be conventionally depicted as circles, where each circle encompasses a single dot called a token. In the given diagram of a Petri net (see right), the place circles may encompass more than one token to show {{the number of times}} a place appears in a configuration. The configuration of tokens distributed over an entire Petri net diagram is called a marking.|$|E

Dunn & Co. stock brokerage company. With $20,000.00 borrowed from his father-in-law, he acquired a seat on the stock exchange. Canadian business at the time was still heavily dependent on investment money from the British financial markets and Dunn became an expert at raising foreign capital for the underwriting of securities as well as selecting the <b>right</b> <b>places</b> to invest. Articulate, outspoken, and with a personality that commanded respect, Dunn had already made contacts with a number of influential people, including a number of railroad executives, {{one of the most powerful}} group of entrepreneurs of the day.|$|E
25|$|Changes in DNA {{caused by}} {{mutation}} can cause errors in protein sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, {{in order to}} function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function in the <b>right</b> <b>places</b> at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays {{a critical role in}} the body, a medical condition can result. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of Drosophila suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, this will probably be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. Studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.|$|E

500|$|Publishers Weekly {{gave the}} book a starred review, stating, [...] "This subtle, {{brilliant}} {{examination of the}} period between the War of Independence and the Louisiana Purchase puts Pulitzer-winner Ellis (Founding Brothers) among the finest of America's narrative historians." [...] Jon Meacham, reviewing the book for The New York Times, called the book [...] "illuminating", writing that it goes [...] "beyond the familiar critique of the founding to explore a point that remains underappreciated: that America was constructed to foster arguments, not to settle them". Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times also praised the book, writing that [...] "It is Ellis's achievement that he leaves us with a keen appreciation of the good fortune America had in having the right men in the <b>right</b> <b>places</b> at the right times".|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Black Coffee" [...] was {{met with}} {{universal}} acclaim from music critics. Simon Evans writing in the Birmingham Post described the song as a [...] "beautiful slice of haunting, hypnotic pop". Tim de Lisle of The Mail on Sunday called it a [...] "wispy but beguiling piece" [...] and said that Orbit's [...] "floaty atmospheres proved {{to be perfectly suited}} to the girls' slender voices". John Mulvey of The Scotsman praised its [...] "sleek, scrupulously mature sound". Siobhan Grogan of the NME found the track [...] "almost perfect", complimenting its [...] "mellow, glossy haziness", and concluding: [...] "It's wistful in all the <b>right</b> <b>places</b> and makes sadness sound rather alluring like only the bitterest love songs can." [...] Julie MacCaskill of the Daily Record believed that the song was a testament to the group's [...] "pop power". Jon O'Brien from AllMusic felt that [...] "Black Coffee" [...] was among All Saints' most accomplished and mature work, praising its [...] "lush" [...] electronics.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{this episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that though it was [...] "funny in all the <b>right</b> <b>places,</b> this is an episode of two distinct stories, neither of which mesh together. The whole Ed Begley, Jr. saving the forest bit {{seems to have been}} tacked on, as if the stuff about Homer finding his name being abused (shades of Mr. Sparkle again?) ran out of steam. Not a bad show, more a sort of 'So what?' show." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating, commenting that [...] "it has a number of really funny scenes and memorable lines", but overall [...] "the storyline didn't really have anywhere to go and the final half of the third act is a complete waste of time." [...] Morgan Larrick of About.com noted [...] "Homer to the Max" [...] as [...] "one of the most unforgettable episodes" [...] when reviewing the complete tenth season.|$|E

500|$|The protein {{products}} of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of pleiotropy, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element {{just a few hundred}} base pairs long, the pleiotropic eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls [...] "scores to hundreds" [...] of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each. All this complexity enables genes involved {{in the development of the}} embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the <b>right</b> <b>places.</b> Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.|$|E
500|$|Membership in the Sex Pistols had a {{progressively}} destructive {{effect on}} Vicious. As Lydon later observed, [...] "Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly {{he was a}} big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the <b>right</b> <b>places,</b> adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid." [...] Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from {{the other members of the}} band. Lydon later wrote, [...] "We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission.... Only she didn't want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her.... She was so utterly fucked up and evil." [...] Lydon also admits to regretting introducing the two in The Filth and the Fury.|$|E
500|$|Will Friedwald {{wrote of}} Evancho's 2017 concert series at Café Carlyle, that [...] "this superhuman voice {{is housed in}} the person of someone {{relatively}} inexperienced in terms of relating to an audience and especially in a New York nightclub. (It will be years, if ever, before she can connect with a crowd like, for instance, Marilyn Maye.) ... She covers a lot of bases musically. ... Her rendition of [...] "Music of the Night" [...] is especially moving. ... Hearing Jackie Evancho in such an intimate space is a rare chance to experience perfection at close proximity." [...] Linda Amiel Burns, however, wrote of the piano-only accompaniment that additional instrumentation [...] "would have made the arrangements more interesting and exciting". She praised Evancho's voice but thought that some of the song choices were odd, and that sometimes [...] "it was difficult to understand the lyrics." [...] She felt that Evancho sounded more comfortable in her classical selections, but that pop songs require [...] "a different vocal technique with more emphasis on the lyrics ... she has to watch her phrasing ... breathe in the <b>right</b> <b>places,</b> and find the deeper meaning and longing that the song expresses." ...|$|E

500|$|The Los Angeles Times film critic, Charles Champlin, {{explained}} that the Director's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival [...] "came into being {{as one of the}} consequences of the political turmoil that aborted the festival in 1968. It is designed to make the festival a less than totally establishment affair and it offers Third World, independent and frequently angry films on social themes." [...] He further {{explained that}} Carradine's Americana was [...] "an ideal selection for the fortnight." [...] In fact, the film won the People's Choice Award there in 1981. Film columnist Christopher Hicks stated that Americana was also warmly received at the 1981 United States Film and Video Festival in Park City, Utah. [...] This was the third of such events which would later become known as the Sundance Film Festival. Carradine said of the audience's reaction to the film, [...] "Well, they laughed in all the <b>right</b> <b>places,</b> and they applauded at the end, so I guess it went alright." [...] He also said, [...] "Americana swept the festival and I came very close to making a distribution deal with Warner Brothers."
