40|$|The {{quality of}} patient care is {{critically}} influenced by the availability of accurate information and its efficient management. Radiation oncology consists of many information components, for example there may be information related to the patient (e. g., profile, disease site, stage, etc.), to people (radiation oncologists, <b>radiological</b> <b>physicists,</b> technologists, etc.), and to equipment (diagnostic, planning, treatment, etc.). These different data must be integrated. A comprehensive information management system is essential for efficient storage and retrieval of the enormous amounts of information. A radiation therapy patient information system (RTPIS) has been developed using open source software. PHP and JAVA script {{was used as the}} programming languages, MySQL as the database, and HTML and CSF as the design tool. This system utilizes typical web browsing technology using a WAMP 5 server. Any user having a unique user ID and password can access this RTPIS. The user ID and password is issued separately to each individual according to the person&#x 2032;s job responsibilities and accountability, so that users will be able to only access data that is related to their job responsibilities. With this system authentic users {{will be able to use}} a simple web browsing procedure to gain instant access. All types of users in the radiation oncology department should find it user-friendly. The maintenance of the system will not require large human resources or space. The file storage and retrieval process would be be satisfactory, unique, uniform, and easily accessible with adequate data protection. There will be very little possibility of unauthorized handling with this system. There will also be minimal risk of loss or accidental destruction of information...|$|R

40|$|With great sadness {{we learned}} that John Howarth, former President of NCHC (1988), passed away February 21, 2011. He was a leading figure in honors {{education}} and NCHC from its earliest days when he was appointed director of the University of New Mexico Honors Program in 1971. John studied physics at Cambridge University and received his PhD in physics from the University of London in 1963. He was then invited to New Mexico {{to serve as a}} <b>radiological</b> <b>physicist</b> at the Lovelace Clinic in New Mexico and joined the physics department at the University of New Mexico in 1964. His work as honors director at New Mexico was followed by his appointment as honors director at the University of Maryland, College Park in 1978. Though John was {{also a member of the}} physics department at UMCP, the possibilities of honors education captured his imagination more and more. While at the University of Maryland, John introduced several innovative approaches to honors education that remain important today. He introduced the idea of learning communities into the honors curriculum and developed that model of education to reach out to high school teachers in the Washington D. C. area, arranging for them to spend a sabbatical leave embedded in the Maryland honors program. He integrated various developmental models, including the work of William Perry, into the honors program, and he became widely known as an innovator and explorer both in his own classes and the NCHC. He spoke frequently about his insights into education and the processes of learning at national and regional conferences. His love of learning and of learning about learning became a defining and enduring characteristic of NCHC...|$|E
40|$|My {{bachelor}} thesis {{focus on}} Centre of rotation stability for Infinia cameraAt my work I got closely familiarize with scintillation camera Infinia Hawkeye, {{which is located}} in the department of nuclear medicine in the České Budějovice. The aim of my work was to determine whether the centre of rotation (C. O. R.) takes place around a fixed axis, and thus whether there is not movement. The method that I chose to accomplish my goals, was to test the camera, which was performing by 360 ° acquisition around a point source 99 mTc. The point source was fitted to a rod and placed on the Infinia camera on patient's pallet. Testing was carried out with two collimators LEHR and LEGP in modes H and L. The testing was performed by <b>radiological</b> <b>physicist,</b> always in the afternoon to ensure smooth running of the workplace. The test confirmed my hypothesis that the value will be within the values specified by the manufacturer. Testing was performed once a month for half a year. In In this days because we are apperceiving tremendous technological progress, and devices which allow us to produce more perfectly and detailed images and contribute to better diagnosis and treatment are created {{it is very important to}} ensure the quality control. Over the last few years progress in gamma camera designs, have improved all aspects of image quality, particularly in tomographic images. As the system complexity increases, it becomes more important that all nuclear medicine employees are able to recognize the various types of aberrations or artefacts that can occur in nuclear medicine imaging systems. The primary purpose of the quality control program in department for nuclear medicine is to verify that the images accurately reflect distribution of the radiopharmaceutical within the patient. The purpose of quality control is detect changes of gamma camera system that may adversely affect the interpretation of clinical studies. There are large number of factors that contribute to the final quality of the image (including uniformity, resolution - both intrinsic and energy, pulse frequency, centre of rotation system, rotational stability of the detector head). On a everyday examinations there is a limited amount of time that can be reasonably devoted to quality control system. Hence the main goal of quality control program should be to monitor those parameters that are most sensitive to changes in system performance and are most likely to impact clinical studies. Therefore, the main objective of quality control program should be monitor the parameters that are most sensitive to changes in system performance and most likely have a impact on the clinical studies. Specials series of quality control tests were designed to ensure the optimal performance of the camera. Over the whole time of the entire period of clinical operation, technicians or physicists regularly perform various quality control tests, some daily, others weekly or monthly. The purpose of these tests is monitor day to day camera performance and detect changes from the baselines values. Additional quality control test may be performed to compare characteristics of different systems and to optimize the quality of clinical studies...|$|E

All medical physicists should be knowledgeable about radiological emergencies and prepared to respond to an emergency if one occurs in their vicinity. Four types of radiological emergency would potentially expose large numbers of people to high amounts of radiation and require an emergency response that involves medical physicists. These types of events are (1) the detonation of a nuclear weapon or improvised nuclear de- vice, with an impact on the order of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombs, or possibly larger; (2) a crisis at a nuclear power plant, including...|$|R
40|$|This work aims {{to develop}} a {{methodology}} for determining the qualitative composition of an expert group and the weighting factor regarding the importance of expert’s judgments {{for the purpose of}} participating in decision-making. It is based on the expert’s overall work experience, experience in solving tasks, level of education and scienti fi c record, interest in solving the particular task, current position and awareness of how to solve the task. This study also considered the relevance of the expert’s knowledge and the overall self-evaluation concerning their total competence in solving the task. For the purpose of validating the methodology, 96 potential experts (physicians, biomedical engineers, <b>radiological</b> assistants, medical <b>physicists,</b> etc.) from 72 health facilities in the Czech Republic were interviewed through a web-based questionnaire. The calculation model that was selected was able to eliminate errors in estimating the proportionality of extreme values and reduces the impact of uncertainty in the experts’ overall self-evaluations concerning their total competence. A statistically signi fi cant correlation was found between the complex weighting factor and the following characteristics: the expert’s experience in dealing with similar tasks (r = 0. 512, p < 0. 001), the expert’s theoretical background (awareness) and the relevance of the expert’s knowledge (r = 0. 440, p < 0. 001), the expert’s current position (r = 0. 319, p = 0. 002) and the level of his or her education and scienti fi c record (r = 0. 280, p = 0. 007).

40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) images {{are used for}} diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines. In Japan, the number of facilities that own diagnostic CT equipment, the number of CT scanners, {{and the number of}} CT examinations increased by approximately 1. 4 -, 1. 5 -, and 1. 6 -fold between 2005 and 2014, respectively. CT operators (medical <b>radiological</b> technologist, medical <b>physicist,</b> and physician) must understand the radiation exposuredoses for examinations at their own institutions and carefully approach each examination. In addition, the patients undergoing the examination (as well as his/her family) must understand the effective dose of each examination {{in the context of the}} cumulative dose. The numbers of pediatric patients (aged 0 - 5 years) and total patients who underwent CT at Hirosaki University Hospital between January 2011 and December 2015 were surveyed, and effective doses administered to children aged 0, 1 and 5 years were evaluated. Age-and region-specific conversion factors and dose-length products obtained from the CT scanner were used to estimate the effective doses. The numbers of CT examinations performed in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 were 16, 662, 17, 491, 17, 649, 18, 242 ，and 18, 206, respectively, of which 1, 052 (1. 2 %) of the overalltotal involved children aged 0 - 5 years. The estimated effective doses per examination to children aged 0, 1, and 5 years were 5. 6 ± 4. 1, 4. 4 ± 3. 1, and 2. 9 ± 2. 8 mSv, respectively. This large variation was attributed to several factors associated with scan methods and ranges in actualsetting. In conclusion, the need for individual patient prospective exposure management systems and estimations of low-dose radiation exposure should be considered in light of the harmful effects of exposure. This study will encourage medical staffs to recognize and understand the effective dose estimation and help to the necessity and introduction of radiation dose management system for each child...|$|R
