50|$|Robersonville soon {{developed}} into {{a leader of the}} industrial revolution, which has characterized the economy of Martin County in the last half-century. In 1910, the Robersonville Hosiery and Manufacturing Co. was incorporated. In 1912, the firm was reorganized as Robersonville-Tar River Hosiery Mill, Inc. The ruins of this brick building still stand on the corner of N. Railroad and Mill Streets. Most of the industry - a large cotton ginning plant, lumber mills, and grist mills - {{in the early part of}} the 20th century focused on the handling of agricultural or lumber products. Southeastern Tobacco Co. operated a large tobacco <b>redrying</b> and stemming plant for many years. John Henry Roberson, Jr., a direct descendent of the founders of Robersonville, owned his own farm south of Robersonville, and was involved in many civic affairs with his brothers David Roberson and Grover H. Roberson. Grover H. Roberson left the Robersonville area in early 1940 to join the U.S. Navy. Grover saw action at the Battle of Anzio. After the Battle of Anzio, Grover was in the company of a group of other naval officers and had a special audience with Pope Pius XIV at the Vatican in Rome, Italy. Some of the early industries were not directly related to agriculture. The D.B. Parker Buggy Co. began in 1903 and operated until its product was replaced by the automobile. Established in 1905, the Carolina Brick Co. made ornamental bricks with a capacity of 30,000 daily. Since the late 1950s, a wider range of industry has appeared. In 1958, a poultry processing company was opened by Austin Farms. This plant was later purchased by Central Soya of Athens, Inc. and then later owned by Perdue. Also in 1958, Robersonville Manufacturing Co. was chartered as a maker of children's clothes. John Henry Roberson, Jr. lived on Broad Street and worked in the local tobacco market for many years. It expanded and was acquired by Blue Gem, which had its origins as the Hamilton Pants Manufacturing Company. Later it was changed to Southern Apparel. Robersonville Products Co. opened in 1970. As a division of Hallmark, it produced display fixtures for retail stores. After closing in 1993, the building was used by Empire Brush Company. Also in 1970, Blue Ridge Shoe Co. opened and began making children's shoes. Later the building was bought by Sandra Manufacturing Co., a sewing plant later known as Generation II, and then later as Ithaca Inc. and recently Caraustar. Microcell Corp., a hydrogen fuel company is moving into the old Caraustar building. Carolina Peanuts was started by locals as a small company but later grew after being acquired by Anheuser-Busch. Eagle Snacks later changed to Guy Snacks and is now known as Ann's House of Nuts. For a few years, W.M. Green had a catalog showroom. Today the town's biggest entertainment venue is East Carolina Motor Speedway, a racetrack. East Carolina Motor Speedway opened its first season in 1989 with the thoughts of having a much needed attraction for racing fans throughout Eastern North Carolina. This D-shaped, 3/8 mile track has 24 degree banking in its turns as well as 10 degree banking on its straight-a-ways. The track is 40 feet wide, allowing cars to run three-wide for added excitement to its spectators. The grandstand can seat 3,000 fans and VIP booths located in turn four provide a first-class view of the entire track and pit area. The Filling Station Restaurant has an interesting historical artifact. Go check out the work of art while enjoying a delicious meal. In the 1940s, Bill Bemis worked at Jim Johnson's store in nearby Gold Point, North Carolina and painted pictures for a hobby. Using enamel paints, he created a mural on the inside walls of the store. The mural depicts then store owner Jim Johnson and his daughters Mable and Peggy and their dog, in a fox hunt scene. This store was later called the Grant Vandiford store until it was moved to Robersonville to be part of the dining room of the Filling Station Restaurant. After the move, Bill Bemis retouched his work, so, the fox hunt mural is as bright and colorful today as it was 60 years ago.The volunteer fire department was first organized in 1924 with William Gray as the first fire chief and police chief. The rescue squad was organized in 1959 and was the first one in Martin County. It was sponsored by the Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jay Cee's) under the leadership of John L. House and Robert E. Lee. A municipal building houses the police, fire, and rescue departments as well as the public library. Town council meetings are held 2nd Tuesday of every month at 7:30 p.m. in the Paul D. Roberson Boardroom at the Town Hall, located in the old Wachovia Bank building at 114 S. Main Street. Most of the meetings are open to the public. Although the railroad has been replaced by the new US 64 Bypass as the town’s main link to the outside world, Robersonville continues to thrive, providing needed services, industry and entertainment to local and out-of-town residents alike.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{physiological}} and biochemical responses of Douglas-fir seeds to stratification, <b>redrying,</b> storage and subsequent germination were determined. Stratification increased seed vigor, embryo and gametophyte phosphorylative efficiency and RNA synthetic ability. <b>Redrying</b> seems {{to increase the}} rate of enthryonic nucleic acid synthesis, speed of germination and seedling vigor. ATP, total adenosine phosphates and energy charge levels of stratified seed were stable through air drying. RNA levels were markedly reduced during 1 and 3 months of cold storage possibly indicating an enhanced RNAse activity. Storage also reduced seed energy status, seed viability, and seed vigor. The loss of stratification benefits and subsequent deterioration throughout storage were similar in stratified and redried stratified seeds. None of the biochemical criteria studied in the 5 -day-old seedling showed close proportionality with either physiological responses or biochemical changes obtained in the seed stage.

Targeted water- or FR-loading levels were no FR (0 % FR-weight gain, water-treated control), 32 kg/m 3 FR (∼ 5 % weight gain), 64 kg/m 3 FR (∼ 10 % weight gain), and 96 kg/m 3 FR (∼ 15 % weight gain). All water- or FR-treated strands were <b>redried</b> to less than 8 % moisture content prior to diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) resin appli cation in rotary blenders using an aerosol sprayer. Three replicate specimens for each treatment level of 12. 5 -mm-thick, randomly oriented strandboard at a density of 650 kg/m 3 were evaluated. FR-treated strandboard had higher dry- and wet-internal bond strength and lower flexural strength than matched untreated strandboard. A Class B flame-spread rating was achieved near 10 % FR-loading. These results suggest that better ratings seem possible at higher loadings...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Poly(ester {{urethane}} ureas) (PesURUs) and poly(ether urethane ureas) (Pe-tURUs) synthesized from diphenylmethane- 4, 49 -diisocyanate and poly(butylene adi-pate) diol, and poly(tetramethylene oxide) diol or poly(propylene oxide) diol, respec-tively, were hydrolyzed at 70 °C {{for various}} periods up to 16 weeks. Differences in thermal and mechanical properties of as-received dry samples are {{correlated with the}} number and strength of hydrogen bonds formed between urea/urethane groups of hard segments and polyester or polyether groups of soft segments. Gel permeation chroma-tography measurements show that the molar mass of linear PesURUs markedly de-creases with the hydrolysis time, whereas that of linear PetURUs remains almost unaffected. PesURU crosslinked by polymeric isocyanate has lower crystallinity, but shows somewhat better resistance to hydrolysis than its linear counterpart because of its more stable three-dimensional molecular structure. Water uptake at 37 °C, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry thermograms de-termined for <b>redried</b> hydrolyzed specimens concurrently show that advancing hydroly-sis accounts for decrease in the crystallinity (if any) of soft polyester segments, in the efficacy of hydrogen bonding and in crosslinking density. Experimental data indicate that hydrolytic resistance of PetURUs is primarily determined by (1) the hydrolytic stability of individual types of present groups, (2) steric hindrances affecting the access of water molecules to these groups, and (3) the hydrophilicity of backbones. © 1998 Joh...|$|R
