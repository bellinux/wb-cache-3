40|$|IP over wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} (WDM) {{networks have}} been identified as promising candidates to underpin future telecommunication networks and thus industrial and academic researchers have been actively investigating key issues that affect the integration of IP and optical layers. An area of prime concern is network survivability. The main challenges within this domain are: to provide survivability schemes under different failure scenarios and {{to reduce the amount of}} required <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> while providing the required quality of service (QoS). Due to its flexibility and simplicity, one candidate technique is pre-allocated restoration. In this paper, the performance of pre-allocated restoration mechanisms are investigated considering a distributed GMPLS-based IP/WDM mesh network under single and dual-link failure scenarios. Several issues are considered. Firstly, two proposed <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation schemes are investigated; link partitioning and lightpath partitioning. Secondly, the paper evaluates a retrial scheme that supports the utilisation of <b>spare</b> <b>capacity.</b> Thirdly, proposed class prioritisation scheme applied to the differentiated survivability concept with pre-allocated restoration is investigated.

The more resources allocated to recovering a degraded input signal, the fewer resources, referred to as cognitive <b>spare</b> <b>capacity,</b> remain for higher-level processing of speech. Using simulated natural listening environments, the aims of this paper were to (1) evaluate an English version of a recently introduced auditory test to measure cognitive <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> that targets the updating process of the executive function, (2) investigate if the test predicts speech comprehension better than the reading span test commonly used to measure working memory capacity, and (3) determine if the test is sensitive to {{increasing the number of}} attended locations during listening. In experiment I, the cognitive <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> test was presented using a male and a female talker, in quiet and in spatially separated babble- and cafeteria-noises, in an audio-only and in an audio-visual mode.

In this work, two methods of assigning p-cycles in a wavelength division multiplexing network are compared over a range of topologies with different average node degrees. The joint capacity placement (JCP) method considers the working traffic and <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> jointly. The <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> placement (SCP) method assigns traffic to the shortest paths and then assigns p-cycles using the <b>spare</b> <b>capacity.</b> The joint capacity placement method provides ~ 35 % lower spare-to-working capacity ratio than the <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> method with ~ 7 % increase in working capacity cost. In addition, a topology with higher average node degree provides lower spare-to-working capacity ratios because more straddling links are possible.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of provisioning <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> in two-layer backbone networks using shared backup path protection. First, two <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation (SCA) optimization problems are formulated as integer linear programming (ILP) models for the cases of protection at the top layer against failures at the bottom layer. The first model captures failure propagation using overlay information between two layers for backup paths to meet diversity requirements. The second model improves bandwidth efficiency by moving <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> sharing from the top layer to the bottom layer. This exposes a tradeoff between bandwidth efficiency and extra crosslayer operation. Next, the SCA model for common pool protection is developed to allow <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> sharing between two layers. Our previous SCA heuristic technique, successive survivable routing (SSR) is extended for these optimization problems. Numerical results {{for a variety of}} networks indicate that the common pool protection is attractive to enhance bandwidth efficiency without loss of survivability and that the SSR heuristic quickly results in near optimal solutions.

40|$|Link {{failures}} in wide area networks are common. To recover from such failures, {{a number of}} methods such as SONET rings, protection cycles, and source rerouting have been investigated. Two important considerations in such approaches are the recovery time and the needed <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> to complete the recovery. Usually, these techniques attempt to achieve a recovery time less than 50 ms. In this paper we introduce an approach that provides link failure recovery in a hitless manner, or without any appreciable delay. This is achieved {{by means of a}} method called diversity coding. We present an algorithm for the design of an overlay network to achieve recovery from single link {{failures in}} arbitrary networks via diversity coding. This algorithm is designed to minimize <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> for recovery. We compare the recovery time and <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> performance of this algorithm against conventional techniques in terms of recovery time, <b>spare</b> <b>capacity,</b> and a joint metric called Quality of Recovery (QoR). QoR incorporates both the <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> percentages and worst case recovery times. Based on these results, we conclude that the proposed technique provides much shorter recovery times while achieving similar extra capacity, or better QoR performance overall...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} survivable mesh based {{communication}} networks has received considerable attention in recent years. One {{task is to}} route backup paths and allocate <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> in the network to guarantee seamless communications services survivable {{to a set of}} failure scenarios. This is a complex multi-constraint optimization problem, called the <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation (SCA) problem. This paper unravels the SCA problem structure using a matrix-based model, and develops a fast and efficient approximation algorithm, termed successive survivable routing (SSR). First, per-flow <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> sharing is captured by a spare provision matrix (SPM) method. The SPM matrix has a dimension the number of failure scenarios by the number of links. It is used by each demand to route the backup path and share <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> with other backup paths. Next, based on a special link metric calculated from SPM, SSR iteratively routes/updates backup paths in order to minimize the cost of total <b>spare</b> <b>capacity.</b> A backup path can be further updated {{as long as it is}} not carrying any traffic. Furthermore, the SPM method and SSR algorithm are generalized from protecting all single link failures to any arbitrary link failures such as those generated by Shared Risk Link Groups or all single node failures. Numerical results comparing several SCA algorithms show that SSR has the best trade-off between solution optimality and computation speed.

The core of the network {{tends to be a}} meshed architecture equipped with Multi-Service Switches (MSSs). In the context of these emerging technologies, we propose a load-balancing <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> reallocation approach to improve network utilization in the next-generation SONET metro networks. Using our approach, carriers can postpone network upgrades, resulting in increased revenue with reduced capital expenditures (CAPEX). For the first time, we consider the <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> reallocation problem from a capacity upgrade and network planning perspective. Our approach can operate in the context of shared-path protection (with backup multiplexing) because it reallocates <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> without disrupting working services. Unlike previous <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> reallocation approaches which aim at minimizing total <b>spare</b> <b>capacity,</b> our load-balancing approach minimizes the network load vector (NLV), which is a novel metric that reflects the network load distribution. Because NLV takes into consideration both uniform and non-uniform link capacity distribution, our approach can benefit both uniform and non-uniform networks. We develop a greedy loadbalancing <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> reallocation (GLB-SCR) heuristic algorithm to implement this approach. Our experimental results show that GLB-SCR outperforms a previously proposed algorithm (SSR) in terms of established connection capacity and total network capacity in both uniform and non-uniform networks...|$|R

This thesis presents two policy-based models for evaluating the end-to-end (E 2 E) availability of an SBPP connection by assuming that {{no more than two}} simultaneous failures could possibly occur in the network. To minimize the redundancy while meeting the E 2 E availability requirement, a new parameter is defined for each connection, called protection level, which creates a framework of partial restoration from any unexpected failure. Based on the proposed availability model, two novel policy-based Linear Programming (LP) formulations are introduced - called failure-dependent and failure-independent policies, which aim to reconfigure the <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation for dynamic provisioning of SBPP connections. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed availability model and demonstrate the effectiveness of the <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> reconfiguration architecture.
