5|$|Critics {{praised the}} film's hard-line look at <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> Fuller's use of melodrama and metaphors {{to present his}} argument, and its {{somewhat}} disheartening ending that leaves the impression that while racism is learned, it cannot be cured. Reviewers consistently questioned the film's lack of wide release in the United States when it was completed and applauded its belated release by Criterion.|$|E

The attacker has never been identified.|$|E

5|$|After his {{appearance}} on Jeopardy!, Chu contacted publicists and PR firms {{to ask for}} {{suggestions on how to}} monetize the recognition from his Jeopardy! run. However, he found the proposals unappealing, and did not follow suggestions that he use the 'successful game theorist' image. Instead, he started writing a column for The Daily Beast, and later for Salon. Chu has written on various aspects of nerd culture and on being Asian American. He is a vocal critic of <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> online bullying, and is known for his opposition to the Gamergate movement.|$|E

The ultras scene of Bayern Munch has been recognized for certain groups taking stance against right-wing extremism, <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> homophobia, and in 2014 the group Schickeria München received the Julius Hirsch Award by the DFB for its commitment against antisemitism and discrimination.|$|E

5|$|By March 1964, MalcolmX {{had grown}} disillusioned with the Nation of Islam and its leader Elijah Muhammad. Expressing many regrets about {{his time with}} them, which {{he had come to}} regard as largely wasted, he embraced Sunni Islam. After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, which {{included}} completing the Hajj, he also became known as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. He repudiated the Nation of Islam, disavowed <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism, black self-determination, and black self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Caged Bird was {{nominated}} for a National Book Award in 1970 and remained on The New York Times paperback bestseller list for two years. It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, <b>racism,</b> <b>and</b> sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.|$|E
5|$|He {{wrote one}} of the first {{scientific}} treatises in the field of American sociology, and he published three autobiographies, each of which contains insightful essays on sociology, politics and history. In his role as editor of the NAACP's journal The Crisis, he published many influential pieces. DuBois believed that capitalism was a primary cause of <b>racism,</b> <b>and</b> he was generally sympathetic to socialist causes throughout his life. He was an ardent peace activist and advocated nuclear disarmament. The United States' Civil Rights Act, embodying many of the reforms for which DuBois had campaigned his entire life, was enacted a year after his death.|$|E

5|$|<b>Racism</b> <b>and</b> {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the NSDAP and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief {{in the existence of}} a superior master race. The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of the Aryan race.|$|E
5|$|<b>Racism</b> <b>and</b> {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the Nazi Party and the Nazi government. Discrimination and violent attacks against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power in 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazis to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Palestine, and other countries.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the passing}} of the Holocaust denial law in 1995, it is illegal to deny or attempt to justify the Holocaust. The act follows the Belgian Anti-Racism Law, passed in 1981, which led to the {{establishment}} of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, which researches <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> anti-Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination. Breendonk and Dossin Barracks (at the site of the former Mechelen transit camp) are preserved as museums to the Holocaust and to German repression in Belgium during the occupation.|$|E

5|$|The {{second game}} was {{initially}} postponed, but was forfeited by the White Sox {{the next day}} by order of American League president Lee MacPhail. Disco Demolition Night preceded, and may have helped precipitate, the decline of disco in late 1979; some scholars and disco artists have described the event as expressive of <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> homophobia while others have denied this connection. Disco Demolition Night remains well {{known as one of}} the most extreme promotions in major league history.|$|E
5|$|The story {{starts out}} as a fairly {{conventional}} adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on the potential autobiographical elements as well as hints of <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> the symbolism in the final lines of the work.|$|E
5|$|The three episodes {{were tied}} {{together}} by {{the story of a}} murdered Haitian domestic worker employed by wealthy philanthropist Felix Wilson, played by Jones. Protagonists Frank Pembleton and Al Giardello initially refuse to properly investigate the Wilson family out of respect for their success and contributions to the African American community of Baltimore, which leads to tensions and accusations of discrimination within the police department. The storyline serves as a rumination and commentary on <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> classism, even when they come from the best of intentions.|$|E

40|$|Perhaps {{no other}} prison riot has {{received}} as much notoriety as the uprising at Attica (New York). From the onset, Attica became {{a metaphor for}} numerous social problems, including <b>racism,</b> oppression, <b>and</b> injustice.

5|$|While {{attending}} Antioch College in {{the early}} 1960s, Gould {{was active in the}} civil rights movement and often campaigned for social justice. When he attended the University of Leeds as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a Bradford dance hall which refused to admit black people. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked. Throughout his career and writings, he spoke out against cultural oppression in all its forms, especially what he saw as the pseudoscience used in the service of <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> sexism.|$|E
5|$|Wong's {{image and}} career {{have left a}} notable legacy. Through her films, public {{appearances}} and prominent magazine features, she helped to humanize Asian Americans to white audiences {{during a period of}} overt <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> discrimination. Asian Americans, especially the Chinese, had been viewed as perpetually foreign in U.S. society but Wong's films and public image established her as an Asian-American citizen at a time when laws discriminated against Asian immigration and citizenship. Wong's hybrid image dispelled contemporary notions that the East and West were inherently different.|$|E
5|$|Among other things, {{the episode}} was {{inspired}} by the history of baseball in Roswell, as well as the infamous 1947 Roswell Incident. Jesse Martin was offered the lead guest role as Exley after Duchovny noticed him in a production of the musical Rent and an episode of Ally McBeal. Originally, Darren McGavin was cast as Arthur Dales, but after he suffered a stroke, he was replaced by Walsh. Many of the outdoor baseball scenes were filmed at Jay Littleton Ballfield, an all-wood stadium located in Ontario, California. The episode has been critically examined for its use of literary motifs, its fairy tale-like structure, and its themes concerning <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> alienation.|$|E
