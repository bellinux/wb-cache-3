5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to <b>reheating</b> than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by <b>reheating</b> within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, <b>reheating</b> occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.|$|E

25|$|Slag {{may also}} form during smithing and refining. The {{product of the}} bloomer process is {{heterogeneous}} blooms of entrapped slag. Smithing is necessary to cut up and remove the trapped slag by <b>reheating,</b> softening the slag and then squeezing it out.

25|$|The {{availability}} of a suitable catalyst {{is also an important}} factor in deciding whether to build an alkylation plant. If sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is used, significant volumes are needed. Access to a suitable plant is required for the supply of fresh acid and the disposition of spent acid. If a sulfuric acid plant must be constructed specifically to support an alkylation unit, such construction will {{have a significant impact on}} both the initial requirements for capital and ongoing costs of operation. Alternatively it is possible to install a WSA Process unit to regenerate the spent acid. No drying of the gas takes place. This means that there will be no loss of acid, no acidic waste material and no heat is lost in process gas <b>reheating.</b> The selective condensation in the WSA condenser ensures that the regenerated fresh acid will be 98% weight, even with the humid process gas. It is possible to combine spent acid regeneration with disposal of hydrogen sulfide by using the hydrogen sulfide as a fuel.|$|E

500|$|... "White" [...] {{cast irons}} contain their carbon {{in the form}} of cementite, or iron carbide (Fe3C). This hard, brittle {{compound}} dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723°C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and ferrite, which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle martensite. The steel can then be tempered by <b>reheating</b> to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite. The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-ferrite mixture, and that above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture.|$|E

40|$|Carbon dioxide is {{a natural}} {{refrigerant}} that has been considered for certain refrigeration and air conditioning applications. The coefficient of performance (COP) of carbon dioxide cycles is low compared to classical vapor compression cycles. The aim of {{this portion of the}} thesis is to present a thermodynamic analysis of carbon dioxide cycles in order to evaluate the potential performance of a refrigeration cycle using carbon dioxide. A thermodynamic model for the cycle is proposed which can simulate the operation of a carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle. This model takes into account the practical effects of the thermo-physical properties of carbon dioxide as a refrigerant in a trans-critical cycle. One and two-stage compression processes were considered for comparison purposes. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted so that cycle performance can be estimated. The effect of cycle components on system capacity and cycle performance was investigated. The second portion of the thesis deals with the concept of <b>reheat</b> air conditioning, and looks at the performance of different <b>reheat</b> cycles. The thesis looks at <b>reheat</b> systems that utilize different placements of the <b>reheat</b> coil. The overall performance of these <b>reheat</b> systems is then calculated. These systems require no additional electric power to <b>reheat</b> the air after it is cooled and dehumidified in the evaporator. Instead, they use heat from the condenser heat exchanger to <b>reheat</b> the air during partial load conditions. Four different <b>reheat</b> configurations are discussed and analyzed to determine performance levels. Visual Basic programs were written {{for each of the four}} cycles to simulate the different configurations and to evaluate key performance parameters. Graphs were developed based on these programs, where critical variables were changed to monitor trends in coefficient of performance. The thermodynamic cycle of each <b>reheat</b> configuration is developed, with equations presented with figures depicting the cycles. Refrigerant 134 a was used in the programs throughout the <b>reheat</b> section of the thesis. The <b>reheat</b> coefficient of performance is used as the basis for cycle comparison.
