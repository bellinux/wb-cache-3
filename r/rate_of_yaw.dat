30|$|Another {{critical}} component to {{be accounted for}} is {{the difference in the}} modelling of yaw maneuvers. Yaw maneuvers occur when the actual yaw angle differs from the nominal yaw angle. The nominal yaw angle is the orientation angle by which a satellite would maintain optimal solar visibility throughout its orbit, provided it could spin arbitrarily fast. The actual yaw angle is the orientation that the satellite can maintain due to its limited <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>yaw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{a typical}} jet {{aircraft}} has {{most of its}} mass distributed close to its centerline, and the aerodynamics in planes designed to be stable (such that small fluctuations in control tend to return it to attitude equilibrium) provide some stabilization, {{it is important to}} remember that aircraft realistically always fly with a small non-zero random <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>yawing</b> and pitching. Inertia coupling on an aircraft usually manifests itself as a downward pitching; rolling causes the tail mass to be flung upward and thus the nose to tip down. The pitching can in turn cause gyroscopic yawing.|$|R

The investigation is carried out on the 28 th March 1974 in Hyuga Nada on KEITEN MARU, Training Ship of the Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, by sailing her systematically toward eight points, under the condition of north wind with the velocity of 10 m/sec. Following tendencies are found out : 1) The occurrence <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>yawing</b> is the highest when wind and waves come on the beam. The rate on the starboard beam is, however, different from that on the port beam. 2) The occurrence rate is comparatively high when disturbance foces of wind and waves come on the starboard bow 45 degrees. And the rate is followed by that astern and then by that on the port bow 45 degrees. 3) This Training Ship has, without any connection with the direction of wind and waves, a tendency to drift toward starboard side, which requires a checking rudder of 2 ~ 3 degrees to port side. 4) In connection with the tendency mentioned above, the ship must be always steered correspondingly to port side. 5) The change of course to the right is able to be finished rapidly, to the left is, on the contrary, inactive and requires along time. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the application of an analytical model to determine the regions of a tandem wind turbine blade, operating in the wake of an upstream wind turbine, affected by dynamic stall. The wind conditions used as the input for the model were determined based on the Large Eddy Simulation of the turbine wake. The dynamic stall occurrence on the tandem wind turbine blade was studied {{as a function of the}} spacing between the wind turbines. It was observed that, even with an ambient turbulence intensity of 0. 5 % for the upstream wind turbine, approximately 30 % of the tandem wind turbine blade was under the influence of dynamic stall for spacing up to at least 20 turbine diameters. The main causes of dynamic stall on the tandem wind turbine blade were shown to be the increased turbulence intensity in the turbine wake and the large <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>yaw</b> angle experienced by the tandem wind turbine operating in the wake of the upstream turbine.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{estimation}} method for ships on collision courses taking crash astern maneuvers {{based on a}} new potential area of water (PAW) for maneuvering. A crash astern maneuver is an emergency option a ship can take when exposed {{to the risk of}} a collision with other ships that have lost control. However, lateral forces and yaw moments exerted by the reversing propeller, as well as the uncertainty of the initial speed and initial yaw rate, will move the ship out of the intended stopping position landing it in a dangerous area. A new PAW for crash astern maneuvers is thus introduced. The PAW is developed based on a probability density function <b>of</b> the initial <b>yaw</b> <b>rate.</b> Distributions <b>of</b> the <b>yaw</b> <b>rates</b> and speeds are analyzed from automatic identification system (AIS) data in Madura Strait, and estimated paths of the maneuvers are simulated using a mathematical maneuvering group model...|$|R

40|$|The {{onset of}} dynamic stall in {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines (HAWTs) {{is related to}} the rapid increase in the angle of attack caused by sudden changes in wind speed and direction. In order to relate the changes in wind speed and direction with the variations in the blade-section angle of attack, an analytical model is proposed to determine the regions of the blade affected by dynamic stall. The so-called threshold radius has been identified and defined as the percentage of the blade length from the horizontal axis wind turbines hub beyond which the probability of dynamic stall occurrence falls to zero. High quality wind data were acquired to determine the average wind conditions that serve as the model inputs. It is shown that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change of wind speed, due to gusts or the average turbulence, can cause large regions of dynamic stall on the wind turbine blade. Other parameters, such as the yaw misalignment and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>yaw</b> angle are shown to be the cause of asymmetrical distribution of threshold radius with azimuth and also serve to increase the affected regions. Finally it is shown that the type of airfoil used in the turbine blade also has a significant effect on the threshold radius due to the different limiting reduced frequencies.

The Lerwick was immediately found to be unstable in the air, {{on the water and}} not suited to [...] "hands off" [...] flying. The latter was a major problem in an aircraft designed for long-range patrols. Numerous adjustments, including the addition of a greatly enlarged single fin and an increase in the wing angle of incidence, failed to remedy its undesirable characteristics, which included a vicious stall and unsatisfactory <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> roll and <b>yaw.</b> In service, several aircraft were lost because of wing floats breaking off, suggesting this was a structural weakness. Persistent problems with the hydraulics resulted in bomb doors sometimes dropping open during flight.|$|R
50|$|Unless {{the vehicle}} is very short, {{compared}} to its height or width, these are about equal. Angular inertia determines the rotational inertia of an object for a given <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> rotation.The <b>yaw</b> angular inertia tends to keep the direction the car is pointing changing at a constant rate. This makes it slower to swerve or go into a tight curve, and it also makes it slower to turn straight again.The pitch angular inertia detracts from {{the ability of the}} suspension to keep front and back tire loadings constant on uneven surfaces and therefore contributes to bump steer.Angular inertia is an integral over the square of the distance from the center of gravity, so it favors small cars even though the lever arms (wheelbase and track) also increase with scale. (Since cars have reasonable symmetrical shapes, the off-diagonal terms of the angular inertia tensor can usually be ignored.)Mass near the ends of a car can be avoided, without re-designing it to be shorter, by the use of light materials for bumpers and fenders or by deleting them entirely. If most of the weight {{is in the middle of}} the car then the vehicle will be easier to spin, and therefore will react quicker to a turn.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a series of autorotation and torque tests on four different rotating wing systems at various <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> roll and at several angles <b>of</b> <b>yaw.</b> The investigation covered an angle of attack range up to 90 degrees and angles <b>of</b> <b>yaw</b> <b>of</b> 0 degree, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees. The tests were made in a 5 -foot, closed-throat atmospheric wind tunnel. The object of the tests was primarily {{to determine the effects of}} various angles <b>of</b> <b>yaw</b> on the rolling moments of the rotating wings up to large angles of attack. It was found that at angles of attack above that of maximum lift the rolling moments on the wings due to yaw (or side slip) from 5 degrees to 20 degrees were roughly of the same magnitude as those due to rolling. There was a wide variation in magnitude of the rolling moment due to yaw angle. The <b>rates</b> and ranges <b>of</b> stable autorotation for the monoplane models were considerably increased by yaw, whereas for an unstaggered biplane they were little affected. The immediate cause of the rolling moment due to yaw is apparently the building up of large loads on the forward wing tip and the reduction of loads on the rearward wing tip...|$|R

An evalu-ation {{of the first three}} years of the program indicates that the multidisciplinary approach has benefited a large segment of the population, which previously has had little or no access to medical care. This control program has also had an impact on other diseases and conditions. Yaws is the most important of the endemic treponemal diseases known in the Republic of Ghana. It is the second most common notifiable communicable disease in Ghana (after measles). Over 90070 of the active forms <b>of</b> <b>yaws</b> occur in chil-dren younger than 15 years of age [1]. The disease is most prevalent where there is overcrowding and where the standard of hygiene is low. The persons most commonly affected are those living in rural areas.
