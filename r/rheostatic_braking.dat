25|$|A common {{option on}} diesel–electric {{locomotives}} is dynamic (<b>rheostatic)</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent a}} runaway due to loss of brake pressure, dynamic (<b>rheostatic)</b> <b>braking</b> can be {{utilized}} so the locomotive(s) will assist in retarding the train. Often, blended braking, the simultaneous application of dynamic and train brakes, {{will be used}} to maintain a safe speed and keep the slack bunched on descending grades. Care would then be given when releasing the service and dynamic brakes to prevent draw-gear damage caused by a sudden run out of the train's slack.|$|E

50|$|Each coach weighs between 55 and 57 tonnes, {{with a total}} {{train weight}} of 281.9 tonnes for a 5-car set (227 tonnes for a 4-car set). The trains have {{air-operated}} (pneumatic) and <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brakes,</b> with an emergency stopping distance of 350m at 60 mph.|$|R
25|$|When the {{signalling}} on the Central line needed replacement by {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided to}} bring forward the replacement of the 1962 Stock, due at about the time as the replacement of the 1959 Stock. The signalling was to be replaced with an updated version of the Automatic Train Operation (ATO) system used on the Victoria line, the line traction supply boosted and new trains built. Prototype trains were built with two double and two single doors hung on the outside of each carriage of the train, and with electronic traction equipment that gave regenerative and <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|E
2500|$|To {{deal with}} {{increasing}} reliability problems, the Class 50 fleet was refurbished at Doncaster Works between 1979 and 1984. Doncaster had taken {{responsibility for the}} fleet after BR completed {{the purchase of the}} locomotives from English Electric. The work involved simplifying the complex electronics and removing redundant features such as slow speed control and <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking.</b> In addition, the air intake fan arrangement was modified, because the original setup often prevented fresh air from entering the engine room and stale, oil mist-filled air from escaping, leading to many main generator failures. This was in part due to the moisture in the air in the UK: dust and other particles would lodge in the filter system and become 'gummed up' with moisture, preventing circulation which in turn also hampered the intended engine compartment pressure levels which then meant 'filtered' air could not be evacuated by the intended means. The filtration system was fundamentally sound and widely used in other countries; the problems arose because relative humidity had not been taken into account at the design stage. This modification eliminated the characteristic droning [...] "sucking" [...] noise which had earned the [...] "Hoover" [...] nickname.|$|E
50|$|As a result, the rebuilt Class 18E {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> instead of regenerative braking. With <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking,</b> the energy {{generated by the}} traction motors is dissipated by the resistor grids on the locomotive itself. The <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> of the Class 18E was superior and very reliable for higher speed trains, compared with the regenerative braking of the older Classes 6E1 and 17E locomotives.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the {{solution for the}} modification of thebrakes on the electric railcar series 6111 used in suburban traffic. It also gives {{the results of the}} performed measurements aswell as their analysis. The mentioned electric railcar is fitted with air and rheostaticbrakes whose activation is mutually independent. Sincesuburban traffic means frequent slopping, and since the enginedriver does not use the <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brake</b> regularly, but only theair brake, the wear of the brake lining and wheels is higher, andthe heat load on the brake elements is substantial. By regularapplication of <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brake,</b> the air brake could be LLSed lessthus contributing to a lower wear of the friction elements.

50|$|The {{class is}} fitted with <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brakes</b> in {{addition}} to standard Westinghouse air brake equipment. A Time-Division Multiplexer (TDM) is fitted to enable two or more locomotives to work in multiple. It also allows a Class 90 to work a push-pull passenger train with a Driving Van Trailer (DVT), DBSO or Propelling Control Vehicle.|$|R
25|$|Neutral Bay wharf – Neutral Bay Junction: {{closed in}} May 1956. As {{mentioned}} above, this line had {{a combination of}} long, steep grades and windy track, and only trams fitted with track brakes (which were not otherwise used on the Sydney tramways) or dynamic (<b>rheostatic)</b> <b>brakes</b> were permitted. The single track down Hayes Street was the steepest unassisted in Sydney.|$|R

50|$|There {{were five}} 140 kW Brown Boveri {{traction}} motors, connected in parallel. Innovations in the E el-5 included forced ventilation for the traction motors, field weakening for high speed running and <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking.</b> The <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> was {{excluded from the}} Russian built locomotives, to save weight, but they still weighed several tons more than the E el-5.|$|E
50|$|Also, <b>rheostatic</b> type <b>braking</b> is possible, on {{a similar}} way used on {{experimental}} unit E636.082.|$|R
50|$|From 2001, {{seventeen}} Class 7E3 locomotives, sixteen Series 1, numbers E7260 to E7275, and one Series 2, no. E7276, underwent significant modifications. This {{included the}} installation of Hitachi micro-processor controls with improved <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brakes,</b> auxiliary inverters designed and built by Fuji, and the conversion from double cab to single cab since the no. 2 end cab space was required {{for some of the}} new equipment. These modified single-cab locomotives were reclassified to Class 7E4.|$|R
50|$|The new {{vehicles}} were a {{steel frame construction}} with a rounded roof and four double sliding doors for passengers on each side. There were also doors for the driver and escape doors at the non-driving ends. Instead of ventilation flaps in the windows, pressure ventilation was used. Each car had four motors of 100 kW each, <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brakes</b> and electrically controlled pneumatic brakes. Scharfenberg couplers were used, and the vehicles were equipped with multiple unit traction control.|$|R
50|$|As of 12/05, all WCAM-3 locos {{had been}} {{retrofitted}} with roof-mounted <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> grids.|$|E
50|$|The railcars could brake by {{reversing}} the traction current, <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking,</b> and a mechanical brake.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{makes use}} of either regenerative or <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking,</b> as the situation demands. Both traction and electric braking power are continuously variable with the electric braking optimised {{to such an extent}} that maximum use will be made of the regenerative braking capacity of the 3 kV DC network, with the ability to automatically change over to <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> whenever the overhead supply system becomes non-receptive.|$|E
50|$|The {{stock was}} made up of three two-car units, a 16.030 m driving motor and a 14.970 m trailer, each with four pairs of doors on each side and seating 32 people. The stock had a public address system and <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brakes</b> on the driving motor. Although there are {{technical}} differences, units of different ages can be coupled together and since the 1991-94 refurbishment there are no visual differences. The stock was unpainted until refurbishment, then painted red, white and blue.|$|R
5000|$|Auxiliary {{electrical}} supply is taken via a step-down chopper to a 525 V DC supply; {{there are four}} [...] (380 V max) three-phase inverters. Two of them supply variable speed and voltage power for cooling fans for the traction motors, transformer, <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brake,</b> locomotive main electronics block. Another one supplies fixed voltage and frequency (air compressor, oil pumps, other loads), the inverters are switchable with one unit providing redundancy. Additionally there are two 72 V 40 A inverters for battery charging.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 2000, {{seventeen}} Class 7E3 locomotives, sixteen Series 1, numbered in {{the range}} from E7260 to E7275, and one Series 2, no. E7276, underwent significant modifications. This included the installation of Hitachi micro-processor controls with improved <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brakes,</b> auxiliary inverters designed and built by Fuji Electric, Thelma and Cutler-Hammer rheostat grids, fans by Donkin Fans in Port Elizabeth, and conversion from double-cab to single-cab since the no. 2 end cab space was required for some of the new equipment which was installed. These single-cab locomotives were reclassified to Class 7E4 and the first of them entered service early in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Dynamic (<b>rheostatic)</b> <b>braking</b> {{on the two}} Driving Motor coaches is {{available}} in addition to disc brakes, via a system of brake blending.|$|E
5000|$|... 313s have <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> (which was {{disabled}} on London Overground) {{in addition}} to conventional three-step air-operated disc braking. During braking if wheelslide is detected by the Wheel slide protection (WSP), <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> is disabled and disc-braking only is used. Great Northern units have sanding equipment. Unlike some other DMU/EMU classes, additional brake force is not available when the emergency brake application is initiated and is the equivalent force of a step 3/full service application. WSP is still active when making an emergency application.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> {{was used}} on the trains, and {{required}} amendments to the standard P.C.M. (Pneumatic Camshaft Motor) controllers, to include the switching in of the rheostats. When the train was to be stopped, <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> was used first, after which friction brakes on the trailer cars were brought into action. If required, friction brakes on the motor cars could also be used. The <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> fades as the speed drops below 10 mph, and so slow speed braking was always by friction brake. As on the 1960 Stock, traction was supplied by four motors, one on each axle. The motors on each bogie were wired in series permanently, and the traction controller performed series/parallel switching of the pairs of motors. The handbrake used hydraulic power to apply it, and then remained locked on until hydraulic pressure was used to release it.|$|E
50|$|During {{this time}} a {{proposal}} was made about building a Bo-Bo+Bo-Bo electric locomotive, which would essentially be a pair of EW class locomotives permanently coupled together as one locomotive. This was initially classified EWO, but later received the classification EX. However, this did not proceed as the CME felt {{that it would not}} be possible to re-engineer the EW class, which had been designed to work in Wellington, for the 1 in 33 gradients between Arthur's Pass and Otira. The locomotives would also need major alteration such as the fitting of <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brakes,</b> as used on the EO class, and multiple-unit equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was developed}} after a previous class WAP-1 was found inadequate to haul the longer, heavier express trains (24-26 coaches) that were becoming {{the mainstay of}} the Indian Railways network. It was introduced in 1994, with a similar bodyshell to the WAP-1 class, but with Hitachi traction motors. Electricals are traditional DC loco type tap changers, driving 6 traction motors arranged in Co-Co fashion. This locomotive {{has proved to be}} highly successful, with over 750 units in service. Newer examples have been fitted with Microprocessor Controlled diagnostics, Static Converter units (instead of arnos) and roof mounted Dynamic (<b>Rheostatic)</b> <b>Brakes.</b>|$|R
25|$|New {{cars were}} {{purchased}} from Milnes Voss for these extensions, numbered 106 to 115, and they entered service on 28 March. These vehicles were a new departure for Nottingham, having normal staircases and top-covered bodies. The trucks were Mountain and Gibson 2IEM type, having M equipment and controllers. In {{addition to the}} usual slipper brake, hand <b>brake</b> and <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brake,</b> they had a magnetic runback brake. All had with wooden block slipper brakes, as were several of the earlier cars, and a fitter had {{to be kept in}} the Market Place fitting new blocks every two or three journeys for they quickly wore out, particularly on the Mapperley service.|$|R
5000|$|Series 1 {{locomotives}} {{have four}} braking systems, air brakes for the locomotive, train air braking, a handbrake and dynamic <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> which can dissipate [...]|$|E
5000|$|Bulgaria Railways ordered ER25 {{trainsets}} from Railcar Manufacturing plant of Riga. The plant projected <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> {{system for}} these trains. ER9p-101 electric trainset {{was equipped with}} such a brake. This train was tested on experimental circle track of CNII of Railroad Ministry. The <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking</b> was in use for lowering speed from 130 km/h down to 50 km/h. Then regular electro-pneumatic braking was in use. After that, the electric trainset entered Gorky Depot for a permanent use. It worked on common schedule with other ER9p electric trainsets.|$|E
5000|$|Dual-purpose main {{resistance}} modules which {{replaced the}} accelerating resistance system {{and which are}} used for motoring and <b>rheostatic</b> <b>braking.</b> The resistance blowers use AC motors which are powered through inverters.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1970s it was decided to {{electrify}} the line, {{in order to make the}} Black Forest Railway yet more flexible and economically attractive, and on 25 September 1977, the entire line was switched to full electrical operation. The work to electrify the line had been more complex than anticipated, particularly in the many tunnels, as the rail beds had to be lowered in those instances. Several unprofitable railway stations and other halts were also taken out of service at the time. It is also worth noting that, due to the many sections with steep inclines, locomotives of the type DB Class 139, with <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brakes,</b> were prominently seen in service.|$|R
500|$|The {{limit on}} axle load makes the {{locomotives}} small and compact. They weigh , {{and the total}} train weight is limited to [...] This also gives the trains a short length of [...] The trains had a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement. In addition to air brakes for the whole train, the locomotives are equipped with <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brakes</b> which is sufficiently powerful {{to allow for the}} 5.5 percent gradient. When braking, three of the motors are connected to the air-cooled resistance on the roof, while the last motor is connected to deliver magnetization current to the other three motors. The braking is regulated with 22 steps. As a backup, the units are equipped with a carborundum track brake {{on each side of the}} bogies.|$|R
40|$|Means {{of dealing}} with and {{compensating}} for line-voltage decreases in chopper-controlled regenerative-brake equipment are described. The method of correction involves using a <b>rheostatic</b> <b>brake</b> resistor which is commonly available in such equipment and requires no extra power electronic circuit components. Electric braking can be maintained under all specified line-voltage conditions, {{as well as with}} a short circuit on the power supply line. With this arrangement full protection of the traction and chopper equipment is provided. A fast acting controller is proposed consisting of a closed-loop peak-current inner feedback loop with an outer loop controlling average armature current. Results of practical tests on a 250 A 400 v chopper are supported by numerically predicted results, obtained using a digital computer. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
