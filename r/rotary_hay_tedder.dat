5000|$|There are few {{implements}} {{that give}} more general satisfaction in use or that are simpler in construction and operation than the <b>hay</b> <b>tedder.</b> Robert L. Ardrey, American Agricultural Implements The tedder came into {{use in the}} second half of the nineteenth century. While Charles Wendel claims in his Encyclopedia of American farm implements & antiques that the machine wasn't introduced to the United States until the 1880s, there are enough indications that the tedder was in use in the 1860s—The New York Times reports on its efficacy in 1868, and in that same year the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Agriculture in Maine comments on the American-made Hubbard's <b>hay</b> <b>tedder,</b> which had been on the market since 1863; according to the Maine report, in 1859 the machine was [...] "an implement lately imported from England." ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>tedder</b> (also called <b>hay</b> <b>tedder)</b> is {{a machine}} used in haymaking. It is used after cutting and before windrowing, and uses moving forks to aerate or [...] "wuffle" [...] the hay and thus {{speed up the}} process of hay-making. The use of a <b>tedder</b> allows the <b>hay</b> to dry ("cure") better, which results in {{improved}} aroma and color.|$|R
5000|$|American machines, such {{as those}} made by Garfield, by Mudgett, and by Bullard (Ezekiel W. Bullard of Barre, Massachusetts, is {{credited}} in one source with {{the invention of the}} machine, nicknamed [...] "the grasshopper"), typically used a system with a revolving crank {{in the middle of the}} arm and a lever at the upper end, or a system whereby rotating wheels moved the forks up and down. The first tedder widely available on the American market was the already mentioned Bullard's <b>Hay</b> <b>Tedder,</b> which had forks moving up and down on a compound crank, working in a motion described as [...] "the energetic scratching of a hen." [...] The American <b>Hay</b> <b>Tedder,</b> made by the Ames Plow Company of Boston and described in 1869 as a [...] "new machine, remarkable for its simplicity and perfection of working, was more like the British machine in its rotational operation.|$|R
5000|$|In an early, simple <b>hay</b> <b>tedder</b> {{described}} in 1852 and manufactured in Edinburgh {{by the company}} of Mr. Slight, the two wheels, via a spur wheel and a pinion, drive a set of light wheels, the [...] "rake wheels"; on these two rake wheels are mounted eight rakes, which pick up and disperse the hay. A later [...] "English hay-tedder" [...] uses two separate cylinders with rotating forks that can be reversed to lay the hay down lightly for improved exposure to air.|$|R
50|$|That night, Brougham sabotages {{the next}} morning’s hunt by laying a drag with a fox in a sack over the fields. He {{especially}} marks a blind spot behind a high wall, and moves a large <b>hay</b> <b>tedder</b> behind, intending for Gethryn (who {{has been given}} the honour of leading the hunt) to be impaled upon its lethal tines. Unbeknownst to Brougham, his plan goes awry when a farmer repositions the tedder early the next morning. The hunt commences but comes to a halt at the specified spot. Gethryn reveals to the gathered crowd that he discovered and removed the hay-tedder booby trap earlier that morning and, {{with the help of}} the lead fox hound, will detect the scent of the culprit amongst a group of hunt saboteurs. Brougham, once again disguised, is identified and runs off, mounting Derek's horse. When Derek shouts a command to the horse, the animal stops short, throwing Brougham and impaling him on the very same machine he intended for Gethryn.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the method of}} derivation of mathematical description of a cam orbit in <b>rotary</b> rakes (<b>hay</b> aggregators). At first, the authors describe basic construction elements of the <b>rotary</b> <b>hay</b> rake mechanism and their mutual links and relationships. Thereafter, they define the origin and {{the orientation of the}} system of coordinates, in which all calculations are carried out. In the next step they define basic requirements concerning the assurance of an optimum functioning of cam mechanisms as well as their transformation into mathematical equations. These requirements represent a base for the mathematical formulation of an optimum transition curve and it is emphasized that an optimum formulation of parameters of this curve is very important. In the course of calculation, they use also a normalized transition curve, which is used for the optimizations {{of the total number of}} parameters of the transition curve. Thereafter, they take into account mechanical and operational parameters of the hay aggregators and convert the optimum transition curve to that part of the space curve, which agrees at best with these parameters. Finally, the whole cam orbit is constructed using individual segments and presented as a sequentially defined space curve. Its individual parts concur sequentially to the level of the second derivation and are described as explicit mathematical functions of mechanical and operational parameters of the hay aggregator. The definition of the system of coordinates, the execution phase of calculations and the final shape of the cam orbit are illustrated in graphs...|$|R
50|$|Spangler {{was granted}} a patent on a grain {{harvester}} in 1887. He invented certain new and boring improvements such as the sliding tailboard made of sheet metal. He removed a standard tailboard and provided the sliding tailboard to regulate {{the width of the}} platform and adjust it to grain of different length. He also installed guards that prevented straw or grain from wrapping around the roller.Spangler invented a combined <b>hay</b> rake and <b>tedder</b> which was patented in 1893. By his peculiar arrangement, he was able to provide a combined <b>hay</b> rake and <b>tedder</b> in one machine, thereby reducing the cost. He formed a company for its sale which was unsuccessful and short-lived.|$|R

40|$|Based on a {{literature}} review {{for the period}} of 1982 – 2011, an analysis was performed of studies by various researchers concerning the exposure of private farmers to noise and vibration of the whole body with particular consideration of the annual exposure to these factors. The main sources of noise occurring in agriculture are: agricultural tractors mounted with a set of farm machinery, self-propelled machines, machinery for the production of fodder and workshop equipment. The review of literature showed that the highest values of equivalent exposure to noise (EA, T) or noise doses (d) were noted during the summer-autumn season and in spring. Mean noise levels for the entire year (of over 90 dB-A), considerably exceeded permissible values. The primary sources of the whole body vibration are agricultural vehicles including agricultural tractors of various types and self-propelled agricultural vehicles. In these vehicles vibration transmitted from the seat to the whole body is of basic importance. The measurements of vibration acceleration indicated that mechanical vibration on seats was produced while performing following activities: <b>hay</b> <b>tedding</b> and raking, sowing of fertilizers, aggregation of soil, grass mowing and cultivation. All of them may create a considerable health risk. These work activities are performed at elevated working speeds of tractors, most often along with hardened or uneven surfaces. In relation to the standard values (A(8) 40. 8 m/s 2), the mean daily vibration acceleration values remain below the permissible levels during all months of the year. However, considering the occurrence of mechanical shocks of high values (above the Maximum Acceptable Intensity) on agricultural vehicles there is a high risk for the spine problems among operators of agricultural vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{in determining the}} stage of the curing process at any given time was largely overcome in these studies by the perfection of a weighing device which enabled the operator to determine the moisture content of the hay as it was being cured in the field. The presence of living cells in the stems and leaves of field-cured hay plants was shown. The evidence and theories on heating of hay indicate that heating is due largely to chemical oxidation processes. These processes may be helped along by the respiration of the living cells in the plant up to 40 - 45 °C. and by the work of microorganisms from air temperatures to 70 ° C. in producing unstable, unsaturated compounds. It is believed that beyond this point the heating is due entirely to chemical processes. Alfalfa hay was found to cure more rapidly in the swath than in the windrow and more rapidly in the windrow than when cocked. Hay that was one-fourth, one-half or three-fourths cured in the swath prior to windrowing cured more rapidly than the hay windrowed at once, and the longer the hay was allowed to remain in the swath, the less time was required for curing. Cocking hay, either at once or after partial swath Or windrow-curing, delayed the curing process. Green hay in large cocks heated and lost its color. Good quality hay was made by cocking after partial swath or windrow-curing. Turning average sized windrows with the rake in good curing weather was found to be slightly detrimental as no appreciable time was gained {{and the quality of the}} hay was slightly lowered. Turning large windrows or windrows wet by rain caused them to cure more rapidly and gave a better quality of <b>hay.</b> <b>Tedding</b> <b>hay</b> was not found to be advantageous in any way in these experiments and was detrimental to the quality of the <b>hay.</b> The <b>tedder</b> may be valuable in curing extremely heavy swaths of hay. Complete swath-curing resulted in the greatest loss of leaves; three-fourth and one-half swath-curing were next in amount of leaves lost. Windrowing at once and one-fourth swath-curing followed by windrowing resulted in the least loss of leaves. The leaf-loss in swath-curing hay was increased by the use of the tedder. The turning of the windrow with the rake caused an additional leaf-loss in windrow-cured hay. DurIng these experiments hay was placed in the mow with as low as 20 percent and as high as 58. 7 percent of moisture. The degree of heating was not found to be directly proportional to the moisture content of the hay. Hay with below 30 percent of moisture ordinarily may be considered safe from heating to a destructive or dangerous degree. Hay with less than 27 percent of moisture may be expected to retain its green color. The hay generally heats immediately on being mowed, then cools; this is followed by a second heating period in which the highest temperature is usually reached in 8 to 10 days after mowing, after which the hay cools gradually. The amount of carbon dioxide present in the mow, is a fair indication of the degree of heating of the hay.. The accumulation of carbon dioxide in the presence of moist, hot material results in a transformation of the chlorophyll, accompanied by a change in color from green to brown. The green color of hay was usually destroyed when the heating exceeded 50 °C. Clean, brown hay is formed at temperatures above 55 °C. and below 70 °C. In general, moldy, grayish-brown hay results when hay heats to between 40 and 50 °C. during the storage period. Clean, brown hay is formed by heating quickly to 55 ° C., while if the heating is prolonged at 50 ° C. or less and later heats to above 55 °C., the hay is 2 ̆ 2 dusty. 2 ̆ 2 The value of salting hay in the mow was tested eight times, with a distinctly beneficial effect once, slightly beneficial once and apparently no benefit in six trials. When hay baled from the field with 23 percent of moisture was carefully stored, there was no detrimental heating...|$|R
2500|$|Traditional hay {{making in}} the Boho was a {{communal}} endeavour. Neighbours of the farmer and his family would gather round to help [...] "win" [...] the hay before any sign of rain. This was a long and arduous job compared to the modern process. Local people might even {{take a day off}} their regular job for this sole purpose. The meadow was cut using a scythe (originally), and then in more modern times by tractor with a side-mounted mower blade. The grass swathes would be turned over by means of a hay rake and if the grass was dry enough it would be [...] with a pitchfork. The person that was tedding would lift as much as he/she could with a pitchfork and then shake it out vigorously over the ground. Once the grass was dry enough, the loose hay would be gathered into rows with <b>hay</b> rakes (this <b>tedding</b> might be repeated depending on how dry the grass was). The rows could also be made into small [...] "laps" [...] or [...] "lappins" [...] which are circularised stacks of dried grass. The invention of a hay-right or tedding machine connected to the power take-off (PTO) of a tractor made tedding a lot less labour-intensive.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, haying has {{extended}} to Iberian Mediterranean dry grasslands potentially impacting on grassland bird ecology. We evaluated {{the impact of}} haying on a grassland bird community of South Portugal. Our main goals were: (1) to investigate the exposure of different species to haying, (2) to investigate potential removal of nests and dead birds from hayed fields by haying machinery using the ratio (REC) between the expected number of records {{and the number of}} records collected and (3) to link clutch destruction and bird mortality with haying management practices. Hayed fields were surveyed for signs of breeding and birds censused prior to mowing. Linear models were computed, linking the REC with haying machinery and sward properties. GLMs and model averaging were used to obtain models linking clutch destruction, bird mortality and haying management variables. Only 4 % of records evidenced successful nesting attempts (N[*]=[*] 177). REC evaluation suggested high nest or dead bird removal by the machinery, particularly in fields with lower vegetation biomass prior to cutting. Sickle bar mowers and one-rotor rotary rakes returned higher REC but lower probability of found nests removed from the original nesting sites comparatively to discs mowers and wheel rakes. Higher probabilities of mortality events were found in fields mown earlier (but not in all years). On the other hand, lower mortality was found in fields raked with two-rotor <b>rotary</b> rakes. Delayed <b>haying,</b> silage production in temporary crops and the use haying machinery enabling simultaneously mowing and gathering hay in lines are discussed as management alternatives...|$|R
