That plan was suspended and the MKSR Luch Constellation was defined. It deleted the heavier and more expensive Luch-4 and added a twin of the Luch-5A, the Luch-5V. The three orbital position used by this system would be the 95° east over the Indian Ocean, the 16° west, over the Atlantic Ocean and the 167° east over the Pacific Ocean.

40|$|Background: many {{patients}} with IBS suffer on-going symptoms. The evidence base is poor for IBS drugs {{but they are}} widely prescribed and advised in Guidelines. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can be helpful, but availability is poor in the NHS. We developed a web-based CBT self-management programme (<b>Regul</b> 8) in partnership with patients and trialled it and common IBS medications in an exploratory factorial RCT to test trial procedures and provide information for a larger trial. Methods: patients, 16 to 60 years, with IBS symptoms fulfilling Rome III criteria were recruited via GP practices and randomised to over-encapsulated mebeverine, methylcellulose or placebo for 6 weeks and to 1 of 3 website conditions: <b>Regul</b> 8 with a nurse telephone session and email support, <b>Regul</b> 8 with minimal email support, or no website. Results: 135 patients recruited from 26 GP practices. Mean IBS SSS score 241. 9 (sd 87. 7), IBS-QOL 64 (sd 20) at baseline. 91 % follow-up at 12 weeks. Mean IBS SSS decreased by 35 points from baseline to 12 weeks. There {{was no significant difference}} in IBS SSS or IBS-QOL score between medication or website groups at 12 weeks, or in medication groups at 6 weeks, or IBS-QOL in website groups at 6 weeks. However, IBS SSS at 6 weeks was lower in the No website group than the website groups (IBS SSS no website = 162. 8 (95 % CI 137. 4 - 188. 3), website 197. 0 (172. 4 - 221. 7), Website + telephone support 208. 0 (183. 1 - 233. 0) p = 0. 037). Enablement and Subjects Global Assessment of relief (SGA) were significantly improved in the <b>Regul</b> 8 groups compared to the non-website group at 12 weeks (Enablement = 0 in 56. 8 % of No website group, 18. 4 % website, 10. 5 % Website + support, p = 0. 001) (SGA; 32. 4 % responders in No website group, 45. 7 % website group, 63. 2 % website + support group, p = 0. 035) Conclusions: This exploratory study demonstrates feasibility and high follow-up rates and provides information for a larger trial. Primary outcomes (IBS SS and IBS QOL) did not reach significance at 6 or 12 weeks, apart from IBS SSS being lower in the no-website group at 6 weeks - this disappeared by 12 weeks. Improved Enablement suggests patients with access to the <b>Regul</b> 8 website felt better able to cope with their symptoms than the non-website group. Improved SGA score in the <b>Regul</b> 8 groups may indicate some overall improvement not captured on other measures.

40|$|Abstract Background IBS affects 10 - 22 % of the UK population. Abdominal pain, {{bloating}} {{and altered}} bowel habit affect quality of life, social functioning and time off work. Current GP treatment {{relies on a}} positive diagnosis, reassurance, lifestyle advice and drug therapies, but many suffer ongoing symptoms. A recent Cochrane review highlighted the lack of research evidence for IBS drugs. Neither GPs, nor patients have good evidence to inform prescribing decisions. However, IBS drugs are widely used: In 2005 the NHS costs were nearly £ 10 million for mebeverine and over £ 8 million for fibre-based bulking agents. CBT and self-management can be helpful, but poor availability in the NHS restricts their use. We have developed a web-based CBT self-management programme, <b>Regul</b> 8, based on an existing evidence based self-management manual and in partnership with patients. This could increase access with minimal increased costs. Methods/Design The aim is to undertake a feasibility factorial RCT to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} commonly prescribed medications in UK general practice for IBS: mebeverine (anti-spasmodic) and methylcellulose (bulking-agent) and <b>Regul</b> 8, the CBT based self-management website. 135 patients aged 16 to 60 years with IBS symptoms fulfilling Rome III criteria, recruited via GP practices, will be randomised to 1 of 3 levels of the drug condition: mebeverine, methylcellulose or placebo for 6 weeks and to 1 of 3 levels of the website condition, <b>Regul</b> 8 with a nurse telephone session and email support, <b>Regul</b> 8 with minimal email support, or no website, thus creating 9 groups. Outcomes: Irritable bowel symptom severity scale and IBS-QOL will be measured at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks as the primary outcomes. An intention to treat analysis will be undertaken by ANCOVA for a factorial trial. Discussion This pilot will provide valuable information for a larger trial. Determining the effectiveness of commonly used drug treatments will help patients and doctors make informed treatment decisions regarding drug management of IBS symptoms, enabling better targeting of treatment. A web-based self-management CBT programme for IBS developed in partnership with patients has the potential to benefit large numbers of patients with low cost to the NHS. Assessment of the amount of email or therapist support required for the website will enable economic analysis to be undertaken.
