5|$|In 2008 a {{research}} team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades {{which was published}} in Biology Letters. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the <b>running</b> <b>surface</b> on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} outdoor {{track is}} {{in the shape of}} a stadium, 400 metres in length, and has at least eight lanes 1.22m in width (small arenas might have six lanes). Older track facilities may have nonstandard track lengths, such as 440 yards (402.3m; 1/4 mile) (common in the United States). Historically, tracks were covered by a dirt <b>running</b> <b>surface.</b> Modern All-weather running tracks are covered by a synthetic weather-resistant <b>running</b> <b>surface,</b> which typically consists of rubber (either black SBR or colored EPDM granules), bound by polyurethane or latex resins.

25|$|A {{major problem}} of jointed track is {{cracking}} around the bolt holes, {{which can lead}} to breaking of the rail head (the <b>running</b> <b>surface).</b> This was the cause of the Hither Green rail crash which caused British Railways to begin converting much of its track to continuous welded rail.|$|E
500|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation found a rail had fragmented as trains passed {{and that the}} likely cause was [...] "rolling contact fatigue" [...] (defined as multiple surface-breaking cracks). Such cracks are caused by high loads where the wheels contact the rail. Repeated loading causes fatigue cracks to grow. When they reach a critical size, the rail fails. Portions of the failed track at Hatfield were reassembled and numerous fatigue cracks were identified; these contributed to spalling of the <b>running</b> <b>surface</b> to around [...] deep and [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{principal}} scenario {{was that}} of the Mixtec region, which lies {{to the west of the}} Central Valley. The Mixtec region has also been occupied since prehistoric times. [...] It has an extremely mountainous terrain of variable altitude, rising to more than [...] [...] The climate varies from mountainous and temperate to tropical and dry, and rain is generally scarce. [...] There is little <b>running</b> <b>surface</b> water, and presently, a good part of the area has become alarmingly deforested, a result of the ground-clearing agricultural practices of the ancient inhabitants of the region.|$|E
30|$|In {{the contact}} area, wheel and rail {{exchange}} interaction forces: {{the presence of}} irregularities on the <b>running</b> <b>surfaces</b> arises from dynamic loads, that, besides getting worse the damaged surface initiates vibrations of vehicle and track components (the formation of periodic surface defects is also accelerated by the speed-up of trains [36]).|$|R

2500|$|Hovercraft use blowers {{to produce}} a large volume of air below the hull that is {{slightly}} above atmospheric pressure. The pressure difference between the higher pressure air below the hull and lower pressure ambient air above it produces lift, which causes the hull to float above the <b>running</b> <b>surface.</b> For stability reasons, the air is typically blown through slots or holes around the outside of a disk- or oval-shaped platform, giving most hovercraft a characteristic rounded-rectangle shape. Typically this cushion is contained within a flexible [...] "skirt", which allows the vehicle to travel over small obstructions without damage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{metalling}} was in two layers, {{a foundation}} of medium to large stones covered by a <b>running</b> <b>surface,</b> often a compacted mixture of smaller flint and gravel. About one quarter of road pavements were [...] "bottomed" [...] with large stones, mostly {{in the north and}} west where stone was more readily available. Some high-status roads in Italy were bound together by volcanic mortar, and a small minority of excavated sites in Britain have shown concrete or limestone mortar. Road surfaces in the iron-producing areas of the Weald were made from iron slag. The average depth of metalling over 213 recorded roads is about , with great variation from as little as [...] to up to [...] in places, probably built up over centuries.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, Andrew Kucher of Ford began {{experimenting with}} the [...] "Levapad" [...] concept, metal disks with {{pressurized}} air blown {{through a hole}} in the center. Levapads do not offer stability on their own. Several must be used together to support a load above them. Lacking a skirt, the pads had to remain very close to the <b>running</b> <b>surface.</b> He initially imagined these being used in place of casters and wheels in factories and warehouses, where the concrete floors offered the smoothness required for operation. By the 1950s, Ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system, but mainly proposed its use as a replacement for wheels on trains, with the Levapads running close to the surface of existing rails.|$|E

2500|$|In 1826 and 1827, two Prussian {{engineers}} visited Britain {{to look at}} {{a number}} of railways, and the construction and operation of the Hay inclined plane was described in some detail in their subsequent publication. The rails were made of cast iron, and were [...] "L" [...] shaped in section. The <b>running</b> <b>surface</b> was [...] wide by [...] thick, while the vertical flange was [...] tall and [...] thick. They were described as the strongest and thickest that they had seen. Most of the incline was laid with only three rails, with a small section in the middle which had four rails, so that the boats could pass one another. Because the flanges were on the rails rather than on the wheels as in modern railway practice, one track had the flanges on the inside, and the other on the outside. The rails were fixed to timbers running along the incline, [...] square, which were attached to wooden sleepers which ran across the incline.|$|E
2500|$|The role of glide wax is {{to adapt}} and improve the {{friction}} properties of a ski base to the expected snow properties to be encountered on a spectrum from cold crystalline snow to saturated granular snow. [...] Modern ski bases often are made from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Kuzmin asserts that UHMWPE is non-porous and can hold neither wax nor water, {{so there is no}} possibility for filling pores; furthermore, he asserts that UHMWPE is very hydrophobic, which means that wet snow does not appreciably retard the ski and that glide wax offers little additional ability to repel water. He notes that clear bases are more durable and hydrophobic than those with carbon content. The same author asserts that texture is more important than surface chemistry for creating the optimum balance between a <b>running</b> <b>surface</b> that's too dry (not slippery enough) and too wet (ski subject to suction forces). In warm, moist snow, texture can help break the retarding capillary attraction between the ski base and the snow. Giesbrecht agrees that low wetting angle of the ski base is key and also emphasizes the importance of the degree of surface roughness at the micrometre scale as a function of snow temperature—cold snow favoring a smoother surface and wetter, warmer snow favoring a textured surface.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century, {{researchers}} addressed the twin problems of water and impurities adhering to skis during spring conditions. Terry Hertel addressed both problems, first with the novel use of a surfactant that interacted with the wax matrix in such a way as to repel water effectively, a product introduced in 1974 by Hertel Wax. Hertel also developed the first fluorocarbon product and the first spring-time wax that repels and makes the <b>running</b> <b>surface</b> slick for spring time alpine ski and snowboard. This technology was introduced to the market in 1986 by Hertel Wax. [...] In 1990, Hertel filed for a U.S. patent on a [...] "ski wax for use with sintered-base snow skis", containing paraffin, a hardener wax, roughly 1% per-fluoroether diol, and 2% SDS surfactant. In the 1990s, Swix chief chemist Leif Torgersen found a glide wax additive to repel pollen and other snow impurities—a problem with soft grip waxes during distance races—in the form of a fluorocarbon that could be ironed into the ski base. The solution was based on the work of Enrico Traverso at , who had developed a fluorocarbon powder with a melting temperature just a few degrees below that of sintered polyethylene, patented in Italy as a [...] "ski lubricant comprising paraffinic wax and hydrocarbon compounds containing a perfluorocarbon segment".|$|E

40|$|A {{railway turnout}} {{is a special}} {{construction}} allowing a ride of a railway vehicle in a given direction. A part of each turnout is a frog (alternatively - crossing), it allows to cross rails and a definitive tracks separation of two different directions. The most suitable material for a production of extremely stressed railway turnouts frogs is austenitic highly alloyed manganese steel - Hadfield steel. This steel, with chemical composition of carbon (1, 2 %), mangan (12 %), silicon (0, 45 %) and austenitic structure, is able to harden its working surface (i. e. to increase its surface hardness) under a sufficient pressure and shock loading because of railway wheels shocks during the train passage through the turnout.

40|$|AbstractIn this work, the {{characteristics}} of two coatings and their contribution to a reduced coefficient of friction were studied. In addition, the structural changes of the ski base material due to the waxing process and subsequent skiing were also studied. The Fluorine content, both in the base material and the wax, was given special attention. Field and laboratory experiments on the ski base materials, both with and without waxes, were conducted, whereas the material characterization has been evaluated by using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and contact angle measurement of water droplets on the ski base materials. The friction properties of the ski <b>running</b> <b>surfaces</b> have been tested in outdoor gliding tests in which the ski <b>running</b> <b>surfaces</b> have been compared with each other, {{as well as to}} a reference ski. A tribometer was used in the lab tests to measure the coefficient of friction (COF), and {{it was found that the}} Fluorine content on the top surface is not directly comparable with the surface energy and the contact angle. On average, skiing performance improved significantly by 4 % directly after the application of high fluorinated waxes, while the COF of the used ski base samples increased significantly by 55. 4 % and 96. 3 % after 34. 1 km of skiing in free technique...|$|R
