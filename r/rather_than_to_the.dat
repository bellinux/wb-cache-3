5|$|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria, {{claimed the}} German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a {{son-in-law}} of Joseph I, and furthermore presented himself as Charles VI's legitimate imperial successor. If women {{were going to}} inherit, he claimed, then his family should have precedence: his wife, Maria Amalia, {{was the daughter of}} Joseph I. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph's female children, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.|$|E
5|$|Males display {{during the}} {{breeding}} season at a lek {{in a traditional}} open grassy arena. The ruff {{is one of the}} few lekking species in which the display is primarily directed at other males <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> females, and it is among the small percentage of birds in which the males have well-marked and inherited variations in plumage and mating behaviour. There are three male forms: the typical territorial males, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and a very rare variant with female-like plumage. The behaviour and appearance for an individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by its genes (see §Biology of variation among males).|$|E

5|$|One of Metternich's first tasks was to {{push for}} the {{marriage}} of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tsar's youngest sister Anna Pavlovna. Metternich would later seek {{to distance himself from}} the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon's own idea, but this is improbable; in any case, he was happy to claim responsibility at the time. By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March. Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed by a different route and unofficially. The trip was designed, Metternich explained, to transport his family (stranded in France by the outbreak of war) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise's activities.|$|E
5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a {{cybersquatting}} {{case where}} a top-level domain registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent registrant (Apple), <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered the domain name itunes.co.uk. The domain initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered domain name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded the domain name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Roman generals, and the rewarding {{of soldiers}} with plunder on these campaigns, {{led to a}} general trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their generals <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state. Rome was also plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because vast tracts of land had been given over to slave farming in which the slaves greatly outnumbered their Roman masters. In the 1st century BC at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern continued until 27 BC, when Octavian (later Augustus) successfully challenged the Senate's authority, and was made princeps (first citizen).|$|E

5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding {{of soldiers}} with plunder from those campaigns, {{led to the}} trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state, {{and a willingness to}} follow their generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because in the past century vast tracts of land had been given to veterans who farmed by use of slaves and who came to greatly outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later Caesar Augustus) ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made princeps (emperor).|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} {{published}} in 1960 {{as a result of}} an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS) rather than any variant of the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 2011 and 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram, linking it to an invariant of nature <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mass of a material artefact, thereby ensuring long-term stability.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{controversy}} concerning the widely reported imbalance of the game, as the rules strongly favor the king, {{although there are}} several rule modifications that can produce more balanced play, such as a weaponless king (the king cannot participate in captures), escape to the corners (<b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edges), or hostile attacker camps (the king and defenders may be captured against a vacant attacker camp square). Schmittberger (1992) even reveals some workarounds to produce more balanced play without modifying the rules of gameplay.|$|E

5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left of the stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is {{the same as that of}} the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E
5|$|By 26 April, {{the complex}} at Obersalzberg was {{under attack by}} the Allies, so Göring was moved to his castle at Mauterndorf. In his last will and testament, Hitler {{expelled}} Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed Karl Dönitz, the Navy's commander-in-chief, {{as president of the}} Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and {{he made his way to}} the American lines in hopes of surrendering to them <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Russians. He was taken into custody near Radstadt on 6 May by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army. This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{assessment}} process for the ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot Drain for most of its length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the drain. It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1930s, various Soviet {{publications}} questioned the known historical facts regarding the age of the Cathedral. The publications stressed that the medieval building had undergone major reconstructions and that little of the original Byzantine-style cathedral was preserved. This wave of questioning led to the demolition of the monastery and its replacement with a new administrative centre for the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (previously located in the city of Kharkiv). Before its demolition (June 8–July 9, 1934), the structure was carefully studied by T.M. Movchanivskyi and K. Honcharev from the recently purged and re-organized Institute of Material Culture of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. On the basis of their survey, the cathedral was declared to belong primarily to the Ukrainian Baroque style, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> twelfth century as was previously thought, and thus did not merit preservation due to its lack of historical and artistic value. This conclusion backed up the Soviet authorities' plans to demolish the entire monastery. Local historians, archaeologists, and architects agreed to the monastery's demolition, although reluctantly. Only one professor, Mykola Makarenko, refused to sign the demolition act; he later died in a Soviet prison.|$|E
5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E
