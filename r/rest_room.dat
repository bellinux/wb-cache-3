5|$|Mr. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson {{house in}} order to take Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. While Mr. Burns is setting the agenda for the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the <b>rest</b> <b>room.</b> Homer asks Mr. Burns where the <b>rest</b> <b>room</b> is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading Mr. Burns to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to even hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Mr. Burns. The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{the second}} largest Danish fort after Kronborg, the {{inspiration}} for Shakespeare's Hamlet. It was built by Ove Gjedde {{with the help of}} local laborers in Danish style. The lower compartment in the basement adjoining the fort was used as a store room, prison and a <b>rest</b> <b>room</b> for the soldiers, while the governor and priests resided in the second level. Fort Dansborg was the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. Originally a fishing village, Tharangambadi (referred as Tranquebar) was fortified by the Danish, who used the port as the main trading post for the colony, with the major export of the colony being cotton textiles. During the middle of the 18th century, the commercial importance of the town declined and the centre of textile production moved to Serampore in the state of Bengal. But Tranquebar still remained the headquarters of the Colony. The fort and the town was sold to the British in 1845 and, along with Tharangambadi, the fort lost its significance as the town was not a trading post anymore.|$|E
25|$|Other {{services}} {{offered by the}} League included framed certificates of membership for veterans of the conflict and bereaved relatives of the dead. The scroll certificates, designed by Bernard Partridge, were intended as a memorial of honour. The League, together with the St Barnabas Society, also established and maintained a Pilgrimage Centre and <b>rest</b> <b>room</b> at Ypres, and raised funds to help bereaved and impoverished relatives of dead soldiers to visit Ypres and the surrounding battlefields. The League also worked with the Imperial War Graves Commission to compile registers of those buried or lost in the Salient, and to establish historical records and information for pilgrims and its members.|$|E

25|$|Openly {{transsexual}} {{people can}} have difficulty maintaining employment. Most {{find it necessary to}} remain employed during transition in order to cover the costs of living and transition. However, employment discrimination against trans people is rampant {{and many of them are}} fired when they come out or are involuntarily outed at work. Transsexual people must decide whether to transition on-the-job, or to find a new job when they make their social transition. Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous name—even deciding which <b>rest</b> <b>room</b> to use can prove challenging. Finding employment can be especially challenging for those in mid-transition.|$|E
500|$|Detective Hudak (Daniel Kamin) tells Mulder and Scully that an {{anonymous}} caller phoned 911 {{with a message}} regarding Penny Timmons, one of the killer's victims. The caller claimed that Timmons' last words were [...] "She is me." [...] Hudak notes, however, that the victim's larynx was severed, {{making it impossible for}} her to utter dying words. The agents trace the source of the 911 call to a payphone at the New Horizon Psychiatric Center. Mulder notices one of the patients, Harold Spuller, avoiding his gaze. After viewing photographs of the murder victims, Scully comes to the conclusion that Spuller fits the killer's profile: a compulsive person consumed with the desire to organize, clean and reorder. Scully uses a <b>rest</b> <b>room</b> to attend to a nose bleed. There she encounters the spirit of another blond girl. Moments later, Mulder tells her that the body of yet another victim was found nearby - the same girl Scully had just seen.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] Interstate State Park CCC/WPA/Rustic Style Historic District at the {{northeast}} {{end of the}} Minnesota park contains six contributing properties. [...] These consist of three buildings, two structures, and an object. [...] Noteworthy are the women's <b>rest</b> <b>room</b> (built c. 1920) and men's <b>rest</b> <b>room</b> (built 1928), which predate the federal developments and influenced the WPA's use of rustic style in the park. [...] These two buildings are situated {{at the north end}} of the parking lot; the men's <b>rest</b> <b>room</b> is noted for its placement relative to the rock outcroppings and the women's <b>rest</b> <b>room</b> was modified by the WPA in 1941. [...] The third contributing building is the 1939 Refectory, originally a concession building renovated in 1981 with restrooms and office space to become the current visitor center. [...] The two contributing structures are the 1937 stone curb in the parking lot and a [...] retaining wall built in 1938 at the south end of the Glacial Gardens.

[...] The Synopsis describes shy bladder as [...] "inability to void in a public bathroom" [...] and notes that relaxation exercises are an application of behavior therapy for dealing with this disorder. Some paruretics experience delayed urination and must wait for their need to void to overcome their anxiety, while others are unable to urinate at all.|$|E

His tomb dating his death to A.H. 596 (1177 AD) is located near a rampart in the fort close to the southern gate. It was built over an area of [...] square with retaining walls supporting [...] allround, on a [...] high heap of earth (conjectured to be ruins of former Hindu or Buddhist structure).

6000|$|Together {{they made}} {{studies of the}} Girls' Clubs which are {{scattered}} about London, supplementary homes that have in such places as Walworth and Soho worked small miracles of civilization. These institutions appealed to a lower social level than the one their Hostels were to touch, but they had been organized by capable and understanding minds and Lady Harman found {{in one or two}} of their evening dances and in the lunch she shared one morning with a row of cheerful young factory girls from Soho just that quality of concrete realization for which her mind hungered. Then Mr. Brumley took her once or twice for evening walks, just when the stream of workers is going home; he battled his way with her along the footpath of Charing Cross Railway Bridge from the Waterloo side, they swam in the mild evening sunshine of September against a trampling torrent of bobbing heads, and afterwards they had tea together in one of the International Stores near the Strand, where Mr. Brumley made an unsuccessful attempt to draw out the waitress on the subject of Babs Wheeler and the recent strike. The young woman might have talked freely to a man alone or freely to Lady Harman alone but the combination of the two made her shy. The bridge experience led to several other expeditions, to see home-going on the tube, at the big railway termini, on the train--and once they followed up the process to Streatham and saw how the people pour out of the train at last and scatter--until at last they are just isolated individuals running up steps, diving into basements. And then it occurred to Mr. Brumley that he knew someone who would take them over [...] "Gerrard," [...] that huge telephone exchange, and there Lady Harman saw how the National Telephone Company, as it was in those days, had a care for its staff, the pleasant club rooms, the <b>rest</b> <b>room,</b> and stood in that queer rendez-vous of messages, where the [...] "Hello" [...] girl sits all day, wearing a strange metallic apparatus over ear and mouth, watching small lights that wink significantly at her and perpetually pulling out and slipping in and releasing little flexible strings that seem to have a resilient volition of their own. They hunted out Mrs. Barnet and heard her ideas about conjoint homes for spinsters in the Garden Suburb. And then they went over a Training College for elementary teachers and visited the Post Office and then came back to more unobtrusive contemplation, from the customer's little table, of the ministering personalities of the International Stores.|$|E
