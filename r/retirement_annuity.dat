25|$|It is also {{possible}} for an individual to make contributions under an arrangement they themselves make with a provider (such as an insurance company). Similar tax advantages will usually be available as for occupational schemes. Contributions are typically invested during an individual's working life, and then used to purchase a pension at or following retirement. Various names are given to different types of individual arrangement, {{but they are not}} fundamentally different in nature. The generic term personal pension is used to refer to arrangements established since the rules were liberalised in the 1980s (earlier arrangements are usually called <b>retirement</b> <b>annuity</b> contracts), but can be subdivided into other types (such as the Self-invested personal pension, where the member is allowed to direct what their contributions should be invested in).|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] <b>Retirement</b> <b>annuities</b> for {{civilian}} federal employees are provided mainly through two programs: the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS). Under {{both of these}} systems, <b>retirement</b> <b>annuities</b> are financed {{through a combination of}} employee and employer contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). All assets of the CSRDF are invested in U. S. Treasury bonds and other securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U. S. government. <b>Retirement</b> <b>annuities</b> for federal employees are paid from the CSRDF regardless of whether the benefits were accrued under CSRS or FERS. FERS annuities are fully funded by the sum of employee and employer contributions and interest earned by the Treasury bonds held by the CSRDF. The federal government makes supplemental payments into the CSRDF on behalf of employees covered by the CSRS because employee and agency contributions and interest earnings do not meet the full cost of the benefits earned by employees covered by that system...|$|R

25|$|Along with earning salaries, {{senators}} receive {{retirement and}} health benefits that are identical to other federal employees, and are fully vested {{after five years}} of service. Senators are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). As it is for federal employees, congressional retirement is funded through taxes and the participants' contributions. Under FERS, senators contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6.2% of their salary in Social Security taxes. The amount of a senator's pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest 3 years of their salary. The starting amount of a senator's <b>retirement</b> <b>annuity</b> may not exceed 80% of their final salary. In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under CSRS was $60,972, while those who retired under FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{inherited}} {{wealth in}} modern economies has increasingly become under scrutiny. This study presents {{one of the}} first attempts to shed light on how demographic aging could shape this role. We show that, in the absence of <b>retirement</b> <b>annuities,</b> or for a given level of annuitization, both increasing longevity and decreasing fertility should reduce the inherited share of total wealth in a given economy. Thus, aging is not likely to explain a recent surge in this share in some advanced economies. Shrinking <b>retirement</b> <b>annuities,</b> however, could offset and potentially reverse these effects. We also show that aging could increase the size of individual bequests vis- 0 -vis real wages. However, these bequests will be more unequally distributed if aging is driven by a drop in fertility. In comparison, the effect of increasing longevity on their distribution in non-monotonic...|$|R

40|$|Sponsors of defined {{contribution}} {{retirement plans}} typically limit the investment choices of plan participants {{to a small}} number of investment managers and a limited number of investment vehicles. Such restrictions may limit excessive risk-taking by participants but also may preclude opportunities for efficient diversification. Many college and university 403 (b) plans have restricted investment choices to the <b>retirement</b> <b>annuities</b> offered by TIAA-CREF, the current manager of over half of all 403 (b) contributions. Using 10 years of historical data, we study the efficiency of this TIAA-CREF opportunity set relative to a larger set that includes several standard index funds. Extrapolations must be interpreted -with caution. Assuming optimal rebalancing, depending on loss aversion and diversification constraints, the historical sample of returns implies that over a 20 -year remaining work life, an employee -with an expanded menu that includes standard index funds could gain over 40 % in terminal wealth compared to one who is restricted to TIAA-CREF <b>retirement</b> <b>annuities.</b> Even when a naive diversification strategy of equally weighting (1 /n) all available funds is used, the expandedmenu outperforms the restricted portfolio by more than 25 % over 20 years. These differences generally are significant at conventional levels based on parametric and nonparametric testing and do not appear to result from idiosyncratic market performance durinz the sample period.
