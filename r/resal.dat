40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{appearance}} of non exclusive fuel <b>resaling</b> firms, unbranded resale firms, which don't carry any connections to fuel distributors. In this sense, a simple strategic model was consolidated, in which the only asymmetric information relates to the contracts settled among unbranded resale firms and disbributors and branded resale firms and distributors. The model evaluates the strategic relations between the upstream and downstream sectors, considering a partial vertical relation, such that de branded resale firms bounded by contracts with the distributor, are integrated by an exclusive contract with the distributor. On the other hand, the unbranded resale firm continues with no vertical integration. Consequently, {{it is observed that}} the existence of unbranded resale firms in the market allows an optimal and lower price with larger supply in equilibrium. ...|$|R

Our first line of research investigates whether this market presents features which favor anti-competitive actions, despite being a market with several agents involved. Our empirical analysis makes use of Panel Data Econometrics and the results corroborate {{the idea of a}} possibility of collusive behavior in the gasoline market. We go one step further and investigate whether the appearance of non exclusive (unbranded) fuel <b>resaling</b> firms, with no connections to any fuel distributor, is really able to bring competition to the market. For this part of the research we utilize a Multinomial Logit Model and our results show that a higher proportion of unbranded gas stations in a city truly causes more variability of prices and, therefore, bring more competition and lowers the possibility of cartel formation. ...|$|R

50|$|As a new {{step in the}} {{evolution}} of the school, the decree of 1851 insists on the organisation of the courses, the writing of an annual schedule, the quality of the faculty, and the control of the students’ works. For the first time in its history, the school opens its doors to a larger public. At this time, in France, the remarkable development of transports, roads, bridges and canals is strongly influenced by engineers from the school (Becquerel, Bienvenüe, Caquot, Carnot, Colson, Coyne, Freyssinet, <b>Résal,</b> Séjourné), who deeply modernised the country by creating the large traffic networks, admired in several European countries.|$|E
50|$|In 1853, a new stone {{structure}} was completed atop the existing stone foundation, although this reincarnation was only composed of five arches. The new bridge was subsequently {{the cause of}} not fewer than thirty-five water traffic accidents between 1891 and 1910 and was given the unofficial name the pont du Diable (Devil's Bridge). Thus, {{in order to facilitate}} the passage of boats and the flow of the Seine, a decision was made to rebuild the bridge, this time in metal. The new work was directed by Jean <b>Résal,</b> who had also worked on the Pont Mirabeau and Pont Alexandre III; it was inaugurated in 1919 by Raymond Poincaré, President of the French Republic. The structure has remained the same since.|$|E
5000|$|Born in East St. Louis, Illinois, {{the son of}} <b>Resal</b> and Edith Rutledge Stoops, Larry Stoops {{was playing}} cornet in a Pentecostal church band {{by the age of}} 8, and {{developed}} a style he refers to as, [...] "playing fancy." [...] While still a teenager, Stoops went to Tupelo, Mississippi, to study at the Pentecostal Bible Institute. He sold Kirby vacuum sweepers and worked at a local grocery for $1 an hour to put himself through school. His first job after graduation was selling Bibles. Married at 20, Stoops was posted as an assistant pastor in Maine, but “I just couldn’t make it. I couldn’t make enough money to feed myself or my wife. One day I got a six-pack of beer, called the pastor, and let them know I quit. (I didn’t even drink.)” Three of Stoops four siblings are members of the clergy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most elegant}} and famous of the Belle Époque bridges is the Pont Alexandre-III, {{designed}} by architects Joseph Cassien-Bernard and Gaston Cousin, and engineers Jean <b>Résal</b> and Amédée d'Alby. It was largely decorative, designed {{to connect the}} Grand Palais and Petit Palais of the Exposition on the right bank with {{the parts of the}} Exposition the left bank. The first stone was laid by Nicholas II of Russia, the future Czar, in October 1896. The bridge combined the modern engineering of a single iron span bridge 107 meters long with classical beaux-arts architecture. The counterweights supporting the bridge are four massive masonry columns, seventeen meters high, which serve as the bases for four works of beaux-arts sculpture, representing the four [...] "Fames"; the Sciences, the Arts, Commerce, and Industry. In the center, the sides of the bridge are decorated with two groups of river nymphs; the Nymphs of the Seine on one side, the Nymphs of the Neva on the other. A similar bridge, the Trinity Bridge, designed by Gustave Eiffel, was built over the Neva River in the Russian Capital, St. Petersburg, beginning in 1897.|$|E

The equations of the general motion are written within the <b>Resal</b> trihedral in a way that allows, after linearization, one to draw up a structural scheme of the controlled object, a scheme that will be used in the guided missile system analysis. Opposite to the flying machines with stabilized roll where the analysis is done after decoupling the channels, for the missile with rotation, the analysis of the scheme is done simultaneously on both channels, as terms used are complex terms. Furthermore, there will be presented some characteristics of this type of missile by analyzing a model close to the one of an antichariot missile with gasodynamic control...|$|E
40|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{estimates}} {{that exposure to}} residential radon causes 7, 000 to 30, 000 lung cancer deaths per year. The EPA has provided extensive technical analysis of and support for their recommended policy response of remediating all homes above a threshold level of radon, but these and other benefit-cost analyses typi-cally do not consider many important dimensions of household heterogeneity, specifically residential mobility. We add to the literature on benefit-cost analysis by using agent based models that allow for heterogeneous benefits. Using this model, we re-examine the EPA’s recommendations for radon remediation. Since there is both a capital and an annual cost of radon remediation, many well informed households are better off not complying with the EPA’s recommendation. We find that most households are better of by not paying the annual cost of remediation and that only the least mobile households with smokers would undertake the capital cost of radon remediation in houses with very high radon concentra-tions. Since {{only a small fraction}} of the population values radon remediation, our model suggests that approximately 10 % of the capital cost is likely to be capitalized into the <b>resal...</b>|$|E
40|$|A polemics with Michael Stewart’s article Remembering without commemoration: the {{mnemonics}} {{and politics}} of Holocaust memories among European Roma, „Journal of Royal Anthropological Institute” nr 10, 2004) In the recent years the traditional approach to Roma as „people without history and memory” has been challenged, among others, by a new perspective that assumes that even if Roma do not consciously reflect upon their past, the past is „remembered” for them {{due to the fact}} that it is in a way „stored” or „embedded” in the nature of the relations between Roma and non-Roma. Such an „implicit memory” approach, represented by Michael Stewart, means a step forward since it has assumed a more sophisticated concept of social memory. Nevertheless, it shares with the older approach the essentialized concept of Roma identity. With a help of Lech Mroz’s conception of Romani „non-memory that does not mean forgetting”, I am developing my criticism of Stewart’s argument as (1) treating the Roma as a passive and static group formed by external determinants; (2) homogenizing the diversity of Romani life; (3) presenting a monolithic picture of the non-Roma world; (4) seeing a firm borderline between Roma and non-Roma while we should rather speak here of a liminal frontier zone; (5) neglecting the actual cases of active remembrance among Roma, supported by Romani commemorative ceremonies. In the end, I am suggesting that in contemporary „postmodern condition” the Romani practices of memory and identity do not radically differ from the non-Romani ones, especially those influenced by traumatic historical experience.

40|$|Tapered plate girders often {{form part}} of {{large-scale}} structures such as long continuous bridges or industrial buildings where due to considerable loads the higher resistance is required. There are several important reasons choosing non-prismatic girders. First of all, their tapered shape with gradually changing inertia allows for more effective stress distribution inside the web-panel and contributes to steel reduction and thereby to decrease the overall cost of the structure. Trapezoidal shape of such panels also may be desirable in structures with non-standard shape for example where pre-formed service openings are needed. Although rectangular plate girders were studied in many occasions in last few decades, the latest investigations {{have shown that the}} structural behaviour of tapered panels is more complex and different distribution of the internal forces takes place. Due to a lack of design rules for assessment of ultimate shear resistance of tapered plate structures with considerable angle of a slope (> 10 degrees), this research is focused on searching for a solution of the problem. The main body of the thesis is composed of four independent publications where each of them summarizes different phase of the research. The most relevant issues related to tapered panels discussed in the papers were: the critical shear load in tapered simple-supported plates, the influence of geometrical and structural imperfections, the optimal position of the longitudinal stiffener, the <b>Resal</b> effect, and finally the ultimate shear resistance of stiffened and unstiffened tapered plate girders. Nevertheless, the main objective of this work was the development of a reliable design tool to assess of the ultimate shear resistance of non-prismatic plate girders. The methodology applied in the research consists of the following stages: study of the bibliography and initial theoretical research, development of a numerical model, execution of two experimental programs, development of a wide parametric study, analysis of the experimental and numerical results, comparing them with those obtained according to EN 1993 - 1 - 5, and finally - development of a new design proposal for the assessment of the ultimate shear resistance for tapered steel plate girders. The PhD research was supported by two experimental programs focused on the structural behaviour of tapered plate girders. In the first program, transversally stiffened members subjected to shear and shear-bending interaction were tested. The second experimental program was focused on longitudinally stiffened tapered plate girders under shear. Results obtained from the experimental tests were used for the verification of the numerical model. Plate girders reveal tendency to possess a significant post-buckling resistance. This phenomenon can be observed as a diagonal tension field developing within the web-panel. In both experimental tests and numerical analyses, this characteristic behaviour was observed. Using verified the numerical model, a wide parametric study for a large number of tapered plate girders was carried out. All numerical results presented in this research were compared with those obtained according to EN 1993 - 1 - 5 and discussed. Finally, a new design method for the assessment of the ultimate shear resistance of tapered steel plate girders was presented. The new design proposal is based on the currently valid - Rotated Stress Field Method. The procedure maintains its simplicity and improves considerably results obtained for non-prismatic panels. This new reliable design tool, valid for any geometry and any typology of tapered steel plate girders, provides a solution of the main objective defined in this researc...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of {{quantitative}} resistance in pea (Pisum sativum L.) to Erysiphe pisi DC, the pathogen causing powdery mildew, were investigated. Cultivars and seedlines of pea expressing quantitative resistance to E. pisi {{were identified and}} evaluated, by measuring the amounts of pathogen present on plant surfaces in field and glasshouse experiments. Disease severity on cv. Quantum was intermediate when compared with that on cv. Bolero (susceptible) and cv. <b>Resal</b> (resistant) in a field experiment. In glasshouse experiments, two groups of cultivars, one {{with a high degree}} of resistance and the other with nil to low degrees of resistance to E. pisi, were identified. This indicated either that a different mechanism of resistance applied in the two groups, or that there has been no previous selection for intermediate resistance. Several other cultivars expressing quantitative resistance were identified in a field experiment. Quantitative resistance in Quantum did not affect germination of E. pisi conidia, but reduced infection efficiency of conidia on this cultivar compared with cv. Pania (susceptible). Other epidemiological characteristics {{of quantitative}} resistance expression in Quantum relative to Pania were a 33 % reduction in total conidium production and a 16 % increase in time to maximum daily conidium production, both expressed on a colony area basis. In Bolero, the total conidium production was reduced relative to Pania, but the time to maximum spore production on a colony area basis was shorter. There were no differences between the cultivars in pathogen colony size or numbers of haustoria produced by the pathogen. Electron microscope studies suggested that haustoria in Quantum plants were smaller and less lobed than those in Pania plants and the surface area to volume ratios of the lobes and haustorial bodies were larger in Pania than in Quantum. The progress in time and spread in space of E. pisi was measured in field plots of cultivars Quantum, Pania and Bolero as disease severity (proportion of leaf area infected). Division of leaves (nodes) into three different age groups (young, medium, old) was necessary because of large variability in disease severity within plants. Disease severity on leaves at young nodes was less than 4 % until the final assessment at 35 days after inoculation (dai). Exponential disease progress curves were fitted for leaves at medium nodes. Mean disease severity on medium nodes 12 dai was greatest (P< 0. 001) on Bolero and Pania (9. 3 and 6. 8 % of leaf area infected respectively), and least on Quantum (1. 6 %). The mean disease relative growth rate was greatest (P< 0. 001) for Quantum, but was delayed compared to Pania and Bolero. Gompertz growth curves were fitted to disease progress data for leaves at old nodes. The asymptote was 78. 2 % of leaf area infected on Quantum, significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than on Bolero or Pania, which reached 100 %. The point of inflection on Quantum occurred 22. 8 dai, later (P< 0. 001) than on Pania (18. 8 dai) and Bolero (18. 3 dai), and the mean disease severity at the point of inflection was 28. 8 % for Quantum, less (P< 0. 00 l) than on Pania (38. 9 %) or Bolero (38. 5 %). The average daily rates of increase in disease severity did not differ between the cultivars. Disease progress on Quantum was delayed compared with Pania and Bolero. Disease gradients from inoculum foci to 12 m were detected at early stages of the epidemic but the effects of background inoculum and the rate of disease progress were greater than the focus effect. Gradients flattened with time as the disease epidemic intensified, which was evident from the large isopathic rates (between 2. 2 and 4. 0 m d⁻¹) Some epidemiological variables expressed in controlled environments (low infection efficiency, low maximum daily spore production and long time to maximum spore production) that characterised quantitative resistance in Quantum were correlated with disease progress and spread in the field. These findings could be utilised in pea breeding programmes to identify parent lines from which quantitatively resistant progeny could be selected...|$|E
