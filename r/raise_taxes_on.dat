5|$|In 1956, {{the party}} adopted the Winnipeg Declaration, {{a far more}} {{moderate}} proposal than its previous governing document, the 1933 Regina Manifesto. For example, the Regina Manifesto pledged the CCF to the eradication of capitalism; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business, and stated {{that the government should}} own business only when it was in the public interest. In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised to <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.|$|E

25|$|Income {{inequality}} can {{be addressed}} by pre-tax (market) income policies ("pre-distribution") that raise worker pay, as well as after-tax policies that <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> higher-income taxpayers to fund transfers to lower-income taxpayers ("redistribution"). President Obama attempted both strategies, with some success in reducing both the pre-tax and after-tax share of income of the top 1% measured 2012 to 2013 (the most recent CBO data available as of December 2016), which means the share of income of the bottom 99% increased.|$|E

25|$|Tensions between Gregory and the {{imperial}} court began around 722, when emperor Leo III attempted to <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the papal patrimonies in Italy, draining the Papacy’s monetary reserves. Leo required this revenue {{to pay for}} the ongoing Arab war, while Gregory needed it to provide local foodstuffs for the city of Rome, thereby relieving Rome on its reliance upon the long-distance supply of grain. The result of which was, through refusing to pay the additional taxes, Gregory encouraged the Roman populace to drive {{the imperial}} governor of Rome from the city, and Leo was unable to impose his will upon Rome, as Lombard pressure kept the exarch of Ravenna from fielding an army to bring the pope to heel.|$|E
25|$|When Japanese {{funding for}} the army diminished, Bose was forced to <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the Indian populations of Malaysia and Singapore. When the Japanese were {{defeated}} at the battles of Kohima and Imphal, the Provisional Government's aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost forever. The INA was forced to pull back, along with the retreating Japanese army, and fought in key battles against the British Indian Army in its Burma campaign, notable in Meiktilla, Mandalay, Pegu, Nyangyu and Mount Popa. However, {{with the fall of}} Rangoon, Bose's government ceased to be an effective political entity. A large proportion of the INA troops surrendered under Lt Col Loganathan. The remaining troops retreated with Bose towards Malaya or made for Thailand. Japan's surrender {{at the end of the}} war also led to the surrender of the remaining elements of the Indian National Army. The INA prisoners were then repatriated to India and some tried for treason.|$|E

Appropriating over $60 {{billion over}} 5 years by {{matching}} {{federal funds to}} states that provide health insurance to children and pregnant women, and raising the federal cigarette tax from 39 cents to $1. After CHIP passed the House and the Senate, President George W. Bush vetoed the bill over a $30 billion spending difference between what he and congress proposed, saying that “Because the Congress has chosen to send me a bill that moves {{our health care system}} in the wrong direction, I must veto it,” and that lawmakers should “produce a good bill that puts poorer children first.” After Bush's decision on CHIP, Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed measure to override Bush's veto. In 2009 after Bush left office, the House passed a new version of CHIP, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The new version including the original expansion of coverage to 4 million children, and along with raising taxes on cigarettes, a new provision was added to <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> other tobacco products.|$|E

2500|$|Jindal {{has been}} an {{opponent}} of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Citing concerns that the augmentation of unemployment insurance may obligate the state to <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> businesses, Jindal had indicated his intention to forgo federal stimulus plan funds ($98 million) aimed at increasing unemployment insurance for Louisiana. Louisiana has since been obligated to <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> businesses because the unemployment trust fund had dropped below the prescribed threshold. Louisiana was set to receive about $3.8 billion overall. Jindal intends to accept at least $2.4 billion from the stimulus package.

[...] Throughout most of the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney himself made almost no public statements directly commenting on tax breaks for oil and gas companies; and the Romney campaign declined to respond to repeated requests from the Tampa Bay Times Politifact and The Washington Post's Fact Checker to clarify his position. However, he did tell a town hall gathering in April 2012 that, in contrast to Obama, {{he did not want to}} <b>raise</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> oil companies. Romney's chief energy advisor also testified before Congress twice during the campaign on behalf of the oil and gas industry that Congress should maintain tax benefits for oil and gas producers.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{determinants}} of a readiness for pro-environmental travel behavior in households. Four empirical studies were conducted examining reduction in car use (Study I), acceptability of transport policy measures (Study II and III), and behavioral adaptations in response to travel demand management (TDM) measures (Study IV). In Study I, {{the aim was to}} interrupt habitual car use by means of a deliberation intervention and to examine the importance of moral motivation (i. e., personal norm) for car use reduction. Results showed that, {{as a result of the}} intervention, car use was mainly reduced among car users with a strong car use habit and a strong moral motivation to reduce car use. The aim of Study II was to examine factors important for the acceptability of three TDM measures: <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel, improved public transport, and an information campaign. The results demonstrated the importance of general environmental beliefs (i. e., pro-environmental orientation, problem awareness, personal norm, and willingness to reduce car use) and policy specific beliefs (i. e., perceived impact on freedom to choose travel mode and own car use, perceived effectiveness, and perceived fairness) for the acceptability of the measures. Furthermore, personal norm was found to be particularly important for the acceptability of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> and the information campaign, whereas problem awareness was more important for the acceptability of improved public transport. Following up on Study II, the purpose of Study III was to examine the acceptability of single and combined transport policy measures, more specifically, <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel, improved public transport, subsidies of renewable fuel, a package of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel and improved public transport, and a package of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel and subsidies of renewable fuel. General environmental beliefs (i. e., pro-environmental orientation, problem awareness, personal norm, and willingness to act) and policy specific beliefs (i. e., perceived effectiveness and perceived fairness) were found to be important for the acceptability of the measures. Moreover, personal norm was particularly important for the acceptability of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel and the packages, while problem awareness was more important for the acceptability of improved public transport and subsidies of renewable fuel. The aim of Study IV was to examine the behavioral adaptations, more specifically, the expected car use reduction, in response to three hypothetical TDM measures: <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel, improved public transport, and a package of <b>raised</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> fossil fuel and improved public transport. Furthermore, factors important for the expected car use reduction were analyzed. Results showed that a combination of the measures was expected to lead to a larger car use reduction compared to the single measures, and the most commonly chosen reduction strategies were more efficient car use and changing travel mode. Moreover, internal motivational factors, such as personal norm, and the perceived personal impact of the measures were important for expected car use reduction in response to the measures...|$|R
