25|$|Academics Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg {{have criticized}} Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> {{for his role}} in the {{promotion}} and rise in tech stocks. Their research cites numerous examples of Greenspan putting a positive spin on historic stock valuations despite a wealth of evidence suggesting that stocks were overvalued.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{opposition}} in Congress for an initially proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut (over ten years), Bush held town hall-style public meetings {{across the nation}} in 2001 to increase public support for it. Bush {{and some of his}} economic advisers argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers. With reports of the threat of recession, Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> said tax cuts could work but must be offset with spending cuts.|$|E
25|$|John Linder {{asserts that}} an {{estimated}} 11 trillion dollars is {{currently held in}} foreign accounts, largely for tax purposes, and is growing by $800 billion per year. Former Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> predicts that enactment of the FairTax {{would result in a}} large portion of those funds being transferred to U.S. banks, where they would become available to U.S. capital markets, bringing down interest rates, and otherwise promoting economic growth in the United States instead of the countries where those funds are currently held.|$|E

500|$|The {{possibility}} of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists. Former US Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> gave his opinion in September 2007 that it was [...] "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency". In contrast to Greenspan's 2007 assessment, the euro's increase in {{the share of the}} worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and {{since the beginning of the}} worldwide credit crunch related recession and European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E
500|$|Many {{economists and}} world governments {{determined}} that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan.</b> Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back {{a large portion of}} the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated [...] "The Collective") included future Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara, and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's {{close relationship with the}} younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.|$|E

500|$|The {{surplus in}} fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third {{consecutive}} surplus and the largest surplus ever. In 2001, Bush's budget estimated {{that there would be}} a $5.6trillion surplus over the next ten years. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35trillion tax cut program—one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying [...] "the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money." [...] Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security. O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts. By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant. Another tax cut program was passed that year.|$|E
2500|$|Former Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> {{praised the}} Sarbanes–Oxley Act in 2005: [...] "I am {{surprised}} that the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, so rapidly developed and enacted, has functioned {{as well as it}} has...the act importantly reinforced the principle that shareholders own our corporations and that corporate managers should be working on behalf of shareholders to allocate business resources to their optimum use." ...|$|E

And to uphold our currency's soundness, it must be recognized and honored as legal tender and counterfeiting must be effectively thwarted," [...] Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> said at a ceremony unveiling the $20 bill's new design. Prior to the current design, the most recent redesign of the U.S. dollar bill was in 1996.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the dot-com crash and the {{subsequent}} 2001-2002 recession the Federal Reserve dramatically lowered interest rates to historically low levels, from about 6.5% to just 1%. This spurred easy credit for banks to make loans. By 2006 the rates had moved up to 5.25% which lowered the demand and increased the monthly payments for adjustable rate mortgages. The resulting foreclosures increased supply, dropping housing prices further. Former Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> admitted that the housing bubble was [...] "fundamentally engendered by the decline in real long-term interest rates." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{some have}} spoken {{out in favor}} of {{moderate}} inequality as a form of incentive, others have warned against the current high levels of inequality, including Yale Nobel prize for economics winner Robert J.

2500|$|Concern extends even to such {{supporters}} (or former supporters) of laissez-faire {{economics and}} private sector financiers.

[...] Some economists (David Moss, Paul Krugman, Raghuram Rajan) believe the [...] "Great Divergence" [...] may be connected to the financial crisis of 2008. Money manager William H.

5000|$|The Economist {{magazine}} stated, [...] "The worldwide rise {{in house}} prices {{is the biggest}} bubble in history", so any explanation needs to consider its global causes {{as well as those}} specific to the United States. The then Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> said in mid-2005 that [...] "at a minimum, there's a little 'froth' (in the U.S. housing market) ... it's hard not to see {{that there are a lot}} of local bubbles"; Greenspan admitted in 2007 that froth [...] "was a euphemism for a bubble". In early 2006, President Bush said of the U.S. housing boom: [...] "If houses get too expensive, people will stop buying them... Economies should cycle".|$|R
5000|$|While bubbles may be {{identifiable}} in progress, bubbles can be definitively measured only {{in hindsight}} after a market correction, {{which began in}} 2005-2006 for the U.S. housing market. Former U.S. Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> said [...] "We had a bubble in housing", and also said {{in the wake of}} the subprime mortgage and credit crisis in 2007, [...] "I really didn't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006." [...] In 2001, <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> dropped interest rates to a low 1% in order to jump the economy after the [...] ".com" [...] bubble.

5000|$|Because of {{its height}} and {{visibility}} from the Boston Back Bay neighborhood across the Charles River Basin, plus its rectangular grid of large 6 x 8 ft upright rectangular single-pane windows forming a crude 9 x 18 dot-matrix display, the Green Building {{has been the}} site of many hacks or pranks. [...] In 1993, one widely viewed hack repurposed the nine top-floor windows as an enormous digital VU meter for the traditional Fourth of July concert of the Boston Pops orchestra. Several other simpler hacks have used the entire window array for stationary displays; this practice is sufficiently commonplace to have acquired the term greenspeak (which {{should not be confused}} with the famously obscure Delphic pronouncements of former Federal <b>Reserve</b> Bank <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan).</b>|$|R

" We document the extent and timing of this conundrum using two empirical no-arbitrage macro-finance models of the term structure of interest rates. These models confirm that the recent behavior of long-term yields has been unusual-that is, it cannot be explained {{within the framework of}} the models. Therefore, we consider other macroeconomic factors omitted from the models and find that some of these variables, particularly declines in long-term bond volatility, may explain a portion of the conundrum.

40|$|Measuring the {{benefits}} to consumers from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac activities has received considerable attention, particularly in recent months.

First, the estimates of the benefits may be too low if they fail to consider subsidies to commercial banks. Second, the dollar amount of {{the benefits to}} consumers ranges from $ 6. 76 billion based on the Passmore et al (2005) study to quite large ($ 9. 25 billion for the Cotterman and Pearce (1996) study.

50|$|Derivatives such as CDS were {{unregulated}} or barely regulated. Several {{sources have}} noted {{the failure of the}} US government to supervise or even require transparency of the financial instruments known as derivatives.A 2008 investigative article in the Washington Post found that leading government officials at the time (Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt) vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives. In 1998 Brooksley E. Born, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, put forth a policy paper asking for feedback from regulators, lobbyists, legislators {{on the question of whether}} derivatives should be reported, sold through a central facility, or whether capital requirements should be required of their buyers. Greenspan, Rubin, and Levitt pressured her to withdraw the paper and Greenspan persuaded Congress to pass a resolution preventing CFTC from regulating derivatives for another six months - when Born's term of office would expire.Ultimately, it was the collapse of a specific kind of derivative, the mortgage-backed security, that triggered the economic crisis of 2008.|$|R
40|$|Removing {{transportation}} {{trust funds}} from the federal budget would undermine efforts to reduce the federal deficit and to devolve decision making to the states. Supporters of the policy, moreover, overestimate the nation sinfrastructure prob-lems and underestimate the costs that transportation users impose on society. I n {{the first issue of}} this journal, Congressman Bud Shuster (R-PA) presented several appealingarguments in favor of The Truth in Budgeting Act, a measure that sounds, on first glance, like a good idea (Shuster, 1996). Closer examination, however, shows that it would be bad policy, set a bad precedent, and result in bad decision making. To be specific, a law removing the trust {{funds from the}} unified federal budget would • undermine efforts to reduce the federal deficit; • be based on the false conclusion that the United States is underinvesting in transportation infrastructure; • fail to fully account for the costs of transportation infrastructure; and • undercut efforts to make more cost-effective decisions about transport spending.
