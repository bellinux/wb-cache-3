25|$|DAB is {{not more}} {{bandwidth}} efficient than analogue measured in programmes per MHz of a specific transmitter (the so-called link spectral efficiency), but it is less susceptible to co-channel interference (cross talk), which {{makes it possible to}} reduce the reuse distance, i.e. use the same <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>channel</b> more densely. The system spectral efficiency (the average number of radio programmes per MHz and transmitter) is a factor three more efficient than analogue FM for local radio stations. For national and regional radio networks, the efficiency is improved by more than an order of magnitude due to the use of SFNs. In that case, adjacent transmitters use the same frequency.|$|E

40|$|The maximum {{bandwidth}} capacity of <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>channels</b> {{such as the}} forward control channel (FOCC) used in the mobile switching systems is fixed. The FOCC has been experiencing severe congestion because of the inefficiency of conventional mobile paging methods.

In this dissertation, an approach that minimizes the paging cost of FOCC in order to locate a mobile station in the mobile switching system is presented. In order to minimize the paging cost and to maximize the bandwidth utilization of the FOCC, a new paging schema with the optimal partition of paging zones is developed. By using the refined mobile 2 ̆ 7 s probability pattern stored in the statistical profile, the approach employs the genetic algorithm and the derived fitness function to generate the optimal partition of paging zones, such that the paging cost to locate a mobile station as well as the bandwidth consumption in FOCC is minimized...|$|R

50|$|In a conventional, analog {{two-way radio}} system, a {{standard}} radio has noise squelch or carrier squelch which allows a radio to receive all transmissions.

Selective calling features fit into two major categories: individual calling and group calling. Individual calls generally have longer time-constants: it takes more air-time to call an individual radio unit than to call {{a large group of}} radios.|$|E

50|$|Time-division {{multiple}} access (TDMA) is a channel access method for shared-medium networks. It allows several users {{to share the}} same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using its own time slot. This allows multiple stations to share the same transmission medium (e.g. <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>channel)</b> while using {{only a part of}} its channel capacity. TDMA is used in the digital 2G cellular systems such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), IS-136, Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) and iDEN, and in the Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard for portable phones. It is also used extensively in satellite systems, combat-net radio systems, and PON networks for upstream traffic from premises to the operator.
