30|$|In Brazil, {{there is}} a notable lack of breed variety in the center west and {{especially}} in the north of the country, with a dominance of Dorper, White Dorper and Santa Inês. This is in part due to the recent expansion of sheep farming to these areas (Hermuche et al., 2013 a) and the aggressive marketing carried out by these breed associations. There are some naturalised genetic groups in this region such as the Pantaneira in the Pantanal region of the center-west or Barriga Negra (Black Belly) in the north. These are not yet recognized as breeds by the Ministry of Agriculture although are naturalized and well adapted to their environments. Almost all exotic breeds are registered but several naturalized Brazilian breeds are not, this reflects Brazilian regulations for breed recognition (McManus et al., 2010). Regulations governing genealogical <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> (Brazilian Law 4716 / 1965) included the wording “genealogical register of domestic animals” which led to various interpretations but also limited the participation of smaller breeds, in poorer areas less developed regions (especially the Northeast in the case of sheep) with low HDI and poorly organised farmer’s associations. In 2008, the Commission on Agriculture, Animal Production, Supply and Rural Development in the House of Deputies in the Brazilian National Congress approved a change in the wording in the Law proposal 7210 / 2006 to “genealogical <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> of agricultural interest”, which is hoped should facilitate the registration of smaller populations, ecotypes and breeds.|$|E
40|$|The year 2008 is {{a turning}} point for the {{development}} of eGovernment in the Czech Republic; the acceptance of Government act is awaited; this introduces the obligation of electronic data exchange between state administration and business subjects (government to business- G 2 B). The sphere of agriculture does not stand apart. The Department of Agriculture of the Czech Republic is the central authority of the state administration for agriculture, water resources management, food processing industry, forestry, hunting and fishery. In its administration it has a range of departmental registers. For example: Register of farmland, <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> Register of vineyards, Register of hop-gardens, Register of intensive plantations, Register of agricultural subjects etc. The electronic data exchange between these registers and agricultural entrepreneurs; which will be faster, more effective and more economical than the paper forms; is a big call appeal for the development of eGovernment in the department of agriculture. The current valid legistature obliges the agricultural subjects to hand in the whole range of declarations and announcements to the resort registers. In paper form this means a big ration of duplicate notations which an agricultural company has to fill in, and with this corresponding error rate and work difficulty. Agricultural subjects need also to know data from resort registers; above all, while processing the grants applications. The farmers could gain the needed information only in the form of paper extracts from the registers which constitutes a time demanding and expensive agenda.

Until recently, publication of new names in a work produced with ink on paper was required for their availability.

With this amendment, the rules of zoological nomenclature have been aligned with the opportunities (and needs) of our digital era. However, possible causes for nomenclatural instability remain.

Future developments of the ZooBank may provide the tool required to make this definitive leap ahead in zoological nomenclature. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In 1973 the Rare Breeds Survival Trust {{was set up}} to try {{to prevent}} the {{extinction}} of many of the British traditional breeds. Nowadays, the Welsh pig is not so widely kept as a pure breed but is used extensively in cross-breeding programmes. By 2005, the number <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> breeding <b>animals</b> had dwindled and the Welsh pig was declared [...] "endangered", and later reclassified as a rare breed. This was due to changes in consumer habits and the large numbers of hybrid pigs being produced by the corporate farming industry, which resulted in a dwindling in the pure bred pig population. In 2008 there were 373 registered females from 24 bloodlines, and 108 registered males. By 2012, the numbers had grown, and there were 837 registered females and 238 registered males.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a questionnaire on sickness absence due to back pain and respiratory disorders with the view of using sickness absence as a measure of morbidity. METHODS [...] A cross sectional survey was conducted among 511 male workers aged 20 - 65, drawn from the personnel <b>register</b> <b>of</b> an <b>animal</b> feed mill. The response was 404 (79 %) participants. Data on sickness absence in the six months before the survey were collected by a self administered questionnaire and by sickness absence records. Correlation between both methods was examined for prevalence, duration, and frequency of overall sickness absence, back pain absence, and absence due to respiratory complaints. RESULTS [...] The questions about the prevalence of sickness absence from all causes, back pain, and respiratory complaints showed a high specificity of 91 %, 97 %, and 98 %, respectively. The sensitivities of these questions were 79 %, 88 %, and 13 %, respectively. The survey found a moderate agreement between the questionnaire and the medical register for duration and frequency of overall sickness absence with kappa values of 0. 54 and 0. 50. A good agreement was found for back pain absence with kappa values of 0. 65 and 0. 61. Respiratory absence showed a poor agreement of 0. 16 and 0. 13. CONCLUSION [...] In epidemiological studies questionnaires might be considered a valuable source of information on overall sickness absence or absence due to back pain which lasted for at least two weeks in the past six months. Whether a questionnaire survey is a reliable source of data on sickness absence due to respiratory complaints remains to be seen...|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} of mixed linear statistical models for genetic evaluation of dairy cattle assume that genetic and residual components of variance are each constant across environments. However, this assumption is violated for produc-tion and conformation traits, which can reduce accuracy of selection and cause biases in the proportions <b>of</b> breeding <b>animals</b> chosen from each environment. Best linear unbiased prediction can ac-commodate heterogeneous variances if the appropriate variance components are known. Variance components {{may need to}} be estimated within individual herds using Bayesian or empirical Bayes methods, but such approaches may not yet be computationally feasible on a na-tional basis. For this study, a structural log-linear model for sire and residual variances was used to identify various management factors associated with differences in within-herd variance com-ponents. Increases of herd size and within-herd mean were associated with significant increases of within-herd residual variance for milk and fat yields, but residual variance of milk yield decreased slightly as the proportion <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> <b>animals</b> in the herd increased.

By following the principle that individual breeders register sufficient young females to be certain of having enough replacements for their current breeding stock, the ratios were calculated {{of the number of}} adult females in a breed to the number of female registrations, in a given year. Number of breeds considered were 8 cattle, 16 sheep, 8 pigs, 1 goat and 2 equines, all in the United Kingdom or Ireland.

There was considerable variation between breeds in values of the multiplier, apparently for reasons of breed history and function. This was particularly evident for equines where the two breeds yielded multipliers of 3. 8 and 13. 9.
