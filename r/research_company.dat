5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market <b>research</b> <b>company</b> NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years.

A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle.

Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound {{at about the same}} time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug was successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity.|$|E

40|$|Building {{trust in}} market {{research}} relationships between users and researchers {{is vital for}} a market <b>research</b> <b>company's</b> business to thrive. How to build trust is key to success for market <b>research</b> <b>companies,</b> especially for mid-size companies that need to compete with top companies in the industry. This thesis firstly set up the research constructs by recognizing that trust is a willingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence and that trust serves as a central determinant in relationships. By applying Moorman et al. 's 1993 theoretical framework about factors affecting trust, this thesis then conducts an analysis based on the case study of Consumer Search Group, a growing midsize market <b>research</b> <b>companies</b> in China, and aims to 1) find out the factors that are important for a midsize market <b>research</b> <b>company's</b> business to grow, 2) explore the rationale behind, and 3) discuss how to build trust from those factors. Research results indicate that interpersonal factors, especially willingness to reduce research uncertainties, integrity, collective orientation, and expertise, are the most predictive of trust. To build relationships from these factors, "actively seek out users' research needs", "being honest and offer solutions to problems", "exhibit flexibility", and "show expertise" are suggested ways to build trust accordingly...|$|R
