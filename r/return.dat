The estimates show that daily VIX <b>returns</b> have: (1) significant negative effects on European ETF <b>returns</b> in the short run; (2) stronger significant effects on single market ETF <b>returns</b> than on European ETF returns; and (3) lower impacts on the European ETF <b>returns</b> than on S&P 500 <b>returns...</b>|$|R
