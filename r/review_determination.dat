40|$|Owner's {{cost control}} of large scale {{construction}} projects within a Project Management environment requires {{the processing of}} large amounts of information relating to quantities and unit rates for work expended and work yet to be performed. Cost control is based upon monitoring reports summarizing and presenting the available data and the adoption of appropriate management responses. Due {{to the amount of}} information to be considered, computer processing is almost universally adopted, necessitating management decisions upon the most appropriate of a number of competing computerized cost control programs to be adopted by a particular owner's organization. Such decisions require a basis for comparison. Unbiased comparisons are the ideal to be attained, and to this end, this thesis develops a methodology utilizing a classification system devised to remove some of the elements of bias currently surrounding decisions regarding suitability of any particular proprietary computer program for any owner. [...] The methodology consists of an owner initially determining his information reporting requirements in terms of the classification of data to be presented in each report. For any particular program, the information presented by every report is classified in a similar manner. By comparison of the owner's requirements and the particular program under <b>review,</b> <b>determination</b> may be made concerning the suitability of that particular program for the owner. A number of such available programs may be evaluated against the owner's requirements utilizing the methodology and, by simple discrimination, achievement of unbiased selection of the most suitable is rendered possible.

40|$|Abstract Background Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) is {{not common}} worldwide, {{but it is}} the most common T- and NK-cell lymphomas in many Asian countries. Immunophenotypic {{profiles}} were studied based on limited series. The authors, therefore, studied on ENKTL according to characterize immunophenotypic profiles as well as the distribution of EBV subtype and LMP- 1 gene deletion. Methods By using tissue microarray (TMA), immunohistochemical study and EBV encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization were performed. T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, EBV subtyping, and LMP- 1 gene deletion were studied on the available cases. Results There were 22 cases eligible for TMA. ENKTL were positive for CD 3 (91 %), CD 5 (9 %), CD 7 (32 %), CD 4 (14 %), CD 56 (82 %), TIA- 1 (100 %), granzyme B (95 %), perforin (86 %), CD 45 (83 %), CD 30 (75 %), Oct 2 (25 %), and IRF 4 /MUM 1 (33 %). None of them was positive for βF 1, CD 8, or CD 57. TCR gene rearrangement was negative in all 18 tested cases. EBV was subtype A in all 15 tested cases, with 87 % deleted LMP- 1 gene. Cases lacking perforin expression demonstrated a significantly poorer survival outcome (p = 0. 008). Conclusions The present study demonstrated TIA- 1 and EBER as the two most sensitive markers. There were a few CD 3 and/or CD 56 negative cases noted. Interestingly, losses of CD 45 and/or CD 7 were not uncommon while Oct 2 and IRF 4 /MUM 1 could be positive in a subset of cases. Based on the present study in conjunction with the literature <b>review,</b> <b>determination</b> of PCR-based TCR gene rearrangement analysis might not be a useful technique for making diagnosis of ENKTL. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{analytical}} method on sodium sulfide, sodium sulfite, sodium hydroxide and sodium thiosulfate in sodium polysulfide solution was studied in this paper. The questions in concealing sodium sulfite by formaldehyde and precipitating sodium sulfide by zine acetate, a common method reported in some papers before, was discussed. The improvement on concealing Na 2 SO 3 by SrCl 2 instead of formaldehyde and precipitating Na 2 S by Zn(OH) 2 instead of Zn(Ac) 2 and testing concentration of NaOH in the mixture, was studied. The {{results showed that}} new method is simpler, more rapid, more completely and accurate, the overwhelming reason being {{that it had no}} effect on stability of sodium polysulfide. Intorduction Sodium polysulfide is an important kind of raw material in chemical industry, has been widely used in bamboo pulp, hydrometallurgy, rubber, leather industry and agriculture etc. It is also an important source of sulfur dye. Usually sodium polysulfide used in industry maybe consists of some impurities, such as sodium sulfide, sodium sulfite, sodium thiosulfate and sodium hydroxide. In literature <b>review,</b> <b>determination</b> of sodium sulfide, sodium thiosulfate and sodium polysulfide was reported, while sodium sulfite and sodium hydroxide [1 - 4], and PRC standard for testing sodium polysulfide had not been found. In addition, some effect was overlooked in present papers, such as addition of an excess of Zn(Ac) 2 to precipitate Na 2 S, causing pH decrease (pH= 6 - 7), addition of an excess of formaldehyde to remove Na 2 SO 3, pH value was demanded no larger than 7, but Na 2 Sx maybe decompose. In this paper, the method of testing Na 2 SO 3 and NaOH in sodium polysulfide was studied. The new method of separation of Na 2 S by Zn(OH) 2 suspension instead of Zn(Ac) 2 and separation of Na 2 SO 3 by SrCl 2 instead of formaldehyde has been investigated and it was more accurate and convenient...|$|E

While theoretically feasible, determination of thin and porous occlusions could not be achieved experimentally.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of earthquake catalogues for seismic hazard analysis requires {{the use of}} uniform parameters, in particular for magnitudes, although the original data include a variety of formats, such as macroseismic intensities and various instrumental magnitude scales. In regions of low seismicity, such as South Africa, data are generally sparse and not always sufficient to develop locally calibrated conversion relations. They can nevertheless be used to test the applicability of imported conversion relations, as well as their consistency. The Koffiefontein region of South Africa provides a good test case in view of its somewhat higher level of seismicity, and central geographic location within the country.
