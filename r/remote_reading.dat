40|$|Concurrent {{programs}} executing on NUMA architectures {{consist of}} concurrent entities (e. g. threads, actors) and data placed on different nodes. Execution of these concurrent entities often reads or updates states from remote nodes. The performance of such systems {{depends on the}} extent to which the concurrent entities can be executing in parallel, and on the amount of the <b>remote</b> <b>reads</b> and writes. We consider an actor-based object oriented language, and propose a type system which expresses the topology of the program (the placement of the actors and data on the nodes), and an effect system which characterises <b>remote</b> <b>reads</b> and writes (in terms of which node reads/writes from which other nodes). We use a variant of ownership types for the topology, and a combination of behavioural and ownership types for the effect system. Comment: In Proceedings PLACES 2015, arXiv: 1602. 0325...|$|R

Examples of this include computerization of customer communications (the web portal Enel.it) which allows customers to provide readings, pay bills and take out and modify energy supply contracts; the development of technology for a WebTv system, distance learning and data transmission over electrical wiring. With Enel Trade the company developed a one-to-one relationship with industrial customers, but maybe the most important aspect was the development of the electronic meter, which allows <b>remote</b> <b>reading</b> and different rate bands, of which 33,000,000 have been installed.

40|$|A fast {{shift is}} taking place in Sweden and in other {{countries}} from manual meter reading at irregular intervals, to automatic <b>remote</b> meter <b>reading</b> at pre-defined instants. <b>Remote</b> meter <b>reading</b> {{is an essential part of}} a well-functioning electricity market, but the transmission of large numbers of readings (millions for some network operators) poses serious technical challenges. Different communication channels have been tried, but the power grid is the one that is in any case always available at places where electricity has to be metered. The power grid is however not designed as a communication channel; high disturbance levels and attenuation may occur. The main concern is the as yet unpredictable character of both disturbance and attenuation. The widespread use of the power grid as a communication channel (as will likely be the case with <b>remote</b> meter <b>reading)</b> may also lead to interference with other equipment. This paper will give a general overview of the potential problems associated with remote-meter reading via the power grid and describe some of the technologies available.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} algorithms {{for reducing}} the communication overhead for parallel C programs that use dynamically-allocated data structures. The framework consists of an analysis phase called possible-placement analysis, and a transformation phase called communication selection.

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{of a new generation of}} networks will dramatically increase the attractiveness of loosely-coupled multicomputers based on workstation clusters. The key to achieving high performance in this environment is efficient network access, because the cost of remote access dictates the granularity of parallelism that can be supported. Thus, in addition to traditional distribution mechanisms such as RPC, workstation clusters should support lightweight communication paradigms for executing parallel applications. This paper describes a simple communication model based on the notion of remote memory access. Applications executing on one host can perform direct memory read or write operations on user-defined remote memory buffers.

40|$|Loop tiling and {{communication}} optimizations, such as message pipelining and aggregation, can achieve optimized and robust memory performance by proactively managing storage and data movement. In this paper, we generalize these techniques to pointer-based data structures (PBDSs). Our approach, dynamic pointer alignment (DPA), has two components. The compiler decomposes a program into non-blocking threads that operate on specific pointers and labels thread creation sites with their corresponding pointers. At runtime, an explicit mapping from pointers to dependent threads is updated at thread creation {{and is used}} to dynamically schedule both threads {{and communication}}, such that threads using the same objects execute together, communication overlaps with local work, and messages are aggregated.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} spinning-on-coherency (SOC) {{a technique}} for virtual shared memory (VSM) which enables latency-hiding of <b>remote</b> <b>reads</b> and {{the removal of}} related synchronisation points. Coherence-bits are hardware-tags associated with addresses which record local access permissions (such as read, write, invalid). In SOC a user-thread spins on the particular coherence-bits associated with an address until the new data value is asynchronously propagated and the address becomes valid. Data-propagation occurs when another node issues an update after having written the new value. Performance improvements are demonstrated for two codes, representing the core communication found in Shallow (a well known numerical weather prediction benchmark), and CG (from the NAS Parallel Benchmarks). These are run on a 30 node prototype distributed memory architecture (EDS), with invalidation based sequentially consistent VSM. SOC is also applicable to other consistency models and directory schemes, [...] ...|$|R
