50|$|Ernst Abbe (1840-1905), {{working for}} Carl Zeiss AG in Jena, Germany {{in the late}} 19th century, {{was the first to}} develop a {{laboratory}} refractometer. These first instruments had built-in thermometers and required circulating water to control instrument and fluid temperatures. They also had adjustments for eliminating the effects of dispersion and analog scales from which the readings were taken. In the Abbe' refractometer the liquid sample is sandwiched into a thin layer between an illuminating prism and a <b>refracting</b> <b>prism.</b> The <b>refracting</b> <b>prism</b> is made of a glass with a high refractive index (e.g., 1.75) and the refractometer is designed to be used with samples having a refractive index smaller than that of the <b>refracting</b> <b>prism.</b> A light source is projected through the illuminating prism, the bottom surface of which is ground (i.e., roughened like a ground-glass joint), so each point on this surface {{can be thought of as}} generating light rays traveling in all directions. A detector placed on the back side of the <b>refracting</b> <b>prism</b> would show a light and a dark region.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect is}} {{achieved}} by interfering with the reflection and refraction {{of light from the}} painted object's surface. The paint contains tiny synthetic flakes about one micrometre thick. The flakes are constructed of aluminium coated with glass-like magnesium fluoride embedded in semi-translucent chromium. The aluminium and chrome give the paint a vibrant metallic sparkle, while the glass-like coating acts like a <b>refracting</b> <b>prism,</b> changing the apparent color of the surface as the observer moves.|$|E

50|$|The imaging {{spectrometer}} works by imaging a radiation source onto {{what is called}} a “slit” by means of a source imager. A collimator collimates the beam that is dispersed by a <b>refracting</b> <b>prism</b> and re-imaged onto a detection system by a re-imager. Special care is taken to produce the best possible image of the source onto the slit. The purpose of the collimator and re-imaging optics are to take the best possible image of the slit. An area-array of elements fills the detection system at this stage. The source image is reimaged, every point, as a line spectrum on {{what is called a}} detector-array column. The detector array signals supply data pertaining to spectral content, in particular, spatially resolved source points inside source area. These source points are imaged onto the slit and then re-imaged onto the detector array. Simultaneously, the system provides spectral information about the source area and its line of spatially resolved points. The line is then scanned in order to build a database of information about the spectral content.|$|E

Thus, antivibration equipment and complicated optical alignment system are not required, leading to a much more simple optical setup than previously reported laser holographic lithography techniques. Large-scale (over 1 cm(2)) 2 D hexagonal and 3 D fcc-type PhCs have been produced. Reflection/transmission measurements performed on the fabricated 3 D fcc-type PhC structures agree well with the corresponding band structure calculation.

40|$|Abstract: The article {{describes}} the main results in development of the manual ultrasonic tomograph for testing of welds in metallic objects. For development of small-size system {{it is appropriate to}} use the antenna array with direct excitation of shear wave in the testing object without using <b>refracting</b> <b>prism.</b> The system reconstructs the acoustic image of the defect using the SAFT-C algorithm. Introduction: During the last years tomographic methods is a very developing direction of ultrasonic non-destructive testing. Tomography lightens the methodology of testing and interpretation of signals. This is especially important at distinguishing the signals from the defects from the signals determined by the weld form (internal roller, facets and other). Besides the tomography enlarges the possibilities in developing flaw detection and gauging methods...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Prism {{adaptation}} (PA), a perceptual distortion technique forcing realignment between ocular- and arm- proprioceptive reference frames, {{has shown}} promise as a therapeutic intervention for a surprising range of functional disturbances related to right hemisphere lesions. The current {{study sought to}} explore the potential application of PA therapy in patients with left hemisphere lesions. Methods: Semantic priming (SP) in a lexical decision task, which {{has been shown to}} be reduced in left but not right hemisphere lesioned patients (Henik et al, 1993), was measured before and after adaptation to both right and left <b>refracting</b> <b>prism</b> (in separate sessions) in 12 patients with left hemisphere lesions. PA effectiveness was confirmed with open loop pointing tasks before, post and late following PA. Results: Whereas there was no change in SP after PA in a group of healthy controls, a significant increase in semantic priming, compared to sham PA, was observed after PA in the patient group. These preliminary data also suggest that the increase in SP might be greater after adaptation to right Conclusions: PA may modulate mental processes mediated by the left hemisphere, and could potentially have therapeutic application...|$|E
40|$|Reaching {{toward a}} visual target {{displaced}} by laterally <b>refracting</b> <b>prisms</b> results in adaptation of limb and ocular proprioception, which individually and additively lead to prism adaptation (PA). The recalibration of oculomotor corollary discharge signals, from which orbito-ocular straight-ahead is derived, displaces perception of visual straight-ahead. The contribution of ocular proprioception to PA {{has not yet}} been directly measured. This research {{will be the first to}} utilise eye-tracking technology to measure eye position before, during, and after PA, and to compare those measures with a condition where eye muscle potentiation occurs in the absence of visual error feedback. Additionally, it will be the first study to correlate ocular proprioceptive changes with traditional PA after-effect measures of straight-ahead pointing (limb proprioception), open-loop pointing, and dual-limb passive proprioceptive pointing in both conditions. We found that visual adaptation does not occur in patients with lesions of intraparietal cortex. We therefore hypothesise that calibration of ocular proprioception with oculomotor corollary discharge in this brain region is used in computing visual straight ahead. With this novel work, we aim to better understand the role of ocular proprioception in the rehabilitative application of PA...|$|R

60|$|I {{have heard}} it represented, that if the Light of a Candle be <b>refracted</b> by a <b>Prism</b> to the Eye; when the blue Colour falls upon the Eye, the Spectator shall see red in the Prism, and when the red falls upon the Eye he shall see blue; and if this were certain, the Colours of the Globe and Rain-bow ought to appear in a {{contrary}} order to what we find. But the Colours of the Candle being very faint, the mistake seems to arise from the difficulty of discerning what Colours fall on the Eye. For, on the contrary, I have sometimes had occasion to observe in the Sun's Light <b>refracted</b> by a <b>Prism,</b> that the Spectator always sees that Colour in the Prism which falls upon his Eye. And the same I have found true also in Candle-light. For when the Prism is moved slowly from the Line which is drawn directly from the Candle to the Eye, the red appears first in the Prism and then the blue, and therefore each of them is seen when it falls upon the Eye. For the red passes over the Eye first, and then the blue.|$|R
