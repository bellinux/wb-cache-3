So in real terms, interest does not help the savings grow. Each year of work must pay its share of a year of retirement. For someone planning to work for 40 years and be retired for 20 years, each year of work pays for itself and for half a year of retirement. Hence, 33.33% of pay must be saved, and 66.67% can be spent when earned. After 40 years of saving 33.33% of pay, we have accumulated assets of 13.33 years of pay, as in the graph.

Concern over the level of <b>real</b> <b>rates</b> has been widespread in the analyses by economic policymakers both in Europe and in the United States. In this paper we present evidence on several questions regarding the movement in short term <b>real</b> interest <b>rates</b> in eight countries that have been raised by the recent policy debates in Europe and the United States: Have ex ante <b>real</b> <b>rates</b> in the United States and Europe been high during recent years? Has there been a link between U. S. <b>real</b> <b>rates</b> and those in other countries?

Indeed, <b>real</b> interest <b>rates</b> in the United States are currently at high levels unprecedented in the post war period, which rival the levels that occurred during the Great Depression. Complaints that <b>real</b> interest <b>rates</b> in the United States are exceedingly high seem to be well justified.

40|$|Long-horizon {{interest}} rates in the major international bond markets fell sharply during 2004 and 2005, {{at the same time}} as US policy rates were rising; a phenomenon famously described as a 'conundrum' by Alan Greenspan the Federal Reserve Chairman. But it was arguably the decline in international long <b>real</b> <b>rates</b> over this period which was more unusual and, by the end of 2007, long <b>real</b> <b>rates</b> in the United Kingdom remained at recent historical lows. In this paper, we try to shed light on the recent behaviour of long <b>real</b> <b>rates,</b> by estimating several empirical models of the term structure of <b>real</b> interest <b>rates,</b> derived from UK index-linked bonds. We adopt a standard 'finance' approach to modelling the real term structure, using an essentially affine framework. While being empirically tractable, these models impose the important theoretical restriction of no arbitrage, which enables us to decompose forward <b>real</b> <b>rates</b> into expectations of future short (ie risk-free) <b>real</b> <b>rates</b> and forward <b>real</b> term premia. One general finding that emerges across all the models estimated is that time-varying term premia appear to be extremely important in explaining movements in long <b>real</b> forward <b>rates.</b> Although there is some evidence that long-horizon expected short <b>real</b> <b>rates</b> declined over the conundrum period, our results suggest lower term premia played the dominant role in accounting for the fall in long <b>real</b> <b>rates.</b> This evidence could be consistent with the so-called 'search for yield' and excess liquidity explanations for the conundrum, but it might also partly reflect strong demand for index-linked bonds by institutional investors and foreign central banks.
