25|$|Between 1982–1983 the P7 {{received}} several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications {{resulted in the}} P7M8 model. A new magazine <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> (available {{on both sides of}} the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine. The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed.|$|E
25|$|The Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or {{double stack}} {{magazines}} {{that have a}} 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 33-round high-capacity magazines. For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide stop <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> {{is located on the}} left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.|$|E
500|$|The {{sight head}} was mounted {{on top of}} a square platform, with screw {{adjustments}} {{that could be used to}} level the platform. A spirit level on the sight allowed it to be checked. The normally periodic and minor changes required to level the sighting head could be performed by removing the cover over the [...] spirit level and then turning a small adjusting screw on the mount. Pressing the <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> unlocked the sighting head from the mounting shaft on the left of the platform, allowing the sight to be removed and then re-attached simply by sliding it back onto the shaft, maintaining the level setting between missions.|$|E
50|$|Empty {{magazines}} are released by depressing ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers</b> {{incorporated into the}} trigger guard.|$|R
50|$|The FNS {{series of}} the pistols all include ambidextrous {{magazine}} releases, and slide stop <b>release</b> <b>levers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... the lighter, hollow CC (Cross Country) axle: the CC can be {{used with}} quick <b>release</b> <b>levers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The seat [...] tube {{contains}} the seatpost of the bike, which {{connects to the}} saddle. The saddle height is adjustable by changing how far the seatpost is inserted into the seat tube. On some bikes, this is achieved using a quick <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> The seatpost must be inserted at least a certain length; this is marked with a minimum insertion mark.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplicity}} of the design also led to a farcical situation with the official scrutineers. The regulations required [...] "means for reversing", which the White Triplex did not have. Mechanics first jury-rigged an electric motor and roller drive onto a tyre, but this was unable to rotate against the compression of the three large engines, {{which could not be}} un-clutched. An even more complicated contrivance was tried, an entire separate rear axle was fitted, held above ground until dropped by a <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> and then driven by a separate driveshaft. The device is not believed to have been fitted during the record attempt itself, but it satisfied the scrutineers.|$|E
2500|$|The 1974 models brought further modifications. [...] A 1.6l engine {{producing}} 44 HP SAE (50 PS DIN) {{replaced the}} previous 1.5l. The front fenders were enlarged, new front turn signals (identical {{to the ones}} on American spec Beetles) were added, and round, enlarged taillights were introduced, one year after their appearance on German Beetles (except the 1973 VW 1200). The engine cover remained unchanged, except it no longer had an emblem. Inside, the front seats were re-designed, and the interior colour was changed from gray to black. Also, the front hood <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> was relocated inside the glovebox, as on 1969 and later German Beetles.|$|E
50|$|Empty {{magazines}} are released by depressing ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers</b> {{incorporated into the}} trigger guard in all non M2 PPQ variants or by depressing a reversible thumb release push-button located behind {{the bottom of the}} trigger guard in the PPQ M2 variant. Additionally, the PPQ M2 {{magazines are}} not compatible with the original PPQ magazines.|$|R
25|$|Polymer {{holsters}} {{in various}} configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, slide stops, magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers,</b> and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups {{are designed to}} allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.|$|R
50|$|The PPQ M2 is {{a variant}} {{introduced}} at the 2013 Shot Show by {{the newly formed}} Walther Arms Inc. It has the same features as the standard PPQ with the sole exception that the ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers</b> incorporated {{into the bottom of}} the trigger guard have been omitted and replaced by a thumb release push-button located behind the bottom of the trigger guard. For left-handed use the magazine release push-button is reversible.Additionally, the PPQ M2 magazines are not compatible with the original PPQ magazines.|$|R
2500|$|A sliding knife is a knife {{that can}} be opened by sliding the knife blade out {{the front of the}} handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this is the gravity knife). Another form is an O-T-F (out-the-front) switchblade, which only {{requires}} the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed. [...] A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding utility knife (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).|$|E
2500|$|The Health & Safety Executive report {{stated that}} [...] "Hammond's {{instantaneous}} {{reaction to the}} tyre blow-out {{seems to have been}} that of a competent high performance car driver, namely to brake the car and to try to steer into the skid. Immediately afterwards he also seems to have followed his training and to have pulled back on the main parachute <b>release</b> <b>lever,</b> thus shutting down the jet engine and also closing the jet and afterburner fuel levers. The main parachute did not have time to deploy before the car ran off the runway." [...] The HSE notes that, based on the findings of the North Yorkshire Police (who investigated the crash), [...] "the accident may not have been recoverable", even if Hammond's efforts to react were as fast as [...] "humanly possible".|$|E
50|$|The take-down lever {{is used to}} {{lock the}} slide back (as the Browning Hi-Power safety is used) during {{disassembly}} to allow removal of the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> In later variants, this lever is omitted and the slide must be manually aligned to remove the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> Once the slide and frame are aligned (by the disassembly lever or manually), the recoil guide is pulled forward to release the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> {{and allow it to}} drop free. The slide will then be free to run forward and be removed from the frame.|$|E
50|$|The CZ 75 {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It {{uses the}} Browning linkless cam locking system {{similar to that used}} in the Browning Hi-Power pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked {{together}} on firing, using locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of the slide. An enclosed cam track integral with the barrel is actuated by the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever's</b> transverse pin. After the first few millimetres of the recoil stroke, the barrel is cammed downwards at the rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the spent cartridge.|$|R

5000|$|All {{variations}} of the pistols (save some law enforcement models that are decock only) include ambidextrous safety/decocking <b>levers,</b> magazine <b>releases,</b> and slide stop <b>release</b> <b>levers.</b> [...] All variations also include a Picatinny rail, tritium night sights, and a loaded chamber indicator on the right side. [...] New models are sold in a plastic hard case with three magazines, and two interchangeable backstraps. [...] As of 2012, new models include 4 interchangeable backstraps rather than two. One is shipped on the handgun and three extra are in the case. The backstraps are two different thicknesses and two different patterns (a cross-hatch pattern similar {{to the sides of}} the grip, and horizontal lines similar {{to the front of the}} grip).|$|R

5000|$|Walther {{presented}} a redesigned second generation P99 in 2004, incorporating a modified trigger guard that eliminated the [...] "ski hump", which is clearly {{visible in the}} accompanying first generation images. This was done to address user comfort concerns regarding the previous style.The first generation P99 pistols had a slide release at {{the left side of}} the frame while second generation guns may have optional ambidextrous slide stop <b>release</b> <b>levers.</b> Walther also took the opportunity to redesign the slide so the user could grip it more easily, and notably, change the proprietary accessory rail to a Weaver type.Some models built in 2005 and all later models received one more design change, an elongated magazine release.|$|R

50|$|The P99 RAD grip {{shape and}} texture has been altered when {{compared}} to the P99 variants and an extended ambidextrous slide release and extended ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers</b> are fitted as a standard feature. Besides that the slide shape, dimensions and serrations have been altered. The standard sights are high-contrast 3 dot sights with contrast enhancements that have been painted with afterglow paint that can aid target acquisition under unfavourable lighting conditions. As an option the P99 RAD can also be fitted with self-luminous tritium night sights. The P99 RAD pistol is available with the DAO trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately 39 N and the QA trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately 32 N. The grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching tactical lights and laser sighting devices.|$|R

40|$|Impulse {{activity}} was recorded extracellularly from noradrenergic neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus (LC; 47 single-cell and 126 multicell recordings) of four cynomolgus monkeys performing an oddball visual discrimination task. For juice reward, {{the subjects were}} required to <b>release</b> a <b>lever</b> rapidly {{in response to an}} infrequent (1 O- 20 % of trials) target cue (CS+) that was randomly intermixed with nontarget (CS-) stimuli presented on a video display. All LC neurons examined were phasically and selectively activated by target cues in this task. Other task events elicited no consistent response from these neurons (juice reward, <b>lever</b> <b>release,</b> fix-spot stimuli, nontarget stimuli). In one animal, nontarget cues phasically inhibited LC neurons.

40|$|Impulsivity, the {{tendency}} to act without foresight, is a characteristic of behavior that can being seen in everyday life, but high level of impulsivity {{is associated with a}} number of psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and drug addiction. It has been suggested that impulsivity is not a unitary construct, but rather a multi-faceted　construct. This study take up the behavioral paradigm that rats were required to keep pressing a lever to assess these impulsive behavior. In this paradigm, rats were required to keep pressing a lever for 4 seconds to obtain electrical stimulation of medial forebrain bundle, and to <b>release</b> the <b>lever</b> to begin next trial once they obtained electrical stimulation. Nicotine (0. 4 mg/kg, s. c.), suggested to increase impulsivity, had no effect on the percentage of responses to keep pressing the lever for 4 seconds, but decreased response latencies, and accelerated to <b>release</b> the <b>lever</b> after they had obtained a electrical stimulation. These results suggested that nicotine decreased impulsive behavior, specially to stop responses occur...|$|R
