2500|$|This story {{came from}} a {{misunderstanding}} of a transaction in 1671, when he was recorded as purchasing a [...] "fee farm rent" [...] issuing out of the Manor of Princes Risborough. This was a perpetual <b>rentcharge</b> or ground rent secured on the rents and profits of the manor (not the Manor House, which was then Brook House). In other words, {{it was like a}} financial instrument securing an annual income. He would have bought it as an investment and would have received the income at stated intervals. It is very unlikely that he ever went near Princes Risborough himself.|$|E
60|$|In October, Mrs. Crawley {{paid the}} twenty pounds to Fletcher, the butcher, and in November Lord Lufton's cheque was traced {{back through the}} Barchester bank to Mr. Crawley's hands. A brickmaker of Hoggle End, much favoured by Mr. Crawley, had asked for change over the counter of this Barchester bank,--not, as will be understood, the bank on which the cheque was drawn--and had {{received}} it. The accommodation had been refused to the man at first, but when he presented the cheque the second day, bearing Mr. Crawley's name {{on the back of}} it, together with a note from Mr. Crawley himself, the money had been given for it; and the identical notes so paid had been given to Fletcher, the butcher, on the next day by Mrs. Crawley. When inquiry was made, Mr. Crawley stated that the cheque had been paid to him by Mr. Soames, on behalf of the <b>rentcharge</b> due to him by Lord Lufton. But the error of this statement was at once made manifest. There was the cheque, signed by Mr. Soames himself, for the exact amount,--twenty pounds four shillings. As he himself declared, he had never in his life paid money on behalf of Lord Lufton by a cheque drawn by his lordship. The cheque given by Lord Lufton, and which had been lost, had been a private matter between them. His lordship had simply wanted change in his pocket, and his agent had given it to him. Mr. Crawley was speedily shown to be altogether wrong in the statement made to account for possession of the cheque.|$|E

60|$|Some {{six weeks}} after this, inquiry began to be made as to a certain cheque for twenty pounds drawn by Lord Lufton on his bankers in London, which cheque had been lost early in the spring by Mr. Soames, Lord Lufton's man of {{business}} in Barsetshire, together with a pocket-book in which it had been folded. This pocket-book Soames had believed himself to have left at Mr. Crawley's house, and had gone so far, even {{at the time of}} the loss, as to express his absolute conviction that he had so left it. He was in the habit of paying a <b>rentcharge</b> to Mr. Crawley on behalf of Lord Lufton, amounting to twenty pounds four shillings, every half-year. Lord Lufton held the large tithes of Hogglestock, and paid annually a sum of forty pounds eight shillings to the incumbent. This amount was, as a rule, remitted punctually by Mr. Soames through the post. On the occasion now spoken of, he had had some reason for visiting Hogglestock, and had paid the money personally to Mr. Crawley. Of so much there was no doubt. But he had paid it by a cheque drawn by himself on his own bankers at Barchester, and that cheque had been cashed in the ordinary way on the next morning. On returning to his own house in Barchester he had missed his pocket-book, and had written to Mr. Crawley to make inquiry. There had been no money in it, beyond the cheque drawn by Lord Lufton for twenty pounds. Mr. Crawley had answered this letter by another, saying that no pocket-book had been found in his house. All this had happened in March.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, a <b>rentcharge</b> is {{an annual}} sum {{paid by the}} owner of {{freehold}} land (terre-tenant) to {{the owner of the}} <b>rentcharge</b> (rentcharger), a person who need have no other legal interest in the land. They are often known as chief rents in the north west of England but the term ground rent is used {{in many parts of the}} country to refer to either a <b>rentcharge</b> or a rent payable on leasehold land. This is confusing as a true ground rent is a sum payable in relation to land held under a lease. As a result, it is important to know the status of the land for which, an annual sum is paid.|$|E
50|$|Rentcharges {{provided}} a regular income for landowners who {{were prepared to}} release land for development, the original builder, {{or in some cases}} a third party. The payments due are typically between £2 to £5 per annum, which are no longer a significant burden due to past inflation. Sometimes the land was released without a capital sum being paid with the <b>rentcharge</b> being the only payment. Once imposed, a <b>rentcharge</b> continues to bind all the land even when the land is later divided and sold off in plots. In such cases one terre-tenant can be made responsible for paying the whole rent. That person is then left to collect the appropriate portion from the other terre-tenants whose land is subject to the <b>rentcharge.</b>|$|E

50|$|The 1977 Act {{retained}} ‘estate rentcharges’. These are rentcharges {{that serve}} {{one of two}} purposes. Either the <b>rentcharge</b> {{is used as a}} device to impose a duty on the terre-tenant to perform a covenant or it is used to pay for services performed by the rentcharger for the provision of services, maintenance etc. {{for the benefit of the}} land burdened by the <b>rentcharge.</b> Rentcharges will therefore continue to exist as a means of paying for the upkeep of freehold estates.|$|E
50|$|The Rentcharges Act 1977 {{seeks to}} abolish most forms of <b>rentcharge.</b> Section 2 {{prohibited}} {{the creation of}} new rentcharges except for 'estate rentcharges' (see below). Such rentcharges may also be redeemed (i.e. ‘bought out’) by the terre-tenant, generally for around sixteen times the annual amount of the <b>rentcharge</b> in accordance with provisions in the Act. Although many rentchargers will try to make a private settlement with the terre-tenant, the Act provides a formula which enables Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) to calculate the redemption figure that the terre-tenant has to pay the rentcharger in order to redeem their <b>rentcharge.</b> When the transaction has been completed DCLG, on behalf of the Secretary of State, issues a redemption certificate to the terre-tenant. Any existing rentcharges other than estate rentcharges will be extinguished on 22 August 2037.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rentcharge</b> {{is a legal}} device which {{permitted}} {{an annual}} payment to be continually levied on a freehold property. It has been in existence since the 1290 Statute of Quia Emptores and was originally payable to {{the lord of the}} manor in perpetuity.|$|E
5000|$|After Rathcormac, the Dublin Castle {{administration}} {{stopped the}} automatic assignment {{of military and}} police escorts to agents collecting tithes, instead requiring documentary proof that the collectors were endangered.

These provisions were an uncontentious technical amendment of an act passed in 1745 (19 George II c.11).|$|E
5000|$|The final steps towards actual {{abolition}} {{of the system of}} <b>rentcharges</b> took place under the government of Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, when the cause was promoted by Télesphore-Damien Bouchard, the Liberal deputy and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He declared that [...] "a very large number of villein socagers have not yet redeemed for over the seventy years that {{they have been able to}} do so the passage of the 1854 law" [...] and they must [...] "make an annual pilgrimage to pay dues, very often, to a stranger who has acquired rights originally belonging to our ancestral families".|$|R
25|$|The system {{gradually}} {{ended with}} the Tithe Commutation Act 1836, whose long-lasting Tithe Commission replaced them with a commutation payment, land award and/or <b>rentcharges</b> to those paying the commutation payment and {{took the opportunity to}} map out (apportion) residual chancel liability where the rectory had been appropriated during the medieval period by a religious house or college. Its records give a snapshot of land ownership in most parishes, the Tithe Files, are a socio-economic history resource. The rolled-up payment of several years' tithe would be divided between the tithe-owners as at the date of their extinction.|$|R
50|$|The Custom of Paris {{contained}} four titles regarding {{debt collection}} and commercial transactions that were {{greatly influenced by}} the canon-law ban on interest-bearing loans. For instance, {{with the exception of}} <b>rentcharges</b> that allowed interest, notaries were forbidden to include interest charges within their contracts. Notaries {{played a significant role in}} the French legal tradition, as opposed to English practice; notaries drew up most agreements and served as mediators. Performing the function of magistrates in non-contentious matters, notaries facilitated amicable settlements through transactions, accords and désistements. Most of a notary's work concerned property law, primarily in the areas of conveyancing, inheritance, indebtedness, and investment.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{official}} established church, the Church of Ireland was funded partially by tithes imposed on all Irish citizens, {{irrespective of the}} fact that it counted only a minority of the populace among its adherents; these tithes were a source of much resentment which occasionally boiled over, as in the [...] "Tithe War" [...] of 1831/36. Eventually, the tithes were ended, replaced with a lower levy called the tithe <b>rentcharge.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In concept, to be a lay rector is now {{entirely a}} burden for having taken rights over land such as impropriated glebe (the vast {{majority}} of glebe formerly held by a vicar or clerical rector has no liability) or abbeylands and therefore being exempt from paying the tithes that other parts of that parish paid, as the agricultural produce or (after 1836) <b>rentcharges</b> the landowner used to receive no longer apply. Lay rectors would usually be wealthy landowners owning {{a substantial amount of}} property in the parish. Tithes have been terminated or commuted for centuries and en masse since the Tithe Commutation Act 1836, remaining ones terminating in the Finance Act 1977, so it is sometimes possible to discover definitively from any free source whether a given piece of land is still glebe in a present parish that must have had a rector but no longer does - maps and records held by the National Archives can be consulted. Also in some cases it is possible to see which plots of land fall under headings c) and d) of apportionment of chancel liability, from the church website itself. [...] If a parish's liability only falls under headings a) or b) then those persons (a corporate/charitable body or private individual) are liable only, however some geographically diverse parishes had extraneous tithings and in a few cases in the 19th century a merger of the rectory/rectorial land and tithes into one piece of land as a whole took place, such as in Aston Cantlow.|$|R
5000|$|The church's advowson {{was from}} Priory of Monk Sherborne (Pamber Priory) {{by the year}} 1291 when various of its tithes and {{donations}} provided the Prior's pension. Upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries the advowson was exercised by the Crown until the 19th century. A parish <b>rentcharge</b> totalling £250 in 1848 was received by the rector, the parishioners having commutated the tithes; the parish glebe stood at 28 acres. By 1923 the rector's patron was the Lord Chancellor.|$|E
50|$|With {{regard to}} the former of these classes, it may be noticed that {{although}} apportioned rent becomes payable only when the whole rent is due, the landlord, {{in the case of}} the bankruptcy of an ordinary tenant, may prove for a proportionate part of the rent up to the date of the receiving order; and that a similar rule holds good in the winding up of a company; and further that the act of 1870 applies to the liability to pay, as well as to the right to receive, rent. Accordingly, where an assignment of a lease is made between two half-yearly rent-days, the assignee is not liable to pay the full amount of the half-year's rent falling due on the rent-day next after the date of the assignment, but only an apportioned part of that half-year's rent, computed from the last mentioned date. If you pay a ground rent on a leasehold property or a <b>rentcharge</b> on a freehold property that is also payable on other neighbouring properties, you can apply to the Department for Communities and Local Government for an ‘order of apportionment’ that legally separates your share of the ground rent or <b>rentcharge.</b>|$|E
