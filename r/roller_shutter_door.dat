50|$|The south {{elevation}} {{is occupied}} {{almost entirely by}} two continuous bands of windows following an identical pattern to the north elevation but without the projecting centre bay. At ground floor level two doors interrupt the pattern at the eastern end and toward the centre two window bays have been removed and in filled with fibre cement boarding and an aluminium window. At the western end a vehicle ramp leads down to a <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>door</b> to the basement.|$|E
50|$|The main facade, of tuck-pointed red brick, {{reflects}} the structural bays {{of the building}} with a large central arched opening, and slightly smaller flanking arches. The three bays are defined by brick pilasters which extend through to the parapet. The windows in the upper portions of each bay have narrow timber glazing bars. The central bay contains a <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>door</b> while the bay on the eastern end contains a timber door with a carved timber baroque pediment.|$|E
50|$|Other {{buildings}} on the site include the a toilet block (1913) with a gable roof and clad with corrugated iron. A second brick toilet block, kitchen and shower block is located along the Linville Lane side of the property. Also located in the north-eastern corner of the site include a small brick building which originally stored inflammable liquid and a demountable building. A large skillion roofed shed sheeted with ribbed colourbond metal, with a <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>door</b> is located along the Waldheim Street side {{to the north of}} the parade ground.|$|E
50|$|All were {{allocated}} to CA. Initially only the seats were removed, although later a more substantial conversion was carried out, including the fitting of <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>doors,</b> with {{two sets of}} these on the DTCs where the vestibules/passenger doors had been.|$|R
50|$|A {{single track}} enters the shed {{at the western}} and eastern ends through new hinged double gates clad with colorbond. A new {{concrete}} floor has replaced the original timber floor. Original offices at each end have also been removed. Two new <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>doors</b> {{are located in the}} southern and western sides.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, 22 {{redundant}} power cars, {{including the}} first built, no. 51591, were rebuilt to form 11 two-car parcels units. Vehicles were renumbered 55966-987, and formed into sets CH910 to CH920. Units were fitted with <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>doors,</b> and were based at Chester depot. The units lasted in service until 1989, when they were withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|The film {{starts out}} on a rainy night with a {{conversation}} between four cops in a police van, patrolling the streets of Mumbai. A car narrowly misses colliding into them on the road, brakes and then continues on towards a house with iron gates. A man in a jacket gets out from the car, heads towards the garage and opens the <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>door</b> when he is shot from behind multiple times. At the same time, the cops in the van receive an alert on the radio that gunshots have been heard somewhere in the vicinity and they ask the driver to head towards {{the location of the}} gunshots.|$|E
50|$|Verandahs at {{the lower}} level have been {{enclosed}} with facebrick walls and banks of louvre windows. At the upper level, the undersill has been clad with fibro and weatherboards and windows of obscure coloured glass extend full length above sill height. Some original (but badly damaged by later work for the convent) octagonal tapered timber posts remain visible from the inside {{and there is a}} triangular pediment placed centrally on the northern facade. The entrance at ground level is secured by means of a contemporary <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>door.</b> Parts of the verandahs have been ceiled with ripple iron fixed to provide a fall to an outer gutter under {{the leading edge of the}} upper level verandah.|$|E
50|$|Common UK fire {{appliance}} manufacturers and suppliers include Dennis, Scania, Volvo, HCB Angus, JDC, EmergencyOne, Angloco and Carmichael.

Many appliances have <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>doors</b> revealing compartments housing various items of equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{sub-classification}} 302/9 {{was used}} for six non-passenger carrying conversions. Units 302990-992 were reduced to three-car length and converted for use as Royal Mail parcels units, {{with the addition of}} bodyside <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>doors,</b> and repainted in Royal Mail red livery. Units 302996-998 were also reduced to three-car length and used as departmental sandite rail treatment units, later being reclassified as Class 937.|$|R
50|$|Forty-two PCVs were {{converted}} by Hunslet-Barclay in Kilmarnock from 1994 to 1996. The rebuilding work including {{removal of the}} windows and slam-doors, the fitting of <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>doors,</b> and modernisation of the cab. The vehicles were given the TOPS code NAA and numbered 94300-94327 and 94331-94345. The first two vehicles converted were prototypes, and were extensively tested to iron out any problems. The subsequent 40 vehicles incorporated modifications {{as a result of}} this testing. At the same time these vehicles {{were converted}}, the Class 47/7 locomotives that hauled mail trains were modified to be able to work in push-pull mode with the PCVs.|$|R
50|$|A <b>roller</b> <b>shutter,</b> <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> or {{sectional}} {{overhead door}} {{is a type}} of <b>door</b> or window <b>shutter</b> consisting of many horizontal slats (or sometimes bars or web systems) hinged together. The door is raised to open it and lowered to close it. On large doors, the action may be motorized. It provides protection against wind and rain. In shutter form, it is used in front of a window and protects the window from vandalism and burglary attempts.|$|R
25|$|The main {{locomotive}} {{works are}} located at Bridgnorth. It is not normally {{open to the}} public but conducted tours and open days are arranged from time to time. Major features of the locomotive works include the boiler shop equipped with overhead crane, Noble and Lund wheel lathe, ex-LT lifting jacks and a Wheeldrop recovered from Leicestershire, installed in 2010. Works to enclose the southern end of Bridgnorth locomotive shed with <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>doors,</b> improve natural illumination and waterproof the building more effectively were completed in early 2009. This forms the first of a number of phases to improve the Bridgnorth site both for staff and for visitors.|$|R
50|$|The {{drum motor}} concept was first {{recorded}} in 1928 {{but was not}} realised until the early 1950s {{when it was first}} produced specifically for conveyor belt applications. The idea was to produce a compact, totally enclosed single component drive unit with high efficiency and lower frictional losses than a conventional geared motor. The new design was quick and easy to install, required no maintenance and because of its totally enclosed IP66 sealed design would be unaffected by dust, dirt grease or water. Today you see many examples of drum motor applications in airport check-in conveyors and security machines, supermarket checkstands, food processing conveyors and weighing equipment. Reversible drum motors are also used for <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Access by road {{transport}} is gained {{by a series of}} large steel <b>roller</b> <b>shutters.</b> Six <b>doors</b> are spaced along the elevation opposite the railway lines towards the south east. Another door provides access via a new concrete ramp through the north eastern end. All of the doors open onto a raised, concrete platform inside the shed which extends about two thirds of its width for its full length.|$|R
5000|$|The Showtrac was a short-wheelbase 4x2 ballast tractor, {{one of the}} few {{vehicles}} ever {{designed specifically}} for fairground use. It could be supplied with a rear body (with half-height <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> access <b>doors),</b> winch, and dynamo with the ballast block underneath. Eighteen were built, to varying specifications (not all had the body fitted, for example), between December 1945 and September 1948. Seventeen have been preserved. There are many look-alike Scammell tractors, but genuine Showtracs had a special [...] "Showtrac" [...] badge on the radiator, and a full-width cab.|$|R
50|$|TOPS {{numbers are}} {{on the front of the}} cabs under the driver's window in a {{non-standard}} typeface, and the units were numbered 325001 - 325016. The units are fitted with large round oleo buffers, and have no gangways between carriages. They carry a livery of Royal Mail red, with two yellow stripes running along the lower bodyside before turning sharply backwards and pointing up towards the roof, black cab window surrounds and a full yellow warning panel. Each set is made up of four cars, with roller doors in place of sliding ones and no windows. Each car has two <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> sliding <b>doors</b> on each side and is designed to hold up to 12 tonnes. They have a pantograph to pick up power from the 25 kV AC overhead lines, and also a shoe to pick up power off the 750 V DC third rail. They cannot work in multiple with any other multiple unit stock, but are fitted with drop-head buck-eye coupling and can therefore be hauled by locomotives. The units were built in such a way that they could easily be converted for passenger use if no longer required for mail services.|$|R
50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>shutters</b> {{have many}} applications, {{including}} doors for vans, garages, kitchens, schools, prisons and warehouses. In {{some parts of}} the world, <b>roller</b> <b>shutters</b> are subsidized by local governments. In areas that are frequently exposed to inclement weather, <b>roller</b> <b>shutters</b> are used as a method of insulation and can protect windows against hail damage.|$|R
