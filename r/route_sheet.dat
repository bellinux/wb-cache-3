40|$|Abstract: Cellular layout is a {{well-known}} solution method to the layout problems in modern batch type production industries. In Cellular manufacturing system (CMS), machines and parts are grouped together based on manufacturing similarities. Generally, zero-one machine-part incidence matrix (MPIM) obtained from the <b>route</b> <b>sheet</b> information is used to form machine cells. The major demerit with such approaches is that real life production factors cannot be accounted for. In an attempt to address generalized cell formation problem, this study considers operational time of the parts processed on each machine. An efficient algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is suggested to form machine cells with the combined objective of minimizing total cell load variation and exceptional elements when workload matrix is presented as input. A new grouping efficiency measure called Modified Grouping Efficiency (MGE) is proposed to evaluate the performance of GA. The proposed algorithm is tested with varied sizes of problems from open literature...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a layout is a {{critical}} step, which may have {{a major influence on}} the success of a plant, particularly when demand is uncertain and variable. In order to counter this variability, one of two strategies is generally adopted, i. e. the identification of either a robust or an agile layout. This study proposes the adoption of indices that will help in identifying the strategy to be preferred. Starting from the case of a single row layout, the results of an experimental campaign are presented and discussed in order to show the efficacy of the indices themselves. Their calculation takes into account the profile of demand over time together with the product <b>route</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe main {{challenges}} for companies in today's environment are an {{increased demand for}} customized products, shorter product life cycles and the resulting higher amount of variants. This leads to significant growth in existing production data. Additionally, improved ICT-systems and networks enable production planners to access {{a broader range of}} data, containing previous solutions and best practices and therefore the required knowledge and experience. Currently this knowledge and experience is not sufficiently used, as the process planning, work scheduling and <b>route</b> <b>sheet</b> generation is often a manual process, relying on the personal experience of the planner. This paper presents an approach to support the process planning {{with the help of an}} innovative method and corresponding digital tool. The digital tool gathers the master data records and numerical control code from previous products. It provides a library of attributes describing the products and the production processes. Through the employment of the developed method and digital tool, process planning can be sped up and standardize by eliminating or reducing manual search. Double work can be avoided. In total, the method and digital tool enable process planners to react faster and more accurately while gaining a competitive edge in dealing with the challenges on the global markets...|$|E
40|$|Appendix F, G and H {{have been}} removed due to copyrightPrecision Manufacturing Limited (PML) is a small general {{engineering}} firm in Feilding, New Zealand. It is a general job shop (with a few specialty products) {{well known in the}} region for producing timely, high quality results. Southchain Conveying Systems Limited was purchased in November of 1998 and is the only conveyor chain manufacturer in New Zealand. Soon after taking over Southchain, the company found it difficult to compete against chain imports in the New Zealand conveyor chain market with a manual operation. At this point in time Precision Manufacturing owner, Garth Thelin, contacted Massey University and the idea of a GRIP project was introduced. The project commenced on November 1 1999 and ran for 14 months. The technical goals of the project were to reduce manufacturing costs by 30 % and limit capital expenditure to $ 100, 000. A numerical process model was built using Microsoft Excel based around a combination of a Bill of Materials model and a <b>Route</b> <b>Sheet</b> model. After completing the proccss model, it was then analysed to obtain a list of first order savings projects in the company. Dollar savings vs. the estimated cost of implementation, as well as interdependencies between the issues, was used as a criteria to rank projects as first order. Two projects were then chosen to be pursued: pin induction automation and roller induction heat treatment. The induction automation project covered the design of the mechanical apparatus, building and testing of working models, building of the production machinery, and the industrial control systems to integrate the mechanics to the induction heater. The roller induction heat treatment project investigated using the in-house induction heater to case harden the chain rollers and divest the company of a high external expense. Six months after the project was completed the company had reduced its costs considerably and as a result, was more profitable. The key to this was the reduction in roller costs. With better margins the company has been able to increase its sales and hence boost production levels. Being more profitable also means the company is {{in a better position to}} implement more cost saving measures and become more competitive in the market place...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an original {{piece of work}} and contribution to knowledge by creating a new process planning system; Haptic Aided Process Planning (HAPP). This system {{is based on the}} combination of haptics and virtual reality (VR). HAPP creates a simulative machining environment where Process plans are automatically generated from the real time logging of a user’s interaction. Further, through the application of a novel usability test methodology, a deeper study of how this approach compares to conventional process planning was undertaken. An abductive research approach was selected and an iterative and incremental development methodology chosen. Three development cycles were undertaken with evaluation studies carried {{out at the end of}} each. Each study, the pre-pilot, pilot and industrial, identified progressive refinements to both the usability of HAPP and the usability evaluation method itself. HAPP provided process planners with an environment similar to which they are already familiar. Visual images were used to represent tools and material whilst a haptic interface enabled their movement and positioning by an operator in a manner comparable to their native setting. In this way an intuitive interface was developed that allowed users to plan the machining of parts consisting of features that can be machined on a pillar drill, 21 / 2 D axis milling machine or centre lathe. The planning activities included single or multiple set ups, fixturing and sequencing of cutting operations. The logged information was parsed and output to a process plan including <b>route</b> <b>sheets,</b> operation sheets, tool lists and costing information, in a human readable format. The system evaluation revealed that HAPP, from an expert planners perspective is perceived to be 70...|$|R

Compared {{with the traditional}} SnO 2 nanofibers, the as-obtained three-dimensional porous networks show enhancement of photocurrent and photocatalytic activity, which could be ascribed to its improved light-harvesting efficiency and electron transport ability along the in-plane direction, and increased lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers.

40|$|Direct {{evidence}} of plasmon for enhanced H 2 production is observed in photocatalytic water reduction by using TiO 2 /WO 3 electrospun nanofibers decorated with Au nanoparticles. The H 2 production {{rate of the}} as-prepared composite nanofibers was greatly enhanced compared with pure TiO 2 nanofibers (S 0) and TiO 2 /WO 3 nanofibers (S 1). The enhanced activities were mainly attributed to the Schottky effect and Z-scheme photosynthetic heterojunction system, in this system, WO 3 as a hole collector and Au as an electron collector, promoting effective charge separation. More importantly, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) effect of Au further promoted charge separation and absorption of visible light. On {{the basis of the}} Z-scheme photosynthetic heterojunction system, the synergistic effect of Schottky and SPR effect further improve the performance of photocatalytic H 2 production, which were directly evidenced by photocurrent, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectrometer (UPS) analysis.

40|$|Among {{the wide}} range of {{strategies}} to target skin repair/regeneration, tissue engineering (TE) with stem cells at the forefront, remains as the most promising <b>route.</b> Cell <b>sheet</b> (CS) engineering is herein proposed, taking advantage of particular cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and subsequent cellular milieu, to create 3 D TE constructs to promote full-thickness skin wound regeneration. Human adipose derived stem cells (hASCs) CS were obtained within five days using both thermoresponsive and standard cell culture surfaces. hASCs-based constructs were then built by superimposing three CS and transplanted into full-thickness excisional mice skin wounds with delayed healing. Constructs obtained using thermoresponsive surfaces were more stable than the ones from standard cell culture surfaces due to the natural adhesive character of the respective CS. Both CS-generating strategies lead to prolonged hASCs engraftment, although no transdifferentiation phenomena were observed. Moreover, our findings suggest that the transplanted hASCs might be promoting neotissue vascularization and extensively influencing epidermal morphogenesis, mainly through paracrine actions with the resident cells. The thicker epidermis, with a higher degree of maturation characterized by the presence of rete ridges-like structures, as well as a significant number of hair follicles observed after transplantation of the constructs combining the CS obtained from the thermoresponsive surfaces, reinforced the assumptions of the influence of the transplanted hASCs and the importance of the higher stability of these constructs promoted by cohesive cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions. Overall, this study confirmed the potential of hASCs CS-based constructs to treat full-thickness excisional skin wounds and that their fabrication conditions impact different aspects of skin regeneration, such as neovascularisation, but mainly epidermal morphogenesis.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the spatio-temporal variability of the glaciological environment in Dronning Maud Land (DML), East Antarctica, investigations were carried out along the 2800 -km-long Japanese-Swedish IPY 2007 / 2008 traverse. The <b>route</b> covers ice <b>sheet</b> ridges and two deep ice coring sites at Dome Fuji and EPICA DML. The surface mass balance (SMB) distribution was derived based on analysis of isochrones within snow pits, firn cores and subsurface radar signals. The SMB averaged over various time scales in the Holocene was determined. This was then compared with various glaciological data. We find that the large-scale distribution of the SMB depends on the surface elevation, continentality and interactions between ice sheet ridges and the prevailing counterclockwise windfield in DML. A different SMB is found for the windward and leeward sides of the ridges. Local-scale variability in the SMB is essentially governed by bedrock topography which determines the local surface topography. In {{the eastern part of}} DML, the accumulation rate {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century is found to be higher by 15 % compared to averages over longer periods of 722 a or 7. 9 ka before AD 2008.

40|$|Aluminum alloys of the 7000 series possess high {{lightweight}} potential due {{to their}} high specific tensile strength combined with a good ultimate elongation. For this reason, hot-formed boron-manganese-steel parts can be substituted by these alloys. Therefore, the application of these aluminum alloys for structural car body components is desired to decrease {{the weight of the}} body in white and consequently CO 2 emissions during vehicle operation. These days, the limited formability at room temperature limits an application in the automobile industry. By increasing the deformation temperature, formability can be improved. In this study, two different approaches to increase the formability of these alloys by means of higher temperatures were investigated. The first approach is a warm forming <b>route</b> to form <b>sheets</b> in T 6 temper state with high tensile strength at temperatures between 150 °C and 300 °C. The second approach is a hot forming route. Here, the material is annealed at solution heat treatment temperature and formed directly after the annealing step. Additionally, a quench step is included in the forming stage. After the forming and quenching step, the sheets have to be artificially aged to achieve the high specific tensile strength. In this study, several parameters in the presented process routes, which influence the formability and the mechanical properties, have been investigated for the aluminum alloys EN AW 7022 and EN AW 7075. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
