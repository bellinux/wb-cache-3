After a difficult battle Narud's forces were overpowered and Narud was cornered by not only Artanis Kerrigan and Raynor, but Alexei Stukov, who called him [...] "Duran." [...] He asked Duran if he <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> he had done to him, and Narud assumed Stukov was simply there to gloat. Stukov said [...] "No, I'm here to say good night {{you son of a}} bitch." [...] (an echo of the words Duran had said right before shooting him). He then shot Narud with a psychic blast, finishing him for good.|$|E
500|$|U2's 1987 album The Joshua Tree and the {{supporting}} Joshua Tree Tour brought them critical acclaim and commercial success. However, their 1988 album and motion picture Rattle and Hum precipitated a critical backlash. Although the record sold 14million copies and performed well on music charts, critics were dismissive {{of it and}} the film. Hot Press editor Niall Stokes commented [...] "having started out as a band in the slipstream of punk, U2 <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> they had felt about the supergroups of the late '70s. Were they now about to become what they had despised?" [...] In the time leading up {{to the start of the}} Achtung Baby sessions, U2 listened to records which had a [...] "hard-edged industrial kind of sound", including works by KMFDM and Sonic Youth, as well as artists such as Roy Orbison and Jacques Brel. These influences led the band to seek the creation of songs which were harder musically than their previous work, while remaining personal lyrically.|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just as much fun as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot Me! while on set, Colantoni also <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E

In London while en route to Los Angeles, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) is confronted by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) at the airport. She tells him that she wants to kill Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson), a desire they seem to have in common. Following Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes's (Jorge Garcia) breakout of a mental institution, he and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) go to a safehouse, which has been infiltrated by two armed men. Sayid kills the men, but not before one of them shoots him with two potent drugged darts, knocking him unconscious. [...] Meanwhile, Ben and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) have left the funeral parlor with Locke's body. They discover that Hurley has broken out, hindering Ben's plan to reunite the Oceanic Six.

[...] The three astronauts see the Men in Black {{fighting}} the alien villain from the cockpit, but Aldrin realizes that if they report it over the radio to Mission Control the launch will be aborted and they might never {{be sent to the}} Moon. [...] Armstrong nonchalantly responds to Aldrin that [...] "I didn't see anything", and simply doesn't report it. Collins apparently agreed as well. As a result, the Men in Black never realized the astronauts saw them and thus never wiped their memories with their neuralizers as is standard protocol, implying that the astronauts always <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> happened and just never told anyone.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{told that}} when Joseph was young, {{he used to}} study Torah with Jacob. When Joseph's {{brothers}} told Jacob in [...] that Joseph was still alive, Jacob did not believe them, but he recalled the subject that Jacob and Joseph had been studying when they last studied together: the passage on the beheaded heifer ( [...] , egla arufa) in [...] Jacob told the brothers that if Joseph gave them a sign of which subject Joseph and Jacob had last studied together, then Jacob would believe them. Joseph too had <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> subject they had been studying, so (as [...] reports) he sent Jacob wagons ( [...] , agalot) so that Jacob might know that the gift came from him.

2500|$|In 1839 Semyon Leskov {{lost his}} job through a row and intrigue, having brought upon himself {{the wrath of the}} {{governor}} himself. [...] "So we left our house in Oryol, sold what we had in the city and bought a village with 50 peasants in the Kromy region from general A. I. Krivtsov. The purchase was made mostly on credit, for mother was still hoping to get her five thousand off of Strakhov which never came. The tiny village father had bought was eventually sold for debts," [...] Leskov later <b>remembered.</b> <b>What</b> the Leskovs, with their three sons and two daughters, were left with was a small Panin khutor, one very poor house, a watermill, a garden, two peasants' houses and 40 dessiatins of land. This is where Nikolai had his first experiences with oral folklore and the 'earthy' Russian dialecticisms he would later become famous for reviving in his literary work.|$|E
