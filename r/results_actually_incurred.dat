50|$|One obvious {{prerequisite}} for liability {{in terms of}} the law of delict is that the plaintiff must have suffered harm; {{in terms of the}} Aquilian action, that harm must be patrimonial, which traditionally meant monetary loss sustained due to physical damage to a person or property.

With this example we demonstrate inconsistencies that exist between accounting and tax and although the accounting for income taxes standard accounts for the differences, we argue this merely legitimatises them. We challenge this false consciousness that assumes these inconsistencies are merely incidental and point out that these two systems, of tax and accounting, implicitly sustain and reinforce each other. These institutional practices perpetuate the privileges, powers and impact of the mining industry, whilst claiming to serve the community as a whole...|$|R

40|$|There are two key {{unresolved}} {{questions that}} need to be addressed in order to understand the challenge of a late entry. Do late entrants that achieve market share leadership <b>actually</b> <b>incur</b> a market share penalty associated with their entry position? Is their specific entry position a contributing factor or irrelevant to their success? To address these questions, this article uses a consumer scanner data-set containing 360 late entrants, 38 of which achieved market share leadership, to inform a regression analysis examining late entrant performance. As a result of our investigation exploring how late entrants can use marketing mix instruments to challenge incumbents, we propose that although late entry generally leads to a market share disadvantage, several opportunities remain for late entrants to excel.

50|$|The {{estimated}} future cost {{of removing}} the tanks in 40 years is $15,000 * (1.025 ^ 40) = $40,275.96. The {{present value of}} this cost is $40,275.96 / (1.09 ^ 40) = $1,282.29. At installation of the tanks, the company books an asset retirement cost (asset) and an asset retirement obligation (liability) of $1,282.29. The asset is depreciated, usually straight-line, over 40 years (depreciation expense of $32.06 per year). The liability is accreted (interest for each period is calculated and added to the balance), using the interest method. (Accretion expense would be $115.41 the first year, $125.79 the second year, etc.) Over the 40 year life, the liability thereby increases to $40,275.96. At retirement of the tank, the expenses <b>actually</b> <b>incurred</b> to remove the tank are booked against the ARO, and a gain or loss is recognized for the difference.|$|R
3000|$|Previous {{work has}} {{established}} product accumulate codes {{as a class}} of provenly [...] "good" [...] codes on AWGN channels, with low linear-time complexity and performances close to the Shannon limit. This paper performs a comprehensive study of product accumulate codes on Rayleigh fading channels with both coherent and noncoherent detection. Useful analytical tools including Divsalar's simple bounds, density evolution, and EXIT charts are employed, and extensive simulations are conducted. It is shown that PA codes not only perform remarkably well with coherent detection, but the embedded differential encoder makes them naturally suitable for noncoherent detection. A simple iterative differential detection and decoding (IDDD) strategy allows PA codes to perform only 1 [*]dB away from the coherent case. Another useful finding reveals that the widespread practice of inserting pilot symbols to terminate the trellis <b>actually</b> <b>incurs</b> performance loss compared to when pilot symbols are inserted as separate parts from the trellis.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work of Becker, the {{dynamics}} of endogenous fertility {{has been based on}} the trade-off faced by parents between the quantity and the quality of their children.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to restore the Beckerian quantity-quality trade-off when intergenerational transfers are upstream, so as to keep fertility endogenous. We do that by adding a negative "sibship size effect" on human capital formation to the standard Becker model. With a simple specification, we obtain multiplicity of steady states or, more fundamentally, the possibility of a jump from a state with high fertility and low income to a state with low fertility and high income, triggered by a continuous increase in the productivity of human capital formation...|$|R

This paper presents the results of a WTP investigation of two types of screening for colorectal cancer. A questionnaire was issued to a general population via general practitioners (GPs), yielding a sample of approximately 2000 cases for analysis. Regression models demonstrated that WTP was significantly influenced by factors such as gender, income, age, risk perceptions, illness experiences and health beliefs. The median WTP for screening emerged as being pound 30 or pound 50, depending on the method used to elicit WTP, but independent of the screening protocol. Combining the results with those from related research, it emerged, first, that WTP subjects offered higher values for flexible sigmoidoscopy screening than the costs <b>actually</b> <b>incurred</b> by revealed preference studies and, second, they offered WTP values similar to the likely resource costs of the screening procedures...|$|R

The ultimate value of a prediction (estimate) lies in the actual utility (loss reduction) accruing to one who uses this information to make some decision(s). Often we cannot specify with certainty that the prediction will be used in a particular decision problem, characterized by a particular loss matrix (indexed by outcome and decision), and thus having a particular decision threshold. Instead, we consider the more general case of a distribution over such matrices.
