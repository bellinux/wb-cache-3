50|$|Examples of {{rheopectic}} fluids include gypsum pastes and printer inks. In {{the body}} synovial fluid exhibits the extraordinary property of inverse thixotropy or <b>rheopexy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rheopecty or <b>rheopexy</b> is {{the rare}} {{property}} of some non-Newtonian fluids {{to show a}} time-dependent increase in viscosity (time-dependent viscosity); the longer the fluid undergoes shearing force, the higher its viscosity. Rheopectic fluids, such as some lubricants, thicken or solidify when shaken. The opposite and much more common type of behaviour, in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear, is called thixotropy.|$|E
50|$|Synovial {{tissue is}} sterile and {{composed}} of vascularized connective tissue that lacks a basement membrane. Two cell types (type A and type B) are present: Type A {{is derived from}} blood monocytes, and it removes the wear-and-tear debris from the synovial fluid. Type B produces hyaluronan. Synovial fluid is made of hyaluronic acid and lubricin, proteinases, and collagenases. Synovial fluid exhibits non-Newtonian flow characteristics; the viscosity coefficient is not a constant and the fluid is not linearly viscous. Synovial fluid has <b>rheopexy</b> characteristics; viscosity increases and the fluid thickens {{over a period of}} continued stress. Normal synovial fluid contains 3-4 mg/ml hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid), a polymer of disaccharides composed of D-glucuronic acid and D-N-acetylglucosamine joined by alternating beta-1,4 and beta-1,3 glycosidic bonds. hyaluronan is synthesized by the synovial membrane and secreted into the joint cavity to increase the viscosity and elasticity of articular cartilages and to lubricate the surfaces between synovium and cartilage.|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{synovial}} fluid and albumin solutions of similar concentration are rheopectic (stress increases with time in steady shear). This unusual flow characteristic {{is caused by}} protein aggregation, and the total stress is enhanced by entanglement of this tenuous protein network with the long-chain polysaccharide sodium hyaluronate under physiological conditions. Neutron scattering measurements on albumin solutions demonstrate protein aggregation and all measurements are consistent with a weak dipolar attraction energy (of order 3 kT) that is most likely augmented by hydrophobic interactions and/or disulfide bond formation between proteins. Protein aggregation appears {{to play an important}} role in the mechanical properties of blood and {{synovial fluid}}. We also suggest a connection between the observed <b>rheopexy</b> and the remarkable lubrication properties of synovial fluid...|$|E
40|$|The {{viscosity}} of starch-thickened foods {{is critical}} in managing dysphagia (impaired swallowing). These fluids are highly non-Newtonian and exhibit thixotropic behaviour. The thixotropy of the starch-based thickeners {{that are used to}} achieve this critical viscosity is presented. Two types of thickeners were evaluated; maize-based and maltodextrin-based. The thixotropy of these thickeners proved to be complex and the behaviour could be toggled between thixotropy and <b>rheopexy</b> by changing certain variables. The sol to gel transition favours low or zero shear rates when the initial viscosity is low (low starch concentration), but shearing is preferred for structure formation of high viscosity (concentrated) samples. This is likely to be due to Brownian motion being restricted in thicker samples due to less solvent between starch molecules. This may also cause starch granules to be sheared open causing more amylose to enter the viscous matrix...|$|E
40|$|This Letter {{describes}} {{the first real}} space observation {{for the formation of}} a house of cards structure in polypropylene/clay nanocomposite melt under elongational flow by TEM analysis. Both strong strain-induced hardening and <b>rheopexy</b> features are originated from the perpendicular alignment of the silicate layers to the stretching direction. Development of polymer/clay nanocomposites (PCNs) is one of the latest evolutionary step of the polymer technology. The nanocomposites offer attractive potential for diversifica-tion and application of conventional polymeric materials. 1 - 3 To innovate on the material properties of the nanocomposites, we have to understand the material behavior and control the dispersed morphology with nanometer dimensions. In a series of our recent studies on PCN using lipophilized smectic clay minerals, 4 - 6 first we attempted to obtain PCN by dispersing clay particles in a vinyl monomer-initiator mixture that was subsequently allowed to polymerize.

40|$|Different {{viscosity}} {{models were}} developed to describe the viscosity of unprocessed fruit and vegetable purees under dynamic conditions. Temperature hysteresis cycles were carried out for three purees with different structural characteristics (tomato, carrot, and broccoli), with heating and cooling phases from 10 to 80 degrees C with isothermal (holding) phases at 10, 30, 60 or 80 degrees C. The apparent viscosity was measured continuously with a rotational rheometer and the data was analyzed with time-independent and time-dependent models (quantifying <b>rheopexy,</b> thixotropy, or both). The results revealed clear thixotropic behavior in tomato puree, attributed to shearing effects, and rheopectic in broccoli puree, attributed to gel formation at the higher temperatures. Although carrot puree data from the isothermal periods could be quantified satisfactorily with no time dependency, analysis of the nonisothermal periods proved that rheopectic effects also needed to be included.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{formation}} features of thin layers for different multilayered nanocomposites obtaining. It is well-known that screen printing technology is more promising one for thin layers obtaining, but films thickness and parameters of surface are determinate by viscosity and rheological behavior of pastes. Plasticizer addition has {{positive influence on}} thickness and prints parameters of surface of corresponding dielectric pastes based on BaTiO 3 nanopowder because of rheological properties changing during adsorption type modification between nanoparticle and plasticized polymer molecule: <b>rheopexy</b> degree R increasing leads to surface parameter Ra value decreasing (from 83 nm to 20 – 25 nm); shear stress of pseudoplastic flow start increasing leads to thickness growing. It was found that opportunity of bilayer objects formation «conductor - dielectric» is conditioned by dielectric pastes rheological behavior: dilatancy rate Vd increasing leads to dielectric film thickness growing.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether cementitious materials undergo changes during pumping processes due to pressure variation. The influence of pressure on the rheological properties of cement pastes, which assumably represented the lubricating layer that forms along the profile of concrete during pumping, was evaluated using a rotational rheometer with a high-pressure cell. Cement pastes with water-to-cement ratios ranging from 0. 35 to 0. 6 were tested according to a protocol designed to simulate the conditions of an actual pumping process based on field tests. The shear rates, shearing durations, and pressure levels from 0 to 30 MPa were experimentally simulated. The test results indicated that below a certain water-to-cement ratio (0. 40) elevated pressures lead to changes in the rheological properties, while changes were negligible when the ratio was above this threshold. Further, at low water-to-cement ratios the thixotropy of the cement paste can reverse into <b>rheopexy</b> after pressurization. clos...|$|E
40|$|Length {{changes of}} muscle fibers have {{previously}} {{been shown to}} result in a temporary reduction in fiber stiffness that is referred to as thixotropy. Understanding the mechanism of this thixotropy is important to our understanding of muscle function since there are many instances in which muscle is subjected to repeated patterns of lengthening and shortening. By applying sinusoidal length changes to one end of single permeabilized muscle fibers and measuring the force response at the opposite end, we studied the history-dependent stiffness of both relaxed and activated muscle fibers. For length change oscillations greater than 1 Hz, we observed thixotropic behavior of activated fibers. Treatment of these fibers with EDTA and blebbistatin, which inhibits myosin-actin interactions, quashed this effect, suggesting that the mechanism of muscle fiber thixotropy is cross-bridge dependent. We modeled a half-sarcomere experiencing sinusoidal length changes, and our simulations suggest that thixotropy could arise from force-dependent cross-bridge kinetics. Surprisingly, we also observed that, for length change oscillations less than 1 Hz, the muscle fiber exhibited <b>rheopexy.</b> In other words, the stiffness of the fiber increased in response to the length changes. Blebbistatin and EDTA did not disrupt the rheopectic behavior, suggesting that a non-cross-bridge mechanism contributes to this phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ionic strength, pH and droplet size {{distribution}} on {{the stability and}} rheological properties of concentrated emulsions formed using sodium caseinate was investigated. The emulsions were formulated with soybean oil concentration between 50 and 70 wt% and 1 wt% protein. In {{order to understand the}} role and response of the sodium caseinate interfacial thin film to physicochemical changes to the continuous phase the behaviour of sodium caseinate at the air-water and oil-water interfaces, as a function of pH and ionic strength, was studied using Langmuir trough, surface potential and pendant drop methods. Changes in measured system response can be explained by considering changes to protein conformation. Upon increasing ionic strength the data fit with the protein conformation changing from those states where the protein extends into the aqueous phase to those where it essentially lies flat on the interface. Aggregation and dispersion of the protein at the interfaces were detected at different pH values. Also, the buffer capacity of sodium caseinate was evaluated by preparing protein solutions at different pH and ionic strengths. Bridging flocculation and creaming occurred in the emulsions investigated, evaluated via static light scattering and Cryo-SEM. Emulsions with the appearance and texture of liquid-like through to gel-like were formulated by seemingly small changes to the ionic strength and pH of the aqueous phase. Shear-thinning was the flow behaviour of the emulsions with a shear dependent flow response that was function of the parameters evaluated. Time-dependent flow behaviour was detected for the emulsions at a low shear rate and they showed <b>rheopexy</b> behaviour. Viscoelastic properties of the emulsions and the interaction between the droplets were evaluated by strain sweep and creep-recovery tests...|$|E
40|$|Among various nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), ketorolac tromethamine {{has been}} widely used for post operative and emergency treatment of pain. However, it accompanies adverse side effects including gastrointestinal irritation when administered orally. Topical administration of ketorolac offers the advantage of enhanced drug delivery to the affected sites with a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. However, as skin is an exceptionally effective barrier to most chemicals, very few drugs can permeate it in amounts sufficient to deliver a therapeutic dose. Therefore, systems that make the skin locally more permeable and thereby enable transdermal delivery are of great interest. Lecithin organogels are an example of such systems in which solutions of lecithin in organic solvents can be transformed into transparent gels by addition of a critical amount of water. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate lecithin organogels as carriers for topical application of ketorolac tromethamine. In this research, phase studies were carried out to obtain the concentration of components for the existence range of organogel and the effect of these additives on release rate of ketorolac was also evaluated through the artificial membranes and guinea pig skin. As the lecithin concentration was increased from 40 to 50 and then 60 % w/w in formulations, a significant decrease in ketorolac release was obtained. A significant increase in drug release was also observed in formulations containing 6. 5 % w/w of ketorolac compared to those containing 1 % w/w of the drug. Increasing the water content of the organogels also resulted in an increase in ketorolac release. The optimum formulation of the organogel composed of 40 % lecithin, 60 % IPM containing 0. 6 % w/w of water and 6. 5 % w/w of ketorolac tromethamine showed the highest drug release rate. Moreover, the viscosity of the different formulations and their rheological behavior were also determined. All formulations showed a slight <b>rheopexy</b> behavior rheogram. It was found that increase in lecithin concentration resulted in an increase in the viscosity of the organogel. Overall, the results have suggested that ketorolac tromethamine could be incorporated with high concentrations into lecithin organogels which makes them interesting for use as a drug delivery vehicle for water soluble drugs...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to characterise the {{polysaccharide}} extracted from the New Zealand black tree fern, Cyathea medullaris, or mamaku in Maori {{using a combination of}} rheological, structural and in vivo research techniques. Polysaccharides are biopolymers with diverse functionalities that have found their way into many applications in the food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical industries. Novel sources of polysaccharides may have promising functional properties for new or existing applications, therefore it is essential to have fundamental knowledge of their properties. The native and endemic New Zealand black tree fern produces mucilage (containing the polysaccharide) which is extracted from the thick fleshy stem pith of the frond. Rheological properties of the polysaccharide were characterised using rotational shear, oscillatory shear, and extensional rheology. The combination of these techniques provided information on how the polysaccharide deformed under shear, strain and extension. Rotational shear was further classified into tests for shear- dependent viscosity/normal stresses, time-dependent viscosity, and shear-history dependent viscosity. The polysaccharide (5 % w/w) exhibited shear-thickening (4 - 10 s- 1), positive first normal stress differences coinciding with shear-thickening, anti-thixotropy (under constant shear with time at shear rates between 4 - 10 s- 1), and thixotropy (at 1 s- 1, pre-sheared at 10 s- 1) or <b>rheopexy</b> (at 10 s- 1, pre-sheared at 1000 s- 1) depending on shear- history. Oscillatory shear was classified into linear and nonlinear rheology, i. e. small amplitude (SAOS) and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) respectively. Under linear strain deformation, the polysaccharide displayed viscoelasticity and a power-law dependence on concentration for relaxation time (?s~c 3. 6). Complex viscosity did not superimpose on shear viscosity at higher shear rates/angular frequency (nonlinear region), therefore not complying with the Cox-Merz rule. The LAOS response in the nonlinear region was characterised by new large-strain and minimum-strain moduli parameters (G‘L and G‘M), as well as the traditional first-harmonic storage modulus G‘. The polysaccharide (10 % w/w mamaku) was found to exhibit first a linear viscoelastic region (0. 1 - 20 % ? 0), followed by strain-softening (20 - 800 % ? 0), then strain hardening (800 - 2000 % ? 0) and finally a second strain-softening region due to viscous flow (> 2000 % ? 0) for all three elastic moduli measurements. Closer examination of Lissajous plots in the intercycle strain-hardening region revealed deviation from ellipsoidality i. e. sigmoidal shapes, which were representative of intracycle strain-stiffening. Finally, the evolution of filament diameter with time and extensional relaxation time were characterised using a capillary breakup extensional rheometer (CaBER). The polysaccharide exhibited long extensional relaxation times (4. 6 s), high extensional viscosities (~ 104) and large Trouton ratios (~ 104). Factors i. e. temperature, urea concentration, cations (ionic strength) and pH were tested to investigate how changes in the environment would affect the rheological properties of the polysaccharide. These factors are also intrinsically related to intermolecular interactions which may be present in the polysaccharide e. g. hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attractions. Thus the molecular origin of its rheological behaviour could also be elucidated through these effects. Shear-thickening was lost at higher temperatures (? 50 ?C) but enhanced at low temperatures. The peak viscosity during shear-thickening exhibited an Arrhenius‘ Law dependency with an activation energy of flow of ~ 90 kJ/mol (5 % w/w). Hydrogen bonds are sensitive to temperature and inversely proportion to temperature in the order of kT, which indicated that hydrogen bonds are likely to be involved in shear-thickening of the polysaccharide. The addition of urea, a hydrogen-bond disruptor (chaotropic agent) suppressed shear-thickening completely in 5 % w/w mamaku solution at a concentration of 5 M. Urea molecules compete for hydrogen bonding sites with the polysaccharide and lower the lifetime of polymer-polymer associations. Removal of salts from the native mamaku solution via dialysis resulted in loss of shear-thickening as well. However, shear-thickening was reinstated upon addition of salts (NaCl, KCl, N(CH 3) 4 Cl, CaCl 2, MgCl 2, LaCl 3 ? 7 H 2 O, AlCl 3 ? 6 H 2 O) back. Mono-, di- and trivalent cations screen the electrostatic charges on the polysaccharide thus lowering the viscosity as the polysaccharide adopts a more compact configuration. In addition, trivalent cations also cause chain collapse (precipitation) and re-dissolution of the polysaccharide, a phenomenon known as re-entrant condensation in polyelectrolytes. Lastly, shear-thickening was also recovered in the dialysed extract at pH 2 - 4. Similarly, the protons (H+) screen the electrostatic charges which lowered the viscosity of the polysaccharide. Screening of electrostatic repulsion appeared to promote shear-thickening rather than ionic cross-linking, since monovalent cations and protons were able to recover shear-thickening. Chemical structure is an important identity for any polysaccharide. In addition, the chemical structure can provide insight as to how the polysaccharide may have participated in shear-thickening. The native mamaku extract was further purified prior to structural characterisation via ultracentrifugation, starch hydrolysis, de- proteinisation and ethanol (80 % w/v) precipitation. This method of purification yielded approximately 15 % of purified material, removing most of the starch, minerals and simple sugars from the native extract. The purified fraction retained its shear-thickening character and had a molecular weight of 1. 94 x 106 Da. Structural characterisation determining monosaccharide composition and glycosyl linkages were carried out using methylation, HPLC/GC, GC-MS and NMR techniques. The structure of the mamaku polysaccharide was suggested to be a glucuronomannan backbone (methylesterified 4 -GlcpA (27. 9 mol%) with 2, 3 - (9. 2 mol%) and 2, 3, 4 -linked Manp (10. 9 mol%)) with branched sugar side-chains of galactose, arabinose, xylose, non- methylesterified glucuronic acid (8. 2 mol%) and other simple sugars at the O- 3 and O- 4 of the mannose residues. Piecing the information obtained from the various characterisation techniques together helped to elucidate the molecular origin of shear-thickening, anti-thixotropy, strain-hardening and extensional-hardening. They were postulated to be of the same event, i. e. intra- to intermolecular association between polysaccharide chains during shear, strain or extension via hydrogen bonding. Stretching the polysaccharide exposed associative groups within the long chain, which interacted in a cooperative zip-like manner. The hydrogen bonds were suggested to take place via the hydroxyl (-OH) groups of mannose or carbonyl/carboxyl groups (-C=O/- COOH) of the glucuronic acids. Finally, the satiety effects of the mamaku gum were tested in vivo in rats. The functional ability of the polysaccharide to confer satiety was postulated to arise from its high viscosity as well as its shear-thickening behaviour, which alters gastric antrocorporal contractions and delays gastric emptying. Oral gavage of the rats with mamaku gum (15 % w/w) showed a significant reduction in short term food consumption (p< 0. 05), smaller weight gains (p< 0. 05), as well as prolonged gastric emptying (p< 0. 05) as compared to rats gavaged with water. Therefore the polysaccharide could potentially be used as a satiety aid in food products. Biopolymers which exhibit such complex rheological properties that can be easily controlled by manipulating environmental factors are rarely or never before encountered. Clearly, the mamaku polysaccharide would find its way into novel applications, starting with satiety enhancers...|$|E
