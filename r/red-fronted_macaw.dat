25|$|The Ara macaws have a Neotropical {{distribution}} from Mexico to Argentina. The {{centre of}} Ara distribution is the Amazon Basin and the Panama–Colombia border region; each {{with as many}} as four species found together (marginally five where the military macaw approach the western Amazon). Seven species are found in Bolivia, but no single locality in that (or any other) country surpasses four species. The most widespread species, the scarlet macaw, is (or was) distributed throughout large parts of Central America and the Amazon. On the other hand, the blue-throated macaw and the <b>red-fronted</b> <b>macaw</b> have tiny distributions in Bolivia. The overall range of many species and the genus as a whole has declined in historical times due to human activities. The military macaw is distributed from northern Mexico to northern Argentina, but the distribution is discontinuous, with populations in Mexico, a large gap, then a population in the Venezuelan Coastal Range and a population along the Andes from western Venezuela to northern Argentina. The blue-and-yellow macaw was expiated from Trinidad in the 1960s, as well as retreating from northern Argentina, and several species apparently became extinct in the islands of the Caribbean.|$|E
2500|$|The Ara macaws are {{generally}} fairly adaptable in their habitat requirements; this reaches its extreme in the scarlet macaw, which as suggested in its widespread distribution, uses most habitat types from humid rainforest to open woodlands to savannah. The only requirement is sufficient large trees, {{which is where}} they obtain their food and breeding holes. The other species are slightly more narrow in their habitat choices, but the need for large trees is universal. The blue-throated macaw generally inhabits forest [...] "islands" [...] in the savanna, and the <b>red-fronted</b> <b>macaw</b> prefers arid scrub and cactus woodland.|$|E

50|$|The <b>red-fronted</b> <b>macaws</b> (Ara rubrogenys), {{endemic to}} a small mountainous area of Bolivia, can be {{observed}} in Mizque. This species is considered to be endangered due to intense agriculture activity which has reduced its habitat. The problem is that the peasants of some zones look upon them as a plague because they raid the maize in the fields. There is a chance that they might be {{regarded as one of the}} tourist attractions of the region.|$|R
2500|$|Like {{almost all}} parrots, the Ara macaws are cavity nesters. The {{majority}} of species nest in cavities in trees, either live or dead. Natural holes in trees may be used, {{particularly those in}} dead trees, otherwise holes created by other species; in Mexico military macaws still use the cavities excavated by the now critically endangered [...] imperial woodpecker. In addition to nesting in trees the military macaw and green-winged macaw will also nest in natural fissures in cliffs. This nesting habitat {{is the only one}} used by the <b>red-fronted</b> <b>macaws,</b> as sufficiently large enough trees are absent in its arid range.|$|R

50|$|The <b>red-fronted</b> <b>macaw</b> is {{native to}} a small mountainous area of south-central Bolivia {{situated}} about 200 km west of Santa Cruz, {{in the department of}} the same name, where the climate is medium altitude semi-desert. The natural vegetation consists mostly of cactus (large and small) and thorny trees and scrub. The climate is semi arid with cold nights and hot days. Rain comes in infrequent heavy storms. It is unusual in that it is the only macaw to inhabit such a climatic zone. Most macaws nest in holes in large trees, however here there are no very large trees in its range so it nests in vertical fissures in cliff faces. The bird has been captured for the pet trade in the past and killed by local farmers because it raids their crops.|$|E
50|$|The zoo {{is home to}} part of an {{international}} breeding programme for some endangered species such as Owston's palm civet and <b>red-fronted</b> <b>macaw</b> for which an overseas in-situ conservation support programme of funding and skills exchange exists, along with support for the unau sloth project and pacarana in South America, pangolin and small carnivore conservation programme in South East Asia. The World Land Trust BIAZA zoo reserve in South America is also supported through the wild spaces scheme. Support is also given annually to students at the Libanona Ecology Centre in Southern Madagascar. The EAZA Campaign is supported annually. Recent overseas project information can be found for each project on the zoo website. Increasingly animal species held at the zoo are listed as threatened or endangered species on the Red Data lists produced by the IUCN.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © BirdLife International 2012 A. The <b>Red-fronted</b> <b>Macaw</b> Ara rubrogenys is {{endemic to}} Bolivia, {{where it is}} listed as Critically Endangered due to its reduced {{population}} size and persisting threats. This species is known to breed exclusively on steep cliffs in arid inter-Andean valleys. However, during {{a survey of the}} whole distribution, we noted a previously overlooked population breeding in stands of the also endemic and globally endangered palm Parajubaea torallyi. We observed five adult pairs and confirmed at least three active nests. Nests were in holes 14 - 20 m above the ground in dead palms, at 2, 580 - 2, 700 m asl. The scarcity of breeding habitat and current nest poaching were identified as the major threats for this population. This discovery broadens our understanding of the breeding ecology and widens the scope of action for the monitoring and conservation of the species. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The IUCN Red List is {{challenged}} with assessing the conservation status of species on which reliable demographic and distribution parameters are lacking. The hotly debated SAFE index, however, measures the “species’ ability to forestall extinction” and only requires information on population size. Nonetheless, both conservation assessment systems neglect {{the role of}} non-breeding population fractions in conservation. We conducted simple surveys to ascertain the spatial and population structure and conservation threats of the Endangered <b>red-fronted</b> <b>macaw</b> Ara rubrogenys, endemic to the Bolivian Andes. The area of occupancy (ca. 2600 Km 2) encompassed eight breeding and six non-breeding areas, occupied by 807 individuals. By combining population-fraction censuses with the proportion of juveniles (8. 6 %), we inferred a breeding population of less than 100 pairs clumped in 38 – 40 nesting sites, with non-breeders representing ca. 80 % of the population. While this increase in data quality raises questions {{as to whether the}} species should be upgraded to Critically Endangered, the SAFE index rendered questionable guidance for conservation triage. Conservation threats were spatially identified according to spatio-temporal and life-stage population structures and seasonal changes in habitat use. Several sources of habitat loss were widespread but, contrary to expectation, habitat-use models indicated that red-fronted macaws were not tied to forest remnants. Instead, they made use of agricultural lands resulting in conflicts with farmers. Awareness campaigns should focus on a few selected locations to resolve this conflict and reduce the uptake of individuals for use as pets, as {{the most effective way to}} increase population size in the medium-termPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{slopes of}} the Andes are {{recognized}} as supporting the highest avian diversity in the world combined with high endemism rate but also more than 20 % of threatened species. Frugivores birds, even rare species, are known as major providers of seed dispersal service. In Bolivia, the large <b>Red-fronted</b> <b>Macaw</b> (Ara rubrogenys Lafresnaye, 1847) {{is one of the}} 15 endemic species of this country. Its natural habitat is mainly semi-deciduous dry forest but this habitat is most often severely degraded. Climate change is an additional threat over tropical mountain birds and this particular species, since some scenarios suggest warming as high as 7. 5 °C by 2080 and significant variations in the precipitation regime and available soil water. To infer the future of bird species under warming climate, many authors use niche-based models (NBM), in which they combine effects of climate variables, alone or in combination with other environmental variables. A more elaborated approach consists in also including biotic interactions, notably the availability of particular plant species. While NBM with climate variables are now considered as a standard method to predict plant species distribution under future climate, this approach fails to consider the effect of increasing CO 2 concentration in air on plant physiology. Contrariwise, dynamic vegetation models (DVM) are commonly able to reproduce this effect, although the uncertainties on the CO 2 are large. This study assesses the potential impact of climate change on the range of A. rubrogenys, by combining within a NBM climate variables, relief and biotic variables, i. e. plant species resource. Plant resource is computed with a DVM and a NBM to compare the methodologies and to evaluate potential effects of CO 2 on plant species distribution and indirect impacts on the bird...|$|E
