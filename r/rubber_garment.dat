Waterproof dress had {{an important role in the}} late nineteenth century. Heretofore little research has been done to examine the development and design of this apparel sector. The three types of waterproofing techniques used and developed in the nineteenth century included oil or paraffin, chemical, and rubber solutions. The rise leisure and consumption contributed to the growth of waterproof dress allowing people of all classes to benefit from the protective apparel. This research explored the technology and design of waterproof dress by collecting related patents between 1880 and 1895. These patents were compared with catalogs and periodicals from the same time period to better understand what innovations made their way to consumers. The patents helped to identify the problems with waterproof apparel that manufacturers sought to resolve. In addition, the patents assisted with clarifying the target consumers for specific apparel types. The research also revealed the longevity of the gossamer or lightweight <b>rubber</b> <b>garment</b> that experienced at least two decades of success. Overall, this research emphasized that waterproof dress was very important in the lives of many consumers toward the end of the nineteenth century...|$|E
25|$|Ball Band made <b>rubber</b> <b>garments</b> and {{was hit by}} a major {{strike in}} 1931. It flourished in the 1940s, finally closing in 1997 in the face of cheaper imports. Manufacturing in Mishawaka peaked in the 1940s and began a slow decline due to {{industrial}} restructuring. The economic base shifted to retail services and small industry.|$|R

50|$|It {{seems that}} {{in both the}} Converse <b>Rubber</b> and Emerald <b>Garments</b> ruling, the decisive factor {{is not so much}} {{confusing}} similarity, but prior use. Both cases involved merchandise from foreign corporations. Both shoes and jeans were not inexpensive items purchased by persons who are more scrupulous and, thus, less likely to be deceived. In the former case, the test used was the one of dominancy, and it was found that trademark infringement exists. In the latter, the test used was holistic, and resulted in the absence of infringement. However, in Converse, prior commercial use of the trademark was established whereas in Emerald, it was not.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper the}} {{presents}} pattern and determinants of intra-industry trade (IIT) in Australian manufacturing {{since the late}} 1970 s. The results point to a sharp rise in IIT from the mid 1980 s {{which appears to be}} linked with an outward-oriented policy. Industry level analysis indicates that industries which experienced a sharp fall in protection are the industries with the higher levels of IIT. These include textile, <b>garments,</b> <b>rubber</b> products, and machinery and equipment. An increasing trend in IIT suggests that the short-term adjustment costs associated with trade liberalisation are likely to be lower, and that liberalisation can proceed without huge short-term adjustment costs. Using a logit model the determinants of IIT are investigated. Results indicate that intra-industry trade is positively related to product differentiation and scale economies, and negatively related to the levels of protection and foreign ownership in the pre-liberalisation period. In the post-liberalisation period, however, it is scale economies that explain the inter-industry variations in IIT. R&D intensity and close economic integration appear to have no impact on IIT regardless {{of the nature of the}} policy regime...|$|R
40|$|Growth of Albizia lebbeck was {{observed}} in the polluted soils from towel, <b>garment,</b> <b>rubber</b> and ply board factories {{in the vicinity of}} Landhi and Korangi industrial areas of Karachi. Growth of A. lebbeck was reduced in most of the industrial area soils as compared to the control soil from Karachi University campus. The rubber factory soil reduced all the growth parameters as compared to the control soil. Percentage of soil pollutants (total soluble salts and available sulfate) in all of the industrial area soils was higher than in the control area soil. Percentage of coarse sand, calcium carbonate, total soluble salts, available sulfate, and chromium was higher in soil of rubber factory then in the control area soil whereas percentage of water holding capacity, organic matter and zinc was lower in soil from rubber factory than in the control area soil. This showed that the soil of industrial areas of Landhi and Korangi particularly from rubber factory and ply board factory was contaminated by the pollutants in the area and drastically affected the plant growth. The findings of this research could be helpful in monitoring and controlling the pollutant levels in soils of the industrial areas. Such information could also be useful for landscaping and urban planning...|$|R
