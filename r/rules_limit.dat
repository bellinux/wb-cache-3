Committees {{play an important role in}} the legislative process by providing members the opportunity to study, debate and amend the bill and the public with the opportunity to make comments on the bill. There are three types of House Committees, these are: 1) standing committees elected by members of the House, 2) select committees appointed by the Speaker of the House, and 3) joint committees whose members are chosen according to the statute or resolution that created that committee.

500|$|The {{object of}} the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a {{lacrosse}} stick or crosse, to catch, carry, and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling the ball into an opponent's goal. The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball. In addition to the lacrosse stick, players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact. [...] The <b>rules</b> <b>limit</b> the number of players in each part of the field and require the ball to be moved continuously towards the opposing goal. It is sometimes referred to as the [...] "fastest sport on two feet".|$|E

500|$|What {{followed}} {{was a period}} of uncertainty regarding exactly who would and would not {{be a part of the}} merged team. Leopard Trek had 27 riders under contract for 2012 and Team RadioShack had 13 [...] UCI rules impose a hard limit of 30 riders on top-level teams, meaning at least ten riders with valid contracts would be released from them. Leopard Trek riders were not told about the merger ahead of time and were unsure of their status at a time when riders everywhere looked to conclusively determine their places of employment for the upcoming season. The situation was further complicated by two rider transfers made in August, when Ben Hermans and Grégory Rast signed with Leopard Trek away from Team RadioShack, meaning they had effectively re-joined the team they had only just left. The new team also signed four riders who had not been a member of either side in 2011. This resulted in 12 riders departing for other teams, with 13 incoming from Team RadioShack's 2011 formation (that number including Hermans and Rast) and 12 riders being retained from Leopard Trek's 2011 formation. The fused team announced its new name as RadioShack-Nissan-Trek, though UCI <b>rules</b> <b>limit</b> registry to two title sponsors, meaning their name in the official UCI record is RadioShack-Nissan.|$|E
