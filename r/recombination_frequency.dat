25|$|<b>Recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used in the {{creation}} of a genetic linkage map. <b>Recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency.</b> This is a good estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a double crossover is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a double crossover increases. As the likelihood of a double crossover increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|E

40|$|Sixteen ts mutants were {{isolated}} from influenza virus type A 0, strain WSN, after treatment with either fluorouracil or hydroxylamine.

40|$|Telosomic {{stocks have}} been {{extensively}} used to map genes to chromosome arms {{and to determine}} gene-to-centromere genetic distances. It {{has been suggested that}} if a chromosome arm is present as a telosome, <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> will be drastically reduced in the centromeric region. However, previous studies have not considered the bias in recombination estimates due to selection against aneuploid gametes produced by failure of pairing at the first meiotic division.

25|$|A {{linkage map}} (also {{known as a}} genetic map) is a table for a species or {{experimental}} population that shows the position of its known genes or genetic markers relative {{to each other in}} terms of <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency,</b> rather than a specific physical distance along each chromosome. Linkage maps were first developed by Alfred Sturtevant, a student of Thomas Hunt Morgan.|$|E
25|$|Their {{experiment}} revealed {{linkage between}} the P and L alleles and the p and l alleles. The frequency of P occurring together with L and p occurring together with l {{is greater than}} that of the recombinant Pl and pL. The <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> is more difficult to compute in an F2 cross than a backcross, but the lack of fit between observed and expected numbers of progeny in the above table indicate it is less than 50%.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> tends to underestimate the distance between two linked genes. This is because as the two genes are located farther apart, the chance of double or even number of crossovers between them also increases. Double or even number of crossovers between the two genes results in them being cosegregated to the same gamete, yielding a parental progeny instead of the expected recombinant progeny. As mentioned above, the Kosambi and Haldane transformations attempt to correct for multiple crossovers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background HIV- 1 {{recombination}} {{between different}} subtypes {{has a major}} impact on the global epidemic. The generation of these intersubtype recombinants follows a defined set of events starting with dual infection of a host cell, heterodiploid virus production, strand transfers during reverse transcription, and then selection. In this study, <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> were measured in the C 1 -C 4 regions of the envelope gene in the presence (using a multiple cycle infection system) and absence (in vitro reverse transcription and single cycle infection systems) of selection for replication-competent virus. Ugandan subtypes A and D HIV- 1 env sequences (115 -A, 120 -A, 89 -D, 122 -D, 126 -D) were employed in all three assay systems. These subtypes co-circulate in East Africa and frequently recombine in this human population. Results Increased sequence identity between viruses or RNA templates resulted in increased <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies,</b> {{with the exception of the}} 115 -A virus or RNA template. Analyses of the recombination breakpoints and mechanistic studies revealed that the presence of a recombination hotspot in the C 3 /V 4 env region, unique to 115 -A as donor RNA, could account for the higher <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> with the 115 -A virus/template. Single-cycle infections supported proportionally less recombination than the in vitro reverse transcription assay but both systems still had significantly higher <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> than observed in the multiple-cycle virus replication system. In the multiple cycle assay, increased replicative fitness of one HIV- 1 over the other in a dual infection dramatically decreased <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Conclusion Sequence variation at specific sites between HIV- 1 isolates can introduce unique recombination hotspots, which increase <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> and skew the general observation that decreased HIV- 1 sequence identity reduces recombination rates. These findings also suggest that the majority of intra- or intersubtype A/D HIV- 1 recombinants, generated with each round of infection, are not replication-competent and do not survive in the multiple-cycle system. Ability of one HIV- 1 isolate to outgrow the other leads to reduced co-infections, heterozygous virus production, and <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|We empirically {{estimated}} {{the power of}} three methods for ordering loci within a known linkage group. Estimates of pairwise recombination fractions and correlation coefficients were obtained from data on 50 replicates of 50 and 100 pedigrees by using a likelihood method (LIPED; Ott 1974) and the sib-pair test. Locus order then was determined using seriation, multidimensional scaling, and the product of <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Overall, the multidimensional scaling method was less powerful than either seriation or the product of <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The latter two methods were approximately equally powerful. As expected, {{the power of the}} sib-pair test was less than half that of the likelihood method...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{classical}} linkage {{groups were}} identified in two salmonid species (Salmo trutta and Salmo gairdneri) and three fertile, interspecific hybrids (S. gairdneri x Salmo clarki, Salvelinus fontinalis x Salvelinus namaycush and S. fontinalis x Salvelinus alpinus) by backcrossing multiply heterozygous individuals. These linkage relationships of electrophoretically detected, protein coding loci were highly conserved among species. The loci encoding the enzymes appeared to be randomly distributed among the salmonid chromosomes. <b>Recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> were generally greater in females than in males. In males, certain linkage groups were pseudolinked with other linkage groups, presumably because of facultative multivalent pairing and directed disjunction of chromosomes. Five such pseudolinkage groups were identified and they also appeared to be common among species and hybrids. Duplicate loci were never classically linked with each other, although some exhibited pseudolinkage and some showed evidence of exchanging alleles. Gene-centromere <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> estimated from genotypic distributions of gynogenetic offspring were consistent with map locations inferred from female intergenic <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> These linkage relationships support the contention that all extant salmonids arose from a common tetraploid progenitor and that this progenitor {{may have been a}} segmental allotetraploid...|$|R

[...] Crossing these homozygous parental strains will result in F1 generation offspring that are double heterozygotes with genotype AaBb.

40|$|The major repeat {{sequence}} (MRS) {{is known}} {{to play a role}} in karyotypic variation in Candida albicans. The MRS affects karyotypic variation by expanding and contracting internal repeats, by altering the frequency of chromosome loss, and by serving as a hotspot for chromosome translocation.

40|$|A {{system to}} assay intrachromosomal {{homologous}} recombination during the complete life-cycle {{of a whole}} higher eukaryote was set up. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were transformed with a recombination substrate carrying a non-selectable and quantitatively detectable marker gene.

Upon recombination, as proven by Southern blot analysis, a functional gene is restored and its product can be detected by histochemical staining. Therefore, cells in which recombination events occurred, and their progeny, can be precisely localized in the whole plant. Recombination was observed in all plant organs examined, from the seed stage until the flowering stage of somatic plant development. Meristematic recombination events revealed cell lineage patterns.

In this paper we have mainly concentrated on the case of negative interference. We use models to quantify this effect when data are derived from a backcross experiment or from the selfing of F(1) individuals. The effect is quantitatively similar in the two cases. There is an upper limit to the size the bias may reach for every given level of recombination.

To demonstrate the proof of concept, we used 24 gene-based physically mapped single nucleotide polymorphisms to genotype the WGA products of 50 single pollen nuclei. The number of crossovers per chromosome, <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> along chromosome 3 H and segregation distortion were analysed and compared to a doubled haploid (DH) population of the same genotype.

Heteroallelic diploid strains were derived by crossing cyc 1 mutants containing a series of alterations {{at or near the}} same site to cyc 1 mutants containing alterations at variouis distances. Marked disproportionalities between physical distances and <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> were observed with certain cyc 1 mutations, indicating that certain mismatched bases can significantly affect recombination. The marker effects were more pronounced when the two mutational sites of the heteroalleles were within about 20 base pairs, but separated by at least 4 base pairs. Two alleles, cyc 1 - 163 and cyc 1 - 166, which arose by G·C->C·G transversions at nucleotide positions 3 and 194, respectively, gave rise to especially high rates of recombination.
