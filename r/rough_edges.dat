25|$|The {{roughness}} {{of coral}} surfaces {{is the key}} to coral survival in agitated waters. Normally, a boundary layer of still water surrounds a submerged object, which acts as a barrier. Waves breaking on the extremely <b>rough</b> <b>edges</b> of corals disrupt the boundary layer, allowing the corals access to passing nutrients. Turbulent water thereby promotes reef growth and branching. Without the nutritional gains brought by rough coral surfaces, even the most effective recycling would leave corals wanting in nutrients.|$|E

Chinese coins were usually made from mixtures of metals such copper, tin and lead, from bronze, brass or iron: precious metals like gold and silver were uncommonly used. The ratios and purity of the coin metals varied considerably. Most Chinese coins were produced with a square hole in the middle. This was used to allow collections of coins to be threaded on a square rod so that the <b>rough</b> <b>edges</b> could be filed smooth, and then threaded on strings for ease of handling.|$|E

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the {{forthcoming}} season, Arsenal played a series of friendlies across Western Europe. Their first match ended in defeat against Peterborough United of the Second Division; goalkeeper Stuart Taylor was forced {{to come off the}} field after colliding with Peterborough substitute Lee Clarke in the second half. Arsenal then played out a draw against Barnet, where trialist Yaya Touré – the brother of Kolo, was included in the team. In a 2011 interview, Wenger recalled Yaya's performance as being [...] "completely average on the day" [...] and noted his impatience stopped him from joining Arsenal; Touré went on to play for Barcelona before joining Manchester City in 2010. Arsenal undertook a tour in Austria, a year after crowd troubles forced their match in Eisenstadt to be abandoned. Wenger was absent with a stomach upset so assistant manager Pat Rice took charge of Arsenal against SC Ritzing on 22 July 2003; the team came from two goals down to draw their second consecutive friendly.

500|$|Two {{years after}} Sam Houston's death, Baylor University {{president}} William Carey Crane {{was commissioned by}} Margaret to write her husband's biography, allowing complete access to all correspondence and records. Crane was a Lea family friend from Alabama who had {{little more than a}} passing acquaintance with [...] "the hero of San Jacinto". His perception of Margaret, however, was that of an extraordinary woman, in many aspects equal to the man she married. He stated that Houston's [...] "guardian angel", as he called her, had set out from the time she met Houston to refine his <b>rough</b> <b>edges</b> and provide a solid foundation for his personal life. That assessment of Margaret's relationship with her husband was echoed over a century later by author James L. Haley, [...] "...Houston trusted the care of his soul to Margaret, that he had no more war to fight within himself, left him with more energy to wage political battle." [...] Ultimately, several of Houston's associates were cooperative with the Crane endeavor, but not everyone was inspired to join the effort. According to daughter Maggie, the author had told her that many valuable documents were destroyed by Margaret in a fit of anger when someone she considered a friend expressed disinterest. Life and Select Literary Remains of Sam Houston of Texas was rejected by the initial publisher, but was eventually published by J. B. Lippincott in 1884.|$|E

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, residents of Queensbridge experienced intense violence, as the housing development was overrun by the crack epidemic. Illmatic contains imagery inspired by this prevalence of street crime. In [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", Nas details the trap doors, rooftop snipers, street corner lookouts, and drug dealers that pervade his urban [...] Sohail Daulatzai describes this language as [...] "chilling" [...] and suggests that it “harrowingly describes and imagines with such surreal imagery, with so much noir discontent and even more fuck-you ambition, the fragile and tenuous lives of ghetto dwellers…” Author Adam Mansbach interprets Nas's violent aesthetics as a metaphoric device meant to authenticate the <b>rough</b> <b>edges</b> of his persona: [...] "Nas's world and worldview are criminal and criminalized. Hence, he uses metaphoric violence as a central trope of his poetic.” Writer and musician Gregory Tate regards this violent imagery as part of a trend towards dark subject matter that came to prevail among East Coast rappers in the hardcore hip hop scene. He writes, “ome of the most memorably dark, depressive but flowing lyrics in hip hop history were written by Nas, Biggie, and members of the Wu-Tang Clan on the death knell of the crack trade.|$|E
500|$|Despite criticisms, most reviews were {{ultimately}} favourable to Empire: Total War. While IGN {{felt that the}} game [...] "drags a bit {{and there are some}} small, <b>rough</b> <b>edges</b> in the tactical battles", the game still [...] "deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the greatest names in gaming history". 1UP.com finished by saying [...] "For all its problems, it's undoubtedly progress", while Eurogamer felt that issues [...] "limit [...] to being merely one of the games of the year," [...] but implied that a post-release patch could deal with these flaws. GameSpot summarised that the game was [...] "complex and rewarding" [...] and GameSpy praised the game for [...] "the simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens [...] make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started". Crispy Gamer, while acclaiming the game [...] "spectacular" [...] and [...] "lovingly historical", criticised the documentation and concluded that the game falls apart due to its bad AI. The Game Informer reviewers criticised the AI, but still described the overall game experience as [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "outstanding". GamePro provided a dissenting opinion; although describing Empire: Total War as a game with a potential that [...] "with some extra tweaking, could have proven itself an excellent title", noted that it [...] "has a heap of problems that need resolving" [...] with bugs and crashes. PC Gamer UK enthusiastically proclaimed the game as [...] "one of the most playable, important and accomplished games ever created".|$|E

Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, despite feeling that the game was flawed by inherent problems in the Fire Emblem formula, enjoyed the game and was willing to replay once he had finished. Greg Kasavin, writing for GameSpot, saying that [...] "by replacing the traditional random battles that typify most Japanese role-playing games with a fun and exciting turn-based combat system, and by going out of its way to deliver a memorable and genuinely emotional story, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance accomplishes what all role-playing games attempt, but very few actually manage to do". The majority of praise went to the game's story and gameplay, while criticism was focused on the graphical quality.|$|E
