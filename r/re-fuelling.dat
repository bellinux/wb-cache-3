5|$|ANA {{was not in}} the {{practice}} of performing a fuel-drain check immediately after each <b>re-fuelling,</b> as required by Air Navigation Orders.|$|E
5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after <b>re-fuelling.</b> For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E

Also in the group were the destroyer Vidette, frigate Tay, and corvettes Sunflower, Snowflake, Loosestrife, and Pink. The group also contained 2 trawlers, Northern Gem and Northern Spray as rescue ships, and the fleet oiler British Lady for mid-ocean <b>re-fuelling.</b> The convoy was joined by other escort vessels as the battle progressed.|$|E
25|$|A relay of German {{reconnaissance}} aircraft observed British waters during the morning, Luftwaffe aircraft flying {{as far north}} as Scotland. Over Yarmouth, a Hurricane was damaged by return fire from a Do17 and then the Dornier was shot down by Douglas Bader of 242 Squadron based at Coltishall. Squadron Leader Peter Townsend, 85 Squadron, baled out near Harwich after being hit by a Do17 belonging to II./KG 2, which returned with three wounded crew. Encouraged by the relative immunity of the Stukas in the morning attack, Hugo Sperrle ordered Luftflotte 3 to follow up the attack; Bf110s from ZG 76 would provide escort in place of the Bf109s. At 11:00 GMT, Hurricanes from 601 Squadron were scrambled to intercept a reconnaissance Do 17, missed it and stumbled into a formation of Ju87s from III./StG 2 escorted by about 40 Bf110s, that radar had failed to locate. The escorts were too high above the Ju87s to stop the first attack. Most squadrons in the Middle Wallop sector were <b>re-fuelling</b> but six 238 Squadron Hurricanes were scrambled, with three more from 501 and 87 Squadrons and nine from 213 Squadron near Exeter. None arrived in time to stop the attack on Portland at 11:53 GMT but little damage was done and only one vessel was damaged.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{its final}} flight, the Amana {{received}} [...] of fuel from a tanker {{operated by the}} Vacuum Oil Company. The tanker had been checked {{for the presence of}} water in the morning and again at 6:30pm, about 2 hours prior to <b>re-fuelling</b> the Amana. It had also supplied fuel to 3 de Havilland Dove aircraft, none of which suffered any engine problems or were found to have water in the fuel.|$|E
500|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) {{ground staff}} in Sydney checked the Amana's fuel tanks for the {{presence}} of water prior to its first departure on 26 June. They found none. The Amana was subsequently <b>re-fuelled</b> in Melbourne and Adelaide but no check of the fuel tanks was made on these occasions. After being <b>re-fuelled</b> in Perth immediately prior to the fatal flight, the fuel filters in all 4 engines and the fuel drain serving the cross-feed pipe in the wing centre-section were all checked {{for the presence}} of water. The fuel tanks themselves were not checked, partly because, on the night of 26 June, the ground staff were [...] "pressed for time" [...] because one despatch engineer was absent due to illness.|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} <b>re-fuelled</b> for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|R
50|$|On 5 September 1967, ČSA Flight 523 {{crashed on}} {{climb-out}} from Gander International Airport, after being <b>re-fuelled</b> {{for the final}} leg of the flight. The aircraft took off from runway 14 climbing at an abnormally shallow angle. The aircraft struck a supporting wire of a mast, climbed to 40 m, then started to dive, hitting the ground at a speed of approximately 360 km/h, hit a railway embankment 4000 ft past {{the end of the}} runway, caught fire and broke into pieces. Four crewmen and 33 passengers were killed.|$|R
500|$|At the 1982 British Grand Prix, Brabham reintroduced {{the idea}} of <b>re-fuelling</b> and {{changing}} the car's tyres during the race, unseen since the 1957 Formula One season, to allow their drivers to sprint away {{at the start of}} races on a light fuel load and soft tyres. After studying techniques used at the Indianapolis 500 and in NASCAR racing in the United States, the team were able to refuel and re-tyre the car in 14 seconds in tests ahead of the race. In 1982 Murray felt the tactic did little more than [...] "get our sponsors noticed at races we had no chance of winning", but in 1983 the team made good use of the tactic. Refuelling was banned for 1984, and did not reappear until the 1994 season (until it was banned again in 2010 as a part of cost cutting measures), but tyre changes have remained part of Formula One.|$|E
2500|$|First TransPennine Express built a small depot, {{to provide}} stabling, light {{maintenance}} and <b>re-fuelling</b> at Cleethorpes for their DMU fleet.

2500|$|Long haul transatlantic {{operations}} made {{a return}} to Stansted in June 2010, when Sun Country Airlines announced a seasonal weekly service from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights made a <b>re-fuelling</b> stop-over in Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador as the aircraft used for the flight, a Boeing 737-800, {{would not be able}} to complete a non-stop westbound flight from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights operated from 11 June to 15 August 2010. In 2011, Sun Country operated to Gatwick rather than Stansted and were then discontinued due to the price involved in carrying fuel on long haul flights.|$|E
5000|$|The airport's sole {{service to}} the air force {{over the next two years}} was {{essentially}} like a roadside truckstop, providing fuel, rest and meals to aircrew flying across the country. By 1942 so many aircraft were stopping at North Bay that No. 124 Squadron, RCAF, set up a seven-man detachment at the airport. Under the command of a Flying Officer (today's rank, Lieutenant), two aeroengine mechanics, an electrician and an airframe mechanic <b>re-fuelled,</b> serviced and repaired the aircraft. A driver and vehicle mechanic saw to the detachment's staff car, aircraft towing tractor and 1000 imp gal fuel truck. The staff car was eventually replaced by a more practical [...] "Truck, Panel, Delivery".|$|R
50|$|The 20-room hotel {{occupies}} the {{two thirds of}} {{the second floor of the}} station. On the ground floor, the western end of the building's ground floor is occupied by a lunch counter/canteen with a large M shaped circular counter with swivel stools. This was where breakfast's, soup, sandwich, etc. would be served for hotel guests waiting for connecting trains and train passengers who were waiting for the Steam engines to be <b>re-fuelled</b> and passengers to clear Customs. It was not unusual to feed 2000 people a day at this lunch counter. The central portion of the ground floor has a more formal dining room and the kitchen area which served both eating establishments. The eastern end of the building's ground floor hosts the passenger waiting rooms and ticketing office and baggage storage rooms. The station also had a jail cell that was operated by the Pacific Railway Police Service and not to be used by local McAdam police.|$|R
25|$|Convoy OA 178 (convoy {{outbound}} atlantic) of 14 heavily laden merchantmen {{left the}} Thames Estuary, {{bound for the}} west coast and passed Dover safely on 3 July. German radar picked up the convoy and the Luftwaffe was ordered to intercept the ships after the Portland operation. As smoke was rising over Portland, a Junkers Ju88 reconnaissance aircraft from 1.(F)/123 flew over the Channel and reported that the convoy was south-west of Portland. I./StG 2 took off, led by Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Oskar Dinort, from Falaise with 24 Ju87s, escorted by a Staffel of fighters from I./JG 1. The attack was followed by 23 Ju87s of III./StG 51 after they had been hastily <b>re-fuelled</b> and bombed up. The ships were close to the French coast and Dallas City was damaged, engulfed in flames and collided with Flimson which was also hit and the ships took 15 minutes to disengage; Dallas City later sank. Antonio limped into Portland Harbour with Flimson, where the Foylebank was still on fire and sinking. Deucalion (1,796 GRT), Kolga (3,526 GRT) and Britsum (5,225 GRT) were sunk and SS Canadian Constructor, was damaged for no Luftwaffe loss.|$|R
2500|$|ONS 5 {{found itself}} making less than 3 knots headway into a Force 10 gale. The convoy {{started to be}} scattered, some ships ending up 30 miles from the convoy, and the escorts were kept busy {{rounding}} up stragglers. Oribi was able to refuel from the convoy oiler when the storm abated briefly on the 30th before the weather again made <b>re-fuelling</b> impossible, {{and a number of}} the destroyers became so low on fuel as to throw doubt on whether they could continue. At 2305 Snowflake made a radar contact at [...] and dropped a single depth charge after the U-boat dived when illuminated by star shell. The escorts dropped some random depth charges until dawn, and Admiral Dönitz cancelled the chase on the evening of 1 May.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{pressurised}} water reactor, the Rolls-Royce PWR 2, {{was designed}} for the Vanguard class. The PWR 2 has double the service life of previous models, and {{it is estimated that}} a Vanguard-class submarine could circumnavigate the world 40 times without refuelling. Furthermore, during their long-overhaul refit periods, a 'Core H' reactor is fitted to each of the boats, ensuring that none of the submarines will require further <b>re-fuelling</b> {{for the rest of their}} service lives. The reactor drives two GEC steam turbines linked to a single shaft pump jet propulsor, giving the submarines a maximum submerged speed of over [...] Auxiliary power is provided by a pair of 6MW steam-turbine generators supplied by WH Allen, (later known as NEI Allen, Allen Power & Rolls-Royce), and two, 2MW Paxman diesel alternators for provision of backup power supply.|$|E
2500|$|The success against Pinguin {{and other}} raiders {{was due to}} the navy Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC) of the Naval Intelligence Division, at the Admiralty. The OIC tracked raiders, based on the {{position}} of the sinking of Allied merchant ships and by collating rare sightings and distress signals. German commerce-raiders kept radio silence, avoided common shipping routes, searching for independently routed vessels and tried to prevent their victims from transmitting wireless messages. From May to November 1941, the Germans lost Pinguin and two more commerce-raiders but Enigma decrypts by the Government Code and Cypher School (GC) was only involved in one sinking. German commerce-raiders used the [...] (Home Waters) Enigma settings, known as Dolphin to the British, before departing and when returning to Germany. The seven raiders at sea in May 1941 had sailed in 1940, before Enigma intelligence became available to the British. When at sea, Enigma-equipped raiders used the [...] settings if they broke radio silence, which Hut 4 at Bletchley Park never managed to penetrate. Atlantis, the third raider lost in 1941, was sunk by [...] on 22 November after the British read U-boat signals in the [...] setting, introduced in October 1941, to arrange a <b>re-fuelling</b> rendezvous.|$|E
25|$|The only {{successful}} hijacking of a SAA flight {{took place}} on 24 May 1972, when a Boeing 727-044 (ZS-SBE) was hijacked en route from Salisbury, Rhodesia (now known as Harare, Zimbabwe) to Johannesburg. Two Lebanese, Kamil and Yagi, {{took control of the}} aircraft by packing dynamite sticks on the hatracks. They were armed with a pistol. They forced the pilot, Captain Blake Flemington, to return to Salisbury, where they landed and <b>re-fuelled</b> with 12 hostages remaining on board. The captain tricked them into thinking that they were en route to the Seychelles, while he was in fact heading for Blantyre, Malawi. After landing, the passengers used nightfall to enter the cockpit, where they climbed down the emergency escape rope. By the time the hijackers realised this, the captain, one passenger, and a flight steward, Dirk Nel, remained on the aircraft. The two hijackers started fighting with each other for possession of the dynamite fuse. In the ensuing chaos, the three captives escaped, leaving the two hijackers on board. Malawi security forces started shooting and the two surrendered. They were jailed for two years on a charge of being in possession of an undeclared firearm on board an aircraft. After serving one year of their sentence, they were released.|$|R

40|$|Regulation may {{impact on}} {{financial}} risk taking by financial intermediaries {{by way of}} the decision-making process envisaged in the various possible legal structures set forth by the law. In Europe there are three different possible board structures: the one-tier board system, typical of the UK, Spain and many other countries, the vertical two-tier system, typical of Germany and of the Netherlands in the case of large companies and countries in which companies may choose between different models, such as France and Italy. The vertical two-tier system, was introduced in Italy with the company law reform in 2003. In the last eighteen months it was chosen in three of the most recent bank mergers in Italy (Intesa-Sanpaolo IMI, Banca Popolare di Verona e Novara-Banca Popolare Italiana, Banche Popolari Unite-Banca Lombarda) and also by Italy’s largest investment bank Mediobanca. It was also suggested for Assicurazioni Generali by international institutional investors. This <b>re-fuelled</b> the debate concerning corporate governance in Italy. The adoption of the vertical dual system was appreciated by observers who pointed out the potential of the two-tier system in relation to the innovative role of the Supervisory Board and, especially, to its function as filter between ownership and management and in the definition of the risk appetite of financial intermediaries. Others alleged that there are no substantially innovative elements in its application compared to the traditional Italian horizontal two-tier system an...|$|R
