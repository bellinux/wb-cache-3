40|$|ABSTRACT-Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are an {{emerging}} and very interesting technology applied to different applications. They are formed by small, self organized devices that cooperate {{to form a}} large scale network with thousands of nodes covering a large area. The independent operation of the devices and the self-organization feature of the network present some challenges related to security, particularly regarding {{the security of the}} processed and <b>routed</b> <b>data</b> over the network. WSN are generally used to monitor activities and report events, such as fire,overheating etc. in a specific area or environment. It <b>routs</b> <b>data</b> back to the Base Station (BS). Data transmission is usually a multi-hop from node to node towards the BS. Sensor nodes are limited in power, computational and communication bandwidth. Primary goal of researchers is to find the energy efficient routing protocol. This study highlights the different routing protocol with advantages and limitations...|$|R

40|$|The main {{challenge}} in {{wireless sensor network}} {{is to improve the}} fault tolerance of each node and also provide an energy efficient fast <b>data</b> <b>routing</b> service. In this paper we propose an energy efficient node fault diagnosis and recovery for wireless sensor networks referred as fault tolerant multipath routing scheme for energy efficient wireless sensor network (FTMRS). The FTMRS is based on multipath <b>data</b> <b>routing</b> scheme. One shortest path is use for main <b>data</b> <b>routing</b> in FTMRS technique and other two backup paths are used as alternative path for faulty network and to handle the overloaded traffic on main channel.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a {{growing interest in}} deploying large populations of microsensors that collaborate in a distributed manner to gather and process sensory data and deliver them to a sink node through wireless communications systems. Currently, {{there is a lot of}} interest in <b>data</b> <b>routing</b> for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) due to their unique challenges compared to conventional routing in wired networks. In WSNs, each <b>data</b> <b>routing</b> approach follows a specific goal (goals) according to the application. Although the general goal of every <b>data</b> <b>routing</b> approach in WSNs is to extend the network lifetime and every approach should be aware of the energy level of the nodes, <b>data</b> <b>routing</b> approaches may focus on one (or some) specific goal(s) depending on the application. Thus, existing approaches can be categorized according to their routing goals. In this paper, the main goals of <b>data</b> <b>routing</b> approaches in sensor networks are described. Then, the best known and most recent <b>data</b> <b>routing</b> approaches in WSNs are classified and studied according to their specific goals...|$|R
50|$|In Carpenter, the {{government}} is expected to rely upon the Stored Communications Act and Smith v. Maryland to support its position that obtaining the service provider’s location information should not require a warrant because the information only reveals a cell phone’s <b>routing</b> <b>data</b> rather than the contents of communications on the cell phone. The attorneys for Carpenter are expected {{to rely on the}} Fourth Amendment and Riley v. California to argue that cell phones have become intertwined into the lives of American citizens and the vast data contained within a person’s phone potentially holds the sum of the individual’s private life, so the <b>routing</b> <b>data</b> contains much more than the “information necessary to get communications from point A to point B”.|$|E

40|$|We present path {{verification}} routing (PVR) {{to enable}} robust, instantaneous on-demand loop-free <b>routing</b> of <b>data</b> packets {{based on their}} destination address in mobile ad hoc networks. PVR attains instantaneous loop-freedom by using a path verification technique without the necessity for sequence numbers, source-routed data packets, or nodal synchronization. The motivation for PVR is twofold. On the one hand, DSR provides loop-free routing but requires source <b>routed</b> <b>data</b> packets. On the other hand, AODV, {{which is based on}} destinationbased sequence numbers, is vulnerable to the counting-to-infinity problem and has route requests that in many cases must be answered by the destinations. Simulation experiments are used to show that the performance of PVR is comparable to or better than that of AODV, AODVbis, DSR and OLSR...|$|R

50|$|WS-Addressing is a {{standardized}} way of including message <b>routing</b> <b>data</b> within SOAP headers.

50|$|Since {{there is}} no fixed {{topology}} in these networks, {{one of the greatest}} challenges is <b>routing</b> <b>data</b> from its source to the destination. Generally these routing protocols draw inspiration from two fields; WSNs and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). WSN routing protocols provide the required functionality but cannot handle the high frequency of topology changes. Whereas, MANET routing protocols can deal with mobility in the network but they are designed for two way communication, which in sensor networks is often not required.|$|E
