Tatars created self-defence groups, encouraged collaboration with Russians, Ukrainians, and people of other nationalities, and called {{for the protection of}} churches, mosques, synagogues, and other important sites. By nightfall the Crimean Tatars had left; several hundred <b>Russian</b> <b>Unity</b> supporters rallied on.
