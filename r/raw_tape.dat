Isay and Abramson then collaborated with photographer Harvey Wang {{to write a book}} about life in various Bowery flophouses, including the Sunshine Hotel.|$|E
5000|$|Later in the edited video, Schiller {{seems to}} say he {{believes}} NPR [...] "would be better off {{in the long run}} without federal funding", explaining that removal of federal funding would allow NPR more independence and remove the widely held misconception that NPR is significantly funded by the public. But on the <b>raw</b> <b>tape,</b> Schiller also said that withdrawing federal funding would cause local stations to go under and that NPR is doing [...] "everything we can" [...] to keep it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{promoters}} of Electronovision {{gave the impression}} {{that this was a}} new system created from scratch, using a high-tech name (and avoiding the word kinescope) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography. Nonetheless the advances in tape-to-reel time were, at the time, a major step ahead. By capturing more than 800 lines of resolution at 25 frame/s, <b>raw</b> <b>tape</b> could be converted to film via kinescope recording with sufficient enhanced resolution to allow big-screen enlargement. The 1960s productions used RCA TK-60 image orthicon video cameras, which have a characteristic white [...] "glow" [...] around black objects (and a corresponding black glow around white objects), which was an inherent flaw of image orthicon video camera tubes called [...] "blooming." [...] Later vidicon and plumbicon tubes produced much cleaner, more accurate pictures, as well as a higher resolution of 1400 lines.|$|E

5000|$|Attempts {{were made}} {{for many years to}} take {{television}} images, convert them to film via kinescope, then project them in theaters for paying audiences. In the mid-1960s, Producer/entrepreneur H. William [...] "Bill" [...] Sargent, Jr. used conventional analog Image Orthicon video camera tube units, shooting in the B&W 819-line interlaced 25fps French video standard, using modified high-band quadruplex VTRs to record the signal. The promotors of Electronovision (not to be confused with Electronicam) gave the impression that this was a new system created from scratch, using a high-tech name (and avoiding the word kinescope) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography. Nonetheless, the advances in picture quality were, at the time, a major step ahead. By capturing more than 800 lines of resolution at 25 frame/s, <b>raw</b> <b>tape</b> could be converted to film via kinescope recording with sufficient enhanced resolution to allow big-screen enlargement. The 1960s productions used Marconi image orthicon video cameras, which have a characteristic white [...] "glow" [...] around black objects (and a corresponding black glow around white objects), which was a defect of the pickup. Later vidicon and plumbicon video camera tubes produced much cleaner, more accurate pictures.|$|E

50|$|On September 4, 1995, the WWF's chief {{competitor}} World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began airing its new wrestling show, Monday Nitro, live {{each week}} on TNT. Raw and Nitro went head-to-head {{for the first}} time on September 11, 1995. Due to Raw still being pre-recorded on certain weeks, Nitro play-by-play voice Eric Bischoff, who also was WCW's Vice President at the time, would frequently give away the results of WWF's <b>taped</b> <b>Raw</b> shows on the live WCW show. Some fans also looked at <b>Raw</b> <b>taping</b> results on the steadily growing Internet; this caused the ratings of the <b>taped</b> <b>Raw</b> episodes to decrease.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "Eurocontinental Champion" [...] is a {{portmanteau}} of European and Intercontinental, used {{to describe}} wrestlers who held both titles simultaneously. Three wrestlers were booked to accomplish this feat. The first was D'Lo Brown, who defeated Mideon for the European title at Fully Loaded in 1999 and two nights later at a Monday Night <b>Raw</b> <b>taping,</b> defeated Jeff Jarrett to win the Intercontinental Championship.

In 2005, the <b>raw</b> <b>tapes</b> were reviewed by jazz archivist Barry Kernfeld, who documented there were actually complete alternate takes for all six songs that he considered [...] "absolutely riveting." [...] Until clear ownership of these tapes is established between the Coltrane family and Universal Music, {{there are no plans}} for their release.|$|R
5000|$|The Arena is {{also known}} for hosting one of the loudest and passionate crowds in WWE, most notably for Money in the Bank 2011, among others, where the crowd would loudly chant [...] "CM PUNK!"

50|$|By 1993, Martel mainly {{appeared}} on the lower undercard, and rarely on television, mostly on programs such as All-American Wrestling and Wrestling Challenge. However, at the September 27 Monday Night <b>Raw</b> <b>taping,</b> he was the co-winner (with Razor Ramon) of a battle royal (aired October 4) to decide the competitors in a match for the vacant Intercontinental Championship. He lost that match (aired the next week) to Ramon. After this, Martel began moving slightly up the card once again. Martel also briefly feuded with Bastion Booger, losing one of their matches when he got fed up with how Booger smelled and started spraying him with his Arrogance cologne. Martel also appeared at Survivor Series 1993 in a 4-4 elimination match, being eliminated by The 1-2-3 Kid and in the 1994 Royal Rumble as the 26th entrant before getting eliminated by his old rival Tatanka.

He {{worked in the}} script department alongside another newcomer to audio, John Madden and {{under the direction of}} Martin Esslin, BBC head of drama, and Richard Imison, BBC head of scripts. John and Howard returned to Earplay in 1976 to bring a new approach to radio drama, one that did not rely on real time production, that is, recording dramas in real time with sound effects and music. Their idea was to produce radio as if it were film, that is, in segments in several takes without additions such as effects and music. This meant that they could be totally portable and fast, They could record voices in a day in a Los Angeles studio or a New York studio, wherever the best talent could be convinced to work on new and vibrant dramas written and acted by the best new talent anywhere in the country. Then they took the <b>raw</b> <b>tapes</b> back to Madison for post production. Given the technology at the time, they worked with multi tracking 2-inch tapes on a 24-track control board. They transferred the finished dramas onto long playing records and later switched to cassette tapes for distribution to the public broadcasting network throughout the country. Now Earplay was a full NPR distributed national program.|$|R
