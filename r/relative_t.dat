This and other results are {{a consequence of}} a theorem of independent interest, which states that if $H$ is a closed subgroup of a locally compact group $G$, and $A$ is a closed subgroup {{of the center of}} $H$, such that $A$ is normal in $G$, and $(G/A, H/A) $ has <b>relative</b> Property (<b>T),</b> then $(G, H^{(1) }) $ has <b>relative</b> Property (<b>T),</b> where $H^{(1) }$ is the closure of the commutator subgroup of $H$.

Arguably, T. horsfieldii belongs {{in a new}} genus (Agrionemys) {{on the basis of}} the shape of its carapace and plastron, and its distinctness is supported by DNA sequence analysis. Likewise, a separate genus Eurotestudo has recently been proposed for T. hermanni; these three lineages were distinct by the Late Miocene as evidenced by the fossil record. Whether these splits will eventually be accepted remains to be seen. The genus Chersus has been proposed to unite the Egyptian and marginated tortoises which have certain DNA sequence similarities, but their ranges are (and apparently always were) separated by their closest <b>relative</b> <b>T.</b> graeca and the open sea and thus, chance convergent haplotype sorting would better explain the biogeographical discrepancy.|$|E

40|$|Computer-aided {{diagnosis}} (CAD) {{has been}} proposed for breast MRI {{as a tool to}} standardize evaluation, to automate time-consuming analysis, and to aid the diagnostic decision process by radiologists. T 2 w MRI findings are diagnostically complementary to T 1 w DCE-MRI findings in the breast and prior research showed that measuring the T 2 w intensity of a lesion relative to a tissue of reference improves diagnostic accuracy. The diagnostic value of this information in CAD has not been yet quantified. This study proposes an automatic method of assessing <b>relative</b> <b>T</b> 2 w lesion intensity without the need to select a reference region. We also evaluate the effect of adding this feature to other T 2 w and T 1 w image features in the predictive performance of a breast lesion classifier for differential diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions. An automated feature of <b>relative</b> <b>T</b> 2 w lesion intensity was developed using a quantitative regression model. The diagnostic performance of the proposed feature in addition to T 2 w texture was compared to the performance of a conventional breast MRI CAD system based on T 1 w DCE-MRI features alone. The added contribution of T 2 w features to more conventional T 1 w-based features was investigated using classification rules extracted from the lesion classifier. After institutional review board approval that waived informed consent, we identified 627 breast lesions (245 malignant, 382 benign) diagnosed after undergoing breast MRI at our institution between 2007 and 2014. An increase in diagnostic performance in terms of area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was observed with the additional T 2 w features and the proposed quantitative feature of <b>relative</b> <b>T</b> 2 w lesion intensity.

MethodsStudents across four colleges in Texas were sampled. Multiple linear regression models, controlling for covariates, were used to model results. Cross-sectional data were used. ResultsMore number of <b>relatives</b> with <b>T</b> 2 D was associated with vegetable consumption (β[*]=[*] 0. 131, p[*]=[*] 0. 007) and exercise (β[*]=[*] 0. 129, p[*]=[*] 0. 037).
