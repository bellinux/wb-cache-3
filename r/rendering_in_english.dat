[...] The words answered well to the ghastly delineations that seemed stamped on Ambrose's brain and which followed him about into the nave, so that he felt himself in the grasp of the cruel fiend, and almost expected to feel the skeleton claw of Death about to hand him over to torment. He expected the consolation of hearing that a daily [...] "Hail Mary," [...] persevered in through the foulest life, would obtain that beams should be arrested in their fall, ships fail to sink, cords to hang, till such confession had been made as should insure ultimate salvation, after such a proportion of the flames of purgatory as masses and prayers might not mitigate.|$|E

40|$|Taking its {{starting}} point from remarks by Peirce and Rescher on Kant’s pragmatism, the paper attempts to answer two questions. (1) Whether the Ding an sich plays {{any role in}} Kant’s pragmatics; and (2) whether the English rendering of the thing-in-itself has perhaps encouraged P. F. Strawson and his successors to burden Kant’s “problematic” term {{with an emphasis on}} its alleged essential features. The paper retraces some well-trodden ground to emphasize Kant’s perspectival realism, which never doubts the objective reality of the phenomenal world, in order to ward off idealist as well as transcendental realist readings. The paper then proposes the ‘thing-at-itself’ as a less misleading, even if unidiomatic, <b>rendering</b> <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> A brief summary concludes the paper with Kant’s pragmatics as philosophical praxis in which the Ding as sich functions only negatively as cognitive limit but can play no role in the consideration of the consequences of our ideas, their possible utility, and their degree of attunement with sensus communis...|$|E
