5000|$|... == Preliminaries == [...] Array Set Addressing The ASA {{coordinate}} {{system has been}} proposed based on a simple fact that a hexagonal grid {{can be considered as}} a combination of two interleaved <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays.</b> From this, it is easy to address each individual array using familiar integer-valued row and column indices. Now, to select one among these two <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays,</b> a single binary coordinate is used. From this, a full address for any point in the hexagonal grid can be uniquely represented by three coordinates.where the coordinates a,r and c represent the array, row and column respectively. The hexagonal lattice can be separated into <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays</b> by considering alternate rows as one array and the remaining rows as the other. Figure 1 can be used to illustrate the process of Array Set Addressing, where alternate rows of the hexagonally sampled data are mapped to 0-array and 1-array <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays.</b>|$|R

40|$|We examine vortex pinning and {{dynamics}} in thin-film superconductors interacting with square and <b>rectangular</b> pinning <b>arrays</b> for varied vortex densities including densities significantly {{larger than the}} pinning density. For both square and <b>rectangular</b> pinning <b>arrays,</b> the critical depinning force shows maxima at only certain integer matching fields where the vortices can form highly ordered <b>arrays.</b> For <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays</b> the depinning force and commensurability effects are anisotropic with a much lower depinning threshold for vortex motion in the easy flow directions. We find evidence for a crossover in pinning behavior in <b>rectangular</b> pinning <b>arrays</b> as the field is increased. We also show analytically, and confirm with simulations, that for B = 2 B_ϕ the strongest pinning can be achieved for rectangular pinning arrangements rather than square for one direction of driving force. Under an applied driving force we find a remarkable variety of distinct complex flow phases in both square and <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays.</b> These flow phases include stable sinusoidal and intricate pinched patterns where vortices from different channels do not mix. As {{a function of the}} driving force certain flow states become unstable and transitions between different phases are observed which coincide with changes in the net vortex velocities. In the <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays</b> the types of flow depend on the direction of drive. We also show that two general types of plastic flow occur: stable flows, where vortices always flow along the same paths, and unstable or chaotic flows.

40|$|In this thesis, {{reconfiguration}} {{schemes for}} multipipeline structures and <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays</b> are analyzed for their yield and area utilization, {{and a new}} reconfiguration scheme is proposed for these structures. Schemes for <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays</b> are classified {{on the basis of}} locality of spares within the array. A methodology is developed to analyze the yield and area utilization of reconfiguration schemes in each class. Analytical solutions are obtained for yield and area utilization of representative schemes from each class, and schemes are compared for their optimal area utilization. The effect of the size of interconnect area on yield and area utilization is analyzed. The analysis shows that the yield and area utilization decreases very sharply with the size of the interconnection network. A new reconfiguration scheme for multipipeline structures and <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays</b> is presented, in which spare PEs are added to every column of the array, and the array is reconfigured using on-chip distributed logic by bypassing faulty PEs within each column. PEs are tested locally using near-neighbor comparisons, and scan paths are used to enhance the testability of the array. Interconnections between logical neighbors are short, and the speed penalty for reconfiguration is small. The topology of the scheme and design of reconfiguration switches are independent of array size and amount of redundancy. The design and implementation of the reconfiguration switches are presented. and logical properties of the network are studied. The scheme is analyzed for its yield and area utilization, and results are compared with other schemes. The analysis shows that even though the switches for the proposed scheme are very simple, the logical reconfigurability of the scheme is comparable to other schemes, and therefore, the scheme will provide better yield and area utilization than most of the other schemes for multipipeline structures and <b>rectangular</b> <b>arrays...</b>|$|R
