25|$|However it was {{essential}} that servants were close at hand, {{and so they were}} given their own specific floors, usually the lowest and the highest. These floors were often, as at Belton, distinguished by a different fenestration from the rooms of the employers in between. Hence at Belton can be seen the small windows of the semi-basement containing the kitchens, pantries and servants' dining halls. Above are the large windows lighting the principal rooms, while <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the house are again the small windows of the servants’ bedrooms. These rooms which were entirely in main block of the house, and constituted distinct servants' quarters, were to be the forerunner of the service wing.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the trend}} toward {{thinning}} the parcels was not universal. The vertical logic imposed by the formula of the East India Company was not immutable and rather quickly, {{in order to deal}} with demographic pressure, there started to appear horizontal boundaries cutting the original strips into several plots situated one above the other. In 1732, the surveyor Durongoüet was tasked with tracing four surveyors' lines parallel to the shore, at altitudes of 100, 200, 400 and 600 m. These lines, which correspond to the topographic notion of level curves, are still visible today, especially above the centre of Saint-Pierre, in the southern part of the island. Today these are navigable roads lined with houses that form evocatively named towns away from the centre: Ligne Paradis at around 100 m altitude, Ligne des Bambous at about 200 m, Ligne des Quatre-cents ("Line of the Four Hundreds") a little further and Ligne des Six-cents ("Line of the Six Hundreds") <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "Put the Needle on It" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary pop music critics. Cristín Leach of RTÉ Entertainment compared the song's musical style to American pop singer Madonna, while Amazon.com's David Trueman {{wrote that the}} song [...] "utilises the funkier end of 1980s disco, with a contemporary edge that removes the cheese and dispels any notion that [...] may be hanging on the coattails of her big sister (Kylie Minogue)". MusicOMH's Alexis Kirke called the track a [...] "slow but inevitable grower" [...] which [...] "shows that Dannii's dark song-writing powers can compete <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the charts".|$|E

500|$|Overall, {{the press}} the horse {{received}} {{was viewed as}} giving a needed boost to the sport.

He's brought us mainstream again {{for the first time}} in a lot of years." [...] Post-Belmont press analysis contended that California Chrome was the most popular Thoroughbred in America since Zenyatta. In December, when the horse was selected as the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award, Coburn said, [...] "We have always said Chrome is the 'People's Horse' and we are thrilled that the public feels the same way we do about him." [...] In announcing the Moment of the Year, Keith Chamblin of NTRA stated, [...] "the fans reminded us that nothing trumps an awesome performance by a legendary horse." [...] When the horse won the 2016 Vox Populi award, Perry Martin said, [...] "I'm proud to witness the love and devotion of Chrome's fans. They've always seen what I've seen in him." ...|$|E

[...] Film critic Ty Burr reviewed the film for The Boston Globe and criticized, [...] "The movie's often touching and very watchable, but what gets you past the script's sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit." [...] The Chicago Tribunes film critic Michael Phillips talked about [...] "How Woodroof became his own brand of AIDS activist {{is the stuff of}} Dallas Buyers Club, which does a few things wrong but a lot right, starting <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> with McConaughey." [...] Bob Mondello criticized the film's character for the NPR in these words: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club is just about a selfish boor who arguably gets a pass in terms of posterity, because while looking out for No. 1, he paved the way for change for everyone else." [...] Dana Stevens of Slate magazine praised McConaughey's performance, highlighting that the movie [...] "traffics in deep hindbrain emotions: fear and rage and lust and, above all, the pure animal drive to go on living." ...|$|E
500|$|When Mirkin {{took over}} as show runner, he listed actor James Woods {{as one of the}} people he would most like to guest star on the show. Michael Caine was {{originally}} supposed to be the actor in the episode who takes over Apu's job at the Kwik-E-Mart, but he rejected the role. The story was therefore rewritten so that Woods received Apu's job instead. Woods was one of animation director David Silverman's favorite guest stars. Mirkin said he provided one of the [...] "most fantastic" [...] performances ever on the show, and commented that he [...] "nailed" [...] all of his lines and was [...] "so funny, <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of his head". Mirkin said that when most guest stars come in to record their lines for the show, they are a little nervous because they have never done voice-over before. Mirkin noted, however, that Woods was a [...] "fearless guy" [...] and he was [...] "so excited to do it because he was a huge fan of the show". Silverman noted that in addition to his humorous ad-libbing, Woods's tendency to hesitate while speaking was [...] "great for animation", explaining that it made the character feel more realistic. [...] "Homer and Apu" [...] features the popular Simpsons song [...] "Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart?", sung by Apu and the Simpson family. The song was written by all of the show's writers in the writer's room, and it was composed by Alf Clausen. The song later appeared on the soundtrack album Songs in the Key of Springfield, which was released on March 18, 1997, and compiled many musical numbers from the show.|$|E
2500|$|During the Sangam age, 200 BCE – 200 CE, {{agriculture}} was {{the main}} vocation of the Tamils.

2500|$|Santa Maria Maggiore has a {{large area}} of mosaics, {{probably}} of 432-440. They cover the apse, the [...] "triumphal arch" [...] (equivalent to the chancel arch), and sections, originally much larger, of the nave walls, where 27 of an original 42 panels remain from a sequence of scenes from the Old Testament. They are <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the wall and hard to see. The apse mosaic is now mostly a Coronation of the Virgin of 1295 by Jacopo Torriti; probably it was originally all composed of the giant foliage scrolls that remain to the upper sides. San Clemente retains a similar apse mosaic, now a reworking of 1299, following the 5th century original. [...] The triumphal arch has the earliest surviving monumental cycle of the Life of the Virgin, dedicatee of the church, and {{is thought to have}} been put up by Pope Sixtus III (432-40) to celebrate the Council of Ephesus, where Marian doctrine triumphed over the Nestorians.|$|E
2500|$|In The MVC Final, the Cougars faced Missouri State {{and their}} waves of {{substitutes}} on the Bears' home field. Early on, both sides mostly controlled {{the ball in}} their own end of the field, looking for chance to attack. In the 37th minute, Jambga took the ball away, worked downfield and left through several defenders, cut <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the 18 yard box, and slammed a hard, low shot just inside the post for the game's only goal on {{what would be the}} Cougars' only shot of the game. For the [...] remainder of the game, MoSt attacked, SIUE turned the attack aside, and the two teams did the same all over again and again, even after the Bears went a man down when Dal Santo was fouled hard while covering a loose ball in the box. The win gave the Cougars their second MVC Tournament title and automatic qualification to the NCAA Tournament in three years. They would take their trophy and their twelve-game unbeaten streak home to wait to see who they would face in the NCAAs.|$|E

2500|$|Other critics laud {{the use of}} plot {{twists and}} {{surprise}} endings. Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observers issue of 5 November 1939 which began, [...] "No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a [...] trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers {{is one of the}} very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure." [...] After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, [...] "Story telling and characterisation are <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work." ...|$|E
