This paper {{analyzes}} {{the stress of}} the pick-shaped cutter of <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> in process of tunnel excavation in soft and hard interbedded formation, results show that the resistance of pick is obviously jumping fluctuations comparing to that of homogeneous formation. When pick transits from cutting hard rock to soft rock, cutting resistance and driving resistance of pick decrease instantaneously, which leads to momentary decreasing of rotation torque. And mud ball is compacted by high impact force of <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> when cutting hard rock strata, as a consequence, resistance torque increases. When the sum of resistance torque and starting torque is greater than rotation torque, pick can`t rotate, leading to eccentric wear of pick.

40|$|Pickforce sensing is {{a method}} demonstrating a {{promising}} future in automating coal mining machines. The method {{is based on the}} ability to determine the vertical location of a <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> from the force measured at the point of contact between the machine and the coal seam. A major problem that may degrade the reliability of the pickforce data is vibration and is the major concern of this study. To analyze the effects of vibration on pickforce sensing, a vibration model of the cutting process is first developed. Then, a stochastic model of the coal seam is constructed. Subsequently, the vibration model is simulated in three stages. In these stages, the machine is assumed to be cutting through three types of coal seam: homogeneous, predetermined heterogeneous, and heterogeneous stochastic model. The first stage is conducted to prove that pickforce data always contains a degree of phase shift between successive half revolutions. This eliminates the effect of repetitive or orderly vibration that may mask the pickforce data. In addition, both the first and second stages are conducted to find ways to improve the reliability of pickforce data by adjusting a few parameters within the machine. The third stage is conducted to prove that the chaotic appearance of the pickforce data does not eliminate the features that are used to determine the vertical location. The present study concludes that vibration has a minor effect, and that pickforce sensing can be improved by adjusting some parameters of the cutting machine...|$|E

40|$|Reliable {{standardized}} testing of dental <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> instruments remains {{a problem because}} of the many significant parameters that require identi-fying and quantifying. In a previous study, hand-piece wear or degradation {{was identified as a}} potentially significant confounding variable leading to the suggestion that the use of industrial hand-pieces might be necessary. Therefore, the objective of this investigation was to measure and compare industrial and dental air rotor degradation during a simulated diamond <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> instrument test. Two dental and two industrial products were tested in a random sequence using three replicate samples of each air rotor. The simulated test consisted of 10 diamond instruments each making 90 passes through a float glass substrate. The testing apparatus comprised a computer-interfaced device that controlled the contact force between the cutting diamond and the substrate. Air rotor performance was based on the time required to cut a standardized path through the substrate. The performance change that occurred from diamond instrument to instrument during the simulated test was attributed to air rotor degradation. Multiple regression analyses showed significant differences between replicate samples of the same type and between regression intercepts for different air rotor types. Surprisingly, four air rotors exhibited improving performance during the simulated test. Changing air rotor performance must be considered to achieve reliability for the testing of diamond <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> instruments.

40|$|The linear cutting system, {{developed}} by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, uses geometric principles {{developed by}} Cardan to produce a nearly constant cut depth. The new system has been extensively tested in a synthetic material under laboratory conditions to verify mechanical capability and to identify operational characteristics. Comparisons between 15 -rpm linear cutting and 50 -rpm <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> systems show significant improvement in respirable dust entrainment, product size distribution, and energy usage. Respirable dust is reduced {{by as much as}} 90 pct. Recovered product showed a 67 -pct reduction in - 0. 32 -cm (- 1 / 8 -in) material and a 200 -pct increase in + 5. 08 cm (+ 2 in) material. Average power was reduced by 66 pct for the linear cutting. Because the bit cutting paths differ between linear and <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting,</b> it was necessary to compare the two at the same cut depths and bit types. These comparisons show that low revolution per minute <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> entrains about the same amount of respirable dust as the linear cutting system, but the average shaft torque may be 55 to 130 pct greater for the rotary system...|$|R

40|$|Automobile and aero {{industries}} have an increasing interestin materials with improved mechanical properties. However, manyof these new materials {{are classified as}} difficult-to-cut withconventional tools. It is obvious that tools, cutting processesand cutting models has to be devel-oped parallel to materialsscience. In this thesis <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> tools are tested as analternative toexpensive diamond or cubic bore nitridetools. Metal matrix composites mostly consist of a light metalalloy (such as aluminium or titanium) reinforced with hard andabrasive ceramic parti-cles or fibres. On machining, thereinforcement results in {{a high rate of}} tool wear. This is themain problem for the machining of MMCs. Many factors affect thelife length of a tool, i. e. matrix alloy, type, size andfraction of the reinforcement, heat treatment, cuttingconditions and tool properties. In tests, the Al-SiC MMC formed a deformation layer duringmilling, probably affected by lack of cooling. The dominatingfactor for tool life was the cutting speed. Water jet or CO 2 cooling of turning did not provide dramatic increase in toollife. With PCD, cutting speeds up to 2000 m/min were usedwithout machining problems and BUE formation. Tool flank wearwas abrasive and crater wear created an "orange-peel type" wearsurface. PCD inserts did not show the typical increase in flankwear rate {{at the end of its}} lifetime. The use of self-propelled rotary tools seems to be apromising way to increase tool life. No BUE was formed on therotary tool at high cutting data. The measurements indicatethat the rotary tool creates twice as good surface as PCDtools. The longest tool life was gained with an inclinationangle of 10 degrees. Tool costs per component will beapproximately the same, but <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> tool allows higherfeeds and therefore a higher production rate and thus a lowerproduction cost. The <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> operation might have a potential toincrease productiv-ity in bar peeling. The lack of BUE withrotary cutting gives hope on higher tool life. The test resultsshow that tool wear was 27 % lower with <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> tools. Increase of cutting speed from 22 to 44 m/min did not affectcutting forces. This indicates that the cutting speed canincrease without significant change in tool wear rate. Issues related to <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> like cutting models,cutting processes, standards, tools and models have beendiscussed. A tool wear model with kinetic energy has beendiscussed.

The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> and also an innovative solution for beam mounting.

They are also required {{for the development of}} improved devices and recommendations on operation as well as for equipment specification and standards testing. In reviewing the literature on dental <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> performance testing to evaluate available methods, the factors which may influence clinical cutting behaviour are identified as those related to characteristics of the operator, handpiece, <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> instrument, coolant/lubricant used and workpiece material. Existing industrial cutting theory is of limited help in understanding dental cutting in view {{of the differences between the}} control of relevant variables in the two cases. Consideration is given to the ways in which the important variables have (or have not) been controlled in past studies of dental cutting and thus the clinical relevance of available methods evaluated. Serious problems such as the lack of suitable test workpiece materials, as well as deficiencies in current knowledge of operator behaviour, handpiece characteristics and effects of coolant/lubricant application are noted. It is concluded that before improved, clinically relevant tests can be developed, further fundamental research in these areas is essential and that until this is done, further work under arbitrary experimental conditions would be of little value. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
