Reconstituted from the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation he founded in 1927, it was an {{alliance}} between scientists and volunteers, with volunteers raising money to support research and education efforts. Basil O'Connor, an attorney and close associate of Roosevelt, helped establish the foundation and was its president for more than three decades. The organization initially focused on the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>victims</b> of paralytic polio, and supported the work of Jonas Salk and others that {{led to the development of}} polio vaccines. Today, the March of Dimes focuses on preventing premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921 Franklin D. Roosevelt became totally and {{permanently}} {{paralyzed from the}} waist down. Although the paralysis (whether from poliomyelitis, as diagnosed at the time, or from Guillain–Barré syndrome) had no cure at the time, Roosevelt, who had planned a life in politics, {{refused to accept the}} limitations of his disease. He tried a wide range of therapies, including hydrotherapy in Warm Springs, Georgia (see below). [...] In 1938 Roosevelt helped to found the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (now known as the March of Dimes), that raised money for the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>victims</b> of paralytic polio, and was instrumental in funding the development of polio vaccines. The March of Dimes changed the way it approached fund-raising. Rather than soliciting large contributions from a few wealthy individuals, the March of Dimes sought small donations from millions of individuals. Its hugely successful fund-raising campaigns collected hundreds of millions of dollars—more than all of the U.S. charities at the time combined (with the exception of the Red Cross). By 1955 the March of Dimes had invested $25.5 million in research; funding both Jonas Salk's and Albert Sabin's vaccine development; the 1954–55 field trial of vaccine, and supplies of free vaccine for thousands of children.|$|E
