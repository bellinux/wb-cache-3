500|$|Audiences began {{rooting for}} Rachel and Ross' union {{since the very}} {{beginning}} of Friends, openly voicing their frustration with Rachel’s obliviousness to Ross' feelings for her. The episode that would ultimately transform the friends' relationship {{for the remainder of the}} series was the first season finale [...] "The One Where Rachel Finds Out", in which Rachel finally learns of Ross' true feelings for her, at the same time discovering she actually feels the same. However, the episode nearly went unwritten because, at the time, few friends writers were expecting the couple's relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became. The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive [...] "he's pining, she's oblivious" [...] pattern, using the work of author Jane Austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel. Because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high, [...] "The One Where Rachel Finds Out" [...] became Friends most reworked episode. The couple's first kiss at the end of season two's [...] "The One Where Ross Finds Out" [...] was met with deafening applause from the studio audience. Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging. Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph believes that they accomplished this by [...] "dangl the possibility of a Ross and Rachel <b>recoupling</b> through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together." [...] According to Encyclopedia of Television author Horace Newcomb, Ross and Rachel's ever-changing relationship [...] "converted the traditional amnesic plotlines of the situation comedy into ones akin to episodic drama." [...] Meanwhile, writing for The New York Review of Books, Elaine Blair agreed that Friends created [...] "a sense of chemistry between two characters while also putting obstacles in their way, setting us up for a long-deferred union." ...|$|E

40|$|T he {{dramatic}} {{differences between}} the properties of molecules formed from the latep-block elements of the first row of the periodic table (NF) {{and those of the}} corresponding elements in subsequent rows is well recognized as the first row anomaly. Certain properties of the atoms, such as the relative energies and spatial extents of the ns and np orbitals, can explain some of these differences, but not others. In this Account, we summarize the results of our recent computational studies of the halides of the late p-block elements. Our studies point to a single underlying cause for many of these differences: the ability of the late p-block elements in the second and subsequent rows of the periodic table to form <b>recoupled</b> pair bonds and <b>recoupled</b> pair bond dyads with very electronegative ligands. <b>Recoupled</b> pair bonds form when an electron in a singly occupied ligand orbital <b>recouples</b> the pair of electrons in a doubly occupied lone pair orbital on the central atom, leading to a central atom-ligand bond. <b>Recoupled</b> pair bond dyads occur when a second ligand forms a bond with the orbital left over from the initial <b>recoupled</b> pair bond. <b>Recoupled</b> pair bonds and <b>recoupled</b> pair bond dyads enable the late p-block elements to form remarkably stable hypervalent compounds such as PF 5 and SF 6 and lead to unexpected excited states in smaller halides of the late p-block elements such as SF and SF 2. <b>Recoupled</b> pair bonding also causes the Fn 1 XF bond energies to oscillate dramaticall...|$|R

However, when compared to attempting to burn a pasture completely, {{we did not observe}} different vegetative responses associated with fire intensity or herbivory.
