40|$|International audienceRunoff {{from urban}} environments is {{generally}} contaminated. These contaminants mostly originate from road traffic and building envelopes. Facade envelopes generate lead, zinc and even biocides, {{which are used}} for facade protection. Road traffic produces particles from tires and brakes. The transport of these pollutants to the environment is controlled by rainfall. The interval, duration and intensity of rainfall events are important as {{the dynamics of the}} pollutants are often modeled with non-linear buildup/washoff functions. Buildup occurs during dry weather when pollution accumulates, and is subsequently washed-off {{at the time of the}} following rainfall, contaminating surface runoff. Climate predictions include modified <b>rainfall</b> <b>distributions,</b> with changes in both number and intensity of events, even if the expected annual rainfall varies little. Consequently, pollutant concentrations in urban runoff driven by buildup/washoff processes will be affected by these changes in <b>rainfall</b> <b>distributions.</b> We investigated to what extent modifications in future <b>rainfall</b> <b>distributions</b> will impact the concentrations of pollutants present in urban surface runoff. The study used the example of Lausanne, Switzerland (temperate climate zone). Three emission scenarios (time horizon 2090), multiple combinations of RCM/GCM and modifications in rain event frequency were used to simulate future <b>rainfall</b> <b>distributions</b> with various characteristics. Simulated rainfall events were used as inputs for four pairs of buildup/washoff models, in order to compare future pollution concentrations in surface runoff. In this way, uncertainty in model structure was also investigated. Future concentrations were estimated to be between ± 40 % of today's concentrations depending on the season and, importantly, on the choice of the RCM/GCM model. Overall, however, the dominant factor was the uncertainty inherent in buildup/washoff models, which dominated over the uncertainty in future <b>rainfall</b> <b>distributions.</b> Consequently, the choice of a proper buildup/washoff model, with calibrated site-specific coefficients, is a major factor in modeling future runoff concentrations from contaminated urban surfaces...|$|R

25|$|Alwar has an {{important}} place in Agriculture production in Rajasthan. Total geographical area of the district is 7,83,281 hectares which is about 2.5 per cent of the State. In 2010–2011 the net cultivated area is 5,07,171 hecters from which about 83 per cent area viz. – 4,51,546 is irrigated and remaining 17 per cent area viz. – 82,903 is unirrigated. Double cropped area is 252 hectares of which 32,230 hecter (12%) area is irrigated and remaining 2,19,819 hecter (88%) area is unirrigated. Thus, the total cropped area of the district is 8,12,873 hecters. In Kharif season Bajra, Maize, Jowar, Kharif pulses, Arhar, Sesamum, Cotton, Guar etc. are sown in about 3,29,088 hectare (42%) and in Rabi season Wheat, Barley, Gram, Mustard, Taramira, Rabi pulses etc. are sown in about 4,52,527 hectare (58%). The main source of irrigation are wells and Tube Wells. By 26064 Tube Wells about 192861 hectare area is being irrigated and by 57196 Wells about 265169 hectares area is irrigated. By other sources like canals, tanks about 404 hectares area is irrigated. About 35470 electric motors and 66502 Diesel pump sets are being used for Irrigation purposes. The normal rainfall for the district is 657.3mm. The average rainfall in last ten years in the district is 724mm. The <b>rainfall</b> <b>distribution</b> in the district is uneven and scattered which resulted some times flood problems and some time draught position which affect the Agriculture production as well as cropping pattern in Kharif & Rabi season.

[...] A similar model was developed for the northwest Pacific Ocean and Southern Hemisphere known as the Statistical Intensity Prediction System (STIPS), which accounts for land interactions through the input environmental conditions from the Navy Operational Global Prediction System (NOGAPS) model.

[...] The Logistic Growth Equation Model (LGEM) uses the same input as SHIPS but within a simplified dynamical prediction system. [...] Within tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting, the Rainfall Climatology and Persistence (r-CLIPER) model was developed using microwave rainfall data from polar orbiting satellites over the ocean and first-order rainfall measurements from the land, {{to come up with}} a realistic <b>rainfall</b> <b>distribution</b> for tropical cyclones based on the National Hurricane Center's track forecast.

500|$|Isaac Cline was {{the first}} to {{investigate}} <b>rainfall</b> <b>distribution</b> around tropical cyclones in the early 1900s. [...] He found that a larger proportion of rainfall falls in advance of the center (or eye) than after the center's passage, with the highest percentage falling in the right front quadrant. [...] Father Viñes of Cuba found that some tropical cyclones have their highest rainfall rates in the rear quadrant within a training (non-moving) inflow band. [...] Normally, as a tropical cyclone intensifies, its heavier rainfall rates become more concentrated around its center. [...] Rainfall is found to be heaviest in tropical cyclone's inner core, whether it be the eyewall or central dense overcast, within a degree latitude of the center, with lesser amounts farther away from the center. Most of the rainfall in tropical cyclones is concentrated within its radius of gale-force (34knots/39mph/63km/h) winds. [...] Rainfall is more common near the center of tropical cyclones overnight. [...] Over land, outer bands are more active during the heating of the day, which can act to restrict inflow {{into the center of the}} cyclone. [...] Recent studies have shown that half of the rainfall within a tropical cyclone is stratiform in nature. [...] The chart to the right was developed by Riehl in 1954 using meteorological equations that assume a gale radius of about , a fairly symmetric cyclone, and does not consider topographic effects or vertical wind shear. [...] Local amounts can exceed this chart by a factor of two due to topography. [...] Wind shear tends to lessen the amounts below what is shown on the table.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of rainstorm-induced shallow landslides {{is still a}} research topic of wide concern for scientists and engineers. This paper examined the effect of <b>rainfall</b> intensity <b>distribution</b> on shallow landslides. Four synthetic <b>rainfall</b> <b>distributions</b> comprising uniformed, delayed, centralized, and advanced, were selected to {{examine the effect of}} rainstorm patterns on slope failure. The infiltration was modeled using Green-Ampt equation, while an infinite slope was selected to model the shallow landslide.

The results indicated that among the four representative rainstorm patterns, the advanced rainfall pattern caused worst slope stability. The advanced rainfall pattern resulted in the shortest rainfall duration threshold for landslide occurrence, followed by the central, uniform, and then delayed rainfall pattern. The probabilistic analysis method was suitable to estimate the time of failure for the evaluated landslide cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to propose methods for estimating the <b>distribution</b> of hourly <b>rainfall</b> based on at-site daily rainfall measurements, and from available regional information. The methods consist of deriving time-resolution independent mathematical models to describe the <b>distribution</b> of <b>rainfalls</b> for different time scales at a single site, and for the whole study region. The proposed models are ba'led on the theory of multifractal multiplicative cascades which describes the transfer mechanism of rain flux from large time scales (e. g. days or longer) to smaller time intervals (e. g. hours or shorter). In the present study, using rainfall data from a network of nine recording raingages in the Montreal region (Quebec, Canada) an empirical investigation is carried out to demonstrate how well rainfall measurements at different time resolutions can be described by such multiplicative cascade processes. Results of the data analysis in this study have provided some credence to this hypothesis since {{it was found that}} the probability <b>distributions</b> of <b>rainfalls</b> over a wide range of time scales can be described by one particular theoretically-derived functional form. Further, the good agreement between computed and observed hourly <b>rainfall</b> <b>distributions</b> have indicated the adequacy ofthe proposed methods.

LF signals utilized included the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and a decadal-frequency signal (DEC). These were stratified into cool and warm phases based on their sign (+ or –) and were combined with cool (La Niña) and warm (El Niño) ENSO phases. Box plots displaying a 95 % confidence interval for the median were developed for early (Jun-Aug) and late (Sep-Nov) harvest season periods. These were used to determine if discriminatory ability among <b>rainfall</b> <b>distributions</b> is improved when combining ENSO and LF indices as apposed to using individual ENSO phases or individual LF phases only. Results suggest the ENSO signal is strong across all regions for Sep-Nov, but has only minor to moderate effects during Jun-Aug. All three LF indices display very little discriminatory ability across both harvesting periods. When ENSO and the LF indices are combined, additional suppression or enhancement effects could not be established.
