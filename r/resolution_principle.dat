In this paper, the author {{recommends}} {{the use of}} fuzzy logic, {{which is based on}} the concept of fuzzy sets and first order predicate calculus. It is proved that, in fuzzy logic, a set of clauses is unsatisfiable iff it is unsatisfiable in twovalued logic. It is also shown that if the most unreliable clause of a set of clauses has a truth-value a> 0. 5, then all the logical consequences obtained by repeatedly applying the <b>resolution</b> <b>principle</b> has truth-value never smaller than a.

40|$|AbstractAn {{extension}} of the <b>resolution</b> <b>principle</b> was recently proposed by Dubois and Prade for logical clauses weighted by certainty degrees and was used in theorem proving under uncertainty. These certainty degrees were lower bounds on necessity measures. In the case considered here, the available information may also be an upper bound on a necessity measure, or, if one prefers, a lower bound on the dual possibility measure. It leads to a second <b>resolution</b> <b>principle</b> for clauses weighted in terms of possibility or necessity degrees. The formal analogy between these two resolution principles and the ones existing in modal logic is stressed. Finally, the case where the uncertain clauses include fuzzy predicates, to which the excluded-middle law no longer applies, is studied, and a suitable adaptation of the extended resolution principles is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Drawing inferences from a set {{of general}} {{constraint}} clauses {{is known as a}} difficult problem. A general approach is based on the idea of eliminating some or all variables involved.

The result is a general variable elimination method. The paper shows that the elimination problem can always be reduced to the problem of eliminating the variable from a (conjunctive) set of atomic constraints. Variabele elimination has a number of possible applications such as satisfiability testing, hypotheses testing, constraint solving, argumentative reasoning, and many others. ...|$|E

50|$|As the {{development}} of FPM techniques, its power has spread from uniform oriented fluorophores to fluorescent dipoles with organized orientation or on complex bio-structures. The detection accuracy has improved from measuring the bulk volume polarization to sub-diffraction area measurement and single dipole measurement. Imaging resolution of FPM matters not only for intensity image {{but also for the}} accuracy of dipole orientation detection. Recently developed super resolution FPM techniques still have their limitations though demonstrating great successes in their imaging results. Spatial 3D super resolution FPM techniques and 3D orientation measurement of fluorescent dipoles are still missing. In the future, we anticipate more inventions which could achieve both high-resolution measurement and fast temporal resolution, allowing imaging samples of live cells. This may be done by introducing existing super <b>resolution</b> <b>principles</b> into FPM, or by better exploiting the intensity fluctuation with polarization modulation, or other alternative means.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a fuzzy {{temporal}} constraint logic. First of all, we provide the formal language {{which will allow}} the expression of well-formed formulas related to the temporal events by means of temporal constraints. Secondly, we introduce a valid <b>resolution</b> <b>principle</b> in order to solve the queries in this logic. Finally, we will show that this <b>resolution</b> <b>principle</b> is a generalization of the <b>resolution</b> <b>principle</b> proposed for a possibilistic logic with fuzzy predicates (Dubois and Prade, Internat. J. Approx. Reason. 4 (1990) 1 [...] 21). All this will serve to reason within a context of the theoretical model of the temporal reasoning proposed by Mar# #n and Barro (Fuzzy Temporal Constraint Network, FTCN) (Mar# #n et al., Cybernet. Systems 25 (2) (1994) 207 [...] 215). This model underlies a module for the resolution of temporal queries.

40|$|We {{consider}} various {{analyses of}} certain asymmetries concerning morphosyntactic features in coordinate structures in Welsh {{in the light}} of the theories of agreement and of coordination in LFG. In classic LFG, a very simple view is taken of agreement phenomena such as person, number and gender agreement between nite verbs and their subjects, or gender and number agreement between determiners, adjectives and nominals and similar phenomena. Agreement is generally modelled by means of constraints stated over the grammatical features PER, NUM and GEN of the controller argument: since these features belong to the vocabulary of f-structure, agreement is viewed as a surface syntactic matter. It is well known that agreement with coordinate structures may require some computation of controller agreement features and (Dalrymple and Kaplan 1998) show how the LFG formalism may be extended to express such feature <b>resolution</b> <b>principles,</b> again treating agreement at f-structure.
