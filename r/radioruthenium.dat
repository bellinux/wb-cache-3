40|$|A {{study has}} been made to {{determine}} the conditions necessary for the complete (,~ 99 ~) electrodeposition f <b>radioruthenium.</b> Bright adherent deposits uitable for small radio-active sources were obtained from acid solutions containing moderately low concentra-tions (5 X 10 - 3 - 5 X 10 - 5 / 1 /) of ruthenium nitroso salts. The minimum cathode po-tential at which complete deposition was possible was about- 0. 45 volt vs. S. C. E...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of a nine-day release by the Chernobyl reactor in April-May 1986, {{ruthenium}} was considered to have been emitted {{at the same rate as}} other refractory elements. In fact, there are indications that the release was more important than previously estimated and lasted for tens of days because of oxidation of Ru into volatile forms. This paper demonstrates that, when put in contact with air, small uranium oxide particles can release 100 % of <b>radioruthenium</b> at temperatures of the order of 1000 degrees C...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} radioisotopes of cerium, {{ruthenium}} and silver may be {{released into the}} environment and potentially contaminate foodstuffs. For ruminants, data on the absorption, transfer and excretion rates of these radionuclides are sparse and were previously insufficient to allow the development of reliable dynamic models to enable the prediction of contamination levels in food products. In this study, groups of sheep were given single oral administrations of radiocerium, <b>radioruthenium,</b> and radiosilver and slaughtered at various periods up to 1 year. The resulting data were used to develop compartment models to describe {{the transfer of the}} three radionuclides to sheep tissues. Values for gut absorption and transfer to muscle (the most important tissue in terms of contamination of the food chain) derived from the models were considerably lower than previously advised values for the radionuclides studied. For all three radionuclides there were certain organs which contained significantly higher activity concentrations than muscle. The models developed allow prediction of the likely levels of these radionuclides in the tissues of sheep as a result of single or continuous contamination events...|$|E
