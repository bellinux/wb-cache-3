50|$|The Tolomeo {{incandescent}} {{desk lamp}} is {{an icon of}} Italian modern design. It was designed by Michele De Lucchi and Giancarlo Fassina in 1986 for the Artemide company. In its original configuration, it consists of a heavy base, two straight polished aluminum arm sections (each approximately 45 cm long), and a matte aluminum <b>reflector</b> <b>head</b> which can swivel 360°. Steel tension cables attached to springs hidden inside the arms complete the constant-tension structure. Tolomeo is the Italian version of the name Ptolemy. In the dot-com period, it became popular {{as a symbol of}} conspicuous consumption and high design consciousness in high-tech companies as well as in architectural and graphic design offices. It won the Compasso d'Oro design prize in 1989.|$|E

50|$|The 2-door sedan {{was dropped}} {{at the end}} of 1968 and {{replaced}} with the Swinger 2-door hardtop for 1969. Also added was the Swinger 340. The entire 1969 Dart range received trim updates including another minor revision of the grille, and a return to rectangular park/turn lights. The 1968 round side marker lights were replaced with rectangular <b>reflectors.</b> <b>Head</b> restraints were optional equipment until January 1, 1969, when their installation became mandatory under federal law. The 6-cylinder models received a carburetor anti-ice system borrowed from Canadian-market Chrysler 6-cylinder engines, and the drum brake automatic adjusters were revised for more consistent operation. At the top of the Dart performance range for 1969, there was limited availability of the 440 V8 in the Dart GTS model.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{light at}} Kinnaird Head Lighthouse {{was established by}} Thomas Smith on 1 December 1787. A lantern was set 120 ft above the sea on a tower of the old castle. Whale oil lamps produced a fixed light, each backed by a parabolic <b>reflector.</b> Kinnaird <b>Head</b> was the most powerful light of its time, and contained 17 reflectors arranged in 3 horizontal tiers. It {{was reported to be}} visible from 12 to 14 mi.|$|R
40|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation is}} offered for the redshift (an abrupt {{change in the}} ratio of scattering to absorption in the radiance spectra of heading canopies of such crops as wheat and grain sorghum). The shift occurs abruptly at wavelengths near the red-infrared boundary towards the longer wavelengths. The new explanation, following that of Collins (1978) and Schutt et al. (1984), is based on one particular architectural change that occurs in any heading plant canopy. Specifically, the newly extended heads alter the interaction between light and the established foliage. The heads {{reduce the amount of}} sunlight striking the topmost leaves which are generally comparatively good specular <b>reflectors.</b> The <b>heads</b> also reduce the ability to observe the specularly reflecting leaves. The reduction in the amplitude of the radiance (due to decreased specularly reflected light) at heading appears to be a shift in the wavelength of the red edge. It is proposed that vertical (amplitude) shifts - due to changes in the amount of specularly reflected light as a function of heading - have been misinterpreted as horizontal (wavelength) shifts {{due in part to the}} characteristic shape of the radiance curve at the red edge...|$|R
50|$|Binaural hearing {{learning}} is a bionic method. The sensor is a robot dummy head with 2 sensor microphones along with the artificial pinna (<b>reflector).</b> The robot <b>head</b> has 2 rotation axes and can rotate horizontally and vertically. The reflector causes the spectrum change into a certain pattern for incoming white noise sound wave and this pattern {{is used for the}} cue of the vertical localization. The cue for horizontal localization is ITD. The system makes use of a learning process using neural networks by rotating the head with a settled white noise sound source and analyzing the spectrum. Experiments show that the system can identify the direction of the source well in a certain range of angle of arrival. It cannot identify the sound coming outside the range due to the collapsed spectrum pattern of the reflector. Binaural hearing use only 2 microphones and is capable of concentrating on one source among multiple sources of noises.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the issues strictly {{connected with the}} scientific discipline of Transport, concerning the exploitation of lighting devices, reflectors and projectors being the fundamental devices for tram’s head lighting. The factor influencing {{the safety of a}} moving track vehicle is the quality and state of tram’s head lighting. Appropriate light distribution within the area of tram’s foreground plays a decisive role in the perception of luminous sensations by the tram driver. A properly shaped light beam conditions appropriate visibility from the tram driver’s seat and facilitates correct assessment of traffic situations connected with the behaviour of other road traffic participants. The history of development of lighting devices for head lights used for trams has been discussed. The article proposes and discusses application of AFS system in trams particularly accounting for proposals of new lighting requirements for tram’s head lighting devices. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} photometric requirements for projectors and <b>reflectors</b> of tram’s <b>head</b> lights, presenting proposals for these requirements. After conducting a lighting analysis of currently exploited light beams it has been established that justification exists for using symmetrical light beams in the case of head, main and low beam lights.

40|$|A boron {{neutron capture}} {{enhanced}} fast neutron therapy assembly {{has been designed}} for the Fermilab Neutron Therapy Facility (NTF). This assembly uses a tungsten filter and collimator near the patient¡¯s head, with a graphite <b>reflector</b> surrounding the <b>head</b> to significantly increase the dose due to boron neutron capture reactions. The assembly was designed using Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP version 5 for a standard 20 x 20 cm 2 treatment beam. The calculated boron dose enhancement at 5. 7 -cm depth in a water-filled head phantom in the assembly with a 5 x 5 cm 2 collimation was 21. 9 % per 100 -ppm B- 10 for a 5. 0 -cm tungsten filter and 29. 8 % for an 8. 5 -cm tungsten filter. The corresponding dose rate for the 5. 0 -cm and 8. 5 -cm thick filters were 0. 221 and 0. 127 Gy/min, respectively. To validate the design calculations, a simplified BNCEFNT assembly was built using four lead bricks to form a 5 x 5 cm 2 collimator. Five 1. 0 -cm thick 20 x 20 cm 2 tungsten plates were used to obtain different filter thicknesses and graphite bricks/blocks were used to form a reflector. Measurements of the dose enhancement of the simplified assembly in a water-filled head phantom were performed using a pair of tissue-equivalent ion chambers. One of the ion chambers is loaded with 1000 -ppm natural boron (184 -ppm 10 B) to measure dose due to boron neutron capture. The measured dose enhancement at 5. 0 -cm depth in the head phantom for the 5. 0 -cm thick tungsten filter is (16. 6 ¡À 1. 8) %, which agrees well with the MCNP simulation of the simplified BNCEFNT assembly, (16. 4 ¡À 0. 5) %. The error in the calculated dose enhancement only considers the statistical uncertainties. The total dose rate measured at 5. 0 -cm depth using the non-borated ion chamber is (0. 765 ¡À 0. 076) Gy/MU, about 61 % of the fast neutron standard dose rate (1. 255 Gy/MU) at 5. 0 -cm depth for the standard 10 x 10 cm 2 treatment beam. The increased doses to other organs due {{to the use of}} the BNCEFNT assembly were calculated using MCNP 5 and a MIRD phantom. Ph. D.

40|$|The use {{of boron}} neutron capture to boost tumor dose in fast neutron therapy has been {{investigated}} at several fast neutron therapy centers worldwide. This treatment is termed boron neutron capture enhanced fast neutron therapy (BNCEFNT). It {{is a combination of}} boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and fast neutron therapy (FNT). It is believed that BNCEFNT may be useful in the treatment of some radioresistant brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiform (GBM). A boron neutron capture enhanced fast neutron therapy assembly has been designed for the Fermilab Neutron Therapy Facility (NTF).
