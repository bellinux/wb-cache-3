40|$|The Dirac cone {{underlies}} many unique electronic {{properties of}} graphene 1 and topological insulators, and its band structure—two conical bands touching {{at a single}} point—has also been realized for photons in waveguide arrays, atoms in optical lattices, and through accidental degeneracy. Deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dirac cone often reveals intriguing properties; {{an example is the}} quantum Hall effect, where a constant magnetic field breaks the Dirac cone into isolated Landau levels. A seemingly unrelated phenomenon is the exceptional point also known as the parity–time symmetry breaking point where two resonances coincide in both their positions and widths. Exceptional points lead to counter-intuitive phenomena such as loss-induced transparency unidirectional transmission or reflection and lasers with reversed pump dependence or single-mode operation. Dirac cones and exceptional points are connected: it was theoretically suggested that certain non-Hermitian perturbations can deform a Dirac cone and spawn a ring of exceptional points.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a detailed}} investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fabrication, design, characterization, {{and understanding of}} physical principles of energy transduction in surface photonic crystals which are engineered for various applications. One-dimensional photonic crystals are engineered as optically tunable reflectance filters for ?? = 632. 8 nm wavelength light by incorporating azobenzene liquid crystal dye molecules into <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal</b> structure. Optical energy is transduced to accomplish mechanical work by exciting the dye molecules into different physical configurations, leading to changes in <b>the</b> optical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dye molecules, namely their refractive index. This mechanism is used to tune <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> resonance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal</b> filter. <b>The</b> spectral and temporal optical tuning response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal</b> filter due to excitation light at ?? = 532 nm is characterized. Modulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitted and reflected ?? = 632. 8 nm light is achieved at microsecond time response. Two-dimensional photonic crystals are also investigated as reflectance filters for ?? = 532 nm wavelength light. Both optically tunable and static reflectance filters are studied. Again, azobenzene liquid crystal molecules are incorporated into <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal</b> to achieve optical tuning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reflectance wavelength. In this case, the ?? = 532 nm wavelength light is used for self-modulation. That is, the light serves both to optically tune <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal</b> filter {{as well as to}} modulate its own reflection efficiency through <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal</b> filter. Moreover, stacking of multiple photonic crystals into a single filter is studied for both static and optically tunable photonic crystal filters. It is shown that this approach improves <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal</b> reflectance filter by increasing its optical density and its angular tolerance at <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> wavelength <b>of</b> ?? = 532 nm. Additionally, surface photonic crystals are fabricated which incorporate quantum dots as light emitters. Enhancement of optical down-conversion is iii demonstrated. The quantum dots absorb photons at one wavelength and emit photons at a longer wavelength. <b>The</b> photonic <b>crystal</b> is used to engineer the optical emission behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantum dots such that the energy conversion between absorbed and emitted photons is controlled. Enhanced excitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantum dots is achieved through resonant excitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantum with photonic crystal modes. Also, enhanced extraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emitted photons is achieved through modifying the allowed emitted optical modes provided by <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal.</b> Photons <b>of</b> certain wavelengths and propagation directions are more efficiently emitted through engineering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal.</b> Normal incident emission enhancement of 7. 7 x at ?? = 875 nm is obtained through the extraction effect.

40|$|A crystal is a {{periodic}} and repeating arrangement of atoms or molecules. Photonic crystals are structures with periodic {{variations in the}} dielectric constants that manipulate and control <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> light propagation. Photonic crystals are analogous to semiconductor crystals with periodic potentials {{that are responsible for}} the bandgaps for electrons and holes. For electrons and holes, the periodic potential effectively determines how the charged particles propagate through <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> under applied fields. Similarly, for photons in a photonic <b>crystal,</b> <b>the</b> periodic dielectric function can give rise to photon bandgaps that control <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> appropriate photons through <b>the</b> <b>crystal.</b> <b>The</b> most complicated and possibly the most interesting photonic crystals are three-dimensional repeating structures. The main experimental work for this dissertation concerns <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fabrication <b>of</b> three-dimensional photonic crystals using a novel interferometric lithography technique. The work also describes the experimental hardware and the appropriate mathematical models for interferometric lithography. vii Additional work concerns <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> band diagrams for three-dimensional photonic crystals using simulation and modeling. Experimental results for the transmission and <b>reflection</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystals</b> fabricated by interferometric lithography are presented and the results are compared to the simulated band diagram models. A new method for fabricating waveguides embedded in three-dimensional photonic crystals is also developed in this dissertation. This new approach to waveguide fabrication lends itself straightforwardly to mass manufacturing using standard semiconductor lithography equipment. This is in contrast to previously reported techniques that do not scale to high volume manufacturing. Photonic crystals with integrated waveguides are of particular significance due to <b>the</b> possibilities <b>of</b> guiding or confining light propagation in <b>the</b> photonic <b>crystal.</b> This is comparable to the way dopants in a semiconductor crystal can impact electronic propagation. Waveguides with photonic crystals can demonstrate non-linear optical behavior if <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> contains material that exhibits the optical Kerr effect or a nonlinear susceptibility χ(2). These non-linear photonic crystals can be used for optical computing applications. Using the novel approaches presented in this dissertation, in conjunction with additional extensions, it is possible to fabricate a wide variety of three-dimensional photonic crystals that exhibit a complete bandgap.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a mathematicalformalism describing diffraction effects from periodic and mixed-layer minerals {{in which the}} outer surface layers of crystals possibly differ from layers forming <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystals.</b> <b>The</b> X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns calculated for structure models of chlorite and irregular chlorite-smectites terminated on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystals</b> by either brucite-like sheets or 2 : 1 layers show the strong influence that different outer surface layers have on <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> basal <b>reflection</b> intensities. Simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental XRD patterns from two chlorite samples having different Fe contents shows that in these two samples <b>the</b> chlorite <b>crystals</b> were terminated by brucite-like sheets on both sides.
