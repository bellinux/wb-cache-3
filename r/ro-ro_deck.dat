5000|$|Esbern Snare {{is part of}} {{the first}} stage of a {{strategic}} realignment within the Royal Danish Navy, which is transitioning to focus on international operations, in which Absalon-class vessels will form the backbone. The ship is designed for command and support roles, with a large <b>ro-ro</b> <b>deck,</b> and is to be complemented by the [...] frigates, a derivative of the Absalon-class designed specifically for combat operations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of orthotropic plate bending theory to stiffened plating. Schadeâ€™s design charts for rectangular plates are extended to the case where the boundary contour is clamped, which is almost totally incomplete in the afore mentioned charts. A numerical solution for the clamped orthotropic plate equation is obtained. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is adopted, expressing the vertical displacement field by a double cosine trigonometric series, whose coefficients are determined by solving a linear equation system. Numerical results are proposed as design charts similar to those ones by Schade. In particular, each chart is relative {{to one of the}} non-dimensional coefficients identifying the plate response; each curve of any chart is relative to a given value of the torsional parameter, in a range comprised between 0 and 1, and is function of the virtual aspect ratio, comprised between 1 and 8, so that the asymptotic behaviour of the orthotropic plate for high values of the above mentioned parameter is clearly shown. Finally, some numerical applications relative to <b>ro-ro</b> <b>decks</b> are presented, in order to evaluate the accuracy and the capability of the proposed technique for stiffened deck analysis. Obtained results are examined in order to draw a usable procedure for dimensioning deck primary supporting members, taking into account the interaction of the two orthogonal beam sets...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} at the University of Strathclyde culminated {{in the development of}} a numerical procedure for assessing the damage survivability of damaged Ro-Ro vessels. Using this as a basis, new survival criteria have been proposed and submitted to IMO for consideration by the international shipping community. This paper presents the results of a fundamental study aimed at enhancing insight into one of the most dominant parameters affecting the survival of a Ro-Ro vessel, the water accumulation on the vehicle deck. The investigation represents an attempt to identify the most important contributing factors to the flooding process by performing a series of experiments using a scaled model of a typical Ro-Ro vessel. The matrix considered involves a range of ship design and environmental parameters in a number of simplified damage scenarios, building up to the more realistic damages in a way that allows for isolation of individual contributions to the water accumulation on the <b>Ro-Ro</b> <b>deck.</b> The results of the experiments, supplemented by and contrasted with results of numerical simulations, are presented and discussed, leading to recommendations for characterising the flooding process for general assessment of damage survivability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{practical}} method for estimating the weight of <b>ro-ro</b> <b>deck</b> structures. Preliminarily, the procedures for assessing the scantlings of platings, ordinary stiffeners and primary supporting members subjected to wheeled loads, are presented, in order {{to point out the}} parameters that influence the deck weight, such as ordinary stiffener spacing, transverse spacing, number of girders, web height of primary supporting members. The strength check of platings is rule based, while ordinary stiffeners are schematized as continuous beams; concerning the primary supporting members, instead, the direct scantling procedure, proposed in a previous paper, is adopted, schematizing the deck as an orthotropic plate with clamped boundary conditions in correspondence of the aft and fore bulkheads and the ship sides, in order {{to take into account the}} interaction of the two orthogonal beam sets. Some design charts are presented in order to determine the influence of the previously defined parameters on the deck weight or, similarly, on its equivalent thickness, spreading the stiffener and primary supporting member weight on the deck area. Finally, two numerical applications, relative to a Ro-ro PANAMAX ship, are presented, in order to evaluate the capability of the proposed technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{survivability}} of damaged {{ro-ro vessels}} is investigated by motion simulations in irregular seaways. The simulation combines nonlinear equations for roll and surge motions with a linear treatment of heave, pitch, sway, and yaw, using the strip method. The rate of inflow and outflow of water through the damage openings is estimated form {{the motions of}} the internal and the external water surface relative to the openings, so that the volume of water in each damaged compartment and on the vehicle deck is corrected at each time step. Special {{emphasis was placed on}} simulating realistically the motion of water on deck. For three ships, and with different subdivisions on the <b>ro-ro</b> <b>deck,</b> damage positions, trims and drafts, the limit between safe and unsafe damaged metacentric heights is determined by performing the simulation with different KG values. The simulation method was comprehensively validated by comparison with model tests. A series of parameter investigations was carried out, including damaged freeboard, damage location, vehicle deck subdivisions, sheer of vehicle deck, down-flooding, transient flooding, encounter angle of seaway and speed of ship, with the view to identifying the more significant parameters influencing the survivability of a damaged ro-ro ship.
