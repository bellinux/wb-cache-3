The model states that the <b>relative</b> potential <b>vorticity</b> of the forecast error is random.

The agreement between the stochastic model and actual mass-field forecast errors fields for 12 - 36 h periods validates the assumptions on which the model is derived.

To explain these changes, large-scale environmental variables which influence TC genesis and development such as sea surface temperatures (SSTs), relative humidity in mid-troposphere, vertical wind shear and lower tropospheric vorticity have been examined. In the South Indian Ocean, reduction of TC genesis {{in the western part of}} the basin and its increase in the eastern part as well as displacement of the area favourable for TC genesis further away from the equator during La Niña events compared to El Niño events can be explained by changes in geographical distribution of <b>relative</b> humidity and <b>vorticity</b> across the basin as primary contributors; positive anomalies of SSTs observed during La Niña seasons in the eastern part of the basin additionally contribute to enhanced cyclogenesis near the Western Australia.

The relaxation occurs at large but finite Reynolds numbers, and involves substantial decay of higher-order ideal invariants such as enstrophy. A two-fluid formulation, involving interpenetrating positive and negative vorticity fluxes (continuous and square integrable) is developed, and is shown to be intimately related to the passive scalar decay problem. Increasing interpenetration of the two fluids corresponds to the decay of vorticity flux due to viscosity.

40|$|Previous {{observation}} and model {{studies show that}} the upper-ocean stratification is enhanced under global warming (Capotondi et al.; Cravatte et al.; Deser et al., etc.). The response of the recirculation, which is associated with the western boundary current (WBC) jet extension and significantly increases its transport, to the intensified stratification, is studied in a two-layer quasigeostrophic ocean circulationmodel. It is found that the barotropic transport of the circulation first increases with stratification but then decreases as a result of saturation of the surface-layer circulation intensity when the stratification exceeds a threshold. PV budget analysis indicates that the saturation is caused by the increased intergyre transport of <b>relative</b> potential <b>vorticity</b> resulting from the intensified variability of the jet location. Both the barotropic instability and bi-furcation mechanisms contribute to the intensified variability of the jet location. Because of barotropic in-stability, eddies are generated in the confluence region of the WBCs and advected eastward, causing the variability of the jet location. With increased stratification, the surface-layer circulation is strengthened and the barotropic instability is intensified. As a result, the surface flow becomes more variable with excessive eddies and intense variability of the jet. With the increasing stratification, three regimes, each marked by its own variation of the jet location, emerge owing to the successive system bifurcations. In the last two regimes, variability of the jet location is further enhanced by frequent switches among the different dynamic states on multidecadal time scales. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} the dynamics of vortices in the easy plane insulating ferromagnet in two dimensions. In addition to the quasiparticle excitations, here spin waves or magnons, this magnetic system admits a family of vortex solutions carrying two topological invariants, the winding number or vorticity, and the polarization. A vortex is approximately described as a particle moving about the system, endowed with an effective mass and acted upon {{by a variety of}} forces. Classically, the vortex has an inter-vortex potential energy giving a Coulomb-like force (attractive or repulsive depending on the <b>relative</b> vortex <b>vorticity),</b> and a gyrotropic force, behaving as a self-induced Lorentz force, whose direction depends on both topological indices. Expanding semiclassically about a many-vortex solution, the vortices are quantized by considering the scattered magnon states, giving a zero point energy correction and a many-vortex mass tensor. The vortices cannot be described as independent particles [...] that is, there are off-diagonal mass terms, such as 1 / 2 Mij vi vj, that are non-negligible. This thesis examines the full vortex dynamics in further detail by evaluating the Feynman-Vernon influence functional, which describes the evolution of the vortex density matrix after the magnon modes have been traced out. In addition to the set of forces already known, we find new damping forces acting both longitudinally and transversely to the vortex motion. The vortex motion within a collective cannot be entirely separated: there are damping forces acting on one vortex due to the motion of another. The effective damping forces have memory effects: they depend not only on the current motion of the vortex collection but also on the motion history.

Three {{different types of}} k-means-based cluster methods are conducted. The explained cluster variance {{is used as a}} measure for the quality. Several variables of the 700 -hPa fields from the 40 -yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) were tested for the classification. The variables as well as the domain for the clustering are chosen in a way to explain the variability of the UHI as best as possible. It turned out that the combination of geopotential height, <b>relative</b> humidity, <b>vorticity,</b> and the 1000 – 700 -hPa thickness is best suited. To determine the optimal cluster number k several statistical measures are applied. Except for autumn (k = 12) an optimal cluster number of k = 7 is found. The WP frequency changes are analyzed using climate projections of two regional climate models (RCM). Both RCMs, the Regional Model (REMO) and Climate Limited-Area Model (CLM), are driven with the A 1 B simulations from the global climate model ECHAM 5.
