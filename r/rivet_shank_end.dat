Zn-Sn and Al plated rivets {{were used to}} join magnesium sheets by LSPR. Microstructure, surface topography and roughness of the rivet’s coatings were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and surface profilometry.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a study on full flute (extra-long tool) and ground <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> mill wear {{analysis}} by utilizing five-axis CNC to implement flank milling strategy on curved shape part. Five-axis machining eases the user to implement variations of strategy such as flank milling. Flank milling is different from point milling. Point milling cuts materials by using {{the tip of the}} tool whereas the flank milling uses the cutting tool body to cut material. The type of cutting tool used was end mill 10 mm diameter with High Speed Steel (HSS) material. One factor at a time was utilized to analyze the overall data. Feed rate and spindle speed were the two main factors that been set up equally for both full flute and ground <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> mill. At the end of this research, the qualitative analysis based on tool wear between full flute and ground <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> mill is observed. Generally, both types of cutting tools showed almost the same failure indication such as broken edge or chipped off edge, formation of pinned hole on the surface and serration formation or built-up edge (BUE) on the primary flute. However, the results obtained from the enlarged images which were captured by Optical Microscope indicated that, the ground <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> mill is better than the full flute end mill...|$|R

2500|$|Installer bits, {{also known}} as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits, are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through the hole and the bit pulled back out, pulling the wire with it. The wire can then be used to pull a cable or pipe back through the wall. This is especially helpful where the wall has a large cavity, where threading a fish tape could be difficult. Some installer bits have a transverse hole drilled at the <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> as well. Once a hole has been drilled, the wire can be threaded through the <b>shank</b> <b>end,</b> the bit released from the chuck, and all pulled forward through the drilled hole. These bits are made for cement, block and brick they are not for drilling into wood. Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York was issued [...] for this invention on January 25, 1898.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation {{presented in this paper}} was to identify and rank in terms of damage, fatigue-critical locations on a typical riveted stringer-to-cross-girder connection used in railway bridges using the finite element method. The results were derived in the form of Miner’s damage under the passage of a typical freight train. Through this ranking and by considering different damage scenarios, including rivet defects, loss of clamping force in a rivet and loss of a rivet, {{it was found that the}} most damaging effect was caused by the presence of clearance between the <b>rivet</b> <b>shank</b> and the hole or by the loss of a rivet. The damage at the angle-fillet and the rivets connecting the angle to the stringer web was found not to be affected considerably by rivet defects.

The effect of the manner of hole preparation was not considered in this investigation...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue tests {{carried out}} on three {{configurations}} (unexpanded, cold expanded and riveted) of fiber metal laminate material clearly demonstrated the beneficial effect of riveting compared to cold expansion in zero load transfer joints, for an approximately equivalent level of interference. Digital image correlation {{was used to measure}} the in-plane surface strain on cold expanded and riveted coupons during fatigue loading, and for the first time, digital image correlation was combined with pressure sensitive films to measure the strains resulting from the application of the rivet, including those under the rivet head. A comparison of the resultant strain field showed that the application of a rivet significantly reduces the stress concentration at the central hole and is effective in extending fatigue life. Some rivet heads were removed by milling, and the results from subsequent fatigue tests were used together with closed-form calculations to explain the findings of this study. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of riveting was less as a result of interference hole filling {{on the part of the}} <b>rivet</b> <b>shank,</b> but more a combination of the effect of interference and compression through the joint thickness.

40|$|Past {{experience}} {{has shown that}} stringer-to-cross-girder connections in riveted railway bridges are susceptible to fatigue cracking. This fatigue damage is caused by secondary stresses, which develop in the different components of the connection. For this reason, more detailed analysis techniques are needed to capture this type of behaviour. In this paper, a finite element (FE) model of a typical riveted railway bridge is developed by incorporating the detailed local geometry of a stringer-to-cross-girder connection into the global bridge model. Before {{the development of this}} model, benchmark FE studies are carried out on a double-lap joint and the results are presented in terms of stress concentration factors and stress gradients. Further verification studies are carried out on a local bridge connection FE model, in terms of its rotational stiffness. After this investigation, a refined FE model of the bridge is analysed under the passage of a freight train. Principal stress histories at different components of the connection are obtained, which are then combined with the plain material S–N curve, in order to identify the most fatigue-critical locations of the connection. These are identified as being the rivet holes and, in some cases, the angle fillet. By considering different rivet clamping stresses and different rivet defect scenarios it is found that the most damaging effects are caused by the presence of clearance between the <b>rivet</b> <b>shank</b> and the hole, and the loss of a rivet.

The present work shows that the detectable flaw size for cracks originating at rivets can be greatly improved upon from that of isolated flaws. The use of a rotating probe method combined with spatial filtering {{has been used to}} detect 0. 18 cm EDM notches, as measured from the <b>rivet</b> <b>shank,</b> with a 1. 27 cm diameter probe and to detect flaws buried under the rivet head, down to a length of 0. 076 cm, using a 0. 32 cm diameter probe.

40|$|The {{riveting}} process {{with a solid}} rivet {{is one of the}} most applied joining processes in the aeronautic industry. New materials and new design requirements constitute challenges that drive the users to a better understanding of the installation process of riveted joints. Therefore, this study aims with the aid of FEM simulation to understand the phenomena occurring during the installation process and afterwards to predict the mechanical properties of the riveted joint depending on the installation parameters and characteristics of the adherends. The experimental installation process for the validation of the simulation model takes place in a fully automated C-frame riveting machine with all-electric drilling and riveting operations aptitude and continuous collection of process data. This paper deals with the simulation of the installation process. The simulation model consists of a solid rivet with universal head described by the standard EN 6081 and aluminum (2024 T 351) ad herends. The rivet material model has been obtained by a compression test performed on specimens prepared from fasteners. The effect of friction was studied and a suitable friction coefficient identified. The developed installati onprocess model has been validated by comparing the simulation results with different experiments regarding the geometrical characteristics of the formed rivet head, the force-displacement curves and the surface residual strain of one adherend. Afterwards, the clearance fit between the <b>rivet</b> <b>shank</b> and the borehole, the rivet grip, and the squeeze force have been numerically studied in order to determine their effect on the joint.

40|$|Self-advancing tool bits {{that are}} hybrids of drills and stepped taps make it {{possible}} to form threaded holes wider than about 1 / 2 in. (about 13 mm) without applying any more axial force than is necessary for forming narrower pilot holes. These self-advancing stepped-tap drills were invented for use by space-suited astronauts performing repairs on reinforced carbon/carbon space-shuttle leading edges during space walks, in which the ability to apply axial drilling forces is severely limited. Self-advancing stepped-tap drills could also be used on Earth for making wide holes without applying large axial forces. A self-advancing stepped-tap drill (see figure) includes several sections having progressively larger diameters, typically in increments between 0. 030 and 0. 060 in. (between about 0. 8 and about 1. 5 mm). The tip section, which is the narrowest, is a pilot drill bit that typically has a diameter between 1 / 8 and 3 / 16 in. (between about 3. 2 and about 4. 8 mm). The length of the pilot-drill section is chosen, according to the thickness of the object to be drilled and tapped, so that the pilot hole is completed before engagement of the first tap section. Provided that the cutting-edge geometry of the drill bit is optimized for the material to be drilled, only a relatively small axial force [typically of the order of a few pounds (of the order of 10 newtons) ] must be applied during drilling of the pilot hole. Once the first tap section engages the pilot hole, it is no longer necessary for the drill operator to apply axial force: the thread engagement between the tap and the workpiece provides the axial force to advance the tool bit. Like the pilot-drill section, each tap section must be long enough to complete its hole before engagement of the next, slightly wider tap section. The precise values of the increments in diameter, the thread pitch, the rake angle of the tap cutting edge, and other geometric parameters of the tap sections must be chosen, in consideration of the workpiece material and thickness, to prevent stripping of threads during the drilling/tapping operation. A stop-lip or shoulder at the <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> of the widest tap section prevents further passage of the tool bit through the hole...|$|R

40|$|Riveting is a {{commonly}} used (especially in aircraft structures) method of joining metal and composite components. The methods of forming solid <b>shank</b> <b>rivets</b> {{can be classified}} in two types: static and dynamic. The static method is the most efficient one. Regrettably, its application is limited. A popular upsetting tool used in an aircraft is a pneumatic riveter. The rivet driving requires a few hammer strokes. The total stress in a riveted joint depends on the residual and applied stress. Residual post-riveting stress fields are widely accepted to have a beneficial influence on the fatigue life of aircraft structures. The analysis is carried out for a solid mushroom rivet (made of PA 25 alloy) joining two sheets (made of 2024 T 3 alloy). Nonlinear dynamic simulations of the upsetting process are carried out. Simulation of the riveting process is significantly influenced by a material model. The numerical calculations are performed for three different cases of upsetting described by the formed rivet head diameters 1. 4 d, 1. 5 d and 1. 6 d, respectively. The rivet head diameter and, consequently, the residual stress state depend on hammer stroke energy.
