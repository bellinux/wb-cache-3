40|$|Each {{time you}} cite or refer to someone else’s {{work in your}} paper you must {{identify}} the source with a <b>reference</b> <b>number.</b> These numbers appear in the reference list consecutively {{in the same order}} in which they appear in the text. Once a source has been cited, the same number is used in all subsequent references. No distinction is made between print and electronic references when citing within the text. Element The <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> appears in superscript after the full stop if it {{is at the end of}} a sentence, or after a comma if it is in the middle of a sentence. If you are citing the same source again, use the same <b>reference</b> <b>number.</b> If you have written about someone else’s ideas, you must use a <b>reference</b> <b>number,</b> even if you haven’t mentioned that person in your paper. Put the <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> after the relevant sentence or paragraph and cite their details in your reference list. When multiple references are cited at a given place in the text, use a hyphen to join the first and last numbers that are inclusive. Use commas (without spaces) to separate non‐sequential numbers. Use both commas and a hyphen for inclusive and non‐sequential references. If your lecturer asks you to add page <b>numbers</b> after the <b>reference</b> <b>number,</b> put the page number in brackets after the <b>reference</b> <b>number...</b>|$|R

Typhus and starvation related diseases were the major causes of mortality inside the camps (Giusti, 2003). Brutality from the Soviet troops and partisans to unarmed prisoners was reported, but survivors testified also to episodes of comradeship among {{soldiers of the}} two opposing nations, especially {{on the front line}} (Rigoni Stern, 1965) and, compassion from the Russian civilians (Vio, 2004).|$|E
25|$|Cups give a hemi-spherical {{shape to}} breasts and underwires give shape to cups. So the {{curvature}} {{radius of the}} underwire is the key parameter to determine volume and weight of the breast. The same underwires are used for the cups of sizes 36A, 34B, 32C, 30D etc.... so those cups have the same volume. The <b>reference</b> <b>numbers</b> of underwire sizes {{are based on a}} B cup bra, for example underwire size 32 is for 32B cup (and 34A, 30C...). An underwire size 30 width has a curvature diameter of 3-inch 5/6 ≈ 9.7cm and this diameter increases by ⅓ inch ≈ 0.847cm by size. The table below shows volume calculations for some cups that {{can be found in a}} ready-to-wear large size shop.|$|E

2500|$|In this letter, Eusebius {{explains}} his ingenious system of Gospel harmony, the Eusebian Canons (tables) that divide the four Canonical gospels, and describes their purpose, ten in number. Eusebius explains that Ammonius the Alexandrian {{had made a}} system in which he placed sections of the gospels of Marc, Luke and John next to their parallel sections in Matthew. As this disrupted the normal text order of the gospels of Marc, Luke and John, Eusebius used {{a system in which}} he placed the references to the parallel texts in ten tables or 'canons'. By using these tables, the parallel texts could easily be looked up, but it also remained possible to read a gospel in its normal order. (The number of sections was: Matthew 355, Mark 236, Luke 342, John 232 – together 1165 sections). The number of each [...] "Ammonian section" [...] is written in the margin of a manuscript, and underneath these numbers, another number was written in coloured ink. The coloured numbers referred to one of the ten Eusebian canons, in which the <b>reference</b> <b>numbers</b> were to be found of the parallel sections in the other gospels.|$|E

60|$|Plate 14, Fig. 21 {{contains}} rather {{less than}} a quarter of each of eight pairs that were published in the Phil. Trans. memoir above alluded to. They were there enlarged photographically to twice their natural size, which was hardly enough, as it did not allow sufficient space for inserting the necessary <b>reference</b> <b>numbers.</b> Consequently they have been again considerably enlarged, so much so that it is impossible to put more than a portion of each on the page. However, what is given suffices. The omitted portions may be studied in the memoir. The cases of ~1~ and ~2~ are prints of different fingers of the same individual, first as a child 8 years old, and then as a boy of 17. They have been enlarged on the same scale but not to the same size; so the print of the child includes a larger proportion of the original impression than that of the boy. It is therefore only a part of the child's print which is comparable with that of the boy. The remaining six cases refer to four different men, belonging to three quite different families, although their surnames happen to have the same initial, H. They were adults when the first print was made, and from 26 to 31 years older on the second occasion. There is an exact agreement throughout between the two members of each of the eight several couplets.|$|E
