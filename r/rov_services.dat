40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial {{economics}} *KAR OK KONF juni 2016 *Oceaneering AS (OAS) {{is one of}} the world’s largest <b>ROV</b> <b>service</b> {{suppliers and}} a front runner within the subsea inspection and intervention field. OAS acquired a new company called AGR Field Operations late 2011 to increase their inspection capabilities. AGR Field Operations were incorporated as Oceaneering Asset Integrity AS (OAI). OAI want to invest in a new custom tensile test machine (TTM). The TTM will be unveiled at the grand opening of the new OAS facilities on Forus, Stavanger (December 2014). OAI invited four local TTM suppliers to compete for the contract in the end of 2013. The main requirements were a TTM with; 750 T rating, an internal test length of 15 meters and an internal test diameter of 1. 5 meters. The proposed concepts did not satisfy OAI. OAI decided to hold off on the contract award decision, based on TTM functionality and price. This masters’ thesis was established to develop a concept which should compete alongside with the supplier concepts. The tender process deadline for submitting a concept was mid February (2014). The master thesis concept was submitted within the date set forth by OAI. The thesis concept was the one selected; OAI concluded that the new developments provided an edge compared to existing designs whilst satisfying OAI needs. The original scope of the thesis was to design and perform finite element analysis (FEA) on the three main functions in the TTM. The main functions are; the structure and the two opposing modules inside which transfer load to the tested item. The structure itself is called the main frame and the internal function which applies the load to the tested item is called a force module. The third function scoped by the thesis is the test item restraint function, called a tailstock module. A detailed design was made for all three functions, combined with designs of other supplementary functions. The FEA analysis revealed satisfactory results and gave an insight in how the internal components interact during loading. The overall design process has been extensive. Over a 100 3 D components was designed during the thesis period. The designed components and functions are a combination of existing design and new development. The designed functions are products of research and functional analysis. The main focus was to generate a design which facilitates testing of the most frequently tested items, identified during the thesis process. The thesis design process ended in June 2014, followed by a thorough design review. The review concluded that the design of the TTM main functions covered the requirements listed in the invitation to tender (ITT), and additional requirements added during the thesis process. Budget estimates indicate a total price of 4. 5 million NOK for the thesis TTM, while the preferred supplier concept had a fixed price of 6. 2 million NOK. The TTM project will be given additional resources to finish the detail design within the end of July. The drafting and production process will be initiated when the final design is definite. The overall thesis output was classified as a success and OAI want the thesis writer (Torleif Carlsen) to be the technical project manager {{for the remainder of the}} project. The established design and the calculations presented through the thesis is constructed by the thesis writer, with guidance from; OAS, OAI and UIS...|$|R
40|$|Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 327 (summer 2010) was {{designed}} to resolve the nature of fluid-rock interactions in young, upper volcanic crust on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Expedition 327 drilled, cased and cored two new basement holes, conducted hydrogeologic experiments, and installed subseafloor borehole observatories (Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kits, CORKs). These CORKs were intended to allow borehole conditions to recover to a more natural state after the dissipation of disturbances caused by drilling, casing, and other operations; provide a long-term monitoring and sampling presence for determining fluid pressure, temperature, composition, and microbiology; and facilitate the completion of active experiments to resolve crustal hydrogeologic conditions and processes. Expedition 327 was followed (summer 2011) by R/V Atlantis Expedition AT 18 - 07, with the remotely-operated vehicle (<b>ROV)</b> Jason, to <b>service</b> these CORKs, collect subseafloor pressure data, recover and deploy autonomous fluid and microbial samplers, collect large volumes of borehole fluids, and initiate a cross-hole hydrogeologic experiment using an electromagnetic flow meter. In addition, Atlantis Expedition AT 18 - 07 refurbished an old CORK {{that could not be}} replaced during IODP Expedition 327, completing a critical part of the three-dimensional observation network that is currently being used to monitor a large-scale, directional formation response to long-term fluid flow from the crust. doi: 10. 2204 /iodp. sd. 13. 01. 2011 </a...|$|R
