40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of vitamin B 6 deficiency on antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid profile in rats with exercise-induced oxidative stress. Forty eight rats were fed either a vitamin B 6 deficient diet (B 6 -) or a control diet (control) for 4 weeks and then subdivided into 3 groups: pre-exercise (PreE); post-exercise (PostE); recess after exercise (<b>recessE).</b> Compared to those of control group, plasma catalase and hepatic cytosol superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1. 15. 1. 1) activities of B 6 - group were lower regardless of exercise. The ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) of B 6 - group was lower in PreE {{and there was no}} difference between PostE and <b>recessE.</b> The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) of B 6 - was significantly higher in PreE and PostE. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) level of B 6 - group was lower regardless of exercise. Atherosclerotic index of B 6 - group was higher in PreE and {{there was no difference between}} PostE and <b>recessE.</b> It is suggested that a reduction in antioxidative status caused by vitamin B 6 deficiency may be aggravated under exercise-induced oxidative stress...|$|E
40|$|I {{welcome the}} {{opportunity}} to speak to my colleagues and friends on the research I wish to undertake during my next years here at the University of Auckland. This is my third Inaugural lecture since I became a Professor 15 years ago, hence I have learnt {{to take this opportunity}} seriously and cast a vision, as there are so few opportunities to talk to colleagues one’s own esoterica and passions. Maybe it is that I just need {{to do the same thing}} three times to at least say something, and I know my family has therefore renamed these my ‘Ignorable Lectures’. I do know that the fact most remembered from my first was that it was the first time that the chair Michael Scriven and the presenter presented an Inaugural and both did not wear ties. The fact from the second in North Carolina was that it was scheduled at the same time as the Simpson jury read its verdict. We know that students in lectures learn most in the first 8 minutes, only recall three things at most after one hour, and that if the content does not shake their prior beliefs they file away the fascinating facts in the deepest <b>recesse...</b>|$|E
