40|$|This thesis {{considers}} metrological {{application of}} spectrophotometric measurements in characterization of optical thin-film coatings, diffuse <b>reflectance</b> <b>standards,</b> and filter-radiometer components. For the optical metrology of thin films, various systematic {{errors in the}} measurements were studied {{in order to understand}} their effect on the determined optical parameters of thin films. The analysis was done based on computer simulations. Experimental results for several coated samples are also presented. The results demonstrate the importance of accurate spectrophotometric measurements for reliable characterization of thin films. It is shown that when the characterization is done based on measurements at oblique angles of incidence, significant errors may be introduced due to certain systematic effects. Thus the use of ordinary commercial spectrophotometers may restrict the accuracy of the characterization. The experimental data obtained with the high-accuracy spectrophotometer at HUT demonstrates consistency among the derived thin-film parameters at both normal and oblique angles of incidence. For the calibration of diffuse <b>reflectance</b> <b>standards,</b> a gonioreflectometer-based absolute scale of spectral diffuse reflectance has been established at HUT and is presented in the thesis. The newly established absolute scale of spectral diffuse reflectance is at the present moment the second in the world, where the hemispherical reflectance factors are derived without the use of integrating spheres. The gonioreflectometer setup, measurement and characterization procedures, as well as uncertainty analysis and results of test measurements are summarized in the thesis. For the characterization of filter radiometers (FRs), which is needed for the realization of the primary spectral irradiance scale at HUT, the thesis includes a comprehensive overview of the developed measurement methods, modeling and rigorous uncertainty-analysis procedures. An intercomparison of the characterization techniques in the UV spectral region adopted at HUT and at several other National Metrology Institutes is also presented. For the first time, effects of correlations in the FR signals originating through the characterization of the FRs were studied. This has led to a method of optimizing the selection of FR wavelengths and a practical range of uncertainties in the case of correlations in input parameters. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) is an Earth-observing sensor, which {{provides}} global retrievals of aerosols, clouds, and land surface parameters. Instrument specifications require an accurate absolute calibration, {{as well as}} accurate camera-to-camera, band-to-band and pixel-to-pixel relative response determinations. In order to achieve these requirements, MISR makes use of an on-board calibrator (OBC), as well as vicarious calibration (VC) experiments. The OBC makes use of two Spectralon diffuse panels {{in order to provide}} a flatfield illumination. Bi-monthly deployments of these panels into the camera fields-of-view will be made. At these times, solar-reflected radiance values are measured by photodiode detector standards. Accurate relative bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data are required to transfer these photodiode-measured radiances into camera-incident values. An independent calibration pathway, known as VC, will also be implemented in order to reduce systematic errors and to provide a crosscheck on the OBC findings.

Each MODIS instrument has 20 reflective solar bands (RSBs) and 16 thermal emissive bands (TEBs). MODIS RSB on-orbit calibration is reflectance based using an on-board solar diffuser (SD). The SD bi-directional reflectance factors (BRFs) were characterized pre-launch using reference diffuser samples, which are traceable to NIST <b>reflectance</b> <b>standards.</b> The SD BRF on-orbit degradation (or change) is tracked by another onboard device, called the solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM). The SDSM is operated during each scheduled SD calibration event, making alternate observations of direct sunlight and the diffusely reflected sunlight from the SD. The time series of the ratios of SDSM's SD view to its Sun view provide SD degradation information. This paper presents and compares the Terra and Aqua MODIS SD on-orbit performance. Results show that the SD on-orbit degradation depends {{on the amount of}} solar exposure of the SD plate. In addition, it is strongly wavelengthdependent, with a larger degradation rate at shorter wavelengths. For Terra MODIS, an SD door anomaly occurred in May 2003 that led to a decision to fix the door permanently at an "open" position. Since then, the SD degradation rate has significantly increased due to more frequent solar exposure. As expected, the SD on-orbit performance directly impacts the RSB calibration performance.
