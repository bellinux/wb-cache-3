Dielectric and magnetic materials are ubiquitous. Their linear electromagnetic response properties are characterized by permittivity and permeability dyadics which depend on the frequency of excitation and comprise complex–valued scalar components. The permittivity and the permeability dyadics (i. e., second–order tensors) of an isotropic material reduce to complex–valued scalars. The real parts of these scalars can be negative or positive, but the latter possibility is the normative one of the two, as the perusal of almost any undergraduate electromagnetics textbook will show. However, the former possibility does exist for natural materi...|$|R

Salient properties of these guided modes are studied in terms of how these materials and their parameters are chosen to be paired, and are then compared and contrasted with those of the guided modes in conventional waveguides. Special features such as monomodality in thick waveguides and presence of TE modes with no-cutoff thickness in thin parallel-plate waveguides are highlighted and discussed.

However, conventional metals as plasmonic elements in the near-infrared (NIR) and visible spectral ranges suffer from problems such as large losses and incompatibility with semiconductor technology. Replacing metals with semiconductors can alleviate these problems if only semiconductors could exhibit negative <b>real</b> <b>permittivity.</b> Aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) is a low loss semiconductor that can show negative <b>real</b> <b>permittivity</b> in the NIR. A comparative assessment of AZO-based plasmonic devices such as superlens and hyperlens with their metal-based counterparts shows that AZO-based devices significantly outperform at a wavelength of 1. 55 um.

We perform this analysis on structures composed of periodic arrangements of wires, split ring resonators (SRRs) and both wires and SRRs. We find the recovered frequency-dependent permittivity and permeability are entirely consistent with analytic expressions predicted by effective medium arguments. Of particular relevance are that a wire medium exhibits a frequency region in which the <b>real</b> part of <b>permittivity</b> is negative, and SRRs produce a frequency region in which the real part of permeability is negative.

40|$|Recent {{metamaterial}} (MM) research faces {{several problems}} when using metal-based plasmonic components as {{building blocks for}} MMs. The use of conventional metals for MMs is limited by several factors: metals such as gold and silver have high losses in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) ranges and very large negative <b>real</b> <b>permittivity</b> values, and in addition, their optical properties cannot be tuned. These issues that put severe constraints on the device applications of MMs could be overcome if semiconductors are used as plasmonic materials instead of metals. Heavily doped, wide bandgap oxide semiconductors could exhibit both a small negative <b>real</b> <b>permittivity</b> and relatively small losses in the NIR. Heavily doped oxides of zinc and indium were already reported to be good, low loss alternatives to metals in the NIR range. Here, we consider these transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) as alternative plasmonic materials for many specific applications ranging from surface-plasmon-polariton waveguides to MMs with hyperbolic dispersion and epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. We show that TCOs outperform conventional metals for ENZ and other MM-applications in the NIR. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
