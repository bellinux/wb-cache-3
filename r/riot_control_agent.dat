500|$|CS gas {{was used}} {{extensively}} in the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland during the [...] "Battle of the Bogside", a two-day riot in August 1969. A total of 1,091 canisters containing 12.5g of CS each, and 14 canisters containing 50g of CS each, were released in the densely populated residential area. On 30 August the Himsworth Inquiry {{was set up to}} investigate the medical effects of its use in Derry. Its conclusions, viewed in the political context of the time, still pointed towards the necessity of further testing of CS gas before being used as a <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent.</b> During the rioting in Belfast, the following year, known as the Falls Curfew, the Army fired up to 1,600 canisters into the densely populated Falls Road area. It was also used in Lenadoon on 9 July 1972 on the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire. Not long after, the British Army and RUC ceased using CS in Northern Ireland.|$|E
500|$|The {{compound}} 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile (also called o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile; chemical formula: C10H5ClN2), a cyanocarbon, is {{the defining}} {{component of a}} tear gas {{commonly referred to as}} CS gas, which is used as a <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent.</b> [...] Exposure causes a burning sensation and tearing of the eyes {{to the extent that the}} subject cannot keep their eyes open, and a burning irritation of the nose, mouth and throat mucous membranes causing profuse coughing, mucous nasal discharge, disorientation, and difficulty breathing, partially incapacitating the subject. [...] CS gas is an aerosol of a volatile solvent (a substance that dissolves other active substances and that easily evaporates) and 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, which is a solid compound at room temperature. CS gas is generally accepted as being non-lethal. It was first synthesized by two Americans, Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton, at Middlebury College in 1928, and the chemical's name is derived from the first letters of the scientists' surnames.|$|E

40|$|<b>Riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> and {{expanding}} bullets {{are the only}} two kinds of weapon and ammunition that are used for law enforcement purposes but are explicitly prohibited in the conduct of hostilities. This article justifies this difference in treatment with two arguments. First, <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> {{and expanding}} bullets have different effects on the human body depending on their specific types and the circumstances in which they are deployed. Second, the issues raised by their use differ according to whether they are employed for law enforcement purposes or in the conduct of hostilities. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|Phenacyl {{chloride}} is a substituted acetophenone. It is {{a useful}} building block in organic chemistry. Apart from that, it has been historically used as a <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent,</b> where it is designated CN. It {{should not be confused}} with cyanide, another agent used in chemical warfare, which has the chemical structure CN−.|$|E
50|$|It {{was used}} in World War I as a {{chemical}} weapon, called BA by British and B-Stoff (white cross) by Germans. Due to its toxicity, it is obsolete as a <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> and is not used anymore. Bromoacetone is a versatile reagent in organic synthesis. It is, for example, the precursor to hydroxyacetone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> (sometimes called RCAs) are {{non-lethal}} lachrymatory <b>agents</b> {{used for}} <b>riot</b> <b>control.</b> Most commonly used <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> are pepper spray and {{various kinds of}} tear gas. These chemicals disperse a crowd that could be protesting or rioting, or to clear a building. They can rapidly produce sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which usually disappear within 15 minutes (for tear gas) and up to 2 hours (for pepper spray) following termination of exposure. They {{can also be used}} for chemical warfare defense training, although their use in warfare itself is a violation of Article I.5 of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Article II.9 of the CWC specifically authorizes their use for civilian law enforcement.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for chemical weapons {{to be used}} in terrorism is a real possibility. Classes of chemical weapons include nerve agents, vesicants (blister agents), choking <b>agents,</b> incapacitating <b>agents,</b> <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents,</b> blood agents, and toxic industrial chemicals. The nerve agents work by blocking the actions of acetylcholinesterase leading to a cholinergic syndrome. Nerve agents include sarin, tabun, VX, cyclosarin, and soman. The vesicants include sulfur mustard and lewisite. The vesicants produce blisters and also damage the upper airways. Choking agents include phosgene and chlorine gas. Choking agents cause pulmonary edema. Incapacitating agents include fentanyl and its derivatives and adamsite. <b>Riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> include Mace and pepper spray. Blood agents include cyanide. The mechanism of toxicity for cyanide is blocking oxidative phosphorylation. Toxic industrial chemicals include agents such as formaldehyde, hydrofluoric acid, and ammonia...|$|R

50|$|Older {{cartridges}} {{designed specifically}} for the M79 grenade launcher or the AN/M8 pyrotechnic pistol also remain in inventory. The XM674/M674 is a CS <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> cartridge. The unit contains 90-100 grams of CS mixture, with a 2-7 ignition delay and burn time of 10 to 40 seconds. The round is effective to a distance of 65 to 90 meters. It can also be hand fired.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{it might}} be {{necessary}} to neutralize them chemically, as with ammonia as a neutralizer for hydrogen cyanide or chlorine. <b>Riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> such as CS will dissipate in an open area, but things contaminated with CS powder need to be aired out, washed by people wearing protective gear, or safely discarded.|$|R

5000|$|CR gas or dibenzoxazepine (also {{referred}} to as DBO), or its chemical name dibenzb,f1,4oxazepine, is an incapacitating agent and a lachrymatory agent. CR {{was developed by the}} British Ministry of Defence as a <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A report from the Porton Down laboratories described exposure as [...] "like being thrown blindfolded into a bed of stinging nettles", and it earned the nickname [...] "firegas".|$|E
50|$|In World War I, {{ethyl bromoacetate}} {{was used as}} a lachrymatory agent and tear gas agent for {{chemical}} warfare under the German code Weisskreuz (White Cross), and later as odorant or warning agent in odorless, toxic gases. It is listed by the World Health Organization as a <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent,</b> and was first employed for that purpose by French police in 1912. The French may have employed gas grenades of this substance in 1914 during World War I. The German army then used this attack to justify their subsequent employment of chemical weapons in 1915.|$|E

40|$|The Baltimore SunThe United States is {{conducting}} what President Bush has {{described as a}} preventive war to eliminate Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs. Statements by senior administration officials indicate that the United States may use chemical weapons of its own - so-called "nonlethal" <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> - against Iraqi troops if, for example, those troops use Iraqi civilians as human shields. Such actions are unlikely to protect innocent Iraqis from harm. They could also increase the risk to U. S. troops while violating {{one of the key}} disarmament agreements that U.

50|$|A recent {{addition}} to the class of riot guns is the pepper ball gun, an example {{of which is the}} FN 303. This is essentially a paintball marker, either purpose built for riot control, or modified from a commercial paintball marker. The pepper ball guns use special pepper spray ammunition based on paintball technology, consisting of a gelatin capsule filled with the <b>riot</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent.</b> The guns use compressed gas and provide semiautomatic fire, and the pepperballs act just like paintballs, fracturing on impact and splattering the chemical agent on impact. These can be used for direct fire, to break the balls on the target, or indirect fire, breaking near the target and spraying the agent into the target's vicinity.|$|E
