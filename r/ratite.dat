5|$|Plural: sterna. The {{breastbone}} of a bird. There are two types: i) carinate sterna—appearing in flighted birds, {{in which}} the ventral surface is keel-shaped, which provides ample surface area for attachment of wing muscles used for flight; and ii) <b>ratite</b> sterna—appearing in flightless birds, such as rhea, {{in which the}} ventral surface is flattened.|$|E
5|$|The emu {{was long}} classified, with its closest {{relatives}} the cassowaries, {{in the family}} Casuariidae, part of the <b>ratite</b> order Struthioniformes. However, an alternate classification was proposed in 2014 by Mitchell et al., based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA. This splits off the Casuariidae into their own order, the Casuariformes, and includes only the cassowaries in the family Casuariidae, placing the emus in their own family, Dromaiidae. The cladogram shown below is from their study.|$|E
5|$|The emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is {{the second-largest}} living bird by height, after its <b>ratite</b> relative, the ostrich. It is endemic to Australia {{where it is}} the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. The emu's range covers most of {{mainland}} Australia, but the Tasmanian emu and King Island emu subspecies became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788. The bird is sufficiently common for it to be rated as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E

5|$|This large kiwi {{is one of}} five {{species of}} kiwis {{residing}} in New Zealand. The other four are the tokoeka (Apteryx australis), Okarito brown kiwi (Apteryx rowi), little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii), and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli). Great spotted kiwis are related most closely to the little spotted kiwi. The kiwi genus, Apteryx, is endemic to New Zealand, 44% of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic. Kiwis are placed in the <b>ratite</b> family, which also includes the emu, ostrich, rhea, and cassowary. All ratites are flightless. Kiwi are closely related to the extinct moa bird that once inhabited New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Most paleontologists regard birds as {{the only}} {{surviving}} dinosaurs (see Origin of birds). It is thought that all non-avian theropods became extinct, including then-flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and hesperornithiforms. Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K–Pg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and <b>ratite</b> bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs. Large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K–Pg boundary. The absence of these birds in the Paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there. A {{small fraction of the}} Cretaceous bird species survived the impact, giving rise to today's birds. The only bird group known for certain to have survived the K–Pg boundary is the Aves. Avians may have been able to survive the extinction {{as a result of their}} abilities to dive, swim, or seek shelter in water and marshlands. Many species of avians can build burrows, or nest in tree holes or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–Pg boundary. Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E

25|$|The tinamou {{family has}} been shown to be monophyletic. Phylogenomic studies have placed it as the sister group to Australasian and Oceanian ratites (i.e. the cassowaries, emus, and kiwis), thus {{locating}} it well within the <b>ratite</b> phylogenetic tree, with the South American rheas and African ostriches as successive outgroups. Research published starting in 2010 has found that tinamous are the sister group to the extinct moa of New Zealand; moa are more distantly related to emus and cassowaries than had been thought previously. These findings imply that evolution of flightlessness occurred independently multiple times in <b>ratite</b> evolution.|$|E

25|$|The common ostrich {{belongs to}} the <b>ratite</b> order Struthioniformes. Other members include rheas, emus, cassowaries, moa, kiwi and the largest known bird ever, the now-extinct {{elephant}} bird (Aepyornis). However, the classification of the ratites as a single order has always been questioned, with the alternative classification restricting the Struthioniformes to the ostrich lineage and elevating the other groups.|$|E
25|$|The little spotted kiwi is a <b>ratite</b> and {{belongs to}} the Apterygiormes Order, and the Apterygidae Family. Their {{binomial}} name Apteryx owenii breaks down to without wings and owenii which is named after Sir Richard Owen. Today, only the nominate subspecies A. o. owenii exists. The little-known North Island little spotted kiwi, A. o. iredalei, from the North Island became extinct in the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory is}} that the extinction was a secondary effect of human impact resulting from transfer of hyperdiseases from human commensals such as chickens and guineafowl. The bones of these domesticated fowl have been found in subfossil sites in the island (MacPhee and Marx, 1997: 188), such as Ambolisatra (Madagascar), where Mullerornis sp. and Aepyornis maximus have been reported. Also reported by these authors, <b>ratite</b> remains have been found in west and south west Madagascar, at Belo-sur-Mer (A. medius, Mullerornis rudis), Bemafandry (M. agilis) and Lamboharana (Mullerornis sp.).|$|E

25|$|More recently, it {{has been}} deduced from DNA {{sequence}} comparisons that the closest living relatives of elephant birds are New Zealand kiwis. Elephant birds are actually part of the mid-Cenozoic Australian <b>ratite</b> radiation; their ancestors flew across the Indian Ocean well after Gondwana broke apart. The existence of possible flying palaeognaths in the Miocene such as Proapteryx further supports the view that ratites did not diversify in response to vicariance. Gondwana broke apart in the Cretaceous and their phylogenetic tree does not match the process of continental drift.|$|E
25|$|Moa {{belong to}} the order Dinornithiformes, {{traditionally}} placed in the <b>ratite</b> group. However, their closest relatives have been found by genetic studies to be the flighted South American tinamous, once {{considered to be a}} sister group to ratites. The nine species of moa were the only wingless birds lacking even the vestigial wings which all other ratites have. They were the dominant herbivores in New Zealand's forest, shrubland and subalpine ecosystems for thousands of years, and until the arrival of the Māori were hunted only by the Haast's eagle. Moa extinction occurred around 1300 CE - 1440 CE ± 20 years, primarily due to overhunting by Māori.|$|E
25|$|Lambert et al. (2005) {{examined}} {{the possibility of}} using DNA barcoding to assess the past diversity of the Earth's biota. The COI gene of a group of extinct <b>ratite</b> birds, the moa, were sequenced using 26 subfossil moa bones. As with Hebert's results, each species sequenced had a unique barcode and intraspecific COI sequence variance ranged from 0 to 1.24%. To determine new species, a standard sequence threshold of 2.7% COI sequence difference was set. This value is 10 times the average intraspecies difference of North American birds, which is inconsistent with Hebert's recommendation that the threshold value be based on the group under study. Using this value, the group detected six moa species. In addition, a further standard sequence threshold of 1.24% was also used. This value resulted in 10 moa species which corresponded with the previously known species with one exception. This exception suggested a possible complex of species which was previously unidentified. Given the slow rate of growth and reproduction of moa, it is probable that the interspecies variation is rather low. On the other hand, there is no set value of molecular difference at which populations can be assumed to have irrevocably started to undergo speciation. It is safe to say, however, that the 2.7% COI sequence difference initially used was far too high.|$|E
50|$|All {{tinamous}} {{are from}} the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also <b>ratites.</b> Unlike other <b>ratites,</b> tinamou can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All <b>ratites</b> evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamou are the closest living relative of these birds. Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore Crypturellus means small hidden tail.|$|R
50|$|The cinereous tinamou is a {{monotypic}} species.

All <b>ratites</b> evolved from prehistoric flying birds and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds. Gmelin originally placed this bird in the Tetrao genus, as Tetrao cinereus, which is indicative of its apparent, but incorrect, closeness to the other game birds.|$|R
25|$|Of Gondwanan origin, {{tinamous}} {{are members}} of the <b>ratites,</b> which comprise the Palaeognathae ("old jaws"), while all other living birds {{are members of}} Neognathae ("new jaws"). Unlike other palaeognaths, tinamous do have a keeled sternum, but like the other palaeognaths, they have a distinctive palate. It was formerly believed that the Tinamiformes separated from the <b>ratites</b> early on due to their retention of a keeled sternum. The tinamous' possession of powder-down feathers and preen glands, which the <b>ratites</b> lack, was a source of confusion in determining their taxonomy.|$|R

It is the fifth heaviest living bird species, after only the larger varieties of <b>ratite.</b> The weight also varies by season, as {{both male and female}} penguins lose substantial mass while raising hatchlings and incubating their egg.

500|$|Hypacrosaurus stebingeri laid roughly spherical eggs of , with embryos [...] long. Hatchlings {{were around}} [...] long. Studies of lines of growth (i.e. lines of von Ebner) {{in the teeth}} of {{embryonic}} H. stebingeri suggests plesiomorphically long incubation times, with a minimum incubation time of 171.4 days for H. stebingeri. Young and embryonic individuals had deep skulls with only slight expansion in the bones that would one day form the crest. Growth was faster than that of an alligator and comparable to <b>ratite</b> growth, for several years, based on the amount of bone growth seen between lines of arrested growth (analogous to growth rings in trees). Research by Lisa Cooper and colleagues on H. stebingeri indicates that this animal may have reached reproductive maturity at the age of 2 to 3years, and reached full size at about 10 to 12years old. The circumference of the thigh bone at postulated reproductive maturity was about 40% that of its circumference at full size. The postulated growth rate of H. stebingeri outpaces those of tyrannosaurids (predators of hypacrosaurs) such as Albertosaurus and Tyrannosaurus; rapidly growing hypacrosaurs would have had a better chance to reach a size large enough to be of defensive value, and beginning reproduction at an early age would also have been advantageous to a prey animal. Secondary cartilage has been found in the skull of a hatchling specimen of H. stebingeri.|$|E
2500|$|Like the ostrich, rhea, cassowary, emu, kiwi and extinct moa, Mullerornis and Aepyornis were ratites; {{they could}} not fly, and their breast bones had no keel.

50|$|Kiwis and {{tinamous}} are {{the only}} palaeognath lineages not to evolve gigantism, perhaps because of competitive exclusion by giant <b>ratites</b> already present on New Zealand and South America when they arrived or arose. The fact that New Zealand {{has been the only}} land mass to support two major lineages of flightless <b>ratites</b> may reflect the absence of native mammals, which allowed kiwis to occupy a mammal-like nocturnal niche. However, various other landmasses such as South America and Europe bear multiple lineages of flightless <b>ratites</b> that evolved independently, undermining this competitive exclusion hypothesis.|$|R
