40|$|In this study, <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> {{strategies}} for a large-scale argon cell facility were considered. The suggested strategies {{were evaluated by}} several types of field test. The teleoperation tasks were performed using a developed <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> system, which enabled traveling over entire cell area using a bridge transport system. Each arm of the system had six DOFs (degrees of freedom), and the bridge transport system had four DOFs. However, despite the dexterous manipulators and redundant monitoring system, many operators, including professionals, experienced difficulties in operating the <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> system. This {{was because of the}} lack of a strategy for handling the installed camera system, and the difficulty in recognizing the gripper pose, which might fall outside the FOV (field of vision) of the system during teleoperation. Hence, in this paper, several considerations for the <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> tasks performed in the target facility were discussed, and the tasks were analyzed based on ergonomic factors such as the workload. Toward the development of a successful operation strategy, several ergonomic issues, such as active/passive view of the <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> system, eye/hand alignment, and FOV were considered. Furthermore, using the method for classifying <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> tasks, several unit tasks were defined and evaluated...|$|R

The maintenance configuration considered here is the Vertical <b>Remote</b> <b>Handling,</b> meaning gravity acting along the launcher radial axis. The plant, where the maintenance under consideration is occurring, is the Hot Cell Facility Work Cell. The study here reported {{has been carried out}} within the presently ongoing EFDA Goal Oriented Training program on <b>Remote</b> <b>Handling</b> (GOT-RH), which aims to support ITER activities. This document and its contents have to be considered as part of a more vast RAMI analysis to be developed within the GOT-RH, which aims to maximize the Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive system availability. The Baseline CAD model of the Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive Upper Launcher is currently in its preliminary design phase and does not provide enough details for developing a fully detailed maintenance strategy. Therefore, through a System Engineering approach, a set of assumptions was conceived on the launcher structure, as a basis for development of a <b>Remote</b> <b>Handling</b> strategy. Moreover, to compare different design solutions related to the possibility of integrating a quasi-optical component into the Blanket Shield Module, a Trade-Off was made, and its contents are shown here. The outcome of this System Engineering approach has been formalized into Task Definition Forms whose contents are reported here.
