Near its summit he broke into a hunting cabin and stole food, clothing, and a rifle. The following day he left the cabin and continued south toward the town of Crested Butte, but became lost in the forest. For two days he wandered aimlessly on the mountain, missing two trails that led downward to his intended destination.

40|$|Judicial {{decisions}} of public courts increasingly {{are based on}} “contract procedure,” private rules of procedure that the parties draft and assent to before a dispute even has arisen. These rules govern such matters as the forum in which the proceeding will be conducted, whether a jury {{will be involved in}} adjudicating the dispute, the scope <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>discovery,</b> and rules <b>of</b> evidence. The practice deserves greater attention and should raise more profound concerns than the academic literature currently suggests. We argue that contract procedure operates as a form of privatization that effectively outsources government functions to private contracting parties. As such, contract procedure has the potential to promote self-governance, encourage innovation, and secure efficiency. Yet it also permits unelected and unaccountable contract drafters to reshape adjudication, procedural rulemaking, and substantive law with virtually no meaningful oversight by Congress, agencies, or the courts. The practice of contract procedure has effects that spill over from the private world of the contracting parties into a world in which more public modes of deliberation and decision making have traditionally prevailed. Our argument that these spillovers may be negative draws from well-developed theoretical concerns about the potential inefficiency of the private production of public goods, the potential threats to political competition posed by allowing economic actors to influence the exercise of adjudicative power, the dangers of exit from public institutions highlighted by Albert Hirschman’s theory of exit, voice and loyalty, and Michael Walzer’s account of the appropriate boundaries of the different “spheres of justice. ” We suggest a package of reforms that are aimed at the system effects that we identify and that are designed to capture the benefits of privatization while ensuring the transparency, public-regarding values, and information production that are essential to sound judicial administration. The two central reforms can be easily administered and would encourage greater oversight by Congress, agencies, and the courts. The two reforms are: (1) a requirement that the civil cover sheet that typically accompanies the filing of a complaint in a public court inquire whether the parties have agreed to deviate from any public rules of procedure and (2) a requirement that any such deviation be a mandatory topic of discussion at a judicial pre-trial conference and that the court consider and assess the likely effect of the customized rule in terms of party fairness, judicial integrity, and administrative efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The Falkland Islands War of 1982 {{was fought}} over {{competing}} claims to sovereignty over {{a group of}} islands off {{the east coast of}} South America. The dispute was between Argentina and the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom claims the islands primarily through prescription [...] {{the fact that they have}} governed the islands in a peaceful, continuous and public manner since 1833. The British also hold that the population living on the islands, roughly eighteen hundred British descendants, should be able to decide their own future. The United Kingdom also lays claim to the islands through <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>discovery</b> and settlement, although this claim has always been challenged by Spain who until 1811 governed the islands. Both claims have legal support, and the final decision if there will ever be one is difficult to predict. Sadly today the ultimate test of sovereignty does not come through international law but remains in the idea that "He is sovereign who can defend his sovereignty. " The years preceding the Argentine invasion of 1982 witnessed many diplomatic exchanges between The United Kingdom and Argentina over the future of the islands. During this time the British sent signals to Argentina that ii implied a decline in British resolve to hold the islands and demonstrated that military action did more to further the talks along than did actual negotiations. The Argentine military junta read these signals and decided that they could take the islands in a quick military invasion and that the United Kingdom would consider the act as a fait accompli and would not protest the invasion. The British in response to this claimed that they never signaled to Argentina that a military solution was acceptable to them and launched a Royal Navy task force to liberate the islands. Both governments responded to an international crisis with means that were designed both to resolve the international crisis and increase the domestic popularity of the government. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was facing an all-time low in popularity for post-War Prime Ministers while Argentine President General Galtieri needed to gain mass popular support so he could remain a viable President after he was scheduled to lose command of the army and a seat on the military junta that ran the country. The military war for the Falklands is indicative of the nature of modern warfare between Third World countries. It shows that the gap in military capabilities between Third and First World countries is narrowing significantly.
