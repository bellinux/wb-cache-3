5|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve an extremely high Q with mechanical <b>resonators.</b> Mechanical <b>resonators</b> typically have a Q of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in torsional <b>resonators</b> using a particular nickel-iron alloy.

5|$|The {{resonator}} {{shown in}} figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using cantilever varactors as the resonator elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5mm. Cantilever <b>resonators</b> are typically applied at frequencies below 200MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, {{can be used in}} the microwave bands. Extremely high Q <b>resonators</b> can be made with this technology; flexural mode <b>resonators</b> with a Q in excess of 80,000 at 8MHz are reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{various types}} of {{resonator}} are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few kilohertz (kHz) are rare. The lower part of this range, below 100kHz, is best covered with bar flexural <b>resonators.</b> The upper part is better done with torsional <b>resonators.</b> Drumhead disc <b>resonators</b> are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300kHz.|$|E

5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has <b>resonators</b> connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating <b>resonators</b> is to improve the stopband rejection. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the <b>resonators</b> are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E

The proposed <b>resonator</b> is studied both experimentally and theoretically with field simulation software. An important advantage of the fork microstrip <b>resonator</b> is attributed to its single-layer geometry and easier manufacturing processes.

5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} <b>resonators</b> {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two <b>resonators</b> (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E
5|$|Early {{designs in}} the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a {{resonator}} material. This {{has given way}} to nickel-iron alloys, primarily to maximise the Q since this is often the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter <b>resonators</b> and their Q are shown in the table.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity <b>resonators,</b> but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled <b>resonators.</b>|$|E

40|$|A Helmholtz <b>resonator</b> with {{flexible}} plate attenuates noise in exhaust ducts, and the transmission loss function quantifies {{the amount of}} filtered noise at a desired frequency.

The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC <b>resonators</b> used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness.

5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional <b>resonators,</b> and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of <b>resonators</b> does not normally exceed eight.|$|E

This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E
