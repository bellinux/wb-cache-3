Objectives The objective {{of this study was to}} generate a profile of clinic and inpatient strengths and weaknesses. This study <b>received</b> <b>exempt</b> approval. Patients and Methods The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) questionnaire was administered to students over the course of 3 academic years after inpatient and clinic assignments (2 -week deployments each) in the 8 -week clerkship. DREEM identifies student academic self-perceptions, perceptions of teachers, and perceptions of the educational atmosphere. Fifty questions are rated from 4 = strongly agree to 0 = strongly disagree for a total of 200. Anonymous responses were grouped by assignment and analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Participants were asked for up to 3 suggestions to improve the rotation. An immersion/crystallization framework was used to identify themes. Two authors independently coded suggestions, and then discussed the themes to reach a consensus. Results Overall results from DREEM indicated students’ perceptions were positive for different learning environments. No statistical differences were noted between subscales. Thematic analysis identified concerns with scheduling, lack of teaching, and non-specific feedback. Conclusions DREEM did not identify measurable deficiencies in the learning environment.

40|$|Purpose: To measure patient {{perceptions}} of collaborative practice in an interprofessional team providing geriatric oncology assessments to older patients with cancer. Background: The Senior Adult Oncology Clinic (SAOC) at Thomas Jefferson University’s Kimmel Cancer Center utilizes an interprofessional team approach to provide comprehensive geriatric oncology assessments and treatment plans for older patients with cancer. The importance of team-based healthcare delivery is well documented, however, {{experts agree that}} there is a need for more tools to assess the skills required to become a high-functioning team and a need to study the impact of collaborative practice on patient reported outcomes and satisfaction. For this study, we sought to evaluate patients’ experience and perception of our SAOC team function. Description of Intervention: Upon completion of a SAOC visit, patients were asked to participate in a short voluntary survey to assess team performance. The Jefferson Teamwork Observation Guide (JTOG) is a validated survey used with learners that has been adapted to elicit patient perspectives of five domains of interprofessional collaborative practice, including communication (C), values/ethics (V/E), teamwork (T), roles/responsibilities (R) and patient-centeredness (PC). The Patient JTOG includes eight competency–based Likert Scale questions as well as one open-ended question. The survey was administered on secure mobile tablets by trained research assistants (RAs) who were not part of the healthcare team. The study <b>received</b> <b>exempt</b> approval by our Institutional Review Board. Results: A total of 13 patients completed the survey. Seven respondents were female, and six were male. Seven identified as Caucasian, four as African American and two as other. One hundred percent responded “Strongly Agree” to a global question about the importance of teamwork in patient care (mean 4. 0). Overall satisfaction with the SAOC team was 3. 92 out of 4. 0. For the eight questions relating to each of the five collaborative practice competencies noted above, the team received an average score ranging from 3. 69 to 3. 77 out of 4. 0, for a global score of 29. 66 (out of 32 possible), placing this team in the highest quartile of teams surveyed at our institution to date (n= 407). In addition, all 13 respondents completed the open-ended qualitative comments with 12 out of the 13 being positive with multiple references to effective listening and communication, team coordination, and patient-centered care. Conclusion: The SAOC has a relatively unique model of providing interprofessional geriatric oncology assessments. The Patient JTOG tool was easy to incorporate into a busy clinic and provided valuable feedback to our providers, demonstrating that our patient’s perceive the team as highly functioning and effective. Based on these early results, our high functioning interprofessional consultative team model may serve as a model for replication for team based care delivery at other institutions Relevance: Incorporation of an easy to use tool to assess interprofessional team function and patient {{perceptions of}} collaborative practice Learning Objectives: Define methods for evaluating patient perceptions of collaborative practice in an outpatient geriatric oncology practice (Knowledge) Describe a replicable model for interprofessional collaborative practice (Comprehension/Application) Apply lessons learned for engaging students in and preparing faculty for interprofessional team-based care delivery (Comprehension/Application...|$|R

40|$| {{designed}} to provide protection for the creditors. The accountancy regulations {{take into account the}} need for information {{on the part of the}} creditors and other interested parties. Much of the protection in a company depends upon the company's interested parties themselves being careful. In order to be able to judge the risks, creditors require access to correct accounts. The capital accounted for by the company is also, for the benefit of the creditors, surrounded by protective regulation. In the perspective of the creditors' protection consisting of information and equity protection regulations, consolidated accounts play an important part. From the point of view of the group, the parent company has, in its subsidiary a possession of assets. The subsidiary owns its assets, but the parent company also owns the same assets indirectly. The parent company's possession of the subsidiary's assets is accounted for by its ownership of shares in the subsidiary. The shares in the subsidiary are to be treated as fixed assets. Special valuation rules apply to such assets. These valuation rules prevent the parent company from showing unconverted profits. After the fusion, the group consisting of the parent company and its subsidiary ceases to exist. It is not necessary to demand protection for the creditors of the group or of the subsidiary at this stage. Instead, it is more important to protect those creditors who will have claims in the parent company after the fusion. Other creditors can receive securities or payment for their claims as part of the fusion procedure. It is therefore necessary that the accounting of the fusion takes place from the parent company's side. From the perspective of the parent company, it is its creditors who stand to lose due to the redistribution of capital in the company accounts. A detrimental redistribution has taken place if previously restricted equity becomes non-restricted. It is important to prevent the parent company from creating new non-restricted equity. Rather than being permitted to create new non-restricted equity, the parent company should, after the fusion, only control the same amount of non-restricted equity as it did in the group before the fusion. As part of the stock of the group, the entire non-restricted equity of the subsidiary cannot be transferred to the parent company. Profits or reserves which have been earned prior to the acquisition of the subsidiary can, for example, not be transferred without a corresponding devaluation of the parent company's shares. In principle, such profits of the subsidiary have formed restricted equity from the point of view of the parent company. In the accounts of the parent company, these profits have been included as fixed assets in the form of shares in the subsidiary. The parent company has not been able to pay out these profit funds by increasing the value of its shares. Nor has the parent company been able to pay out these funds by first having the subsidiary pay them out to the parent company. In such a case, the parent company would, of course, devalue the shares of the subsidiary to the same degree. A loss would have been created by this devaluation which would have reduced the possibilities for paying dividends. Taxational consequences of fusions There is no direct connection between the taxational regulations and the regulations in corporate law concerning fusions. From the point of view of taxation, different objectives have been of importance than the protection of creditors. The taxational regulations have, however, been developed from the civil fusion procedure. The taxational regulations serve to guarantee that companies pay tax• on their incomes. In this context, fusions are events which can create income or outlay. In turn, the business event itself is also taxed. In the sections dealing with taxational aspects, I have treated fusion as an alternative business event. Tax forms an outlay in the business of a company. Thus, companies seek to keep tax costs at as low a level as possible. This means that the fusion procedure is used if no other action will entail lower tax costs. In my opinion, certain actions are, from the point of view of taxation, equal' to the fusion procedure. These include, among others, transactions involving companies with collected profits. Companies can also achieve the same effects, from the point of view of taxation, as with fusion by means of various income equalizations. Companies may simply transfer assets and avoid taxation by keeping within the regulations concerning group subsidies or tax exemption for share dividends. By applying regulations and inconsistencies between different regulatory systems, tax-payers can obtain taxation benefits. The restrictive interpretation of the taxation regulations, has in fact resulted in the development of procedures which are similar to those which involve a tax burden. The inventiveness of taxpayers in finding ways to legally avoid taxes is great. Many of the tax-related procedures which have been developed are based upon one person taking over assets from another. The idea is that the take-over brings taxation advantages. Such possibilities have been brought about, in part, by the inconsistency in the taxation of legal as opposed to physical persons. In some cases, a company can transfer untaxed and taxed funds from another company to itself. The 'raison d'etre' of a company is to make a profit for its owners. Taxation legislation is so formed that taxes are first levied on profits at the company level, and later, when dividends are paid, at the level of the individual share-holder. In order to avoid double taxation in the private sector, rules exist which allow parent companies to <b>receive</b> tax <b>exempt</b> payments from subsidiary companies. There are also other possibilities for parent companies to transfer funds to themselves from subsidiaries without paying tax on them. One such possibility is group subsidy. A company can also acquire another company with the intention of transferring assets to itself after the acquisition. Such transactions depend on the fact that companies, but not physical individuals, are exempt from taxation in the transfer of the acquired company's assets to themselves. The taxation laws are detailed and far reaching. They include, for example, special rules concerning the transfer of assets where one of the companies involved is an investment or trustee company. Tax payers can, using creative accounting, ease their tax burdens by utilizing the different tax regulations applying to different types of companies. Different types of companies are taxed differently for various procedures. A trustee company cannot, for example, <b>receive</b> tax <b>exempt</b> dividends. Therefore, trustee companies seek to find possibilities of income adjustment between themselves and their subsidiaries. One such possibility to receive untaxed dividends is for the trustee company to change its status in such a way that it is no longer subject to the regulations concerning trustee companies. The company can achieve this by initiating some active enterprise or by acquiring an active company. These days, fusion between a subsidiary and its parent company can be included among the income adjusting transactions which can be made within the private sector. The tax regulations are to be found in SIL § 2 article 4. In principle, the regulations exempt companies from taxation of profit arising from fusions. Fusions of Parent companies and their subsidiaries would otherwise have involved taxation consequences in line with income tax legislation. A fusion is. the taking over of a subsidiary's assets by its parent company whereby the parent company actually makes a profit (or alternatively loss). A fusion is a business event in which a parent company exchanges shares in the subsidiary for the assets and debts of that subsidiary. This business event should, therefore, not involve income taxation. The intention behind the fusion regulations is that the companies involved should be regarded as if they had represented one tax payer from the outset. Aided by the regulations for tax relief in the case of fusions, fusions become, essentially, a way of unifying a parent company and its subsidiary into a single taxpaying unit. Fusions also give beneficial taxation effects as the companies are not taxed as part of the unification process. In those cases where fusion brings about taxation, it is likely that this would act as a deterrent. Fusions are therefore not usually undertaken in cases where they bring about considerable negative consequences. As the companies involved are not taxed in conjunction with a fusion, the procedure implies a greater degree of tax reduction than do other restructuring processes. The occurrence of beneficial taxation consequences in connection with fusions is to a large extent due to the fact that the regulations surrounding fusions do not correspond to those connected with distribution of dividends, group subsidies and other transfers of assets between companies. We can take the fusion of a trustee company and another company as an example. As the acquiring company, the trustee company can transfer assets to itself in a way which would otherwise not be possible due to dividend distribution and group subsidy regulations. Fusions also make it possible for companies, using various transactions, to offset losses made by either the parent company or the subsidiary against profits made by the companies. The parent company can, for example, take over assets from the subsidiary and value them at levels other (lower) than the taxation level of the subsidiary. Later the parent company can revalue the acquired assets at a higher level thus offsetting the profit gained against its own losses. In some cases, the parent company can also take over assets at higher values, then directly offsetting the profit gained against corresponding losses. Similar effects can occasionally be brought about using group subsidy and dividend distribution regulations. In most cases, however, fusion is the most beneficial method of transferring income from a subsidiary to its parent company...|$|R
