25|$|The more {{detailed}} regional approach subdivides the cavity into nine regions, with two vertical and two horizontal lines drawn according to landmark structures. The vertical; or midclavicular lines, are drawn as if {{dropped from the}} midpoint of each clavicle. The superior horizontal line is the subcostal line, drawn immediately inferior to the ribs. The inferior horizontal line is called the intertubercular line, and is to cross the iliac tubercles, found at the superior aspect of the pelvis. The upper <b>right</b> <b>square</b> is the right hypochondriac region and contains {{the base of the}} right ribs. The upper left square is the left hypochondriac region and contains the base of the left ribs.|$|E
25|$|The epigastric {{region is}} the upper central square and {{contains}} {{the bottom edge}} of the liver {{as well as the}} upper areas of the stomach. The diaphragm curves like an upside down U over these three regions. The central right region is called the right lumbar region and contains the ascending colon and the right edge of the small intestines. The central square contains the transverse colon and the upper regions of the small intestines. The left lumbar region contains the left edge of the transverse colon and the left edge of the small intestine. The lower <b>right</b> <b>square</b> is the right iliac region and contains the right pelvic bones and the ascending colon. The lower left square is the left iliac region and contains the left pelvic bone and the lower left regions of the small intestine.

2500|$|In India, {{hopscotch}} is {{also called}} Kith-Kith, Stapu, [...] in the Hindi-speaking areas, or Ek-hat - Du-hat in Bengal, [...] Chirpi in Maharashtra, Kunte bille in Karnataka, Paandi in Tamil Nadu, and Tokkudu Billa in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. These games have similar principles in that players must hop {{on one foot}} and must throw the marker in the <b>right</b> <b>square.</b> The game is mostly common among girls in India, though some boys play too.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first player}} tosses the marker also called a [...] "lucky" [...] unto the court. This object should {{land in the}} square without bouncing, sliding, or rolling out. It is {{typically}} a small flat stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm. The marker must land completely within the square without touching the line. The player then hops through the course, skipping the square with the marker in it. Single squares must be hopped on one foot. For the first single square, either foot may be used. Side-by-side squares are straddled, with the left foot landing in the left square, and the right foot landing in the <b>right</b> <b>square.</b> Optional squares marked [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest" [...] are neutral squares, and may be hopped through in any manner without penalty. After hopping into [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest", the player must {{then turn around and}} return through the course (square 9, then squares 8 and 7, next square 6, and so forth) on one or two legs depending on the square until reaching the square with the marker. The player stops in the square before the marker and reaches down to retrieve the marker and continue the course as stated, without touching a line or stepping into a square with another player's marker.|$|E

6000|$|Far {{different}} was {{the attitude}} of Mrs. Crocker's sister, Nesta Pett. She entirely disapproved of the proposed match. At least, {{the fact that in}} her final interview with her sister she described the bridegroom-to-be as a wretched mummer, a despicable fortune-hunter, a broken-down tramp, and a sneaking, grafting confidence-trickster lends colour to the supposition that she was not a warm supporter of it. She agreed wholeheartedly with Mrs. Crocker's suggestion that they should never speak to each other again as long as they lived: and it was immediately after this that the latter removed husband Bingley, step-son Jimmy, and all her other goods and chattels to London, where they had remained ever since. Whenever Mrs. Crocker spoke of America now, it was in tones of the deepest dislike and contempt. Her friends were English, and every year more exclusively of England's aristocracy. She intended to become a leading figure in London Society, and already her progress had been astonishing. She knew the right people, lived in the <b>right</b> <b>square,</b> said the right things, and thought the right thoughts: and in the Spring of her third year had succeeded in curing Bingley of his habit of beginning his remarks with the words [...] "Say, lemme tell ya something." [...] Her progress, in short, was beginning to assume the aspect of a walk-over.|$|E
