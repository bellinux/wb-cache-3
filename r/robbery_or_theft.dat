50|$|Bank {{fraud is}} the use of {{potentially}} illegal means to obtain money, assets, or other property owned or held by a financial institution, or to obtain money from depositors by fraudulently posing as a bank or other financial institution. In many instances, bank fraud is a criminal offence. While the specific elements of particular banking fraud laws vary depending on jurisdictions, the term bank fraud applies to actions that employ a scheme or artifice, as opposed to bank <b>robbery</b> <b>or</b> <b>theft.</b> For this reason, bank fraud is sometimes considered a white-collar crime.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the typical}} hijackings of land {{vehicles}} or ships, skyjacking {{is not usually}} committed for <b>robbery</b> <b>or</b> <b>theft.</b> Most aircraft hijackers intend to use the passengers as hostages, either for monetary ransom or for some political or administrative concession by authorities. Various motives have driven such occurrences, including demanding the release of certain inmates (notably IC-814), highlighting the grievances of a particular community (notably AF 8969), or political asylum (notably ET 961). Hijackers also have used aircraft as a weapon to target particular locations (notably during the September 11, 2001 attacks).|$|E

5000|$|The terms piracy {{and theft}} are often {{associated}} with copyright infringement. The original meaning of [...] is [...] "robbery or illegal violence at sea", but the term has been in use for centuries as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement. Theft, meanwhile, emphasizes the potential commercial harm of infringement to copyright holders. However, copyright {{is a type of}} intellectual property, an area of law distinct from that which covers <b>robbery</b> <b>or</b> <b>theft,</b> offenses related only to tangible property. Not all copyright infringement results in commercial loss, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that infringement does not easily equate with theft.|$|E
5000|$|... "Articles {{like the}} ones just cited 158 are also {{valuable}} sources on Serbian social history. However, they must be used with caution. For a series of laws {{is not the same}} type of source as a visitor's description of a society. A law code does not describe how things actually functioned but only how they ought to have functioned. In some cases articles may have been based on customary laws; in such cases the articles’ contents were probably generally observed or practiced and thus can be taken as evidence about actual practices and conditions. However, an article could also reﬂect an innovation, a reform the ruler was trying to bring about through legislation. In this case it would not have reﬂected existing customs and we must then ask, was the ruler successful in realizing his reform or did it remain a dead letter? Thus a law code may at times more accurately depict an ideal than reality. And since certain—perhaps many—articles in Dusan’s code may have been attempts to legislate change, attempts {{which may or may not}} have been successful (and even if successful in one place, possibly not in others), we must always be careful and avoid leaping to the conclusion that this or that article describes the way things were done in fourteenth-century Serbia." [...] John Van Antwerp Fine, author of the The Late Medieval Balkans. The Code also maintained law and order, not limiting itself against crime and insults, but also gave responsibility to specific communities; it stated the existing custom that each territory was responsible and liable for keeping order; e.g. a frontier lord was responsible for defending his border: [...] "if any foreign army come and ravish the land of the Emperor, and again return through their land, those frontier lords shall pay all people through whose territory they army came." [...] (Article 49). The control of brigands, a constant problem in the Balkans, was also widely addressed in articles 126, 145, 146, 158 and 191. Article 145 says: [...] "In whatsoever village a thief or brigand be found, that village shall be scattered and the brigand shall be hanged forthwith ... and the headmen of the village shall be brought before me Emperor and shall pay for all the brigand or thief hath done from the beginning and shall be punished as a thief and a brigand." [...] and continues in article 146, [...] "also prefects and lieutenants and bailiffs and reeves and headmen who administer villages and mountain hamlets. All these shall be punished in the manner written above 145 if any thief or brigand be found in them." [...] And article 126 states, [...] "lf there be a <b>robbery</b> <b>or</b> <b>theft</b> on urban land around a town, let the neighborhood pay for it all." [...] And finally article 158 requires that the localities bordering on an uninhabited hill jointly supervise that region and pay for damage from any robbery occurring there. Fine concludes that these articles demonstrate a weakness in the state's maintaining of order in rural and border areas, which caused it to pass responsibility down to local inhabitants, by threatening them with penalties, the state hoped to force the locality to assume this duty. Another reason for the strictness of the articles towards the locality was the belief that the brigand could not survive without local support, shelter, and food. Thus the brigand was seen as a local figure, locally supported, preying on strangers. As a result, the allegedly supporting locality shared his guilt and deserved to share the punishment. The strict articles were therefore intended to discourage a community from aiding brigands.|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{have found}} that {{attractive}} faces are associated with qualities of goodness, honesty, warmth, and being more socially desirable. Physically attractive individuals experience several advantages (i. e., occupational success, criminal justice system decisions, interpersonal relationships) compared to average and unattractive individuals. Facial attractiveness {{has been found to}} be a predictor of victimization for females in relation to sexual assault. To date, facial attractiveness involving male victims has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine whether facial attractiveness influences an offender’s choice when selecting a male victim to commit <b>robbery</b> <b>or</b> <b>theft</b> against. The sample consisted of two hundred participants that ranged in age from 18 to 75 years old. Participants were asked to fill out an online survey comprised of a Facial Victim/Offender Survey and the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. Facial attractiveness did play a role in victimization. Facially attractive male victims were perceived as possessing more socially desirable qualities and more likely to be employed. Both male and female participants selected facially attractive males for the vignette offenders to victimize compared to average and unattractive male victims. Overall, this research provides evidence that facial attractiveness is related to offender victim-selection...|$|E
5000|$|Henry's true {{measure of}} cleverness, though, {{is on display}} in his {{innovations}} in criminal justice. Henry appointed [...] "justices in eyre," [...] the counterpart of circuit judges, to travel from town to town. When they arrived, they too called upon the sheriff to summon twelve free men from the surrounding areas. These twelve free men were a prototype of a grand jury. They were called to report under oath any accusations of crime {{they were aware of}} in the community. In theory, then as (in the United States and Liberia) now, the grand jury only brought accusations; it did not find guilt or innocence. The crimes to be investigated were specified in the Assize of Clarendon to be <b>robbery,</b> murder <b>or</b> <b>theft</b> <b>or</b> anyone who had harbored a robber, murderer, or thief. To these the Assize of Northampton (1176) added counterfeiting, forgery, and arson. Minor crimes were specifically excepted so the new assizes concerned themselves with what would later be labeled [...] "felonies." ...|$|R
5000|$|During the 2016 election, presidential {{candidate}} and frontrunner, Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte, campaigned {{to restore the}} death penalty in the Philippines. During the [...] "Yes or No" [...] segment of the second presidential debate on March 20, 2016, Duterte and Senator Grace Poe were the only candidates who said [...] "Yes" [...] when asked about the restoration of {{the death penalty in}} the country, favoring the decision. Duterte, who won the election in May 2016, supports restoration of the death penalty by hanging. It has been reported that he wants capital punishment for criminals involved in illegal drugs, gun-for-hire syndicates and those who commit [...] "heinous crimes" [...] such as rape, <b>robbery</b> <b>or</b> car <b>theft</b> where the victim is murdered, while Poe has stated that the capital punishment should apply to criminals convicted of [...] "drugs and multiple crimes where involved people can no longer be rehabilitated." [...] Duterte has theatrically vowed [...] "to litter Manila Bay with the bodies of criminals." [...] In December 2016, the bill to resume capital punishment for certain [...] "heinous offenses" [...] swiftly passed out of Committee in the House of Representatives; it passed the full House of Representatives in February 2017. [...] , passage of the law awaits the Senate's approval.|$|R
40|$|Research Report 77 {{looks at}} the {{relationship}} between an offender’s debut offence (first proven offence) and their future offending, {{using data from the}} UK Police National Computer (PNC). The study considers whether the type of crime committed as a first offence predicts chronic or serious offending and also looks at how the numbers and types of first offences have changed over time. The analysis shows that offenders who committed <b>robbery,</b> burglary <b>or</b> vehicle <b>theft</b> as their debut offence in 2001 were most likely to become chronic offenders and that this small group were responsible for a disproportionate amount of re-offences by the cohort. The authors consider the potential impact of the changes in the numbers of first time offenders committing key debut offences on levels of future offending and put forward suggestions for policies to reduce levels of crime...|$|R
