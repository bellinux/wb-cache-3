40|$|ABSTRACT: Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{the most}} common lethal hereditary disorder with autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>heredity</b> in caucasians. The majority of CF patients suffer from chronic respiratory infection with the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No consensus among clinicians has been reached so far concerning antibiotic treatment against P. aeruginosa in CF patients. Consensus answers to 24 important questions in this context, based on current evidence, are presented, given by a panel of 34 European experts. Questions addressed and answered are: The diagnosis of P. aeruginosa lung colonization in CF; The impact of P. aeruginosa on the clinical state of CF patients; The assessment of P. aeruginosa susceptibility against antibiotics and the importance of these results for the clinician; The use of monotherapy versus combination therapy; The development of microbial resistance; The achievement of optimal airway concentrations; The effects of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on P. aeruginosa; Statements on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in CF patients; Recommendations for doses and dosing intervals and length of treatment regimens; and Toxic side effects due t...|$|E
40|$|Mice of the C 5 -deficient DBA/ 2 J and B 10. D 2 /oSnJ inbred strains were aerosolized with Staphylococcus aureus, and the {{pulmonary}} clearance {{of bacteria}} was determined 4 h later. Both C 5 -deficient strains {{had a significantly}} decreased lung clearance of S. aureus compared with their genetically closest C 5 -sufficient relatives, DBA/ 1 J and B 10. D 2 /nSnJ strains, respectively. Serum hemolytic activity and pulmonary clearance of S. aureus were also investigated in F 1 and F 2 progenies (DBA/ 1 J X DBA/ 2 J and DBA/ 2 J X B 10. D 2 /oSnJ). Serum hemolytic activity was present in all F 1 (DBA/ 1 J X DBA/ 2 J) mice, and their pulmonary clearance of S. aureus was no {{different from that of}} the C 5 -sufficient parents (DBA/ 1 J). The absence of serum hemolytic activity (absence of C 5) in all mice from F 1 and F 2 (DBA/ 2 J X B 10. D 2 /oSnJ) and 20 % of the F 2 (DBA/ 1 J X DBA/ 2 J) was related to a decreased lung clearance of S. aureus. These results are consistent with an autosomal <b>recessive</b> pattern of <b>heredity</b> for the murine abnormality in pulmonary clearance of S. aureus...|$|R
40|$|Miotonia é o fenômeno da diminuição da velocidade de relaxamento muscular após contração, estímulo mecânico ou elétrico. As miotonias congênitas são afecções hereditárias e não apresentam distrofia muscular. Atualmente, a tendência é agrupá-las como doenças de canais iônicos, juntamente com as paralisias periódicas. Foram acompanhados sete pacientes, seis do sexo masculino e um do sexo feminino, com idade entre 16 e 48 anos (média 27 anos) e início dos sintomas entre 1 e 10 anos (média S anos), que apresentavam fenômeno miotônico desencadeado por contração intensa e hipertrofia muscular global. Três pacientes foram diagnosticados como miotonia generalizada tipo Becker por apresentarem herança autossômica recessiva e/ou episódios transitórios de fraqueza muscular. Dois pacientes correspondiam à miotonia congênita de Thomsen, com padrão de herança autossômica dominante e/ou ausência de episódios de fraqueza ou fatores de piora. Dois pacientes apresentavam miotonia flutuante, piorando com o frio e/ou ingestão de potássio. O diagnóstico clínico foi confirmado através de exames complementares (eletroneuromiografia, biópsia muscular e estudo do DNA). Cada paciente fez uso de diferentes drogas, no sentido de procurar o máximo de melhora da miotonia. Houve cinco relatos de melhora com difenil-hidantoína, um com carbamazepina, três com acetazolamida, um com bloqueador de canal de cálcio, um com beta-adrenérgico, um com tiazídico e nenhum com quinidina/procainamida. Myotonia is the {{phenomenon}} of decrease of muscular relaxation rate, after either a contraction or a mechanical or electrical stimulus. Congenital myotonias are hereditary affections and do not present muscular dystrophy. The current trend is to group them as ionic channels diseases, together with the periodic paralysis. The authors accompanied the cases of seven patients, six males and one female, with ages ranging from 16 to 48 years (average 27 years) and onset of symptons between 1 and 10 years (average 5 years). These patients presented a myotonic phenomenon unleashed by intensive contraction and global muscular hypertrophy. Three patients were diagnosed as cases of Becker type generalized myotonia because they presented a <b>recessive</b> autosomic <b>heredity</b> and/or transient episodes of muscular weakness. Two patients fitted the description of Thomsen congenital myotonia, with a pattern of dominating autosomic heredity and/or absence of weakness episodes or worsening factors for their condition. Two patients presented fluctuating myotonia, which became worse in cold weather or at potassium intake. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed through complementary tests (electroneuromyography, muscle biopsy and DNA study). Each of the patients made use of different drugs, in the search of optimal lessening of their myotonia. There were five reports of amelioration {{with the use of}} diphenilhydantoine; one report with the use of carbamazepine; three reports {{with the use of a}}cetazolamide; one report with the use of a calcium channel blocker; one report with the use of a beta-adrenergic; one report with the use of thiazide; and none with the use of quinidine/procainamide...|$|R

Se expone la hipótesis de Lyon para explicar la ocurrencia de este hecho. Se concluye que las heterocigotas pueden manifestarse clínicamente al igual que los varones hemicigotos, por lo que a todas se les debe realizar estudio oftalmológico minucioso para confirmar el estado de portadora, así como para iniciar tratamiento adecuado, de ser necesario.

40|$|Platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase {{has been}} rec-ognized as an enzyme that inactivates PAF. We {{developed}} a convenient and reproducible method for determining human serum PAF acetyihydrolase activity. The assay {{was based on}} measurement of 1 I 4 Clacetate produced from 1 -O-alkyl- 2 - 1 ' 4 C]-acetyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine upon precipitation of the complex of radioactive substrate and albumin with TCA. The apparent Km value of PAF acetylhydrolase (near the physio-logical concentration of serum protein) was 1. 5 X 10 - 4 M PAF. 32 subjects with serum PAF acetylhydrolase deficiency were found among 816 healthy Japanese adults. The low PAF ace-tylhydrolase activity in the deficient serum might not {{be due to the}} presence of enzyme inhibitor. Both the sensitivity to PAF and the metabolism of PAF in platelets from PAF acetylhy-drolase-deficient subjects were almost the same as those of normal subjects. Deficiency in serum PAF acetylhydrolase ap-peared to be transmitted by autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>heredity</b> among five Japanese families. Among healthy adults, healthy children, and asthmatic children, who were grouped into five classes on the basis of respiratory symptoms (remission, wheezy, mild, moderate, and severe groups), the probability of PAF acetylhydrolase deficiency was significantly higher in groups with severe symptoms (moderate and severe) (P < 0. 01). These results suggest that deficiency of serum PAF acetylhydrolase might be one of the factors leading to severe respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children...|$|E

In a {{commercial}} stock of pigs reared semi-intensively almost 100 animals {{out of a}} total of about 800 juvenile pigs exhibited variously intense motility disorders, some very serious, of unclear aetiology, mainly in the pelvic limbs. The clinical symptoms were reminiscent of Ca and P metabolic disorders, but increased satu-ration with these elements did not result in an improvement. With increasing weight the motility disorders of the animals increased to such an extent that they all had to be slaughtered before reaching the proper body mass. Clinical, X-ray and pathomorphological stUdy of 8 sick animals and two controls revealed the typical signs of disproportional. congenital chondrodysplasia; strikingly short limbs as a result of premature closure of growth cartilage, and thus a halt to the longitudinal growth of the long bones of endochondral type, their thicken-ing under the influence of normal continuation of perichondral ossification, extre-me dysplasia with characteristic deformation of the epiphyses and the joint sockets, especially in the regions of the joints, which were the actual cause of the. motility disorders. The proportions of trunk and head remained unchanged. As regards aetiology, we suppose this be a hereditary disorder of endochondral development of bones with autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>heredity.</b> Chondrodysplasia, pathology, joints, bones, hereditary dwarfism, motility disorders, pig Hereditary dwarfism in various domestic animals has been described by various authors (Diimm...|$|E
40|$|Incidence of {{resistance}} to erythromycin at our institution reached 53 % in 122 Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) from 1997 to 1999. Macrolide-resistance genes were sought for in 20 erythromycin-resistant isolates from 9 patients with CF by use of polymerase chain reaction; 13 strains did not contain any known macrolide-resistance genes. Sequence of ribosomal genes rrl (23 S rRNA), rplD (L 4 protein), and rplV (L 22 protein) revealed the presence of mutations in the target site of macrolides in 15 of the 20 isolates. A higher proportion of hypermutator strains was observed {{in a group of}} 89 CF staphylococcal isolates, compared with that in the 74 non-CF control isolates (13 / 89 vs. 1 / 74 with resistance to rifampin []; 9 / 89 vs. 1 / 74 with resistance to streptomycin []). Various mutations or deletionsPp. 0045 Pp. 04 of the mutator mutS gene were found not only in 5 of 11 hypermutable strains but also in 3 nonhypermutable strains harboring a large number of ribosomal mutations. The presence of a high proportion of hypermutable strains might explain the adaptation of certain strains in the patients, as well as the emergence of macrolide resistance as a result of antibiotic selective pressure in CF.

40|$|ABSTRACT Some outer floral {{organs are}} unique in gramineous plants, like the sterile lemma and {{rudimentary}} glume in rice. However, their development mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we used 4 mutants with long sterile lemma (LSL), named JF 11, JF 12, JF 13 and JNY- 7, to be crossed with Aijiaonante (AJNT) and Nipponbare (NIP), respectively. Genetic {{analysis indicated that}} LSL trait exhibited <b>recessive</b> <b>heredity</b> and was controlled by a common allele named sl- 1 (t). Using the method of bulk segregant analysis and linkage analysis between SSR markers and LSL trait based on F 2 populations, the sl- 1 (t) gene was located at the interval between RM 20903 and RM 20948 on chromosome 7. The interval harbors a known G 1 gene, which regulates the sterile lemma trait. The findings of allelic sequencing showed an 11 -base deletion in gene G 1 happened in the mutants of JF 11, JF 12 and JF 13, {{which led to a}} frame-shifting mutation, whereas the mutant of JNY- 7 had a base substitution that caused the change of the amino acid residue. Eight substitutions in the ORF and 10 in the upstream region from − 1 to − 824 were found between Indica and Japonica rice by DNA sequence analysis, but those polymorphisms have no effect on the gene function. In conclusion, we fine mapped the LSL gene, sl- 1 (t), and found 2 kinds of mutant alleles conferring the gene function and the DNA polymorphisms of G 1 between Indica and Japonica rice...|$|E

The expert panel answered further questions on the use of fluoroquinolones in children with CF, on the administration of nebulized antibiotics and whether prevention of P. aeruginosa lung colonization is possible in CF using antibiotic therapy. Problems of antibiotic therapy at home and in the hospital were addressed, a consensus statement on regular maintenance treatment, or treatment on demand, was given and different routes of administration of antibiotics were recommended for different clinical situations. Finally, the factors which determine the choice of the antibiotic, the dosage, and the duration of the treatment in cystic fibrosis patients were addressed and the design of future antibiotic studies in the context of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients were recommended...|$|E
