This article reports the {{validation of the}} Positive And Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), by means of confirmatory analysis. Methods: A community-dwelling cross-national sample of 1291 older adults aged 75 years-old and older voluntarily completed the PANAS. The relations between variables in the model were evaluated using structural equation based on maximum likelihood estimation. The distributional properties, cross-sample stability, internal reliability, and convergent, external and criterion-related validities of the PANAS were analyzed and found to be psychometrically acceptable. Results: Our results outcomes support for {{the hypothesis that the}} PANAS is valid and reliable in the two 10 -item mood scales, hence fit for use with older adults, within a culturally diverse view of well-being. Conclusions: The psychometric properties of the PANAS are satisfactory in this older sample, and according to those of its early version. Taken together, these results substantiate the validity of this measure when applied to an older community cross-national population.

To a certain extent, the purpose of the conference is to highlight the contribution derived from reading the biography of Bocage, despite the fact that his academic career was extremely short. He did not attend Coimbra University, and instead enrolled at a professional training school similar to the Navy Academy. The intellectual life of Bocage, namely his literary activity, shows that his cultural instruction occurred outside school, although his knowledge of Latin and French (acquired at school) enabled him to perform other activities, such as translation. His verses reveal, albeit from a brief analysis, a philosophical culture that was rare during his epoch.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{motivated}} {{by the need to}} find parental characteristics other than demographic indicators which exhibit substantial links to a child’s success in school. Therefore, the associations between various indicators of family background and a child’s school achievement are empirically explored. A latent variable model is assumed to describe the underlying relationships. A data set, large in terms of selectable variables, gives rise to the need to use statistical methods that reduce its dimensionality. Since there many possible methods, simulations comparing their predictive ability are conducted. A regularized version of Factor Regression turns out to be most suitable. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, the method extracts several factors with relevant associations to the outcome. While factors related to demographic indicators play a major role, other factors related to participation in cultural life or the interest and participation in politics or in further education substantially contribute to explaining variance in the outcome. The results suggest that demographic indicators alone might not be sufficient to describe the <b>relevant</b> <b>facets</b> of family background...|$|E

Based on the PHS (Predicted Heat Strain) model, the last version of ISO Standard 7933 devoted to the hot stress evaluation requires the measure of four physical (air temperature, mean radiant temperature, humidity and air velocity) and two sub-jective (metabolic rate and thermal clothing insulation) parameters. As far the measurement of mi-croclimatic parameters is concerned, ISO 7726 Standard suggests minimum and maximum accuracy values.

If a query image admits to multiple interpretations, user feedback on the set of returned images can be an effective tool to improve retrieval performance in subsequent rounds. For this to work, however, the first results set has to include representatives of the semantic facet of interest. We will argue that relevance feedback techniques that fix the distance metric for the first retrieval round are semantically biased and may fail to distil <b>relevant</b> semantic <b>facets</b> thus limiting the scope of relevance feedback. Our approach is based on the notion of the NN k of a query image, defined as the set of images that are nearest neighbours of the query under some instantiation of a parametrised distance metric. Different neighbours may be viewed as representing different meanings of the query. By associating each NN k with the parameters for which it was ranked closest to the query, the selection of relevant NN k by a user provides us with parameters for the second retrieval round. We evaluate this two step relevance feedback technique on two collections and compare it to an alternative relevance feedback method and to an oracle for which the optimal parameter values are known...|$|R
