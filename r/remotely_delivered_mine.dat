Discussion and concluding remarks. Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a significant cause of disability globally, with common causes being stroke and trauma. Individuals living with ABI often display high levels of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour, which increases their risk of morbidity and mortality. However, many adults with ABI experience barriers to participation in effective physical activity interventions. <b>Remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> self-management programs focussed on teaching individuals how to improve and maintain their physical activity levels {{have the potential to}} improve the overall health of adults with ABI. The development of a complex and multifaceted health intervention, such as self-management program to increase physical activity, requires a scholarly and systematic approach to the development process, underpinned with a sound theoretical basis. The work presented in this Thesis demonstrates this rigorous development process, using an Intervention Mapping framework, to develop an innovative <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> self-management program focussed specifically on assisting individuals living in the Australian community to increase their physical activity. The development process commenced with a comprehensive needs assessment; including a systematic review of the literature on the {{efficacy of}} self-management programs to increase physical activity after ABI (Study I), and a survey of potential participants regarding barriers to physical activity and interest in a program of this nature (Study II). The detailed developmental process is outlined (Study III), and resulted in a comprehensive self-management program, the myMoves Program. Initial testing of this program has been conducted (Study IV) demonstrating that it is both feasible to deliver, and highly acceptable to participants. Testing also informed an iterative review of the program (Study V) to conclude the developmental process and inform future testing of efficacy. In essence, the work presented in this Thesis has demonstrated the successful development of a <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> self-management program focused at increasing physical activity for individuals living in the community with ABI.

40|$|Background Health {{anxiety and}} {{medically}} unexplained symptoms cost the National Health Service (NHS) an estimated £ 3 {{billion per year}} in unnecessary costs with little evidence of patient benefit. Effective treatment is rarely taken up due to issues such as stigma or previous negative experiences with mental health services. An approach to overcome this might be to offer <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> psychological therapy, which {{can be just as}} effective as face-to-face therapy and may be more accessible and suitable. Aims To investigate the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) to people with high health anxiety repeatedly accessing unscheduled care (trial registration: NCT 02298036). Method A multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be undertaken in primary and secondary care providers of unscheduled care across the East Midlands. One hundred and forty-four eligible participants will be equally randomised to receive either remote CBT (6 – 12 sessions) or treatment as usual (TAU). Two doctoral research studies will investigate the barriers and facilitators to delivering the intervention and the factors contributing to the optimisation of therapeutic outcome. Results This trial {{will be the first to}} test the clinical outcomes and costeffectiveness of <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> CBT for the treatment of high health anxiety. Conclusions The findings will enable an understanding as to how this intervention might fit into a wider care pathway to enhance patient experience of care...|$|R

Various models of <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> care have been developed, with a gap in knowledge regarding the outcomes of these heterogeneous models. This report describes a satellite care model for remote full-care hemodialysis units managed homogenously {{in the province of}} Manitoba, Canada, without onsite nephrologists. Survival in remotely located full-care units is compared with a large, urban full-care center with onsite nephrologists. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Data from a Canadian provincial dialysis registry were extracted on 2663 patients between 1990 and 2005. All-cause mortality after initiation of chronic hemodialysis was assessed with Cox propor-tional hazards regression. Both short-term (1 year) and long-term (2 to 5 years) survival were analyzed. Results: Survival for patients receiving <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> care was shown to be better than for those receiving care in the urban care center with this particular Canadian model of care. Furthermore, there was no difference when assessing short- and long-term survival. This was independent of distance from the urban center. Conclusions: Chronic hemodialysis patients receiving <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> care in a specialized facility attain comparable, if not better survival outcomes than their urban counterparts with direct onsite nephrology care. This model can potentially be adapted to other underserviced areas, including increasingly larger urban centers. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol ●●: ●●●–●●●, 2010. doi: 10. 2215 /CJN. 0455070...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} scientific literature regarding tele-rheumatology and draw conclusions about feasibility, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane database searches were performed (April 2016) using relevant MeSH and keyword terms for telemedicine and rheumatic diseases. Articles were selected if reporting outcomes for feasibility, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction and methodologically appraised using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and {{a modified version of}} CONSORT 2010 Statement. Results: A total of 177 articles were screened, 23 were selected for the present review but only 9 were RCTs. Five studies reported on feasibility, 14 effectiveness, and 9 satisfaction rates for different tele-rheumatology interventions grouped in synchronous (<b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> consultation) and asynchronous (remote disease activity assessment; tele-monitoring of treatment strategies or rehabilitation; and <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> self-management programs). Seven studies (30. 4 %) were on rheumatoid arthritis, 2 (8. 7 %) were on systemic sclerosis (1 including also rheumatoid arthritis patients), 5 (21. 7 %) on fibromyalgia, 2 (8. 7 %) on osteoarthritis, 3 (13. 0 %) on juvenile idiopathic arthritis and 4 (17. 4 %) on mixed disease cohorts. Interventions and outcomes heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis of results. Overall, feasibility and patient satisfaction rates were high or very high across intervention types. Effectiveness was equal or higher than standard face-to-face approach in controlled trials which, however, were affected by small sample size and lack of blinding participants according to appraisal tools. Conclusion: Telemedicine may provide a well-accepted way to <b>remotely</b> <b>deliver</b> consultation, treatment and monitoring disease activity in rheumatology.

The current paper provides an empirical example {{of the use of}} the engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to build a <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> responsive parenting intervention to prevent obesity among children of low-income mothers with and without depressive symptoms. Methods Participants were 107 mothers with (n[*]=[*] 45) and without (n[*]=[*] 62) depressive symptoms who had a child aged 12 to 42  months participating in the Women, Infants and Children program. Participants were randomized to one of sixteen experimental conditions using a factorial design that included a combination of the following eight <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> intervention components: responsive feeding curriculum (given to all participants), parenting curriculum, portion size guidance, obesogenic risk assessment, personalized feedback on mealtime routines, feeding curriculum counseling, goal setting, mobile messaging, and social support. This design enabled efficient identification of components with low feasibility and acceptability. Results Completion rates were high (85 %) and did not statistically differ by depressive symptoms. However, mothers with depressive symptoms who received obesogenic risk assessment and personalized feedback on mealtime routines components had lower completion rates than mothers without depressive symptoms. All intervention components were feasible to implement except the social support component. Regardless of experimental condition, most participants reported that the program increased their awareness of what, when, and how to feed their children. Conclusions MOST provided an efficient way to assess the feasibility of components prior to testing them with a fully powered experiment. This framework helped identify potentially challenging combinations of <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> intervention components. Consideration of how these results can inform future studies focused on the optimization phase of MOST is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Background: People {{living with}} {{acquired}} brain injury (ABI) {{are more likely}} to be physically inactive and highly sedentary and, therefore, to have increased risks of morbidity and mortality. However, many adults with ABI experience barriers to participation in effective physical activity interventions. <b>Remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> self-management programs focused on teaching patients how to improve and maintain their physical activity levels have the potential to improve the overall health of adults with ABI. Objective: The study objective was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> self-management program aimed at increasing physical activity among adults who dwell in the community and have ABI. Design: A single-group design involving comparison of baseline measures with those taken immediately after intervention and at a 3 -month follow-up was used in this study. Methods: The myMoves Program comprises 6 modules delivered over 8 weeks via email. Participants were provided with regular weekly contact with an experienced physical therapist via email and telephone. The primary outcomes were the feasibility (participation, attrition, clinician time, accessibility, and adverse events) and acceptability (satisfaction, worthiness of time, and recommendation) of the my Moves Program. The secondary outcomes were objective physical activity data collected from accelerometers, physical activity self-efficacy, psychological distress, and participation. Results: Twenty-four participants commenced the program (20 with stroke, 4 with traumatic injury), and outcomes were collected for 23 and 22 participants immediately after the program and at a 3 -month follow-up, respectively. The program required very little clinician contact time, with an average of 32. 8 minutes (SD = 22. 8) per participant during the 8 -week program. Acceptability was very high, with more than 95 % of participants being either very satisfied or satisfied with the my Moves Program and stating that it was worth their time. All participants stated that they would recommend the program to others with ABI. Limitations: The results were obtained from a small sample; hence, the results may not be generalizable to a larger ABI population. Conclusions: A <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> self-management program aimed at increasing physical activity is feasible and acceptable for adults with ABI.

Compliance and satisfaction with the intervention was good. Treatment fidelity was high for both remote and face to face delivery (1251 / 1421 therapist behaviours were compliant with the protocol). Participants who received therapy improved on picture naming significantly more than controls (mean numerical gains: 20. 2 (remote from University); 41 (remote from clinical site); 30. 8 (face to face); 5. 8 (attention control); p <. 001).

50|$|Ice {{blasting}} {{is the use}} {{of explosives}} to break up ice in rivers, greatly aiding navigation systems. This is done during the spring when snow is melting and river ice is breaking up. There is always a chance that the ice flows could collide creating an ice jam and blocking the river. The river, filled with melt water, will quickly flood and often cause damage to nearby settlements. Thus in most northern areas governments quickly act to break up the ice jams before they can do much damage. This is most easily done with explosives.

40|$|Chronic pain {{is common}} during {{childhood}} and adolescence and is associated with negative outcomes such as increased severity of pain, reduced function (e. g. missing school), and low mood (e. g. high levels of depression and anxiety). Psychological therapies, traditionally delivered face-to-face with a therapist, are efficacious at reducing pain intensity and disability. However, new and innovative technology {{is being used to}} deliver these psychological therapies remotely, meaning barriers to access to treatment such as distance and cost can be removed or reduced. Therapies delivered with technological devices, such as the Internet, computer-based programmes, smartphone applications, or via the telephone, can be used to deliver treatment to children and adolescents with chronic pain. Objectives To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies <b>delivered</b> <b>remotely</b> compared to waiting-list, treatment-as-usual, or active control treatments, for the management of chronic pain in children and adolescents. Search methods We searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) from inception to June 2014 for randomised controlled trials of <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> psychological interventions for children and adolescents (0 to 18 years of age) with chronic pain. We searched for chronic pain conditions including, but not exclusive to, headache, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also searched online trial registries for potential trials. A citation and reference search for all included studies was conducted. Selection criteria All included studies were randomised controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of a psychological therapy <b>delivered</b> <b>remotely</b> via the Internet, smartphone device, computer-based programme, audiotapes, or over the phone in comparison to an active, treatment-as-usual, or waiting-list control. We considered blended treatments, which used a combination of technology and face-to-face interaction. We excluded interventions solely delivered face-to-face between therapist and patient from this review. Children and adolescents (0 to 18 years of age) with a primary chronic pain condition were the target of the interventions. Each comparator arm, at each extraction point had to include 10 or more participants. Data collection and analysis For the analyses, we combined all psychological therapies. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed (non-headache) pain and analysed them separately. Pain, disability, depression, anxiety, and adverse events were extracted as primary outcomes. We also extracted satisfaction with treatment as a secondary outcome. We considered outcomes at two time points: first immediately following the end of treatment (known as 'post-treatment'), and second, any follow-up time point post-treatment between 3 and 12 months (known as 'follow-up'). We assessed all included studies for risk of bias. Main results Eight studies (N = 371) that <b>delivered</b> treatment <b>remotely</b> were identified from our search; five studies investigated children with headache conditions, one study was with children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and two studies included mixed samples of children with headache and mixed (i. e. recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain) chronic pain conditions. The average age of children receiving treatment was 12. 57 years. For headache pain conditions, we found one beneficial effect of <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> psychological therapy. Headache severity was reduced post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) = 2. 65, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 56 to 4. 50, z = 3. 62,p < 0. 01, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2. 88). For mixed pain conditions, we found only one beneficial effect: psychological therapies reduced pain intensity post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) = - 0. 61, 95 % CI - 0. 96 to - 0. 25, z = 3. 38, p < 0. 01). No effects were found for reducing pain at follow-up in either analysis. For headache and mixed conditions, there were no beneficial effects of psychological therapies <b>delivered</b> <b>remotely</b> for disability post-treatment and a lack of data at follow-up meant no analyses could be run. Only one analysis could be conducted for depression outcomes. We found no beneficial effect of psychological therapies in reducing depression post-treatment for headache conditions. Only one study presented data in children with mixed pain conditions for depressive outcomes and no data were available for either condition at follow-up. Only one study presented anxiety data post-treatment and no studies reported follow-up data, therefore no analyses could be run. Further, there were no data available for adverse events, meaning that we are unsure whether psychological therapies are harmful to children who receive them. Satisfaction with treatment is described qualitatively. 'Risk of bias' assessments were low or unclear. We judged selection, detection, and reporting biases to be mostly low risk for included studies. However, judgements made on performance and attrition biases were mostly unclear. Authors' conclusions Psychological therapies <b>delivered</b> <b>remotely,</b> primarily via the Internet, confer benefit in reducing the intensity or severity of pain after treatment across conditions. There is considerable uncertainty around these estimates of effect and only eight studies with 371 children contribute to the conclusions. Future studies are likely to change the conclusions reported here. All included trials used either behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapies for children with chronic pain, therefore we cannot generalise our findings to other therapies. However, satisfaction with these treatments was generally positive. Larger trials are needed to increase our confidence in all conclusions regarding the efficacy of <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> psychological therapies.

The Marine Corps has requested options that offer increased accuracy, lighter payloads, greater stand-off distances and reduced cost. To date, most research has resulted in a series of large, expensive and platform-specific solutions, which do not capitalize on the enhanced range and capability afforded by existing and commercially available unmanned aerial system technology. The systems engineering processes contained in the conceptual and preliminary design phases are utilized to investigate and develop a potentially low-cost alternative to existing systems. Using an Agile methodology, individual components are designed and incorporated into an integrated aerial system that utilizes an autonomously guided and controlled ram-air parachute delivered from an unmanned aerial platform. Employment of the low-cost micro-light weight class of JPADS has the potential to provide all services with a near-term platform to <b>remotely</b> <b>deliver</b> diverse logistical and sensor payloads while minimizing risk to forces.

40|$|Data {{collected}} by sensors {{often have to}} be <b>remotely</b> <b>delivered</b> through multi-hop wireless paths to data sinks connected to application servers for information processing. The position of these sinks has {{a huge impact on}} the quality of the specific Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Indeed, it may create artificial traffic bottlenecks which affect the energy efficiency and the WSN lifetime. This paper considers a heterogeneous network scenario where wireless sensors deliver data to intermediate gateways geared with a diverse wireless technology and interconnected together and to the sink. An optimization framework based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is developed to locate wireless gateways minimizing the overall installation cost and the energy consumption in the WSN, while accounting for multi-hop coverage between sensors and gateways, and connectivity among wireless gateways. A traffic-variable scenario is also considered, where the network can go through high and low traffic operation points, and the topology is optimized accordingly. The proposed ILP formulations are solved to optimality for medium-size instances to analyze the quality of the designed networks, and heuristic algorithms are also proposed to tackle large-scale heterogeneous scenarios...|$|R

50|$|On Christmas Day, Terror got underway. She <b>delivered</b> <b>mines</b> {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} to units at Espiritu Santo and Guadalcanal before arriving at Makin Island on 18 January 1944. The minelayer {{anchored in the}} lagoon while her boats surveyed the passes in the reef. She then readied a self-propelled barge to mine the channels. She departed Makin on the 28th and proceeded independently to Tarawa where she embarked Mine Detail 19. On 31 January 1945, she got underway for Pearl Harbor and took on passengers for transportation to San Francisco. After a three-day stay, she departed the west coast on 21 February with over 500 passengers on board, accommodated on a temporary wooden deck constructed over the tracks on the mine deck. She discharged her passengers at Pearl Harbor on the 26th; then steamed on to Majuro, where she arrived on 10 March.|$|R
