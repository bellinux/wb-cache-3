50|$|Fronto-cerebellar {{dissociation}} is the disconnection {{and independent}} function of frontal and cerebellar {{regions of the}} brain. It is characterized by inhibited communication between the two regions, and is notably observed in cases of ADHD, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, and heroin abuse. The frontal and cerebellar regions make distinctive contributions to cognitive performance, with the left-frontal activations being responsible for selecting <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stimulus, while the right-cerebellar activation {{is responsible for the}} search for <b>a</b> given <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stimulus. Left-frontal activation increases when there are many appropriate <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stimulus, and right-cerebellar activation increases when there is <b>a</b> single appropriate <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stimulus. A person with dissociated frontal and cerebellar regions may have difficulties with selecting <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stimuli, or difficulties with response initiation. Fronto-cerebellar dissociation can often result in either the frontal lobe or the cerebellum becoming more active in place of the less active region as a compensatory effect.|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Depression Six {{while it was}} centered about 1,150miles (1,850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles on September3. Later that day, the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Erika. It moved west-northwestward and steadily intensified to attain hurricane status on September4. Erika passed a short distance {{to the north of}} the Lesser Antilles, and later turned to the north in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> approaching trough. The hurricane quickly strengthen to reach peak winds of 125mph (195km/h) on September8, and after maintaining peak strength for 24hours Erika weakened over cooler waters. It turned to the east, weakened to a tropical storm, and became extratropical after passing near the Azores on September15.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 27. Initially, virgorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235miles (375km) east-southeast of Barbuda.|$|E
5|$|Around 0000UTC on September25, the {{disturbance}} was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression. Shortly after, the NHC issued their first advisory {{on the system}} as it intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Kyle.

Kyle track northward in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States. The sheared structure of the storm led to problems with recording the intensity of the storm throughout the day. Hurricane Hunters continuously flew into the storm to record information; however, their estimates were considered too high as the storm was disorganized.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Britain {{commenced}} {{a nuclear}} weapons project, known as Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged it with the American Manhattan Project.

The project was called High Explosive Research, and was directed by Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, with William Penney in charge of bomb design.|$|E
5|$|Few {{details are}} {{known about the}} {{production}} of the film, but it was shot on a beach resort and used a miniature train.

The film was the first release by the new Joker productions, which was dedicated to producing only short comedy films. Kalton C. Lahue and Samuel Gill credit this production as being Louise Fazenda's film debut. Film historian Richard E. Braff notes that Allen Curtis as the writer, but provides no directorial credits. The single reel production was released on October 25, 1913.|$|E

40|$|Oxytocin is a {{neurohormone}} {{that has}} been correlated with lactation, uterine-contractions, postpartum behavior, pro-social behavior, trust, empathy, and decreased anxiety. In addition, oxytocin is believed to underscore the tend-and-befriend <b>response</b> <b>to</b> stress. In this study, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol and oxytocin levels were measured in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> social stressor in human participants. Oxytocin was initially seen to increase with ACTH and cortisol in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> social stressor. As levels of oxytocin increase, levels of ACTH and cortisol were shown to decrease or plateau. I conclude that oxytocin is released in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> perceived stressor and display inhibitory effects over ACTH and cortisol...|$|R

5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E
