5|$|Every {{night after}} shooting, editor Colin Goudie and his {{assistant}} Justin Hall would download the footage so the memory sticks could be cleared and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. While new footage was being captured, the previously filmed footage was edited at the production team's hotel. After filming concluded, the crew had over 100 hours of footage. The original cut was over four hours long but was trimmed to 94 minutes after eight months of editing. Edwards originally had {{the ending of the}} film both at the beginning and the end. He and the film's producers disagreed about the placement, so he decided to put the chronological ending of the film {{at the beginning and end}} the film immediately after Andrew and Samantha kiss.|$|E
5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E
5|$|In England's second innings, Lindwall bounced Washbrook and the England opener {{went for}} the hook shot. The ball flew in the air {{straight}} towards fine leg, where Hassett dropped {{the ball on the}} third attempt. At the time, Washbrook was on 21. The English batsman had moved to 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman before humorously gesturing to indicate that he was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> catch, much to the amusement of the crowd. On 80, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack. After the day's play, Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink; England were in a strong position at 3/174, with an overall lead of 316. Luckily for Australia, the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little. Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition to their score midway through the last day; the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain. Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to reach 1/92 and ensure that the match ended in a draw.|$|E

25|$|In {{applications}} that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition camcorder {{may require a}} card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used.

25|$|The {{defoliation}} {{of vital}} enemy strongholds, transportation routes, and crops forced the communists to vigorously defend against the spraying. Ranch Hand aircraft regularly received damage on missions—considering their low altitude, low speed and large size, they {{were easy to}} hit. Ranch Hand maintainers worked constantly {{to repair the damage}} and get their UC-123s <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> mission. In addition to engines and flight controls shot out, and several crewmen wounded and killed, Ranch Hand lost five UC-123s in combat between 1966 and 1968.|$|E
5000|$|The {{other major}} method used to {{simulate}} microgravity is flight in a reduced gravity aircraft (a so-called [...] "vomit comet"), an aircraft which performs {{a number of}} parabolic climbs and descents to give its occupants the sensation of zero gravity. Reduced-gravity aircraft training avoids neutral-buoyancy training's drag problem (trainees are surrounded by air rather than water), but instead faces a severe time limitation: periods of sustained weightlessness are limited to around 25 seconds, interspersed with periods of acceleration of around 2 g as the aircraft pulls out of its dive and <b>readies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> run. This is unsuitable for practicing EVAs, which usually last several hours.|$|R

25|$|Rodgers dodged another Stanford {{player and}} took the ball to his right, {{toward the middle of}} the field, where at least four other Cal players were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> pitch. Around the Stanford 45, Rodgers pitched the ball to Mariet Ford, who caught it in stride. Meanwhile, the Stanford band, all 144 members, had run out past the south end zone—the one the Cal players were trying to get to—and had {{advanced}} as far as twenty yards downfield. The scrum of players was moving towards them.|$|E
25|$|The 46-caliber21-K was {{a minimal}} {{adaptation}} of the 53-K anti-tank gun that was created by taking the latter's barrel and mounting it on a simple pedestal mount. Its semi-automatic breech automatically ejected the cartridge case and locked open, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round. This was less than ideal for an anti-aircraft weapon that relied on its rate of fire to inflict damage on aircraft because every round had to be hand-loaded. Fully automatic weapons of roughly this caliber like the 40 mm Bofors typically used 4-5 round clips of ammunition to produce rates of fire four times as high.|$|E
25|$|The first {{track was}} {{completed}} in 1835, and freight service began immediately. The solid granite roadbed proved to be much too rigid, jolting the engine and cars nearly to pieces. Repairs on the locomotives (there were two at the time) would sometimes take most of the night, {{trying to get them}} <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day's service. The much poorer Boston and Worcester Railroad could not afford a granite bed and so was built with modern wooden ties.

25|$|The use {{of black}} blow fly maggots in maggot therapy is common. After the maggots have hatched, they are {{carefully}} monitored {{until they reach}} roughly 2 to 3mm in length; at this point they are <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> step. Within 24 to 36 hours of hatching, the maggots are tested for their sterility; if they pass the rigorous tests, then they {{may be used in}} maggot therapy. These maggots are placed onto a sterile piece of gauze which is laid over the wound of the patient. The maggots will proceed through the gauze to the open wound, where they will then begin their work. When they are full-grown, they leave the wound and enter the gauze for the purpose of pupating. They are then removed with the waste gauze and disposed of properly.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed an}} obvious {{progression}} to use Fowler’s latest steam-driven plough for normal ploughing, {{rather than just}} drainage channels. However normal ploughing was much lighter work that could be achieved perfectly well {{by a team of}} horses and in comparison the steam-driven plough was rather cumbersome. One way of improving the plough’s efficiency would be to design a plough that could plough in either direction without having to be turned round. Fowler achieved this by designing a frame for the plough that had two ploughs attached as a kind of see-saw. One of the two plough blades would be swung down to make contact with the soil, depending on the direction the plough was to travel. At the end of each furrow the anchored pulleys would be moved slightly <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> furrow.|$|E
25|$|On the {{following}} Thursday, during on-going negotiations, team officials definitively told the JPBPA that a one-year freeze on the BlueWave/Buffaloes merger, {{one of the}} three demands set by the association to avoid a strike, was impossible. Two Internet service companies had applied to start new Japanese baseball teams {{in the wake of the}} professional leagues losing a team, however NPB representatives maintained that the 2006 season would be the earliest a new team could enter. The players wanted any new teams <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> season. Negotiations continued into Friday and lasted four hours past the 5 PM deadline, however, no agreement was reached and the players proceeded to stage the first and only strike in Japanese professional baseball history. The two-day strike occurred on Saturday and Sunday, September 18–19, 2004. All 12games scheduled for that weekend were cancelled as a result of the strike. The following Thursday, with the strike set to continue the during the upcoming weekend, players and team management came to an agreement. Players agreed not to stage a strike for the second straight weekend after team representatives eased the rules of entry for new teams into the professional leagues and that one would be allowed to join {{the following}} season.|$|E

Nonetheless {{there is a}} subtle undertone of something sinister in the Baron's attitude, further emphasized by veiled, ambiguous warnings from the ville's sec boss, Harry Guiteau, {{as well as the}} extreme security measures in place throughout the ville. The following day the companions are invited to participate in a series of public, competitive challenges, which they accept. The first challenge pits Michael against the ville's jailer, Jericho, in unarmed wrestling. Michael wins the first bout, only to be sucker-punched by Jericho as her <b>readies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round.

The Target Area will provide appropriate in-chamber conditions before, during, and after each shot. The repeated introduction of large amounts of laser energy into the chamber and emission of fusion energy from targets represents a new challenge in ICF facility design. Prior to a shot, the facility provides proper illumination geometry, target chamber vacuum, and a stable platform <b>for</b> <b>the</b> target and its diagnostics. During a shot, the impact of the energy introduced into the chamber is minimized, and workers and the public are protected from excessive prompt radiation doses.
