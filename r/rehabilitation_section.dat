It describes factors that can affect postoperative progress and presents guidelines that should be followed during rehabilitation after semiconstrained and unconstrained types of implants. It also describes lifetime regime measures and recommendations for the patient. The theoretical part is compiled from the available Czech and foreign sources. The practical part is a case study of two patients with implanted semiconstrained total elbow arthroplasty.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the inter-rater {{reliability of the}} Early Functional Abilities (EFA) scale. Design: An observational study of inter-rater reliability in an open cohort. Patients: Twenty-four patients with traumatic brain injury in need of medical or surgical intervention in the early <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>section</b> of the intensive care unit. Methods: The EFA was assessed by 4 different professions in the rehabilitation team. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using linear weighted kappa statistics. Results: The overall weighted kappa values of the different EFA items varied from 0. 27 to 0. 60. The items in the sensorimotor functional area had the highest pairwise agreement, with a mean kappa range of 0. 68 - 0. 76. The vegetative stability, position tolerance and wakefulness items had the lowest mean kappa values (0. 49, 0. 33 and 0. 49, respectively). Agreement was good to excellent between the occupational therapist and physiotherapist across {{the majority of the}} items, whereas the physician and nurse agreed less with one another.

The study is primarily descriptive: we wanted to find out how care programming was being implemented in different places in 1992 / 93, the obstacles encountered, the impact on existing systems and the costs of care packages delivered. As such, we did not attempt to measure the effectiveness for service users of the care programme approach, but rather to carry out some of the groundwork required to define it and differentiate it from other systems of mental health care. This needs to be done before its relationship to user outcomes can be tested.

40|$|Despite major {{improvements}} in diagnostics and interventional therapies, cardiovascular diseases remain a major {{health care and}} socio-economic burden both in western and developing countries, in which this burden is increasing in close correlation to economic growth. Health authorities and the general population have started {{to recognize that the}} fight against these diseases can only be won if their burden is faced by increasing our investment on interventions in lifestyle changes and prevention. There is an overwhelming evidence of the efficacy of secondary prevention initiatives including cardiac rehabilitation in terms of reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, secondary prevention is still too poorly implemented in clinical practice, often only on selected populations and over a limited period of time. The development of systematic and full comprehensive preventive programmes is warranted, integrated in the organization of national health systems. Furthermore, systematic monitoring of the process of delivery and outcomes is a necessity. Cardiology and secondary prevention, including cardiac rehabilitation, have evolved almost independently of each other and although each makes a unique contribution it is now time to join forces under the banner of preventive cardiology and create a comprehensive model that optimizes long term outcomes for patients and reduces the future burden on health care services. These are the aims that the Cardiac <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Section</b> of the European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention & Rehabilitation has foreseen to promote secondary preventive cardiology in clinical practice...|$|E

This exothermic generation {{can be used as}} a possible heating source for hyperthermia therapy. The current study reports the dispersible and exothermic properties with NIR irradiation for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) treated with a strong acid (acid-treated SWNTs), and the SWNTs further functionalized with double-stranded DNA (DNA-functionalized SWNTs: DNA-SWNTs). DNA-SWNTs significantly improved the dispersibility of SWNTs when compared with the acid-treated SWNTs. The binding ratio of the acid-treated SWNT and DNA was calculated to be 3. 1 (DNA/SWNTs) from the phosphorous content in the DNA-SWNT. This interaction of the SWNTs and DNA would contribute to the stable dispersion of the DNA-SWNTs in a culture medium. With NIR irradiation by a halogen lamp light source, the acid-treated SWNTs and the DNA-SWNTs showed strong heat evolution in vitro (in a culture medium) and in vivo (in the subcutaneous tissue of a mouse) condition without any invasive effect on the non-SWNT area. The results of this study suggested that the functionalization with DNA was an efficient approach to improve the dispersibility of SWNTs in body fluids, and the DNA-SWNT would be a promising source for photo-induced exothermic generation.
