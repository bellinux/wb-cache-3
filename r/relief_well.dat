5|$|Tropical Depression Five was an Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone {{that lasted for}} 12hours, although its remnants persisted for almost another week. Its precursor was from a non-tropical trough east of Florida, and on August10 it developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. It was the fifth depression of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. The system was declassified as a {{tropical cyclone}} the following day, a remnant circulation later moved over Louisiana and Mississippi, producing heavy rainfall and causing flooding. Along the Florida coast, the system produced heavy waves that contributed to two deaths. Moving inland, {{the remnants of the}} depression reached central Alabama before turning southward. The system nearly redeveloped into a tropical cyclone on August16 after it again reached the Gulf of Mexico, but it became disorganized and turned northward into Mississippi. The depression twice caused BP to delay work in building a <b>relief</b> <b>well</b> to combat the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.|$|E
25|$|The BP {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico {{affected}} Florida's number one industry, which is tourism. The lack of a <b>relief</b> <b>well</b> prevented company officials from shutting down the leak immediately. Instead, it took months to drill a new <b>relief</b> <b>well,</b> while {{millions of gallons of}} oil gushed into the Gulf each week. In response, Grayson introduced the Emergency <b>Relief</b> <b>Well</b> Act, which would require that an emergency <b>relief</b> <b>well</b> be drilled {{at the same time as}} any new exploratory well.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the system dropped locally heavy rainfall in portions of southern Florida. Palm Beach International Airport recorded [...] on August8, a record for the date. The system spawned a weak tornado near Boca Raton, which downed a few trees and damaged shingles from one house. In Sarasota, high tides from the system affected 200sea turtle nests, of which 20 had to be transported to a safer location. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the developing system threatened the area affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; this prompted BP to stop operations temporarily in constructing a <b>relief</b> <b>well.</b> The same event occurred a week later when the depression was threatening to redevelop.|$|E
40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>wells</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} to relieve excess hydrostatic pressure in pervious foundation strata overlain by impervious top strata, conditions which often exist landward of levees and downstream of dams and hydraulic structures. Placing well outlets in below-surface trenches or collector pipes helps dry up seepage areas downstream of levees and dams. <b>Relief</b> <b>wells</b> {{are often used}} in combination with seepage control measures, such as upstream blankets, downstream seepage berms, and grouting. Draining seepage water into <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> decreases uplift and prevents piping. This study examined the effect of <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> with different diameters at different distances downstream of a homogeneous earth dam using Seep/W software. Also the effect of upstream water level of reservoir on seepage flow to each well was carried out. Results show that by decreasing the distance between <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> and increasing {{the diameter of the}} <b>relief</b> <b>wells,</b> total uplift pressure decreases. The optimum distance between <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> to decrease uplift pressure was found to be 5 m. The proposed method is recommended in designing <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> by providing optimum diameter and distance of wells for the sustained yield...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} Dutch way to {{deal with}} piping failure in river dikes is the implementation of piping berms.

2500|$|Late on February 6, the {{day after}} the spill washed ashore, President Richard Nixon {{announced}} a complete cessation of drilling, as well as production, in federal waters of the Santa Barbara Channel, with the solitary exception of the <b>relief</b> <b>well</b> being drilled to intersect the blown-out borehole. [...] Still the spill continued to spew from fissures in the ocean floor, undiminished, and by noon on February 7 a $1.3 billion class action lawsuit had been filed against Union Oil and their partners on Platform A. [...] On the platform itself, workers labored continuously to try to kill the well. [...] They made their final attempt that afternoon and evening, pumping [...] of the heaviest available drilling mud into the well at pressures of thousands of pounds per square inch. [...] They had almost exhausted their supply of mud when the oil and gas boiling up from the ocean began to slow down, and by 8:00p.m. it had stopped. [...] Delivering the coup de grâce, the crews rammed over 1,000 sacks of concrete into the well. [...] Well A-21 would leak no more. [...] Approximately [...] of oil had already spilled into the ocean at this point; but there was more to come.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} Dutch way to {{deal with}} piping for river levees is the implementation of piping berms. The disadvantage of such a measure is the inland space required, especially in urban areas. <b>Relief</b> <b>wells,</b> on the other hand, require less or no inland space and therefore represent an attractive solution as mitigation measure against piping. The aims of this research are first, to show how reliability analysis of <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> systems can be carried out, and second to examine the costs required to achieve a reliability target for piping failure, as set in the Netherlands. The outcomes of this analysis will help comparing <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> with piping berms in economic terms. To obtain these results, the statistical parameters of the influencing variables are studied using both, the collected data from existing projects in the Netherlands, and data from relevant literature. A reliability-based design approach is followed to estimate the reliability of <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> systems. In order to establish the limit state functions, the assessment methods recommended by the Dutch flood defence regulations are used. Applying the probabilistic axioms it is possible to resemble piping failure as a parallel system assessing uplift and heave failure mechanisms. To estimate the hydraulic head in <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> system, the United States Corps of Engineers method is applied, as well as the latest developments in flood risk analysis, achieved by the VNK project, which are used to determine the reliability target. To estimate the probability of failure and the system reliability, MCS and FORM methods are utilized. A tailor-made comprehensive tool is built in Matlab to compute the hydraulic head in <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> system and to perform the probabilistic analysis. Subsequently, a LLC analysis is performed with the aim to account for the life cycle of <b>relief</b> <b>wells.</b> A comparison of the net present value of the two alternatives (<b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> and piping berms) is made. Finally, analysis of two case studies with different scenarios are performed to show the possible economic advantages of installing <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> and sensitivity analysis is used to underpin the robustness of the conclusions. The results show that, using USACE method, the blanket and the aquifer permeability, as well as the hydraulic losses, are the dominant variables (from the 'load' side). The sensitivity factors show high discrepancy between partially and fully penetrated wells. Even when the entrance losses cannot be accurately predicted, a total clogging scenario of the filter can be neglected. One main limitation for the applicability of <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> system, {{is that there is a}} maximum achievable head reduction. This maximum head reduction is limited to the minimum possible well spacing (a>D/ 4). Results from the case studies show that <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> are a cost-effective as piping mitigation measure, outperforming piping berms. This advantage can be up to a factor of ten regarding initial investment. This allows accounting for a shorter life cycle for <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> in order to equate the same LCC as piping berms.

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} an {{on-going}} discussion about piping safety for dikes in the Netherlands. <b>Relief</b> <b>wells</b> represent an attractive solution as mitigation measure against piping, saving hinterland space. Nevertheless, they have been disregarded due to the uncertainties in its performance over its life cycle. The aim of this contribution is to demonstrate a probabilistic design of <b>relief</b> <b>wells</b> systems using fully and approximated probabilistic methods. We compare the results with the reliability target for piping as set in the Netherlands. For this purpose, statistical parameters of the influencing variables were studied, using collected data from existing projects or field observations in the Netherlands.
