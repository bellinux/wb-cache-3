5|$|Writer-director Bertino was {{inspired}} by two real-life events: the Manson family Tate murders, a multiple homicide that occurred in California in 1969; {{and a series of}} break-ins that occurred in his own neighborhood as a child. Made on a budget of $9 million, the film was shot on location in <b>rural</b> <b>South</b> Carolina in the fall of 2006. At the 2007 San Diego Comic Con, Bertino appeared with stars Tyler and Speedman, and premiered a teaser trailer promoting the film.|$|E
5|$|Blues is a {{combination}} of African work songs, field hollers, and shouts. It developed in the <b>rural</b> <b>South</b> {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century. The most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale, with a flatted or indeterminate third, as well as the typically lamenting lyrics; though both of these elements had existed in African American folk music prior to the 20th century, the codified form of modern blues (such as with the AAB structure) did not exist until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the <b>rural</b> <b>South</b> to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E

25|$|The {{collapse}} of cotton production {{contributed to the}} Great Migration of the early 20th century, when a total of 1.5 million African Americans left the <b>rural</b> <b>South</b> for jobs in northern and midwestern cities.

Today, African-Americans are concentrated in the eastern and southern Tidewater and Piedmont regions where plantation agriculture was the most dominant. The western mountains were settled primarily by people of heavily Scots-Irish ancestry.

25|$|A need to {{conserve}} the remaining life in 88-seater railcars for weekend services on the Christchurch–Greymouth route meant that, from 1975, the Vulcans were used on some Invercargill–Dunedin–Christchurch (Main South Line) services {{to supplement the}} 88-seater railcars. The use of Vulcans on the Otago Central Line, and between Christchurch and Invercargill, ceased in April 1976. The last use of a Vulcan was on the Greymouth–Christchurch evening service on 9 September 1978, ending nearly 38 years of heavy use of Vulcans in the <b>rural</b> <b>South</b> Island.|$|E
