5|$|Following the {{advanced}} course, Middleton {{spent the summer}} as the senior instructor at a Reserve Officer Training Camp at Fort Logan, Colorado, then returned to Camp Benning for one more year {{as a member of}} the Infantry Board. Four years at Benning had been enough for him and he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on. After expressing his wishes to a senior officer, he was assigned to Fort Leavenworth in the summer of 1923, a place he had been eleven years earlier to prepare for his officer's commission.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1944, the Second Panzer Army was finally <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, {{originally}} planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation Rübezahl (Mountain Spirit), the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation Hackfleisch (Minced Meat). Hackfleisch aimed to drive out the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj, Vlasenica, Sokolac and Olovo, south of the security zone. The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the pincers of the other units, thereby destroying them.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. The country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> them to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E

5|$|By early 1101, Henry's {{new regime}} was {{established}} and functioning, {{but many of}} the Anglo-Norman elite still supported Robert, or would be prepared to switch sides if Henry's elder brother appeared likely to gain power in England. In February, Flambard escaped from the Tower of London and crossed the Channel to Normandy, where he injected fresh direction and energy to Robert's attempts to mobilise an invasion force. By July, Robert had formed an army and a fleet, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> against Henry in England. Raising the stakes in the conflict, Henry seized Flambard's lands and, with the support of Anselm, Flambard was removed from his position as bishop. Henry held court in April and June, where the nobility renewed their oaths of allegiance to him, but their support still appeared partial and shaky.|$|E
5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, {{should be a}} priority of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working on}} plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward push—on March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the British side, General Clinton {{learned of}} the almost undefended Jamaica Pass from local Loyalists. He drew up a plan {{and gave it to}} William Erskine to propose to Howe. Clinton's plan had the main army making a night march and going through the Jamaica Pass to turn the American flank, while other troops would keep the Americans busy in front. On August 26, Clinton {{received}} word from Howe that the plan would be used, and that Clinton was to command the advance guard of the main army of 10,000 men on the march through the Jamaica Pass. While they made the night march, General James Grant's British troops along with some Hessians, a total of 4,000 men, were to attack the Americans in front to distract them from the main army coming on their flank. Howe told Clinton to be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out that night, August 26.|$|E
50|$|By the {{decision}} of the Swedish Riksdag in 1959 Stockholm University College was ordered <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Frescati located outside the Centre of the town.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 6, around 8:00 or 8:30a.m., Grant's {{flagship}} stopped alongside Wallace's boat moored at Crump's Landing and gave orders for the 3rd Division to be held <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in any direction. Wallace concentrated his troops at Stoney Lonesome, although his westernmost brigade remained at Adamsville. He then waited for further orders, which arrived between 11 and 11:30a.m. Grant ordered Wallace to move his unit up to join the Union right, {{a move that would}} have been in support of Sherman's 5th Division, which was encamped around Shiloh Church when the battle began. The written orders, transcribed from verbal orders that Grant gave to an aide, were lost during the battle and controversy remains over their wording. Wallace maintained that he was not ordered to Pittsburg Landing, which was to the left rear of the army, or told which road to use. Grant later claimed that he ordered Wallace to Pittsburg Landing by way of the River Road (also called the Hamburg–Savannah Road).|$|E
5|$|Unaware that Humbert had {{surrendered}} and {{the rebellion}} been defeated, the French prepared a follow-up expedition {{under the command}} of Commodore Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart. Three thousand men were embarked aboard the ship of the line Hoche and eight frigates, the force departing Brest on 16 September. However, having missed Savary's frigate squadron, the Royal Navy were more watchful; roving frigate patrols cruised off the principal French ports and in the approaches to Ireland, while squadrons of battleships from the Channel Fleet sailed nearby, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> against any new invasion force. In command of the squadron on the Irish station was Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, a highly experienced officer (and politician) who had {{made a name for himself}} raiding the French coast early in the war.|$|E
5|$|Montcalm, before {{agreeing to}} these terms, {{tried to make}} sure that his Indian allies {{understood}} them, and that the chiefs would undertake to restrain their men. This process was complicated by the diversity within the Indian camp, which included some warriors who spoke languages not understood by any European present. The British garrison was then evacuated from the fort to the entrenched camp, and Monro was quartered in the French camp. The Indians then entered the fort and plundered it, butchering some of the wounded and sick that the British had left behind. The French guards posted around the entrenched camp were only somewhat successful at keeping the Indians out of that area, and it took much effort to prevent plunder and scalping there. Montcalm and Monro initially planned to march the prisoners south the following morning, but after seeing the Indian bloodlust, decided to attempt the march that night. When the Indians became aware that the British were getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> a large number of them massed around the camp, causing the leaders to call off the march until morning.|$|E
50|$|When Morley's group {{arrived at}} the camp, they found William Reed stripped, scalped, and disemboweled a short {{distance}} from the wagons. Luke and Nelson's throats were cut; they were also disemboweled. The Morley party emptied the wagons of their grain and then loaded three of the bodies for transport to Nephi, Utah (Clark's body later being found by a relative) and as the party <b>readied</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on, numerous Utes appeared on the hillside. Oral tradition holds that Morley, angry over disobedience to his orders, denied the dead men burial in the town cemetery. Their gravesites are unknown, despite efforts to locate the remains of the four men.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{on to the next}} news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware {{that he was going to}} lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} rested {{here when}} the men, horses and several hundred Ottoman prisoners were watered and fed. During {{this time a}} squadron led by armoured cars went ahead to reconnoitre the track across the Mount Carmel Range from Sindiane through the Abu Shusheh Pass. The reconnaissance group reported the track across the Abu Shusheh pass rough and in a bad repair. Macandrews informed Chauvel that his division would not be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from Liktera before 18:15 when the 13th and 14th Cavalry Brigades would advance without wheels to negotiate the pass at night. As a consequence the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade remained to guard the guns. The artillery and the Jodhpur and 1st Hyderabad Lancers, were to follow at daylight on 20 September, while the Mysore Lancers waited at Liktera for the division's transport, which they were to guard. Chauvel arrived at Liktera after midnight on 19/20 September when he ordered the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade to take the 5th Cavalry Division's guns via J'ara and Abu Shushe. They arrived at Abu Shusheh at 03:00 and rejoin their division at Afulah during the night.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica, {{which was}} {{forecast}} {{to bear the}} brunt of Hurricane Dean, underwent the most extensive preparations. The Jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans, including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections, to allow residents to prepare for the storm. Curfews were put in place for parts of the island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work. More than 1,000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. Evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1,000 water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stocks in nearby Haiti, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> them to Jamaica if they were needed. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team tried to reach Jamaica, but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled. The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed, and the North-West Caribbean Donor Group met to decide what actions would need to be taken.|$|E

50|$|The Markgräflerhof is a baroque {{palace in}} Basel, Switzerland, {{built by the}} margraves of Baden-Durlach, who used it as an {{extraterritorial}} residence as their principality including its residences was often the victim of wars and armies. The margraves had several residences in Basel, but the construction of current palace started under margrave Frederick VII in 1698 when a fire destroyed the previous building. The palace was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>moved</b> in by 1705. The architect was an entrepreneur Augé who based himself on plans from a book by the French architect Charles Daviller. Frederick VII's successor Charles III William also often used the palace. But afterwards, the margraves predominantly resided in Karlsruhe. The city of Basel purchased the palace in 1807 and the University Hospital of Basel uses the building since 1842.|$|R
