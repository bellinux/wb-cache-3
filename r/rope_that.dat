5|$|Suzy Kline's book, Horrible Harry Moves {{up to the}} Third Grade {{features}} a story on Starkey's deadly escape. The account {{is given to the}} characters by a guide, stating Starkey's amassing of the $100 and bribery of a guard. The fictional guide also states that the guard provided the information on the way to escape, and deliberately chose not to warn Starkey of the frayed <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> would cause his fatal fall.|$|E
5|$|Now at his wit's end, Presto storms {{backstage}} {{to catch}} Alec, but he accidentally releases a weight holding down some stage props, and his foot gets {{caught in a}} <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> lifts {{him up to the}} fly space above the stage. When his foot comes loose from the rope, he falls, along with suspended scenery (including a piano). Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the apparently restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show, and they are rewarded for each show they do, with roses for Presto and carrots for Alec.|$|E
25|$|After initial {{tightening}} of the verticals, a djembe is tuned by creating twists in the verticals to shorten them (Mali weave). With {{more than one}} completed row of twists, the vertical rope forms diamond shapes that can be quite decorative. Well-applied Mali weave keeps the <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> runs across the verticals horizontal, without gradually climbing up in a spiral pattern.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{buildings of}} Tuvalu used plants and trees from the native broadleaf forest, including timber from: Pouka, (Hernandia peltata); Ngia or Ingia bush, (Pemphis acidula); Miro, (Thespesia populnea); Tonga, (Rhizophora mucronata); Fau or Fo fafini, or woman's fibre tree (Hibiscus tiliaceus). and fibre from: coconut; Ferra, native fig (Ficus aspem); Fala, screw pine or Pandanus. The buildings were constructed without nails and were lashed and tied {{together with a}} plaited sennit <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> was handmade from dried coconut fibre.|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} climbed on July 24, 1938 by Andreas Heckmair, Ludwig Vörg, Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek, a German–Austrian group. The group had {{originally}} {{consisted of two}} independent teams; Harrer and Kasparek were joined on the face by Heckmair and Vörg, who had started their ascent a day later and had been helped by the fixed <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> the lead group had left across the Hinterstoisser Traverse. The two groups, led by the experienced Heckmair, cooperated on the more difficult later pitches, and finished the climb roped together as a single group of four.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{research}} on the social loafing effect began in 1913 with Max Ringelmann's study. He found that when he asked {{a group of men}} to pull on a <b>rope,</b> <b>that</b> they did not pull as hard collectively as they did when each was pulling alone. This research did not distinguish whether this {{was the result of the}} individuals in a group putting in less effort or of poor coordination within the group. In 1974, Alan Ingham, James Graves, and colleagues replicated Ringelmann's experiment using two types of group: 1) Groups with real participants in groups of various sizes (consistent with Ringelmann's setup) or 2) Pseudo-groups with only one real participant. In the pseudo-groups, the researchers' assistants only pretended to pull on the rope.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} three or four hours' sail Geoffrey and Lionel {{acquired}} much nautical knowledge. They learned {{the difference between the}} mainmast and the mizzen, found that all the strong <b>ropes</b> <b>that</b> kept the masts erect and stiff were called stays, <b>that</b> the <b>ropes</b> <b>that</b> hoist sails are called halliards, and that sheets is the name given to the <b>ropes</b> <b>that</b> restrain the sails at the lower corner, and are used to haul them in more tightly when sailing close to the wind, or to ease them off when the wind is favourable. They also learned that the yards {{at the head of the}} main and mizzen sails are called gaffs, and those at the bottom, booms.|$|R

25|$|Modern dory {{designers}} include Phil Bolger of Gloucester and John Welsford of New Zealand. Most modern dories {{are about}} 15–16 feet long, built of lightweight plywood, fastened by fibreglass tape and epoxy resin. They are much lighter than traditional dories and {{compensate for the}} lack of initial stability by having slightly wider bottoms and very low (8inch high) seats and are fitted with skegs for directional stability. Welsford recommends the carrying of a water container on a <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> can be thrown to either the bow or stern to adjust trim in different sea conditions. Unlike a conventional wide bottom dinghy it is dangerous to sit or stand in the extreme ends due to the minimal displacement. Modern designs, like their traditional counterparts, gain significant stability when heavily laden amidships.|$|E
25|$|At first, Mary is as {{rude and}} sour as ever. She dislikes her new home, {{the people living}} in it, and most of all, the bleak moor on which it sits. However, a good-natured maid named Martha Sowerby tells Mary about the late Mrs Craven, who would spend hours in a private walled garden growing roses. Mrs Craven died after an {{accident}} in the garden, and the devastated Mr. Craven locked the garden and buried the key. Mary becomes interested in finding the secret garden herself, and her ill manners begin to soften as a result. Soon she comes to enjoy the company of Martha, the gardener Ben Weatherstaff, and a friendly robin redbreast. Her health and attitude improve, and she grows stronger as she explores the moor and plays with a skipping <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> Mrs Sowerby buys for her. Mary wonders about both the secret garden and the mysterious cries that echo through the house at night.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} the three guides came back, {{traversing}} the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, {{with one hand and}} one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly.|$|E

500|$|Half Dome is a {{prominent}} and iconic granite dome that rises [...] {{above the floor}} of Yosemite Valley. It was first climbed on October 12, 1875, by the Scottish blacksmith of Yosemite Valley, George C. Anderson. A <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> Anderson laid was used by six men, including 61-year-old Galen Clark, and one woman, to scale the last [...] of Half Dome. [...] Anderson's rope was repaired several times and was replaced in 1919 by a stairway built by the Sierra Club.|$|E
500|$|Another group, under Volney C. Wilson, was {{responsible}} for instrumentation. They also fabricated the control rods, which were cadmium sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent neutron absorber, and the scram line, a Manila <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction. Richard Fox, who made the control-rod mechanism for the pile, remarked that the manual speed control that the operator had over the rods was simply a variable resistor, controlling an electric motor that would [...] the clothesline wire over a pulley that also had two lead weights attached to ensure it would fail-safe and return to its zero position when released.|$|E
500|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene where}} Alex swims underneath {{the ship was}} filmed in the Tongue of the Ocean {{off the coast of}} New Providence in the Bahamas. The location was chosen due to its water clarity, however, after viewing dailies of the scene, De Bont felt the water was too clear, so it was reshot with divers above the camera dusting the area in front of the lens with sediment to alter the clarity of the footage. [...] The scene was filmed underneath a propeller-less barge that was designed to resemble the Seabourn Legend. To provide a sense of velocity in the scene, the barge was towed by tugboats at one and a half knots. The production crew did not have a winch system available for the underwater shoot as depicted in the scene, so a pulley system was created by feeding Patric a <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> was attached to the axle of a car that drove along the barge.|$|E

500|$|During {{the retreat}} from Arrah, Ross Mangles and William Fraser McDonell (civilian magistrates, and {{personal}} friends of Wake, who {{had volunteered to}} serve with Dunbar's expedition) earned the Victoria Cross—Mangles, despite being wounded, carried a wounded soldier from the 37th Regiment of Foot for several miles while under fire, and McDonnell exposed himself to heavy fire to cut a <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> was preventing a boat from making its escape, saving the lives of 35 soldiers. The steamer carrying the expedition returned to Dinapore on 30 July, and families and friends were waiting at the dock expecting to welcome home the victorious men. When the steamer docked outside the hospital instead of at its usual berth, the spectators realised something was wrong. In the words of Tayler: [...] "The scene that ensued was heart-rending, the soldiers' wives rushed down, screaming, {{to the edge of}} the water, beating their breasts and tearing their hair, despondency and despair were depicted on every countenance." [...] Out of 415 men, the expedition had suffered 170 fatalities and 120 wounded.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{returned}} {{to the police station}} and charged William with Ellen's murder. Ellen's jewellery, found in William's pockets, was confiscated. A preliminary search of the premises revealed chalk graffiti on the rear door of the flat, which read [...] "Jack Ripper [...] is at the back of this door", and on the stairwell leading up {{from the rear of the}} property, which read [...] "Jack Ripper is in this seller [...] ". The press and the police thought they had been written by a local boy before the tragedy, but the writer was never identified. A more extensive search the following morning found blood-stained clothing in the crate that had contained the body, and the remains of more clothing and some of Ellen's personal effects burned in the fireplace. The flat was bereft of furniture, indicating that it may have been burnt on the fire, either for heat or to destroy evidence. A large penknife was found with human flesh and blood upon it, and the <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> William had bought on the morning of 4 February was found with strands of Ellen's hair caught in the fibres.|$|E

50|$|Bondage ropes used come in {{a variety}} of {{materials}} and length. Japanese bondage traditionally uses natural fibers such as hemp and jute which are cut to approximately 25 foot lengths. Western-style bondage typically uses longer <b>ropes</b> <b>that</b> span a wider variety of materials.|$|R

2500|$|Climbing on short, low routes {{without the}} use of the safety <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> is typical of most other styles. [...] Protection, if used at all, {{typically}} consists of a cushioned bouldering pad below the route and a spotter, a person who watches from below and directs the fall of the climber away from hazardous areas. Bouldering may be an arena for intense and relatively safe competition, resulting in exceptionally high difficulty standards.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{important}} {{changes were made}} to the railroad. [...] When originally built in 1829, iron chains were used to move the cars up and down the planes. [...] Frequently the chains broke with catastrophic effect, so blacksmith forges were maintained beside the planes in order to facilitate repairs. [...] It was soon found that hemp rope performed better than the chains, and all planes were converted to rope. [...] In 1858, the hemp ropes were replaced with wire <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> had been manufactured by the Roebling company. [...] Also during those improvements the strap iron rails were replaced with T rail.|$|E
2500|$|The old plan of a [...] "drop" [...] was {{discarded}} {{for a more}} merciful machine, {{by which}} the prisoner is jerked up from a platform on the ground level by a weight of 280 lbs, which is suspended by an independent rope pending the execution … At the words [...] "Forgive us our trespasses," [...] the executioner drove his chisel against the light <b>rope</b> <b>that</b> held the ponderous iron {{at the other end}} of the noose, and in an instant the heavy weight fell with a thud, and the [...] body was jerked into the air and hung dangling between the rough posts of the scaffold.|$|E

50|$|The third method {{involves}} gimmicked <b>ropes</b> <b>that</b> {{can literally}} be rejoined {{with the use}} of adhesives or some other method.
