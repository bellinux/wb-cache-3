40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore {{potential}} path of progress in developing full-spectrum Islamic finance. It will be argued that all Islamic transaction contracts (‘uqud) are risk sharing contracts. Next,the paper will explore ways and means of creating sufficiently strong impetus for widening and deepening the present menu of instruments toward longer time, higher risk-return, investment-oriented instruments. It will argue that governments can create the energy and the incentives within the private sector in this direction by first developing a vibrant and efficient equity market. Such a market will serve to stake out the higher end of the spectrum of Islamic finance instrument menu. Incentives will then allow the private sector to develop <b>risk-sharing</b> <b>instrument</b> in between the low and high end of time, risk-return profile of the menu. The paper will also address principles and methods underlying the legal, regulatory, supervisory infrastructure as well as economic policies needed to organize such an equity market. ...|$|E

We therefore believe that sectors without well-developed financial markets will benefit from sector-specific regulation of investment decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|The core {{principles}} of Islam lay great emphasis on social justice, inclusion, and sharing of resources {{between the haves}} and the have nots. Islamic finance addresses the issue of"financial inclusion"or"access to finance"from two directions [...] one through promoting risk-sharing contracts that provide a viable alternative to conventional debt-based financing, and the other through specific instruments of redistribution of the wealth among the society. Use of <b>risk-sharing</b> financing <b>instruments</b> can offer Shariah-compliant microfinance, financing for small and medium enterprises, and micro-insurance to enhance access to finance. And redistributive instruments such as Zakah, Sadaqat, Waqf, and Qard-al-hassan complement <b>risk-sharing</b> <b>instruments</b> to target the poor sector of society to offer a comprehensive approach to eradicating poverty and to build a healthy and vibrant economy. Instruments offered by Islam have strong historical roots and have been applied throughout history in various Muslim communities. The paper identifies gaps currently existing in Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries on each front, that is, Shariah-compliant micro-finance and financing for small and medium enterprises and the state of traditional redistributive instruments. The paper concludes that Islam offers a rich set of instruments and unconventional approaches, which, if implemented in true spirit, can lead to reduced poverty and inequality in Muslim countries plagued by massive poverty. Therefore, policy makers in Muslim countries who are serious about enhancing access to finance or"financial inclusion"should exploit the potential of Islamic instruments to achieve this goal and focus on improving the regulatory and financial infrastructure to promote an enabling environment.

40|$|A {{major reason}} for the {{recurrent}} episodes of financial instability is the predominance of interest-based debt and leveraging. Financial stability is achievable through risk sharing finance instead of risk shifting that characterizes contemporary finance. A risk sharing system serves the true function of finance as facilitator of real sector activities and avoids {{the emergence of a}} “paper economy” where there is gradual decoupling of finance from the real sector. Islamic finance was initially proposed as a profit-loss sharing system, but its core principle is risk sharing. In prohibiting interest-based debt instruments, Islam grounds finance on a strong risk sharing footing. Although still a young industry that has come a long way, it has not managed to develop truly <b>risk-sharing</b> <b>instruments</b> that would allow individuals, households, and firms as well as whole economies to mitigate systematic and un-systematic risks. It is suggested that governments should intervene and issue macro-market instruments to provide their treasuries with a significant source of non-interest rate based financing while promoting risk sharing. Moreover, given that evidence across the world suggests that monetary policy’s transmission mechanism may be impaired, it is suggested that these government issued securities could also impart added potency to monetary policy...|$|R
40|$|Enhancing {{financial}} inclusion or {{access to finance}} can make critical contributions to the economic development. Conventional mechanisms such as micro-finance, small-medium-enterprises (SME), and micro-insurance to enhance {{financial inclusion}} have been partially successful in enhancing the access and are not without challenges. Islamic finance, based {{on the concept of}} risk-sharing offers set of financial <b>instruments</b> promoting <b>risk-sharing</b> rather than risk-transfer in the financial system. In addition, Islam advocates redistributive <b>risk-sharing</b> <b>instruments</b> such as Zakah, Sadaqat, Qard-al Hassan, etc, through which the economically more able segment of the society shares the risks facing the less able segment of the population. These are not instruments of charity, altruism or beneficence but are instruments of redemption of rights and repayment of obligations. In addition, the inheritance rules specify how the wealth of a person is distributed among present and future generations of inheritors. This paper argues that conventional modes of enhancing financial inclusion can be replicated through instruments of Islamic finance allowing risk sharing and risk diversification. However, even after availability of micro-finance and SME financing, financial exclusion may not be fully overcome. Therefore, one needs to utilize, Islam’s instruments of redistribution where mandated levies and recommended avenue of spending may play their role. They help reduce the poor’s income – consumption correlation. The paper concludes that Islamic finance provides a comprehensive framework to enhance financial inclusion through the principle of risk-sharing and through Islam’s redistributive channels which are grossly under-utilized in Muslim countries. The redistributive instruments may be developed as proper institutions to optimize the function of such instruments. Applications of financial engineering can device innovative ways to develop hybrids of <b>risk-sharing</b> and redistributive <b>instruments</b> to enhance access to finance to promote economic development. ...|$|R
40|$|Incluye BibliografíaThis paper {{discusses}} the engagement of the European Investment Bank Group (EIB Group) with the financing {{and support of}} SMEs, both within the European Union (EU) as well as EU Candidate Countries and the Balkans. Indeed, lending and providing financial support to SMEs {{is one of the}} key core objectives of the EIB Group. The main focus of the paper is to describe and analyse the practises and experiences of the EIB Group in this field, to discuss the key lessons and to make policy recommendations to be considered within the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) context. The large role played by the EIB Group in financing SMEs in Europe shows the significance of the role the public sector needs to, and can, play in providing direct financial support to SMEs - as well as helping catalyse private financing to them, for example via bank guarantees and other <b>risk-sharing</b> <b>instruments</b> - given the large market imperfections and gaps in private financial markets for SMEs, particularly credit markets. This is the case in general, but has become particularly evident in the crisis, where the EIB Group has played an important countercyclical role in credit provision, in the face of sharply falling private credit to SMEs. It is noteworthy that the valuable role that public financial institutions need to play has been increasingly recognized since the crisis at the level of multilateral development banks (MDBs) and regional development banks (RDBs). It is important that similar conclusions are also applied to national development banks...|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} Roman {{legal framework}} {{a key factor}} in the discussion about the process of decodification in Europe one cannot overlook some concepts which nowadays are thought to be a mere history. Roman law does not always pass the test of flexibility and economical effectiveness. For example a strong affirmation of personal character of any obligation made Romans reluctant to accept assignment of rights and pactum in favorem tertii which are broadly recognized in the modern civil law. However, it seems not to be a case with pecunia traiecticia, i. e. the sea loan. This special contract of loan had a twofold character: it served to take over the risk of sea transport and to invest in maritime trade. The main idea was quite familiar: just price for any loss incurred due to vis maior. Usus modernus applied it also to land transport. Nevertheless, the sea loan suddenly disappeared at the end of 19 th century after a long tradition of being a part of the western legal thought. The author believes that there is a place in the realm of obligations for an ancient, but still a vigorous concept. Pecunia traiecticia was inspiration for two different and more famous contracts: insurance and bottomry loan which dominated its history. However, as such it was more like modern <b>risk-sharing</b> <b>instruments</b> which combine credit, insurance and a bit of speculation. Examination of Roman legal framework and western legal tradition has proved that some ancient concepts even ‘forgotten’ could revive and {{should be included in the}} market of ideas while shaping a new order of private law...|$|R

This paper sets out to explore the effects that relationship development in the commercial aerospace supply chains have on innovation and competitive advantage. A perspective of supply chains as complex activity networks is used for data analysis based on in-depth interviews in a global setting. Applying these concepts of supply chains as the interaction of multiple work activities assists in comprehending the forces of change. The processes of change are characterized by expansive learning processes of creating instruments for initializing, developing and sustaining these relationships. These processes {{take place in a}} terrain of complex power exercises. The long-term effects are totally dependent on nurturing the relationships. The findings may be useful to practitioners in understanding how implementation of successful supply chain changes may come about. It promotes <b>risk-sharing</b> partnerships as <b>instruments</b> for innovation. The paper provides evidence of changing relationships in commercial aerospace supply chains...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe {{increasing}} frequency and economic losses from natural disasters {{within the framework}} of decreasing agricultural prices is becoming crucial in increasing poverty in the Mexican rural economy. During the past two decades, the governmental withdrawal from supporting the agricultural sector with investments in physical, financial and logistic instruments continues to stress agricultural livelihoods, as current private mechanisms have not replaced them effectively. Natural disasters occurrence is increasingly producing severe damages to the so-called traditional agriculture, highly exposed to climatic events due to its predominating rainfed cropping practices as well as its high marginalization conditions, especially in the South of the country. Together, it tends to amplify the negative effects from extreme events. This process undermines farmers' incomes given their limitations to increase neither productivity nor cropping land, as well as their overall inability to re-orientate production. This document assesses public response to natural disasters in Mexico, including <b>risk-sharing</b> and loss-transfer <b>instruments.</b> It concludes with a set of policy suggestions to the public sector in order to maximize benefits from the existing governmental programs for adaptation to the increasing natural hazard exposure of the country...|$|R
