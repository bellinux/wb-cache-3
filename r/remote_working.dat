50|$|The 2012 Status Telework in the Federal Government {{features}} teleworking {{highlights from}} the past 18 months as well as goals for improving teleworking in the future. Reports finding that all 87 agencies participating in the Data Cell had established telework policies and 73 percent of the policies met the Telework Act Requirements. More than 684,000 federal employees were deemed eligible to telework, this represents approximately 32 percent of all federal employees. More than 144,000 federal employees had written teleworking agreements with their agencies. 27 percent of teleworkers worked remotely three or more days per week. In addition to the findings, the reports examine teleworking at the Department of Defense. According to the report, {{there are more than}} 793,000 employees in the DoD and of those employees, 134,477 were deemed eligible for teleworking. Overall, the federal government seems to have embraced teleworking and is attempting to create more <b>remote</b> <b>working</b> opportunities for employees. In closing, the report listed several ways that the government could make more jobs available through telework. Suggestions include using telework as a tool to retain employees at or near retirement age and using telework to expand hiring of highly trained disabled veterans.|$|E
5000|$|Lilli is one {{of three}} backing singers for a touring Elvis impersonator until she is fired. Then, left alone at the {{beginning}} of winter she is stranded in a ramshackle beach town on the windswept coast of New South Wales. This <b>remote,</b> <b>working</b> class, tourist-town has a pervasive sense of rootlessness and movement. The people survive by changing their occupations with the seasons and work hard in small businesses. Here, stuck in the Mermaid Caravan Park, she encounters her teenage daughter Ally (Claudia Karvan). When Lilli's young surfer husband had died, she felt lost; she gave up her baby to her mother-in-law, Bet. Lilli has been drifting ever since, and getting wasted. Bet is a rowdy, belligerent woman, devoted to Ally—she has taken care of her for 13 years but she has no idea how unhappy the girl is. Lilli has an immediate rapport with the lonely Ally even before she knows that Ally is her daughter, and after she knows, she can't take her eyes off her. They belong with each other. but Lilli's terrified of taking on the responsibilities of motherhood, and Bet tells her she's riff-raff. When we first see Ally she is in the water; surfing is—"her refuge from the noisy junkiness of life with Bet. Bet isn't a monster, she's simply the wrong person to be raising the pensive Ally, whose emotions are hidden away, like her mother's. The drama is in our feeling that Lilli must not leave her daughter in the embrace of this raucous old trouper." ...|$|E

40|$|More and more... work is {{becoming}} something you do, {{not a place}} you go to. " - Woody Leonhard, The Underground Guide to Telecommuting (1995). Many organisations now have <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> initiatives, not just the large multi-nationals, but increasingly small and medium enterprises as well. There are many benefits of <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> which firms can exploit to increase performance such as cost savings, work-life balance, increased productivity, reduced absenteeism, loyalty, resilience and finding talent from a wider pool. But alongside these are a myriad of problems {{as a result of}} people and technology coming together. Some companies have guidelines and training for <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> in place, although many do not. Many firms view <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> as ad-hoc arrangements which usually originate from informal staff requests due to conveniences of the day and granted as privileges which can be taken away. These firms simply rely on an underlying management philosophy of trust and mutual benefit. Even with guidelines in place, many issues and problems occur. Technologies enabling and in support of <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> have also evolved rapidly, giving firms the ability to collaborate and do things that were thought impossible a short time ago. Information Technology (IT) management has to provide these technologies, and deal with issues pertaining to continuous operations, support, connectivity and security. Human Resource departments have to deal with issues such as finding the appropriate staff and job types for <b>Remote</b> <b>Working,</b> paying global talent, and performance measurement systems that will suit this new way of working. There are also many issues surrounding firm culture, communication and trust such as managers insisting on visibility and "presenteeism", teams not communicating well, Orwellian-type monitoring of remote workers, and the lack of face-to-face interaction. Remote workers also face all sorts of social problems such as loneliness, isolation and strain on the family unit. Many firms also grapple with having to make frame-breaking decisions pertaining to <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> such as placing workers near customers and market opportunities, implementing hotdesking, health and safety, and being environmentally conscious. This paper intends to explore these benefits, challenges, technologies and issues surrounding <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> and gather findings through a survey which will cover these areas. Results from the survey show that remote workers, including their friends and family, are generally open and supportive towards <b>Remote</b> <b>Working,</b> but still feel that face-to-face interaction is important. They feel that they are supported well by their colleagues but may find themselves overworking, ironically. Results also show that firms, held back by old ways of thinking, are lacking in areas pertaining to <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> training, guidelines, security awareness, evaluation and have an unwillingness to fully embrace new ways of working, e. g. hotdesking. Firms could also do more to find appropriate staff, not just job types, for the initiative and pay more attention to issues surrounding accountability, trust, communication and control, health and safety, performance management and monitoring of remote staff. Findings also show that IT management face pressures in providing seamless <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> services and support, and may therefore have to innovate and adopt different strategies and procedures. <b>Remote</b> <b>Working</b> is a good strategy which firms can use to help them through today's competitive business climate and deal with an ever demanding workforce in a global economy that is showing signs of gloom. However, the issues that come along with it need to be managed well for the whole initiative to work...|$|E
40|$|The central {{thrust of}} this article is that {{improvements}} in <b>remote</b> <b>working</b> will not occur consistently without some form of structured process and that more strategic benefits evolve as the increased profile of remote workers is acknowledged in organisational policy. In previous articles on <b>remote</b> <b>working</b> [1] [2] Marieke Guy has written about the positive and negative aspects of working from home and the technologies that can support one to do so. This article aims to discuss how she and her coworkers at UKOLN, have put this theory into practice by creating a support framework for remote workers. It is a case study of what can be done with enthusiastic staff, support from managers and faith in an iterative process. It is also a reality check. <b>Remote</b> <b>working</b> continues to be an aspiration for so many yet the reality is not always plain sailing.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of trust as it relates to <b>remote</b> <b>working</b> from home.

Its problematic is to explore how trust is understood, developed and managed through predominantly remote everyday interpersonal relationships, organisation goals and routines, and the general day-to-day activities of working remotely from the organization that employs workers. In its present form, the paper is structured as follows: it provides a rationale and discussion of the key literature and then a brief outline of the case study methodology, after which it provides a discussion of the findings, which because of spatial limits are presented only in summary form rather than as data. We reflect upon the theoretical implications of these findings for current debates about the nature of trust in <b>remote</b> <b>working</b> contexts.
