The first type consists of areactive <b>reciprocal</b> <b>two-port</b> <b>network</b> insertedbetween two bridges of ideal switches.

40|$|In every reflectance-based {{application}} like broadband matching, circuit modeling, etc., a nonlinear equation following from energy conservation, the Feldtkeller equation, must be solved, {{in order}} to obtain real networks. In the literature, however, there is no analytic solution available but only numerical solutions. Consequently, the resulting error depends on the accuracy of the numerical tools. In this paper, an analytic solution is proposed, which is based on the modified ABCD-parameters of a lossless <b>reciprocal</b> <b>two-port</b> <b>network.</b> An algorithm is presented and examples are included to illustrate the implementation of the analytical method...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimiteda method {{for determining the}} free-field open circuit voltage sensitivity of a reversible underwater electroacoustic transducer from the difference in its input electrical impedance when loaded by water and air was investigated theoretically and experimentally. An equation for the sensitivity was derived using <b>reciprocal</b> <b>two-port</b> <b>network</b> theory. The theory {{takes into account the}} diffraction due to the finite size of the transducer, its finite mechanical impedance, and its free-field radiation impedance in water, An experiment to test the predictions of the theory was performed using a 6 " diameter, hollow, piezoelectric ceramic spherical transducer. The result of the experiment agreed within several dB with a standard comparison calibration over the frequency range for which both the electrical impedance and comparison calibration data are considered reliable. The calibration method described, which has been termed the Delta-Z method, may be useful for in-situ monitoring of transducer sensitivity in installations which can be flooded and purged.

50|$|To {{check if}} two <b>two-port</b> <b>networks</b> can be {{connected}} in a parallel-parallel configuration, {{first of all}} just the input ports are connected in parallel, a voltage {{is applied to the}} input and the open-circuit voltage is measured/calculated between the outputs that are short-circuited each. If there is a voltage drop, the <b>two-port</b> <b>networks</b> cannot be combined in parallel. The same test is repeated from the output side of the <b>two-port</b> <b>networks</b> (parallel connection of the output ports, application of a voltage to the output, measurement/calculation of the open-circuit voltage between the inputs that are short-circuited each). Only if there is no voltage drop in both cases, a combination of the <b>two-ports</b> <b>networks</b> is permissible.|$|R
