[...] Prior to this, Australia's most famous player was Michelle Timms, Australia's first player of either gender to play internationally. [...] She was recognised {{as one of the}} world's best basketball players {{by the time she was}} 21. [...] She has been described as Australia's answer to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal, and the best female basketball player in the world. [...] She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world: [...] "I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Nobody really talks to me like that. It's not something I'm conscious of. My family and people who have known me all my life, they see me for who I am, and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me. They know I have to train, but the rest of it is really laid-back." ...|$|E
500|$|NASCAR {{officials}} reviewed video {{evidence of}} Smith's pass of Stewart {{on the final}} lap with Smith and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. president Max Siegel in attendance, and declared the manoeuvre illegal; Smith was issued a pass-through penalty which dropped him from second to 18th. Smith argued that he was forced down below the yellow line: [...] "I was always told that the rule is if you get forced down there, then you are {{the winner of the}} race, and on the last lap, anything goes. That’s what I was going with. I had a nose inside of him and I could have piled up the whole field." [...] Ninth-place finisher Johnson said there were rumors that drivers were allowed to go below the yellow line on the last lap of the previous day's Craftsman Truck Series race which were circulated {{on the day of the}} AMP Energy 500: [...] "I didn’t know what to <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> or understood it, or had seen it.

After one incident where the drummer had disappeared {{for two or three}} days, Corgan [...] "put the hammer down", according to Vig, and had Chamberlin perform the drum part for [...] "Cherub Rock" [...] until his hands bled. Due to Corgan's urging, Chamberlin checked into a rehab clinic. Corgan told Spin later that year, [...] "You know, I gave them {{a year and a half}} to prepare for this record... I'm surrounded by these people who I care about very much, yet they continue to keep failing me." [...] Corgan explained that he began to take the actions of others personally; he said, [...] "If you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> of course, someone doesn't do the job because they're lazy, or they don't think it's important. But I took it as, 'You're not worth going home and working on the song.'" ...|$|E

[...] "It now rests entirely with Mr. Playmore to go on or to give up; and this is my last opportunity of discovering what he <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Don't I deserve some little indulgence?

That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E

A father fond of unworthy children, and leading a life of self-denial for their sake, as may {{probably}} and pathetically be, is not enough; there must be an imbecile, trembling dotard, willing to promote even the liaisons of his daughters to give them happiness and to teach the sublimity of the paternal instinct. The hero cannot sufficiently be a selfish young fellow, with alternating impulses of greed and generosity; he must superfluously intend a career of iniquitous splendor, and be swerved from it by nothing but the most cataclysmal interpositions. It can be said that without such personages the plot could not be transacted; but so much the worse for the plot. Such a plot had no business to be; and while actions so unnatural are imagined, no mastery can save fiction from contempt with those who <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> To Balzac it can be forgiven, not only because in his better mood he gave us such biographies as 'Eugenie Grandet,' but because he wrote at a time when fiction was just beginning to verify the externals of life, to portray faithfully the outside of men and things. It was still held that in order to interest the reader the characters must be moved by the old romantic ideals; we were to be taught that [...] "heroes" [...] and [...] "heroines" [...] existed all around us, and that these abnormal beings needed only to be discovered in their several humble disguises, and then we should see every-day people actuated by the fine frenzy of the creatures of the poets. How false that notion was, few but the critics, who are apt to be rather belated, need now be told. Some of these poor fellows, however, still contend that it ought to be done, and that human feelings and motives, as God made them and as men know them, are not good enough for novel-readers.|$|E

6000|$|Why women suffer these wrongs--why {{they do not}} insist {{in having}} their clothes made small enough for them I cannot conceive.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the release of the album, SP.com posted a section {{featuring}} lead singer and lyricist Gary Lightbody discussing the new songs, which was initially a Lightbody interview to RTÉ. About [...] "Crack the Shutters", he said it was the purest love song he'd ever written. The album A Hundred Million Suns is noted for its positive lyrics, as Lightbody was best known before for break-up songs. The song is the one of many positive songs that Lightbody wrote for the album. In an interview with The Sunday Times, he said, [...] "The problem I've always had with writing about love is that you don't <b>really</b> stop and <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> when it's occurring. This time, I made myself <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> — how to fit it into words. The new lyrics took a lot longer than usual, but I'm proud of them." [...] Lightbody credited producer Jacknife Lee with helping him with lyric writing. He praised him further, adding that it was Lee who taught him the importance of the lyrics sounding as good as they're well written.|$|R

The film was not hugely successful and I suppose I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> very much now. It's probably not a great film, but it's all right.|$|E

You know, I used to be very proud of myself when I'd see, you know, this little truck or lorry sort of trundle by in an episode of Thunderbirds and in my playbox I had exactly the same sort of Matchbox toy. And that sort of was the beginning, <b>really,</b> when I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> of, like, the connection of 'This isn't real, these are models, you know, they're making all this stuff up'."

40|$|What {{leadership}} really is? Can it be developed? How? Polysemy is {{a quality}} {{held by the}} word leadership. It is used in many contexts and with so many meaning that sometimes {{it is hard to}} understand what people <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> this concept. <b>It</b> does not matter {{if you are in a}} business environment, within an NGO or working for the government; if you are in the military, in the school or in the church; if you need to have an impact in your sport team, in your family or in your community service project. Leadership is diffuse and seems to serves for everything. Leadership seems to be always needed, and that is one reason of its attractiveness. This idea of a hero leader that solves everything is embedded in a particular way of making meaning of the world. Many courses and programs in different schools or educational places target adults using the L-word in their titles. As thrilling labels they propose leadership as a magic word to gain anything you want –the abracadabra for any door. They promise the development of leadership in many ways and guarantee its success if you enroll. They are also makin...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Climb" [...] was not {{intentionally}} {{written for}} the 2009 musical film Hannah Montana: The Movie. Co-writer Jessi Alexander conceived the song's melody while driving {{to the home of}} songwriting partner Jon Mabe. Once she arrived, she and Mabe developed a song about overcoming life's obstacles inspired by their personal struggles in the music industry. Alexander referred to the process as a form of [...] "therapy" [...] and recalled, [...] "I was just driving to work one day. It's just a typical day, nothing really special about that day. And I just had this melody in my head. And I couldn't get to my co-writer Jon Mabe or my guitar fast enough because I just wanted to play what I was hearing. And, you know, we just kinda put it down pretty fast and didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The lyrics kinda started to come, I think for both of us, being kinda underdogs in the business. My co-writer was a songplugger, just turned songwriter, and I'd had record deals and ups and downs in the music business. I think for both of us, we just came from a place of, you know, 'it's not a race'." [...] The song they created was titled [...] "It's the Climb" [...] and was written in third person. Alexander described the original song as [...] "more spiritual" [...] than the version that was released, and said <b>it</b> contained lines <b>about</b> prayer.

Usually I wouldn't go for something like that because I'd be too scared. The chances of it f**king up are so great, so now when I look back at getting to the final I'm like, 'That was f**king lucky'. I hadn't really done much for four years leading up to that and that part of my life was quite sad and dramatic. So all of these songs coming out now reflects that. There is a part of my brain that's saying, 'Ooh, you better write something a bit more uptempo and happy'. But ultimately, if that's where your head's at, that's what you've got to do." ...|$|E

He gained the sole {{lead in the}} tournament with a victory over Okinoumi on day seven {{and went on to}} secure his ōzeki rank by beating Yoshikaze a day later. In the tournament's second week he maintained his unbeaten run with wins over his fellow ōzeki Terunofuji and Kisenosato and the yokozuna Kakuryū to open up a two-win lead over his rivals. On day thirteen he defeated Harumafuji with a neck throw (kubinage) meaning that he needed only one win in the last two days to secure his first tournament victory. On September 24, the penultimate day of the tournament Gōeidō clinched the title with a force-out (yorikiri) win over Tamawashi. After his win he commented, [...] "I just focused on wrestling as hard as I could. I’m really happy. There was a time when things didn’t go my way, but I’m glad I stuck it out.

When asked about his prospects of advancing to yokozuna he added [...] "I <b>really</b> can't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> right now. I want to soak up the moment for a little bit".

40|$|Introduction A sudden trauma like {{a spinal}} cord injury will have a {{significant}} impact on you and the people close to you. You may see parts of your life change a great deal. Other parts of your life may not change at all. Regardless of the extent of your injury and disability, being hurt and having a disruption to your life may present unexpected problems or changes. This chapter provides information about services that are available at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Magee Rehabilitation Hospital and in the community to provide assistance. Coping with a Spinal Cord Injury After a {{spinal cord injury}}, you may experience many different feelings at one time or another, such as anger, worry, sadness, even hopelessness. These feelings are more likely to occur when you are under stress — as when your body undergoes dramatic changes in its functioning or when you have been in the hospital for a long time. Sometimes they are aimed in the wrong direction, like when your are really angry with one person or situation and you are nasty to someone else. While you are still basically the same person inside, there are many adjustments that you are going through. Rehabilitation is aimed at helping you learn new things — both physical and emotional, so that you can learn to live with your change of body functioning and all the changes in your life that it may bring. The emotional changes and behaviors you see in yourself may surprise you. It is important to recognize that what you are experiencing is normal, and also that what is normal for you may be very different from how someone else reacts. <b>Really,</b> if you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> it would be unnatural not to have some sort of reaction. Another aspect of dealing with this whole business of coping has to do with change. This is a transitional period for you. What is true for you today or this week may be different next week or next month. People change at their own speed. (23 pages, 371 Kb...|$|R
