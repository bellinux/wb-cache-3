40|$|We {{show that}} the crystal {{structure}} of a substrate can be exploited to drive the anisotropic assembly of colloidal nanoparticles. Pentanethiol-passivated Au particles of approximately 2 nm diameter deposited from toluene onto hydrogen-passivated Si(111) surfaces form linear assemblies (rods) with a narrow width distribution. The <b>rod</b> orientations <b>mirror</b> the substrate symmetry, {{with a high degree}} of alignment along principal crystallographic axes of the Si(111) surface. There is a strong preference for anisotropic growth with rod widths substantially more tightly distributed than lengths. Entropic trapping of nanoparticles provides a plausible explanation for the formation of the anisotropic assemblies we observe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was the {{construction}} and testing of a CrEr:YSGG laser for application in photoablative laser surgery. The CrEr:YSGG laser is a solid state laser emitting at 2. 70 #mu#m. Light of this wavelength shows very good results in ablation of biological tissue and good transmission in conventional quartz fibers even at high intensities. With the constructed CrEr:YSGG laser head free running operation at 2. 70 #mu#m was realized with a maximum output energy of more than 800 mJ. To avoid thermal overload of the laser rod, the pump energy was limited to 230 J. Up to thos pump energy, there was no saturation of the output energy of the laser. The homogenious beam profile was 7 times diffraction limited at 2 Hz repetition rate and 20 times diffraction limited at 10 Hz. The pulse to pulse fluctuations were below 5 %. For Q-switching a modulator was constructed and realized based on 'Frustrated Total Internal Reflection' (FTIR). The maximum output energy of the Q-switched laser pulses was limited to 70 mJ, to avoid damage of the optical components (<b>rod,</b> <b>mirrors)</b> inside the resonator. The pulse duration was between 30 and 100 ns depending on pump energy. In comparison to the electrooptical Q-switching, the FTIR modulator {{turned out to be}} a efficient and reliable device. The optimum fluence for processing soft tissue range between 5 - 15 J/cm" 2 in free-running mode and between 1 - 4 J/cm" 2 for the Q-switched regime. Typical ablation rates are 25 #mu#m/pulse at a fluence of 10 J/cm" 2 for soft tissue (cornea). For cartilage the ablation rate is 5 #mu#m/pulse at a fluence of 12 J/cm" 2. In free-running mode the range of thermal induced necrosis is about 120 #+-# 20 #mu#m. In Q-switched mode it is reduced to 25 #+-# 5 #mu#m. The laser system turns out as a promising alternative to the Er:YAG, Ho:YAG as well as the CO_ 2 laser. In particular the laser becomes very attractive for applications in which the radiation energy has to be guided by silica fiber optics. (orig.)

40|$|Structures {{engineered}} {{to give a}} specific response to light are certainly nothing new. The long history of engineering materials response to light encompasses seemingly disparate structures from antennas to stained glass, lighting <b>rods</b> to <b>mirrors.</b> It {{is only in the}} recent decade, however, that we have appreciated the full gamut of possibilities this field holds, and envisioned paths towards realizing these possibilities. The new field of electromagnetic metamaterials has given us the potential to create devices that manipulate light in nearly any way we can envision. The work of this thesis is involved principally with the study of metamaterials and their unique properties. Using a wide array of developed apparatus and techniques - spanning microwave frequencies through the infrared - we investigate metamaterial behavior, and the ways they differ from conventional materials. Applications are always kept in the forefront of thought. The demonstration of a graded negative-index lens, fabricated from metamaterial fiberglass composite, highlights the potential of these structures. Characterization procedures and instruments suitable for metamaterial samples, developed {{in the course of this}} work, enable not only our investigation of the physics of metamaterials, but also facilitate the full design cycle critical to engineering. Our demonstration of dynamic tuning directly addresses the role bandwidth plays as a major roadblock to metamaterial devices. Finally a demonstrated novel use as a sensor/detector adds to the growing list of metamaterial roles in emerging technolog...|$|R
40|$|The Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) {{satellite}} {{was launched}} in February 1980 into a 573 km high circular orbit. It contains X-ray, UV, and optical instruments for the simultaneous observation of solar flares. The ultraviolet spectrometer and polarimeter (UVSP) {{is one of these}} instruments. The objectives of the UVSP require the employment of a raster scanning telescope to study the spatial dynamics of flares, the use of a high resolution spectrometer to select and scan spectral lines for temperature and velocity diagnostics, and the utilization of a polarimeter to measure magnetic fields in the solar transition zone. The present paper has the objective to provide a description of the optical fabrication techniques developed for the instrument. Attention is given to telescope <b>mirrors,</b> metering <b>rods,</b> the Ebert <b>mirror,</b> grating blanks, a four-mirror polarizer, beam splitter assemblies, beam splitter fabrication, deflector mirrors, and shipping containers...|$|R
50|$|In early examples, the rod's ends {{had to be}} {{polished}} {{with great}} precision, such that {{the ends of the}} rod were flat to within a quarter of a wavelength of the output light, and parallel to each other within a few seconds of arc. The finely polished ends of the rod were silvered; one end completely, the other only partially. The rod, with its reflective ends, then acts as a Fabry-PÃ©rot etalon (or a Gires-Tournois etalon). Modern lasers often use rods with antireflection coatings, or with the ends cut and polished at Brewster's angle instead. This eliminates the reflections from the ends of the <b>rod.</b> External dielectric <b>mirrors</b> then are used to form the optical cavity. Curved mirrors are typically used to relax the alignment tolerances and to form a stable resonator, often compensating for thermal lensing of the rod.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} gravity and proper {{acceleration}} on the frequency spectrum of an optical resonator - both rigid or deformable - is considered {{in the framework of}} general relativity. The optical resonator is modeled either as a rod of matter connecting two mirrors or as a dielectric rod whose ends function as mirrors. Explicit expressions for the frequency spectrum are derived for the case that it is only perturbed slightly. For a deformable resonator, the perturbation of the frequency spectrum depends on the speed of sound in the <b>rod</b> supporting the <b>mirrors.</b> A connection is found to a relativistic concept of rigidity when the speed of sound approaches the speed of light. In contrast, the corresponding result for the assumption of Born rigidity is recovered when the speed of sound becomes infinite. The results presented in this article can be used {{as the basis for the}} description of optical and opto-mechanical systems in a curved spacetime. We apply our results to the examples of a uniformly accelerating resonator and an optical resonator in the gravitational field of a small moving sphere. Our approach is not limited to weak gravitational fields, which we exemplify by its application to the fictitious situation of an optical resonator falling into a black hole.

5000|$|Historically, some design {{elements}} {{near the}} outer perimeter of a die were added by punching because technology {{made it difficult}} to press both the central and perimeter design elements at the same time. Also, some dies were made without mintmarks or dates to permit their use at different mints and in later years. A die technician added missing elements by positioning a punch, a small steel <b>rod</b> with the <b>mirror</b> image of a letter or number on it, and striking the punch with a hammer pressing the image into the die. If the image is not strong enough, the technician will punch it a second time. Punches placed in a different position between strikes will produce a doubled image which is called a repunch. [...] Dual punches occur when punching is repeated in a second location. Sometimes technicians use a punch with the wrong or incorrectly sized letter or number. A well known example of a small mint mark is 1945-S [...] "Micro S" [...] Mercury dime, when the mint used an old puncheon intended for Philippines coins. [...] A much rarer example is the 1892-O [...] "Micro O" [...] Barber half dollar, which may have come about from the brief use of a mintmark puncheon intended for the quarter. [...] Exactly the same error occurred with the 1905-O Barber dime, although numerous examples are known of this mistake. Modern equipment virtually eliminates the need to design elements by punching.|$|R
40|$|Several {{remote sensing}} {{applications}} require pulsed {{sources in the}} mid-infrared spectral regime with high average powers and good beam quality. Ho:YAG lasers {{have a number of}} attractive features for high power generation at 2. 1 microns, either for direct applications or as a pump source for parametric conversion to longer infra-red wavelengths. Unfortunately, direct diode pumping of Ho:YAG is not practical, so a two-step process is generally employed in which one or more diode-pumped thulium-doped lasers are used to directly pump (in-band) the Ho:YAG laser. In response, we have investigated a slab-based architecture for scaling the output power of a Tm:YLF laser to the 100 W power regime at 1. 91 microns, corresponding to a strong Ho:YAG absorption line. Multiple slab lasers with moderate beam quality in the plane of the slab can be combined to efficiently end-pump a low-doping concentration Ho:YAG rod in a pump-guided configuration. In a preliminary demonstration, two 2 at. % doped Tm:YLF slab lasers with a spatially multiplexed output of 74 W were employed to end-pump a 1. 5 mm diameter, 80 mm long, 0. 25 at. % Ho:YAG barrel-polished <b>rod.</b> A two <b>mirror</b> plano-concave cavity, with 11 % output coupling transmission, produced a CW output of 38 W with a slope efficiency of 60 % with respect to the incident power. Q-switched operation at a repetition rate of 20 Hz with two intracavity Brewster plate polarizers and a 60 % transmitting output coupler produced 14 mJ pulses with a pulse duration (FWHM) of 18 ns. This architecture offers an attractive route for future high-power 2 micron lasers...|$|R
