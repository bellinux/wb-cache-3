First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level <b>reward</b> <b>systems</b> and team-level <b>reward</b> <b>systems</b> must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Competition {{increases}} and companies {{need to adjust}} their business to stay competitive. Employees have gained an important for an or-ganisation and are often seen {{as the key to}} business success. Motiva-tion is important for increased performance. A <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> can, amongst other things, help an organisation to motivate, attract and retain their employees. Historically, rewards have concerned mostly senior management. We where interested in how a <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> could affect people further down in the hierarchy. How can a <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> influence motivation in small shop-floor business units? What are the benefits and possible pitfalls with a <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> for such a setting? Purpose: The purpose of this report is slightly wider than what the research questions suggest. By thoroughly investigating the motivating ele-ments we aim to create a frame of reference, which is thought to give insight into the important components of a <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> and the motivating factors. It is our aim that this frame will be applicable to other settings similar to the one which we will investigate. We also intend to look into what positive and negative aspects there are and how the disadvantages with a <b>reward</b> <b>system</b> can be minimized. Method: To fulfil our purpose we have chosen to perform a case study on the service unit of Hedin Göteborg Bil AB. In order to retrieve the necessary empirical data we have interviewed two managers and car-ried out a questionnaire amongst the thirteen service technicians. Results: In line with theory, we found that financial rewards it is not the prime source for motivation; there are many factors that play a lar-ger role. Some of the most motivating factors turned out to be col-leges, autonomy and responsibility, fun and rewarding work tasks. More interestingly, we saw a relation between many of these and the <b>reward</b> <b>system,</b> indicating that financial rewards enhance the motiva-tional effects of other factors. We found that there are several positive and negative aspects with any <b>reward</b> <b>system.</b> The case study presented solutions to many of the possible pitfalls and indicated that they benefited from their cur-rent <b>reward</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
