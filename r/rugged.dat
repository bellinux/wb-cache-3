5|$|Ivan Vladislav Point on <b>Rugged</b> Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica {{is named}} after Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rugged</b> high-altitude terrain {{makes it}} {{expensive}} to provide telecommunications services.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the <b>rugged</b> Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the <b>rugged</b> terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E
5|$|Now {{facing a}} more <b>rugged</b> and {{hazardous}} trek, Young chose {{to follow the}} trail used by the Donner–Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. As the vanguard company traveled through the <b>rugged</b> mountains, they divided into three sections. Young and several {{other members of the}} party suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a “mountain fever” induced by wood ticks. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move farther ahead on the designated route.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan's Austronesian {{speakers}} were formerly distributed {{over much}} of the island's <b>rugged</b> central mountain range and were concentrated in villages along the alluvial plains. The bulk of contemporary Taiwanese aborigines now live in the mountains and in cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse the <b>rugged</b> mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville. These <b>rugged</b> and rocky trails were used steadily until 1895, when Pennsylvania Route154 was constructed to take their place. Part of these old horse trails are still in use and known as Pioneer Road and Double Run Road, and form part {{of two of the}} seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and Pioneer Road meet at the Worlds End Vista, which is thought to be a possible inspiration for the park's name.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{consists}} of a plateau sloping from long sandy bays {{in the south to}} <b>rugged</b> cliffs in the north. The plateau is cut by valleys running generally north-south.|$|E
5|$|The {{various types}} of horse ridden by riders of the Pony Express {{included}} Morgans and thoroughbreds which were often used on {{the eastern end of}} the trail. Mustangs were often used on the western (more <b>rugged)</b> end of the mail route.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance design {{must take}} into account local {{conditions}} and infrastructure. Maintained roads are necessary for road going ambulances to arrive on scene and then transport the patient to a hospital, though in <b>rugged</b> areas four-wheel drive or all-terrain vehicles can be used. Fuel must be available and service facilities are necessary to maintain the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, the kakapo was {{extinct in}} the North Island and its range and {{numbers in the}} South Island were declining. One of its last refuges was <b>rugged</b> Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often seen or heard, and {{occasionally}} eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of kakapo were becoming scarce.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks a {{break from}} the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut is that of a soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This <b>rugged</b> soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.|$|E
5|$|Craters of the Moon is {{in south-central}} Idaho, midway between Boise and Yellowstone National Park. The lava field reaches southeastward from the Pioneer Mountains. Combined U.S. Highway 20–26–93 {{cuts through the}} northwestern part of the {{monument}} and provides access to it. However, the <b>rugged</b> landscape of the monument itself remains remote and undeveloped, with only one paved road across the northern end.|$|E
5|$|December 2001: During {{the opening}} {{stages of the}} war in Afghanistan {{launched}} following the September 11 attacks, the U.S. and its allies believed that bin Laden was hiding in the <b>rugged</b> mountains at Tora Bora. Despite overrunning the Taliban and al-Qaeda positions, they failed to capture or kill him.|$|E
5|$|Dominica's {{terrain is}} <b>rugged,</b> which has fostered {{distinct}} regional traditions. The northern, eastern, southern, western and central {{parts of the}} island are music areas. The villages of Wesley and Marigot are also unique in their preservation of English language and music rather than the more French-based styles {{of the rest of}} the island.|$|E
5|$|Highway132 {{is a short}} {{connector}} {{highway that}} travels between Dacre and Renfrew, connecting Highway41 with Highway17 via Highway60. The majority of the route travels through the Canadian Shield, {{with the exception of}} the final few kilometres approaching Renfrew, where it descends into the Ottawa Valley. Because of its <b>rugged</b> surroundings, there is relatively little human habitation along the route outside of the communities of Dacre and Shamrock.|$|E
5|$|Holt {{continued}} to innovate and worked {{to build a}} tractor that could perform <b>rugged</b> tasks yet was not heavy itself. He fitted adjustable blades onto his tractors and hired them out to grade roads and move soil and rock for construction purposes. By 1916, Holt had sold over 2,000 tractors worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the beauty of its <b>rugged,</b> natural landscape, Ikata {{has long been known}} for fishing and mikan orange farming. In recent years Ikata has also become a hotspot of modern energy production—the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant until 2012 produced much of Shikoku's electricity, and the town's windy mountains are dotted by dozens of windmills.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to his {{official}} announcement, Huntsman gained attention for his campaign's unconventional TV ads, produced by veteran GOP strategist Fred Davis III, featuring a lone motocross rider traveling through <b>rugged</b> terrain as music {{plays in the}} background, while facts about Huntsman appear on the screen. The ads were widely parodied, including by the Utah Democratic Party and Rick Santorum's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea's {{coastline}} {{is dominated}} by the Hamakua Coast, an area of <b>rugged</b> terrain created by frequent slumps and landslides on the volcano's flank. The area includes several recreation parks including Kalopa State Recreation Area, Wailuku River State Park and Akaka Falls State Park.|$|E
5|$|Mounted {{police have}} been used since the 18th century, and still are used {{worldwide}} to control traffic and crowds, patrol public parks, keep order in processionals and during ceremonies and perform general street patrol duties. Today, many cities still have mounted police units. In rural areas, horses are used by law enforcement for mounted patrols over <b>rugged</b> terrain, crowd control at religious shrines, and border patrol.|$|E
5|$|Organised armed fighters {{on horseback}} are {{occasionally}} seen. The best-known current examples are the Janjaweed, militia groups {{seen in the}} Darfur region of Sudan, who became notorious for their attacks upon unarmed civilian populations in the Darfur conflict. Many nations still maintain small numbers of mounted military units for certain types of patrol and reconnaissance duties in extremely <b>rugged</b> terrain, including the conflict in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The Great Plains cover most of {{the western}} two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the Missouri River the {{landscape}} becomes more <b>rugged</b> and consists of rolling hills, plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped hills called buttes. These buttes sometimes rise 400 to 600feet (120 to 180m) above the plains. In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota Badlands.|$|E
5|$|The Pony Express {{demonstrated}} that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When {{replaced by the}} telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and {{became part of the}} lore of the American West. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of <b>rugged</b> American individualism of the Frontier times.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} outside of Japan by Sega, who packaged the heroine as a <b>rugged</b> gladiator {{instead of the}} dainty-looking sorceress she originally was. Due {{to the lack of}} publicity for the game internationally, Alisia Dragoon did not make a big impact on the video game market, despite the critical acclaim it received.|$|E
5|$|The journey west usually took {{between four}} and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed by {{following}} a new route called Hastings Cutoff, which crossed Utah's Wasatch Mountains and Great Salt Lake Desert. The <b>rugged</b> terrain and difficulties encountered while traveling along the Humboldt River in present-day Nevada {{resulted in the}} loss of many cattle and wagons, and caused splits within the group.|$|E
5|$|Turkey {{is divided}} into seven {{geographical}} regions: Marmara, Aegean, Black Sea, Central Anatolia, Eastern Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia and the Mediterranean. The uneven north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long, narrow belt. This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey's total land area. As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau becomes increasingly <b>rugged</b> as it progresses eastward.|$|E
5|$|A <b>rugged,</b> sparsely {{populated}} area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.|$|E
5|$|After Leonard I. Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} the Little Boy design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were <b>rugged</b> enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were inserted into the bomb that was used in the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the <b>rugged</b> journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|Among the American {{units that}} {{reinforced}} the Pusan Perimeter {{as soon as}} they could arrive were the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, the 7th Infantry Division, and the 25th Infantry Divisions, along with other units of the U.S. Eighth Army that provided logistical, medical, and intelligence support. Advance units of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 in the first encounter between American and North Korean troops. For the first month after the defeat at Osan, the 24th Infantry were repeatedly pushed back and forced southeastward by larger numbers of North Korean troops equipped with <b>rugged</b> Soviet-made T-34 tanks.|$|E
5|$|An {{automatic}} {{traffic monitoring}} and guidance {{system is in}} place along the motorway. It consists of measuring, control and signalling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary, such as at interchanges, viaducts, bridges, tunnels and zones where fog and strong wind are known to occur. The system uses variable traffic signs to communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorway users. The A2 motorway mainly runs through the plains and rolling hills of Hrvatsko Zagorje region, although the northernmost sections of the route traverse <b>rugged</b> terrain, requiring a number of viaducts and long tunnels along the route.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956–57 NBA season, Auerbach {{acquired}} two future Hall-of-Famers: forward Tom Heinsohn, {{and defensive}} center Bill Russell. Powered by these new recruits, the Celtics went 44–28 {{in the regular}} season, and Cousy averaged 20.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and a league-leading 7.5 assists, earning his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award; he also won his second NBA All-Star Game MVP award. The Celtics reached the 1957 NBA Finals, and powered by Cousy on offense and <b>rugged</b> center Russell on defense, they beat the Hawks 4–3, who were noted for future Hall-of-Fame power forward Bob Pettit and former teammates Macauley and Hagan. Cousy finally won his first title.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass {{on the north side of}} Mount Hood, but that trail was too <b>rugged</b> for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons.|$|E
5|$|Between February and March, {{the corps}} participated in Operation Killer, pushing Chinese forces {{north of the}} Han River. This {{operation}} was quickly followed up with Operation Ripper, which retook Seoul in March. After this, Operations <b>Rugged</b> and Dauntless in April saw Eighth Army forces advance north of the 38th parallel and reestablish themselves along the Kansas Line and Utah Line, respectively. In March, the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team and the 1st Marine Division were reassigned, and the corps was given command of the 7th Infantry Division and the South Korean 2nd Infantry Division in their place.|$|E
