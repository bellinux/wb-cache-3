40|$|<b>Runway</b> <b>incursions</b> pose a {{significant}} threat to continued safety in commercial aviation. In recent years, stakeholders have initiated {{a number of}} programmes dealing {{with the issue of}} <b>runway</b> <b>incursions,</b> with the majority adopting traditional advisory alerting techniques. In contrast, this work proposes the use of directive cockpit alerting, which provides both an alert of the conflict as well as guidance on which manoeuvre to conduct to clear the conflict. This paper reports the findings of simulator trails designed for the assessment of the effectiveness and acceptability of the directive alerting strategy within the context of <b>runway</b> <b>incursions.</b> Statistical analysis performed on the quantitative measures taken from the evaluations have shown that the directive mode of alerting leads to a higher probability of the crew performing the correct action when faced with an alert. This, together with overall participant acceptance of the directive alerting concept, is a strong indicator that the technique has the potential of providing a complete {{solution to the problem of}} <b>runway</b> <b>incursions.</b> peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Runway</b> <b>incursions</b> {{are among}} the most serious safety {{concerns}} in air traffic control. Traditional A-SMGCS level 2 safety systems detect <b>runway</b> <b>incursions</b> with the help of surveillance information only. In the context of SESAR, complementary safety systems are emerging that also use other information in addition to surveillance, and that aim at warning about potential <b>runway</b> <b>incursions</b> at earlier points in time. One such system is "conflicting ATC clearances", which processes the clearances entered by the air traffic controller into an electronic flight strips system and cross-checks them for potentially dangerous inconsistencies. The cross-checking logic may be implemented directly based on the clearances and on surveillance data, but this is cumbersome. We present an approach that instead uses ground routes as an intermediate layer, thereby simplifying the core safety logic.

25|$|The 2007 San Francisco International Airport <b>runway</b> <b>incursion</b> {{occurred}} around 1:30pm PST on May 26, 2007 when SkyWest Airlines (operating as United Express) Flight 5741 (SKW5741), an Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia turboprop aircraft, nearly {{collided with}} Republic Airlines (operating as Frontier Airlines) Flight 4912, an Embraer 170 Regional Jet, {{at the intersection}} of runways 1L and 28R at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), South San Francisco, California.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 2016, China Eastern Airlines Flight 5643, an Airbus A320, was {{involved}} in a serious <b>runway</b> <b>incursion</b> incident during takeoff from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. The aircraft was cleared for takeoff from runway 36L for a domestic flight to Tianjin. As it was accelerating down the runway, China Eastern Airlines Flight 5106, an Airbus A330-343 entered the active runway via taxiway B3. The aircraft had just landed on runway 36R after a flight from Beijing and had reportedly been cleared to taxi to the terminal. It left the runway via B3, crossed taxiway Bravo and entered the active departure runway via taxiway H3. This crossing is located 2110 meters from the threshold of runway 36L and 2400 meters from the point where the A320 commenced takeoff. The A320 was accelerating through 110 knots when the crew noted the A330 entering the runway. The crew selected TOGA thrust and continued their takeoff. The aircraft rotated at about 130 knots and climbed over the A330 with a separation of just 19 meters.|$|E

30|$|Researchers and {{planners}} {{operating from}} different perspectives have proposed many options {{to address this}} problem, such as new technology (e.g. in aircraft, ATC tower, or Airport) and new procedures such as ICAO compliant procedures. These proposals aim to reduce the probability of <b>runway</b> <b>incursions,</b> and reduce the accident risk in case <b>runway</b> <b>incursions</b> occur. However, evaluating {{the impact of these}} proposals is a demanding task, given the large number of human operators and technical systems that closely interact at the airport.

The three most common factors contributing to air traffic controller and pilot error in airport operations include two that involve failed auditory communication. This project addressed the problems of auditory communication in air traffic control from an acoustical standpoint, by establishing an acoustics laboratory designed for this purpose and initiating research into selected topics that show promise for improving voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots...|$|R

The planes were carrying a combined total of 296 people, {{none of whom}} were injured. The NTSB concluded that the incursion {{was the result of}} controller error.

2500|$|SFO was {{initially}} {{selected for the}} first test installation of the AMASS ground radar system in 1992. AMASS, which can detect and alert controllers to potential runway conflicts, was intended by the FAA to be eventually installed in 40 airports around the country. However much criticism was directed at the project for cost overruns and lengthy delays. The SFO AMASS was finally declared operational on June 18, 2001. According to AMASS technical support personnel, in a scenario such as this conflict, AMASS {{is designed to provide}} an alert 15seconds before the aircraft reach the conflict point, and the system performed as designed. [...] However, the NTSB has noted that while AMASS alerted in this incident, it did not alert in time to prevent the <b>runway</b> <b>incursion.</b>|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} serious safety {{concerns}} in air traffic control are <b>runway</b> <b>incursions.</b> Traditional Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems level 2 safety systems detect <b>runway</b> <b>incursions</b> and potential collisions. The subsequent alerts to controllers often require immediate reaction by the controllers. A new, additional safety net for tower runway controllers was developed to provide longer reaction times for certain kinds of imminent runway conflicts. This new safety net detects if controllers give a conflicting clearance to an aircraft or vehicle contradictory to another clearance already given to another mobile. The new safety net concept was developed in context of SESAR. It was tested in a shadow mode validation exercise at the operational environment of Hamburg Airport (Germany). Operational feasibility was tested in order to clarify if operational requirements in terms of usability are fulfilled. At the same time operational improvements regarding safety were studied...|$|R
40|$|<b>Runway</b> <b>incursions</b> are low {{probability}} events {{resulting from}} complex combinations of cognitive and environmental factors, which can have deadly consequences. However, {{the development and}} evaluation of tools to reduce <b>runway</b> <b>incursions</b> are, ironically, hampered by the low incidence of such events. A possible path forward {{is the use of}} high-fidelity cognitive models to predict pilot performance under a wide variety of airport conditions and runway circumstances. We describe a fully embodied ACT-R 6. 0 cognitive model, named SimPilot, of a pilot taxiing a simulated Boeing 737 - 800 aircraft. The goals of SimPilot are twofold. The first is automated testing of a new safety devices. The second goal is to show that modeling the multitasking inherent to taxiing in a cognitive plausible manner is an important step in predicting and preventing <b>runway</b> <b>incursions.</b> New tools are continually being developed to increase aviation safety by reducing human error. Since {{it has been shown that}} small changes in the design of a system can lead to large changes in human performance, imagine the potential changes that could occur as the result of introducing a new tool. To ensure that the changes introduced are beneficial, extensive testing with subject matter experts (SMEs) is required, but in the aviation domain this is expensive. A potential solution to this problem is simulating SMEs with cognitive models. The type of models that can provide useful simulations are process models that can actually do the task and are based on a cognitiv...|$|R
