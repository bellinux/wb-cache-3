ABSTRACT: <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> a set of beliefs of an individual or a set of people. Language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> as sacred as any <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> itself. Language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> distinctive as well as prior to everyday language. In spite of many distinctive features language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> also having some similar features to the other registers. Language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> dynamic and complex regarding its function, style and interrelation with other texts. In this article language of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> stylistically analyzed. Stylistic features like grammatical level, graphological effects, phonological level and semantics discussed {{on the basis of}} stylistic analysis...|$|R

The Bamum ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim. Native traditional <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character.|$|E

5000|$|Reza Aslan {{argues that}} the idea that {{apostasy}} is treason rather than exercise of freedom of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> not so much part of Islam, {{as part of the}} pre-modern era when classical Islamic fiqh was developed, and when [...] "every <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> a `religion of the sword`".This was also an era in which religion and the state were one unified entity. ... no Jew, Christian, Zoroastrian, or Muslim of this time would have considered his or her <b>religion</b> to <b>be</b> rooted in the personal confessional experiences of individuals. ...

5|$|Hong Kong {{enjoys a}} high degree of {{religious}} freedom, guaranteed by the Basic Law. Hong Kong's main <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism; a local religious scholar in contact with major denominations estimates there are approximately 1.5 million Buddhists and Taoists. A Christian community of around 833,000 forms about 11.7% of the total population; Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics by a ratio of 4:3, and smaller Christian communities also exist, including the Latter-day Saints and Jehovah's Witnesses.

The practice of Falun Gong is tolerated.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> similar.|$|E
50|$|Religion for Atheists: A non-believer's {{guide to}} the uses of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> a book by Alain de Botton {{published}} in 2012.

50|$|This factor {{assesses the}} individual’s {{evaluation}} {{of the extent to}} which <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> central to their identity as Pacific, and the extent to which they believe <b>religion</b> to <b>be</b> entwined with Pacific culture. <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> an important aspect of Pacific identity, having a huge influence on many Pacific communities by providing social connections and support, and fulfilling cultural and religious needs. This factor focuses on Christianity-based <b>religions</b> which <b>are</b> the most common in Pacific societies. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels that Christianity-based <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> a central aspect of self-identity, and is strongly linked to their Pacific culture.|$|R

50|$|<b>Religion,</b> to Wright, <b>is</b> {{a science}} built on false foundations.

If <b>religion</b> <b>were</b> built on empirical foundations, Wright suggests the truth should be evident {{and there would be}} no disagreements therefore. Furthermore, Wright explains that the mere fact that the knowledge gained through <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> primarily belief, as opposed to experiential knowledge, exposes religion’s falsehood.|$|R
