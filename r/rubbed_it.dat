It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} Testudo statue lies {{in front of}} the McKeldin Library. The statue's nose is {{polished}} by passers-by that have <b>rubbed</b> <b>it</b> for good luck. Around finals week, students start giving offerings to Testudo in the hope of good grades. In 2013, the Testudo statue caught fire because of an ill-advised mixture of offerings and a lit candle. Local news channels reported about this event and it trended on Twitter.|$|E
25|$|Four overs {{into the}} morning, {{specialist}} spin bowler Ashley Giles {{was involved in}} a dismissal for the only time in the match, having Lee run out for 8. However, Jason Gillespie batted for an hour and 15 minutes, and took part in a 52-run stand with the recognised batsman, Katich before Simon Jones got his reward with an away-swinger that crashed into Gillespie's off stump, after having three catches dropped. The last wicket partnership <b>rubbed</b> <b>it</b> in with 43 more runs before Katich was caught by Simon Jones off Harmison, but England were set what would be a world record 420 to win.|$|E

500|$|Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props {{but young}} women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took {{two to three}} hours to apply. Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. Smith wished River Song's entrance to be a shocking surprise to the audience. A stunt double was used for some shots of the scene where River flies out of the Byzantium airlock, but Kingston wished to do some of it herself. The scene was filmed on a greenscreen with Kingston hooked up on wires that pulled her up and backwards as a wind machine was blown to create the effect of the airlock. Kingston said she [...] "absolutely loved" [...] filming the scene. For the scene in which sand pours out of Amy's eye as she rubs it, an eye patch containing sand that would be released when Gillan <b>rubbed</b> <b>it</b> was placed over her eye.|$|E
500|$|In early July 1955, Hensley began {{a series}} of {{meetings}} near Altha, Florida. He conducted the meetings without snakes for three weeks, before procuring a [...] snake and bringing it to a Sunday afternoon service on July 24. Several dozen people gathered at an abandoned blacksmith shop for the observance. During the service, Hensley loudly delivered a sermon on the topic of faith. He removed the snake from the lard can in which it was stored, wrapped it around his neck, and <b>rubbed</b> <b>it</b> on his face. He walked around the audience while preaching and then returned the snake to the can. As he placed the snake into the can, it bit him on his wrist. After a few minutes, Hensley became visibly ill, experiencing severe pain, a discolored arm, and hematemesis. He refused medical attention, although he remained in pain and was urged to seek treatment both by congregants and the Calhoun County Sheriff. One eyewitness claimed that Hensley attributed his suffering to the congregation's lack of faith, although his wife Sally stated that she believed it was the will of God. Hensley died early the next morning. Calhoun County Judge Hannah Gaskin ruled his death a suicide.|$|E
500|$|Negatively, Mika was {{included}} in Complexs list of the [...] "lamest" [...] Street Fighter characters, reasoning [...] "Street Fighter has never been shy with the gorgeous ladies, but they've always had full-figured back stories {{to go along with}} their full-figured backsides. Rainbow Mika on the other hand is the most blatant example of mysogynistic [...] character design seen in the series." [...] Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network declared Mika as [...] "the worst Street Fighter character," [...] reasoning [...] "every little detail about her annoyed me, from the stupid boob-hearts on her costume to the way she whomped opponents with her buttâ€”and <b>rubbed</b> <b>it</b> after she hit the ground." [...] At Paste, Eric Van Allen criticized her outfit by stating [...] "Even by Street Fighter standards, this amount of gratuitous flesh is rather ridiculous." [...] However, this opinion is not shared between all critics, with Nadia Oxford of USgamer finding Mika to be an example of positive female gender representation, writing [...] "I can say that I have nothing against, er, voluptuous women in games. Or even scantily-clad women", and that [...] "My problem has always been women characters whom I'm expected to take seriously while they slay dragons/wander the desert/travel the frozen wastes while baring their midriff through the majority of their journey", and that she enjoys Mika's [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "goofy" [...] design.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Luigi Garlaschelli, {{professor}} of organic chemistry at the University of Pavia, {{announced that he}} had made a full size reproduction of the Shroud of Turin using only medieval technologies. Garlaschelli placed a linen sheet over a volunteer and then <b>rubbed</b> <b>it</b> with an acidic pigment. The shroud was then aged in an oven before being washed to remove the pigment. He then added blood stains, scorches and water stains to replicate the original. But according to Giulio Fanti, {{professor of}} mechanical and thermic measurements at the University of Padua, [...] "the technique itself seems unable to produce an image having the most critical Turin Shroud image characteristics".|$|E
2500|$|The Pigeon Detectives's {{performance}} was also memorable as frontman Matt Bowman informed {{the crowd that}} he was too clean and then asked if anyone in the audience had any mud or muddy trainers that they could throw at him. This request was readily carried out by the crowd. Bowman himself then proceeded to pick up an armful of mud from the stage and <b>rubbed</b> <b>it</b> over his head. Later he ran down to the crowd, inviting fans to rub his hair, whilst {{at the end of their}} popular single [...] "I'm Not Sorry", he jumped off the stage into the crowd. This performance left Stage 2/NME noticeably caked in mud for the rest of the festival.|$|E
