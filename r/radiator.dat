In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the <b>radiator</b> under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler <b>radiator</b> housed alongside. Under the port wing a new <b>radiator</b> fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two <b>radiator</b> flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E

Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with <b>radiator</b> burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a <b>radiator</b> and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals.

5|$|At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is {{not fully}} set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is {{surprised}} to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from <b>Radiator</b> Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at <b>Radiator</b> Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put <b>Radiator</b> Springs back on the map.|$|E

5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia.

5|$|In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, K5054, {{was fitted}} with ejector type exhausts. Later {{marks of the}} Spitfire used a {{variation}} of this exhaust system fitted with forward-facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes, replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant <b>radiator.</b> The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial <b>radiator</b> antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable <b>radiator</b> leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E

Starring Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Jeanne Bates, Judith Anna Roberts, Laurel Near, and Jack Fisk, it tells the story of Henry Spencer (Nance), who is left to care for his grossly deformed child in a desolate industrial landscape. Throughout the film, Spencer experiences dreams or hallucinations, featuring his child and the Lady in the <b>Radiator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{technical}} {{changes to}} their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren introduced a revised aerodynamic for their MP4/15 chassis, aimed at {{increasing the amount}} of downforce, and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork. They also brought revised nose wings. BAR fitted their cars with one-off components that were produced to help optimise the performance of the monocoque's cooling systems. Ferrari introduced an aerodynamic set-up similar to that used at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the team debuted {{a modified version of the}} F1-2000's chimneys.

In this paper, integration of peltier elements with satellite <b>radiators</b> and heat pipes is discussed. A design was developed using those techniques.
