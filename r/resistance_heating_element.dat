40|$|This essay's main {{aim is to}} find {{an ideal}} <b>resistance</b> of the <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> and voltage for a simple water boiling kettle, if there exists, working under {{alternating}} current. By adjusting {{the size of the}} nichrome wire, which was selected as the <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> after research, the <b>resistance</b> of the <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> will be adjusted to desired values by changing its length while its resistance is measured by an ohmmeter. Resistances are to be 6 Ω, 8 Ω, 10 Ω, 12 Ω and 15 Ω since this is the range of which commercial kettles' <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> have. After all desired wires are achieved, these will then be put into the prepared circuit and be put under alternating current under different voltages. The voltages to be used are 200 V, 220 V, 230 V and 240 V because these voltages are also the range of which commercial kettles work under. When the circuit was completed, 0. 5 L of tap water started to heat up from the initial 20 oC to the 100 oC boiling point of the water. Using this method is a simple and effective way to determine an ideal <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> for a kettle in terms of greatest power output, which is the main goal of this essay. The experiment's resulting data showed that when the <b>resistance</b> of the <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> is equal to the total resistance of the circuit, which was taken as the internal resistance of the power source, the power output was maximum.

40|$|Experimentation to {{characterize}} the heat sink performance is often performed under different procedures and apparatuses specifically catered to {{the knowledge of the}} individual in the thermal testing laboratory.

Recently, thermoelectric devices (TED) are also being used as the heat source in heat sink laboratory experiments. The primary benefit of using a TED as a heat source in laboratory testing is that the TED is a unidirectional heat pump. All input electrical power is discharged to the TED hot side when properly used. This unidirectional heat pump process provides a more conservative experimental result, especially when calculating the experimental <b>heat</b> sink <b>resistance.</b> Contrarily to a TED, the resistance heater is a heat diffusion device, where the heat is dissipated to the surroundings by conduction.
