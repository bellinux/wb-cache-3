40|$|As an {{important}} part of high speed trains, any fault or failure of the bogie may cause fatal disaster and/or expensive lost.

For the <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> signals exited by bogies are short termed, non-periodic, non-stationary, not pre-separated corresponding to wheels, and with time-shifting of phases, they must be separated corresponding to each wheel for fault location. In this paper, to separate and reconstruct the vibration signals from two bogie wheels, a measurement mixing model is established and some assumptions about bogie speed, measure accordance, etc. are given. Based on envelope correlation analysis of signals from multi-sensors, the bogie speed and measurement windows are estimated so that the <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> signals can be separated corresponding to each bogie wheel, which allows the contact dynamics of the wheel-track to be characterized accurately for the purpose of diagnostics.

40|$|An {{improved}} <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> model {{based on}} the semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method has been developed, which allows multiple layers of support and the accurate shape of the rail cross-section {{to be considered in}} the modeling. Rail supports are treated as a continuous layer of equivalent springs connected to the rail foot. Three different assumed support conditions corresponding to no support; rail pads; and rail pads, sleepers and ballast have been modeled. By determining the track parameters from a field test, this model is demonstrated to be able to determine the dispersion relations and the forced responses of both free and variously supported rails. Further, the effect of rail damping including frequency-dependent viscous damping and frequency-independent structural damping on <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> responses is investigated. The effect of the adopted discretization strategy on the calculation is also studied. Model results are compared with predictions from the Timoshenko beam-based rail models with the same support conditions. The results show that track support dynamic stiffness can be incorporated into the developed SAFE rail model which can then be used to represent the real track situation at a site; the rail support can significantly affect rail dispersion and frequency responses below 1. kHz; the Timoshenko beam-based rail models provide an inadequate prediction of <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> response, particularly in the lateral direction, if response at specific frequencies is required; the rail damping has limited impact on <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> responses; and the number of elements has insignificant effect on the calculated rail responses and wave dispersion relations, especially away from the excitation point...|$|E

The downward transmissibility of vertical <b>rail</b> <b>vibrations</b> is greatest around the antiresonance frequency of the <b>rail.</b> Vertical <b>rail</b> <b>vibrations</b> are primarily transmitted in the downward direction at low frequencies, while they are mainly transmitted along the rail at high frequencies.

30|$|Now {{it is well}} {{understood}} that the pinned–pinned vibration of the rail has an important impact on noise radiation and roughness growth. <b>Rail</b> <b>vibration</b> dampers (or <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> absorbers) [24, 25] are thus designed and installed between sleepers in order to suppress the pinned–pinned vibration. The rail damper proposed in [24] are tuned, damped mass–spring absorber systems, with either a single mass or two masses enclosed in an elastomeric material. These rail dampers have been installed at several sites in Europe, with some variations in design. To evaluate the effect of rail dampers on wheel–rail interaction forces and rail roughness growth [26], based on [6], uses the FEM to model the track. The track is truncated to include 50 sleeper bays (30  m in length) and the rail is modeled using four Timoshenko beam elements per sleeper bay. With such a track model being used, differential equations have to be solved in the time-domain at a low computational efficiency and possibly at a low accuracy. This is an obvious disadvantage of the FEM modeling approach, since the prediction of roughness growth requires {{a very large number}} of repetitious wheel/rail interaction calculations. Wu [27] outlines guidelines for designing rail dampers. When the damper is not short compared to the sleeper spacing, bending of the beam in a damper may play a role. However, it is demonstrated in [28] that it is the rigid body motion of the beam of the absorber that leads to energy dissipation of <b>rail</b> <b>vibration,</b> whereas the bending deformation of the beam is a minor factor. Therefore, a simple mass–spring model in which the mass is allowed to vibrate translationally and rotationally, instead of an advanced beam–spring model, is enough to represent the rail damper.|$|E

40|$|A {{desirable}} {{capability for}} those seeking to understand, and manage, railway rolling noise {{is the ability}} to separate the contributions from the wheel and track from revenue service train pass-by events. Relevant aspects of these contributions are the contributions to either: the excitation mechanism, driven by contacting surface roughness; or, to the noise radiated by the various elements of the vehicle and track. Efficient methods for both rolling noise separation, and wheel and rail roughness estimation, have been proposed, including a method known as VTN for noise separation and Janssens‘s Method for roughness estimation. Each relies on simplified models. The validity and acceptability for use have not been adequately tested. Field tests were conducted in order to test the validity of these methods. The results show that, using VTN as currently implemented, estimation errors relative to measured values, for overall noise level, of 2. 3 dB(A). In contrast, predictions of the noise spectra result in errors of up to 20 dB at a certain frequencies. For roughness estimation, Janssens‘s method returns roughness values with errors of 10 dB for some wavelengths for the total wheel and rail effective roughness. In an attempt to improve the accuracy of these methods, more accurate parameter estimation models have been developed. These are based on the novel use of: the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method for the <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> model; and the Wave-number Boundary Element (WBE) method for the rail radiation model. The SAFE rail model has been developed to accommodate multiple layers of rail support. <b>Rail</b> <b>vibration</b> and radiation behaviours have been investigated utilising these <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> and radiation models. The results show that 1) practical models for determining the key parameters for rolling noise and roughness prediction, incorporating more accurate assumptions for rail and rail support behaviour can be developed; 2) below 1 kHz, the assumed rail support has a significant effect on both the calculated <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> response and dispersion relations as well as the calculated rail radiation power; 3) the results also show that the assumed rail support has a limited effect on the rail radiation ratio, under a vertical excitation, and on the calculated rail radiation directivity, under either vertical or lateral excitation; 4) the Timoshenko beam-based rail model adequately predicts vertical <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> response for the rail foot centre but inadequately predictions of the rail lateral response, should accurate predictions be required for particular frequencies, as is the case for the separation of wheel and rail rolling noise from a total noise measurement; and, 5) the analytical line source model is inadequate for the prediction of the rail radiation directivity factor above 1 kHz, and the rail radiation ratio given lateral excitation. The parameters obtained by using the SAFE and WBE rail models developed have been applied to both the VTN rolling noise separation method and Janssens‘s roughness estimation method. Field tests undertaken show that 1) for those cases analysed, the application of the new models results in accurate prediction of rail radiation i. e. elimination of the over-estimation typical of the existing models, and 2) calculated wheel and rail total effective roughness correlation can be improved, with the total effective roughness from direct wheel and rail roughness measurements. In addition to providing more accurate parameters for the VTN and Janssens‘s methods, the models developed in this work {{can also be used to}} improve the accuracy of rolling noise prediction software as well as to investigate the design of rail dampers and low profile noise barriers. Validation of these results using more extensive field trials is required in order to confirm these results. In addition, although the rail models developed allow the inclusion of multiple layers of support with different characteristics, they only accommodate the assumption of a continuous support. A more accurate model would allow discrete supports so representing the actual support provided by the sleepers. The effect of this limitation is restricted to specific frequencies...|$|E

This is useful for the identification of sound sources and the assessment of the track contribution. In this paper, a practical application on a high-speed track is discussed. Acoustic measurements were conducted on a high-speed slab track, with pass-bys of the Thalys and conventional intercity trains, at speeds of around 300 and 160 km/h, respectively. Both sound pressure and vertical <b>rail</b> <b>vibrations</b> were recorded simultaneously.

The transfer function of the slab track is compared with a conventional concrete sleeper track, showing a distinct difference in the low and medium frequency ranges. The transfer function is characteristic of rolling noise, and if also measured at high speed, the contribution of aerodynamic noise can be quantified. For this train/track combination, aerodynamic sound sources are shown to contribute to the pass-by levels mainly in the lower frequency range. Based on the transfer functions and roughness levels, it is shown that rolling noise is still a significant noise source up to 300 km/h. © 2012 Springer...|$|R

To answer this question, the attenuation characteristics of the main propagating waves are required {{as a function of}} distance.

A numerical method called the wavenumber finite element (WFE) method is utilized to predict decay rates for a rail on a continuous foundation. Damping is introduced in this track model by the material damping in the rail and in the foundation. In order to improve the simulated results, the frequency dependent damping loss factor of a rail has been measured up to 80 kHz on short rail samples.

40|$|Theoretical models, such as TWINS, and {{microphone}} array measurements {{have been widely}} used to gain better understanding of rolling noise.

A comparison in terms of noise and <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> has been carried out for six wheel/rail conditions of Japanese railways.

The acoustic properties of a rail as measured with a microphone array have been investigated through simulations and field tests. In the simulation the rail is modelled as an array of multiple sources. Results are given for two situations: (a) the multiple sources are incoherent, which is assumed in determining sound power from a microphone array, (b) the sources are coherent, which is more representative of the rail radiation. It is found that the microphone array cannot detect {{a large part of the}} noise generated by the rail in the frequency range where free wave propagation occurs. Sound measurements were carried out to validate the radiation model of the rail by using a shaker excitation of a track. It is found that the noise is radiated from the rail at an angle to the normal when free wave propagation occurs in the rail, and that the predictions based on coherent sources show good agreement with the measurements. Sound measurements for a moving train were also performed with a microphone array. It is shown that the microphone array misses a large part of noise generated by the rail, when directed normal to the rail.

40|$|Abstract: A {{compound}} track–absorber {{model is}} employed {{to study the}} performance of a rail vibrationabsorber in reducing the rail componentof rollingnoise. The rail vibrationand radiation due to a roughness excitation are calculated {{with the use of the}} absorber. Different types of rail absorber and installation locations are considered in calculations to investigate their influence on the absorber’s performance. The theoretical predictions show that the rail-radiated noise can be reduced by about 6 – 8 dB(A) using the rail absorber for the situation modelled here. The most appropriate installation place for a discrete absorber is at mid-span between sleepers because the vibration response there is large. As the <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> amplitude is small at sleepers, they are not the appropriate installation place for a discrete absorber to reduce rail radiation via energy dissipation.

40|$|The {{control of}} railway rolling noise {{requires}} {{a reduction in}} wheel and track noise emission. In this paper, a parametric study of the possible minimization of the track sound power is presented. In an initial global approach, a number of potential variations in track parameters are assessed {{in terms of their}} likely effect on rolling noise. From this, two main themes are selected for deeper study by use of TWINS model. The first parameter considered is the stiffness and damping of the rail-pad. By reducing the pad stiffness, the noise radiation from the sleeper is reduced but that from the rail is increased, and vice versa. An optimum is found when the rail and sleeper components are equal, for which the track radiation is a minimum. Starting from one existing track design, this optimum pad stiffness has been derived for an example wheel. The second area investigated is the increase of the attenuation rate of <b>rail</b> <b>vibrations</b> by the addition of damping measures. The implementation of dynamic absorbers with a mass of 5 kg every sleeper bay (0. 6 m) leads to predicted reductions of track radiation of 2 dB(A) if the rail-pad stiffness is already optimal. For softer pads a larger reduction has been found, but the total effect is less than the combined effect of first changing to the optimum pad stiffness and then adding absorbers. Globally, for ballasted track with bibloc concrete sleepers, a 2 - 6 dB(A) reduction in track sound power can be expected through a rail-pad optimization and/or the implementation of dynamic absorbers on the rail...|$|R

First, the energy absorption characteristics of damping chamber elements with various gradation combinations and compaction indices were measured in the laboratory using compression testing. The laboratory compression results demonstrated that the optimal gradation combination of damping chamber elements is as follows: the content of fine rubber particles is 10 %, the content of coarse granules is 90 %, and the optimal compaction index is 0. 98. Next, the findings from the laboratory compression-test studies were used to produce damping chamber elements that were applied to a full-scale modern track model in the laboratory. The measurements of the dynamic properties indicated that the damping chamber elements could significantly reduce the vibration levels of the rail head. Finally, the damping chamber elements, which had been proven effective through laboratory dynamic tests, were widely applied to test rail sections in the field. The field tests demonstrated that damping chamber elements can significantly increase the track vibration decay rate in the frequency range of 200 – 10000 [*]Hz.

The purpose of this investigation is to enhance the understanding and modelling of the influence from small-scale surface roughness on the generation of rolling contact forces.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{counteract}} the problem of railway noise and its environmental impact, passing trains in Europe must be tested in accordance to a noise legislation that demands the quantification of the noise generated by the vehicle alone. However, for frequencies between about 500  Hz and 1600  Hz, {{it has been found}} that {{a significant part of the}} measured noise is generated by the rail, which behaves like a distributed source and radiates plane waves as a result of the contact with the train's wheels. Thus the need arises for separating the rail contribution to the pass-by noise in that particular frequency range. To this end, the present paper introduces a wavenumber–domain filtering technique, referred to as wave signature extraction, which requires a line microphone array parallel to the rail, and two accelerometers on the rail in the vertical and lateral direction. The novel contributions of this research are: (i) the introduction and application of wavenumber (or plane–wave) filters to pass-by data measured with a microphone array located in the near-field of the rail, and (ii) the design of such filters without prior information of the structural properties of the rail. The latter is achieved by recording the array pressure, as well as the <b>rail</b> <b>vibrations</b> with the accelerometers, before and after the train pass-by. The performance of the proposed method is investigated with a set of pass-by measurements performed in Germany. The results seem to be promising when compared to reference data from TWINS, and the largest discrepancies occur above 1600  Hz and are attributed to plane waves radiated by the rail that so far have not been accounted for in the design of the filters.

Despite its applicability to many physical phenomena, three-dimensional finite element simulation of rail-wheel dynamic interaction remains to be a computationally formidable task due to the minute size of the rail-wheel instantaneous contact zone. In this thesis, a beam and a plane finite element models are constructed to examine the rail-wheel dynamic interaction. The beam finite element model composes of two-dimensional Timoshenko beam elements whilst contact is mimicked by using a nonlinear contact spring. On the other hand, the plane finite element model composes of plane elements. While very small elements are used on the contacting surfaces, i. e. the wheel rim and rail top, the element size away from the surfaces is kept large {{in order to reduce the}} number of elements. To transit the mesh from dense to coarse, different transition meshes are examined and the one showing the best accuracy is employed. Meanwhile, two different ways of simulated contact are examined. The chosen method of kinematic constraint can deliver a reasonable accuracy and, unlike the penalty method, would not reduce the critical time increment in explicit time integration. The contact forces predicted by the beam and plane finite element models are compared. It is noted that the trends of the contact forces predicted by two finite element models show good agreements with each other. However, the plane finite element model has several advantages in the simulations of rail/wheel dynamics over the beam finite element model. The effects of high wheel speed and multiple rolling wheels on rail/wheel dynamics are investigated. It is found that both the high wheel speed and multiple rolling wheels on a rail lead to more severe rail vibrations. Owing to its advantages in the simulations of rail/wheel dynamics, the plane finite element model is then applied to examine the damping capacities of tuned mass damper which is a promising means for reducing the <b>rail</b> <b>vibration.</b> The predicted rail acceleration reveals that the <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> can be attenuated considerably when the tuned mass damper is installed. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|A {{microphone}} array has been employed {{to locate the}} major sound sources on a moving low speed electric train and analyze the characteristics of train noise. Besides using the traditional delay and sum beamforming for analysis, a new deconvolution method was developed which works for a moving line source model similar to the moving train noise. In the noise model, a moving line source was represented {{by a series of}} discrete moving sources, with some sources having higher power and the powers of the other sources having small fluctuation about a mean level. This noise model was verified in our in-situ measurement where the major sources were located at the wheel positions and the variation of noise level along the middle part of a train unit were found to be small. Different simulations were performed and results showed that the new deconvolution method can give more accurate source power estimates than the delay and sum beamforming method. From the train noise analysis, {{it was found that the}} wheels are the major sources at low and mid frequency range, but not at high frequency (>l. 5 kHz). <b>Rail</b> <b>vibration</b> was deduced to be the major source at high frequency range. The relative noise contribution from different parts of a moving train was investigated. Large variation of noise level emitted from wheel positions were found and should be related to their maintenance conditions...|$|E
40|$|Summary A {{theoretical}} model is developed {{to explore the}} high frequency wheel/rail interaction with coupling between the vertical and lateral directions. This coupling is introduced through the track dynamics due to the offset of the wheel/rail contact point from the rail centre line. Equivalent models of the railway track in the time domain are developed according to the <b>rail</b> <b>vibration</b> receptances in the frequency domain. The wheel is represented by a mass in each direction with no vertical-lateral coupling. The vertical wheel/rail interaction is generated through a non-linear Hertzian contact stiffness, allowing {{for the possibility of}} loss of contact between the wheel and rail. The lateral interaction is represented by a contact spring and a creep force damper in series and their values depend on the vertical contact force. The vibration source is the roughness on the wheel and rail contact surfaces which forms a relative displacement excitation in the vertical direction. Using the combined interaction model with this relative displacement excitation, the wheel/rail interactions with coupling between the vertical and lateral vibrations are simulated. It is found that the lateral interaction force caused by the offset is usually less than thirty percent of the vertical dynamic force. The lateral vibration of the rail is significantly reduced due to the presence of the lateral coupling, whereas the vertical interaction is almost unaffected by the lateral force...|$|E
40|$|The {{road and}} rail {{accidents}} are increasing {{with the advancement}} of human errors. Majority of the level crossing positions are not guided by any accident preventive mechanism and even not accompanied by a skilled person. This paper presents an automatic rail gate control system at level crossing positions and accident prevention mechanism. Two vibration sensors are used to control the open and close state of the gate at level crossing position. An ultrasonic sensor is positioned to detect an unauthorized object on the track. Open and Close status of the gate and unauthorized object on the track will be communicated with the central control room using wireless communication protocol. The experimental results proved the proposed mechanism is a prudent approach to safeguard the human and to curtail the train accidents.

30|$|From {{the above}} {{simulation}} results, {{it is found}} that when wheels slip on the rail and the friction coefficient between the wheel and rail is large enough, unstable vibration of the wheel–rail system will occur, signifying that rail corrugation will arise. Therefore, the effective method for controlling and suppressing rail corrugation in high-speed tracks is to prevent wheels slipping on rails. If the wheel does not slip on the <b>rail,</b> self-excited <b>vibration</b> of the wheel–rail system will not take place. Thus, rail corrugation will not occur. The present result explains why rail corrugation most probably takes place in train brake sections of tracks. This is because the wheel is easy to slip on the rail due to a low coefficient of friction when a train is braked at a high speed. This result {{can also be used to}} explain why most of rails in high-speed tracks are not subjected to corrugation, where wheel slipping on rail rarely takes place.|$|R

This prototype aims at the reduction of the squealing noise emitted in closed curves from tram operation. This activity will support European noise policy to eliminate harmful effects of noise exposure and decrease levels of transport noise creation, especially in urban areas, deriving solutions that will ensure compliance with the constraints of legislative limits. Results comparing both "After" & "Before" campaigns, for all reference speeds of 10, 20 & 25 Km/h, suggests an important squeal noise diminution for each Leq passage of some 8 - 12 dB(A) for the distance of 7, 5 m & microphone height of 1, 2 m in the interior of each curve (internal direction) ...|$|R
