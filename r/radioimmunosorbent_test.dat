40|$|Immunoglobulin E (IgE) {{levels in}} sera of eighty-four {{patients}} with sarcoidosis and fifty-one apparently healthy controls were measured {{by means of}} a <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test</b> (RIST). A significant decrease in IgE level was commonly seen in patients with sarcoidosis. In some patients, a typical isolated IgE deficiency was noted. In a group of patients with significantly low serum IgE levels, reduced immune responsiveness affecting the IgE class was suggested from the study on reaginic-type skin reactions. The implication of these findings with respect to the immunology and etiology of sarcoidosis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|It was {{possible}} to detect in the sera of patients, for whom visceral larva migrans had been confirmed histologically, not only antibodies to the excretoryâ€“secretory antigens of Toxocara canis by means of fluorescence techniques, but also specific homocytotropic antibody measured by passive cutaneous anaphylactic tests in baboons and monkeys. It was observed that these patients had ten to fifteen times the average normal level of IgE {{as determined by the}} <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test.</b> All cases authenticated histologically gave these results, which suggests that these sort of serological findings can make a contribution towards establishing a diagnosis of visceral larva migrans in man...|$|E
40|$|Total {{immunoglobulin}} E (IgE) {{and specific}} IgE were assayed by a <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test</b> and a reverse enzyme immunoassay {{in patients with}} hookworm infections before and after treatment. A total of 77 subjects (30 patients with hookworm infections and 47 subjects as controls) were studied. Both specific and total IgE levels in serum and jejunal juice were raised in hookworm patients. There was {{a significant decrease in}} IgE levels after therapy. Total IgE levels were raised in other nematode infections, but specific IgE levels were low. The reverse enzyme immunoassay for specific IgE was highly specific (96 %) and sensitive (100 %) and may be used in the serodiagnosis of hookworm infections...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Congestive {{heart failure}} (CHF) {{is a major}} public health problem. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) tests shows {{promising}} diagnostic accuracy. Herein, we summarize the evidence on the accuracy of BNP tests in the diagnosis of CHF and compare the performance of rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and standard <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> assay (RIA) <b>tests.</b> METHODS: We searched electronic databases and the reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts. Data were extracted on the study population, the type of test used, and methods. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots and summary ROC curves were produced and negative likelihood ratios pooled. Random-effect meta-analysis and metaregression were used to combine data and explore sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Nineteen studies describing 22 patient populations (9 ELISA and 13 RIA) and 9093 patients were included. The diagnosis of CHF was verified by echocardiography, radionuclide scan, or echocardiography combined with clinical criteria. The pooled negative likelihood ratio overall from random-effect meta-analysis was 0. 18 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 13 - 0. 23). It was lower for the ELISA test (0. 12; 95 % CI, 0. 09 - 0. 16) than for the RIA test (0. 23; 95 % CI, 0. 16 - 0. 32). For a pretest probability of 20 %, which is typical for patients with suspected CHF in primary care, a negative result of the ELISA test would produce a posttest probability of 2. 9 %; a negative RIA test, a posttest probability of 5. 4 %. CONCLUSIONS: The use of BNP tests to rule out CHF in primary care settings could reduce demand for echocardiography. The advantages of rapid ELISA tests need to be balanced against their higher cost...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Children with {{spina bifida}} (SB) {{have a high}} degree of {{exposure}} to latex products as a consequence of repeated surgical procedures, implantation of latex-containing materials and catheterisation. The consequence is a higher incidence of latex allergic reactions. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the prevalence of latex sensitisation and allergy in a population of children with myelomeningocele (MMC) and to assess the role of associated risk factors. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of the patients (29 out of 60) showed a latex sensitisation with specific IgE > 0. 7 kU/l while 15 % (9 out of 60) were allergic to latex (specific IgE > 0. 7 kU/l and clinical manifestations). The principal factor correlated with allergy to latex was specific serum IgE to latex (radioallergosorbent test [RAST]) values (p< 0. 01). Other factors were total serum IgE (paper <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test</b> [PRIST]) values, number of surgical procedures and familiarity with allergy. CONCLUSION: These results underline the importance of prophylactic measures to avoid the exposure, not only in the sanitary environment, through the institution of latex-safe routes, but also in daily life, to prevent potentially serious allergic reactions...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} of IgG, IgA and IgM in serum and sputum from {{patients with chronic}} obstructive lung desease {{was carried out by}} radial immunodiffusion method. The concentration of IgE in the sera and sputa was also determined by <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test.</b> The mean IgA level in the sputa showed no significant defference between the control, bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema groups, but the sputam from patients with pulumonary emphysema had a tendency to give higher mean values of IgA. The mean value of IgE in the sputam was not significantly different among four groups, but the number of sputa with measurable IgE concentration was much greater in chronic obstructive lung desease group. There was no significant difference of the mean IgG level in the sputa between the four groups, but there was a tendency to increase the mean IgG level in the sputa from the bronchial asthma group. IgM was detectabel in a few samples. Results of the present study suggested that the increased IgA and IgE in sputa might play a role in causative and/or pathophysiological mechanism in cases of chronic obstructive lung disease...|$|E
40|$|As {{reported}} previously, {{and confirmed}} here in 26 donors, the serum IgE level (2. 6 - 5, 500 ng/ml) correlates well (rs = 0. 95, P less than 0. 001) with the in vivo number of IgE molecules/basophil (6, 000 - 600, 000). The {{total number of}} IgE receptors/basophil was monitored by incubating them with an IgE-rich serum (15 microgram/ml), quantitatively stripping IgE from the cells at pH 3. 7, and measuring eluted IgE by a direct <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test.</b> Saturation of receptors for each donor was achieved with 15 nM IgE (3 microgram/ml). The proportion of receptors occupied in vivo correlated with the serum IgE (rs = 0. 84, P less than 0. 001) whereas the average association constant of the receptors was independent of serum IgE and ranged from 7. 1 X 10 (8) /M to 2. 8 X 10 (10) /M, averaging 7. 7 X 10 (9) /M. Unexpectedly, {{the total number of}} IgE receptors/basophil was closely related to the serum IgE level. (rs = 0. 92, P less than 0. 001). Thus, either there is genetic association between serum IgE and the number of basophil IgE receptors, or, more likely, the receptor number is modulated by the serum IgE concentration...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com A generalized skin eruption with strong itching was induced by sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitor, {{in a patient}} almost 6 months after initiation of the drug. Physical examination revealed a spread of skin rash from chest to back, and abdomen and thigh. Discontinuation of the drug eliminated the skin rash immediately. The emergence of new rash ended, and the rash itself withered after 1 week. The spread of the rash gradually shrank and the skin lesions subsided, leaving pigmentation 1 month later. Two months after cessation of sitagliptin, the skin eruption had subsided and oral steroid medication was stopped, but some small eczematous eruptions continued to appear intermittently. Although a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test was negative for sitagliptin, nonspecific <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test</b> for immunoglobulin E was increased to 532 IU/mL, with a percentage of eosinophil of 7. 4 %. Sitagliptin has a phenyl ring, carbonyl group, and an absorption spectrum showing three absorption peaks (199. 9, 265. 0, 400. 1 nm), and its photosensitive mechanism could {{have been responsible for}} the itchy edematous plaque. In the present case, the initial generalized skin eruption may have been induced by an allergic reaction to sitagliptin. Close attention should be paid to patients receiving this drug with a history of urticaria, and to the development of photosensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sweating plays a {{key role}} in skin homeostasis, {{including}} antimicrobial and moisturizing effects, and regulation of skin surface pH. Impaired axon reflex-mediated (AXR) sweating has been observed in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the mechanism of such abnormal sudomotor axon reflex remains to be revealed. Methods: To investigate this mechanism, sudomotor function was analyzed using a quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (acetylcholine iontophoresis) in patients with AD (n= 26) and healthy volunteers (n= 12). Correlation between sudomotor function and certain background factors, including Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory score, Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score, number of circulating eosinophils, and serum concentrations of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and immunoglobulin E <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test,</b> was validated. Results: Latency time was significantly prolonged in AD (p= 0. 0352), and AXR sweating volume (mg/ 0 - 5 min) was significantly lower in AD patients than in healthy controls (p= 0. 0441). Direct sweating volume (mg/ 0 - 5 min) was comparable in AD patients and healthy controls. A significant correlation between the evaluation results of quantitative sudomotor axon reflex tests and certain background factors was not observed. The latency time in non-lesioned and lesioned areas for AD patients versus continuous anxiety value in the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the AXR versus SCORAD showed significant correlations (p= 0. 0424, p= 0. 0169, and p= 0. 0523, respectively). Conclusions: Although the number of study subjects was little, abnormal AXR sweating in patients with AD was observed. Correlative analysis suggests possible involvement of continuous anxiety and the immune system in such abnormal sudomotor function...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} between heavy metals exposure and respiratory diseases or allergic sensitization showing high serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) has been suggested. However, previous {{findings have been}} inconsistent and the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. We evaluated heavy metal exposure and its association with coughing, itchy eyes in chronic cough patients with different IgE levels. Ninety outpatients in Kanazawa University Hospital were recruited between Januaryâ€“June 2011. Subjects whose total IgE measured by <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test</b> were asked to record their daily symptoms. We collected daily total suspended particles (TSP) from which concentrations of calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) were determined then divided into high and low level groups. Generalized estimating equations were applied to compute the relationship between concentrations of these metals and symptoms. All metals at high levels {{were significantly associated with}} itchy eyes compared with low levels, with exception of Ca, the six others were significant in patients with IgE < 250 IU/mL. Cd, Fe, Mn had association with coughing (odds ratio-OR (95 % confidence interval-CI) : 1. 13 (1. 03, 1. 24), 1. 22 (1. 05, 1. 42), and 1. 13 (1. 01, 1. 27), respectively), this relationship remained significant for Cd (OR (95 % CI) : 1. 14 (1. 03, 1. 27)) and Mn (OR (95 % CI) : 1. 15 (1. 00, 1. 31)) in patients with lower IgE. Our findings demonstrate the relationship between aerial heavy metals and itchy eyes, coughing in chronic cough patients, suggesting these symptoms may be due to a non-IgE mediated mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Serum IgE {{level was}} {{measured}} by the method of <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test</b> (RIST) in 353 subjects including 183 patients with bronchial asthma. One hundred and twenty patients with other pulmonary diseases and allergic diseases, and 50 normal adults for the control. Also, the level of specific IgE antibody to house dust {{was measured by}} the method of radioallergosorbent test (RAST) in patients with bronchial asthma. In patients with bronchial asthma, the IgE level was evaluated according to the following conditions, i. e., types by Swinfold's classification, age groups, seasons, peripheral blood counts of basophils and eosinophils and effects by immunotherapy. At the same time, the changes of specific IgE antibody level during the periods of house dust desensitization therapy was evaluated. The relusts were as follows: 1) The normal value of serum IgE level was 189 Â± 156 u/ml (meanÂ±one standard deviation) and bronchial asthma patients showed 1121 Â± 1147 u/ml, which was remarkably high. And, significantly high values were observed in patients with bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, drug allergy, diffuse interstitial pneumonitis and parasite diseases compared to normal control. In chronic bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, IgE level was about the same as control. 2) Serum IgE level was found to reduce with aging. 3) The seasonal changes of serum IgE level was not significant. 4) Serum IgE level was significantly higher in patients with atpic bronchial asthma than infectious type of bronchial asthma according to Swinfold's classification. 5) The peripheral blood counts of basophils and eosinophils did not correlate significantly with serum IgE level. 6) Serum IgE level after the long term house dust desensitization therapy did not change, but specific IgE antibody was found to be decreased in 2 out of 5 bronchial asthma patients with more than 2 +RAST score. 7) In intractable asthmaticus the significant relationship was observed between the clinical improvement by the continuous low dose administration of 6 -Mercaptopurine and the decrease of serum IgE level, but the corticosteroids therapy did not affect on the IgE level...|$|E
40|$|Serum IgE {{level was}} {{measured}} by the methods of <b>radioimmunosorbent</b> <b>test</b> (RIST) in 116 subjects including 41 patients with malignant lymphomas and 20 patients of myasthenia gravis. In Hodgkin's disease, the serum IgE level was evaluated according to the clinical stages and to the effects of chemotherapy. Also, the changes of serum IgE level was compared before and after thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients. The results were as follows: 1) Patients with Hodgkin's disease showed remarkably high IgE levels (1726 Â± 2180 u/ml). But, serum IgE level in patients with reticulum cell sarcoma, lymphosarcoma, multiple myeloma except IgE myeloma, leukemia and lung cancer was below the normal value. 2) Most of Hodgkin's disease patients with stage â…¢ showed high IgE level. 3) Hodgkin's disease patients with mixed cellularity according to Rye's classification showed higher IgE level than other histological types. 4) IgE level in most of Hodgkin's disease patients decreased after chemotherapy. The rebound of IgE level was remarked after cessation of chemotherapy in some of the complete remission patients. 5) The background of allergic disposition was negligible in Hodgkin's disease patients with high IgE level. Most of the patients showed negative reactions of PPD skin test and low blastoid reactivity of lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin, but the level of IgG, IgA and IgM was not significantly variable. These results suggest that the impaired regulatory functions due to T cells might be a cause of high IgE level in Hodgkin's disease. 6) In 6 cases of myasthenia gravis with proliferative thymoma, the temporary rebound phenomenon of IgE level in 2 months after thymectomy and the gradual decrease of IgE level after 18 months were characteristic. The simultaneous observations of T and B cells suggested that initial phenomenon might be due to the loss of suppressor T cell in the thymus and the second phenomenon might be due to the decrease of helper T cell in the peripheral lymphoid tissues...|$|E
