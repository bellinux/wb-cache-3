We employ the conditional order-m approach which is a nonparametric method for efficiency computation accounting for environmental variables. Effects of environmental variables are assessed using the non-parametric significance test and partial regression plots. We find not-for-profit ownership and a presence of a specialized center in a hospital to be detrimental to hospital performance {{in the group of}} small and medium hospitals, while not-for-pro t ownership is favorable to efficiency for big hospitals. Generally, hospital performance gets worse in period 2009 - 2010 because additional <b>revenues</b> <b>received</b> <b>in</b> form of user charges which were introduced in 2008 increase spending of hospitals.

This is supported by the fact that remittances are largely used for consumption purposes and contribute to smoothing private consumption. Using a large sample of developing countries observed over the period 1980 - 2006, and even after factoring in the endogeneity of remittances and VAT adoption, the results highlight that remittances significantly increase both the level and the stability of government tax <b>revenue</b> ratio <b>in</b> <b>receiving</b> countries that have adopted the VAT.
