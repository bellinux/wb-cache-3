It is true, vitality and <b>reactive</b> <b>energy</b> might have survived such a process; but that vitality would have shown itself just as it has in France--in struggles and convulsions. The frequent revolutions of France are not a thing to be sneered at; they are not evidences of fickleness, but of constancy; they are, in fact, a prolonged struggle for liberty, in which there occur periods of defeat, but in which, after every interval of repose, the strife is renewed. Their great difficulty has been, that the destruction of the reformed church in France took out of the country entirely that element of religious rationalism which is at once conservative and progressive.|$|E

50|$|Engineers have {{at their}} {{disposal}} many meters, {{that are able to}} read and display electrical power waveforms and calculating parameters of the waveforms. These parameters may include, for example, current and voltage RMS, phase relationship between waveforms of a multi-phase signal, power factor, frequency, THD, active power (kW), reactive power (kVAr), apparent power (kVA) and active energy (kWh), <b>reactive</b> <b>energy</b> (kVArh) and apparent energy (kVAh) and many more. In order to sufficiently monitor unforeseen events, Ribeiro et al. explains that {{it is not enough to}} display these parameters, but to also capture voltage waveform data at all times. This is impracticable due to the large amount of data involved, causing what is known the “bottle effect”. For instance, at a sampling rate of 32 samples per cycle, 1,920 samples are collected per second. For three-phase meters that measure both voltage and current waveforms, the data is 6-8 times as much. More practical solutions developed in recent years store data only when an event occurs (for example, when high levels of power system harmonics are detected) or alternatively to store the RMS value of the electrical signals. This data, however, is not always sufficient to determine the exact nature of problems.|$|E

50|$|The taper {{design for}} {{controlling}} the sidelobe level would therefore involve only the relative unbalance Δb/bm.The transverse equivalent network is slightly {{complicated by the}} presence of two additional changes in height of the waveguide,which can be modeled by means of shunt susceptances and ideal transformers.The ideal transformer accounts for the change in the characteristic impedance, while the storing of <b>reactive</b> <b>energy</b> is taken into account through the susceptance.Scanning arrays achieve scanning in two dimensions by creating a one-dimensional phased array of leaky-wave line-source antennas. The individual line sources are scanned in elevation by varying the frequency.Scanning in the cross plane, and therefore in azimuth, is produced by phase shifters arranged in the feed structure of the one-dimensional array of line sources.The radiation will therefore occur in pencil-beam form and will scan in both elevation and azimuth in a conical-scan manner.The spacing between the line sources is chosen such that no grating lobes occur, and accurate analyses show that no blind spots appear anywhere.The described arrays have been analyzed accurately by unit-cell approach that takes into account all mutual-coupling effects.Each unit cell incorporates an individual line-source antenna, but in the presence of all the others.The radiating termination on the unit cell modifies the transverse equivalent network.A key new feature of the array analysis is therefore the determination of the active admittance of the unit cell in the two-dimensional environment as a function of scan angle.If the values of β and α did not change with phase shift, the scan would be exactly conical.However, it is found that these values change only a little, so that the deviation from conical scan is small.We next consider whether or not blind spots are present.Blind spots refer to angles at which the array cannot radiate or receive any power; if a blind spot occurred at some angle, therefore, the value of α would rapidly go to zero at that scan angle.To check for blind spots, we would then look for any sharp dips in the curves of α/k0 as a function of scan angle. No such dips were ever found.Typical data of this type exhibit fairly flat behavior for α/k0 until the curves drop quickly to zero as they reach the end of the conical-scan range, where the beam hits the ground.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper titled "Coherent {{electromagnetic}} wavelets and their twisting null congruences," I defined the local inertia density (I), <b>reactive</b> <b>energy</b> density (R), and energy flow velocity (v) of an electromagnetic field. These are the field equivalents of the mass, rest energy, and velocity of a relativistic particle. Thus R and I are Lorentz-invariant and |v|<=c, with equality if {{and only if}} R= 0. The exceptional fields with |v|=c were called "coherent" because their energy moves in complete harmony with the field, leaving no inertia or <b>reactive</b> <b>energy</b> behind. Generic electromagnetic fields become coherent only in the far zone. Elsewhere, their energy flows at speeds |v|<c. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to confirm and clarify this statement by studying the local energy flow in several common systems: a time-harmonic electric dipole field, a time-dependent electric dipole field, and a standing plane wave. For these fields, the energy current (Poynting vector) is too weak to carry away all of the energy, thus leaving <b>reactive</b> <b>energy</b> in its wake. For the time-dependent dipole field, we find that the energy can flow both transversally and inwards, back to the source. Neither of these phenomena show up in the usual computation of the energy transport velocity which considers only averages over one period in the time-harmonic case.

The projectile undergoes H/D exchange with the dangling −OD (−OH) bond present on amorphous ice surfaces. It is also shown that H/D exchange product disappears when amorphous ice is annealed to the crystalline phase.
