50|$|In a {{cosolvent}} system, two miscible fluids {{with different}} boiling points are mixed {{to create a}} zeotropic mixture. The first fluid is a solvating agent that dissolves soil in the cleaning process. This fluid is an organic solvent with a low-boiling point and a flash point greater than the system's operating temperature. After the solvent mixes with the oil, the second fluid, a hydrofluoroether rinsing agent (HFE), rinses off the solvating agent. The solvating agent can be flammable because its mixture with the HFE is nonflammable. In bisolvent cleaning processes, the rinsing agent is separated from the solvating agent. This makes the solvating and <b>rinsing</b> <b>agents</b> more effective {{because they are not}} diluted.|$|E

The present study was undertaken to standardise a protocol {{for the analysis of}} oral exfoliated cells using Raman microspectroscopy. For this purpose, samples were obtained from two different sites, based on prevalence of disease (ventral side of the tongue and buccal mucosa). Different oral <b>rinsing</b> <b>agents</b> were employed and it was concluded that non-alcoholic mouthwash adequately removes food debris. Samples were collected using various collection tools and compared. It was observed that endo-cervical brushes yielded cells from deeper layers of the epithelium. Furthermore, monolayer formation of cells was carried out adopting cytospin and ThinPrep techniques and only the ThinPrep method provided flat and separated cells on the glass slide. Raman spectra were acquired from the nuclear and cytoplasmic regions of the cell using an XploRA confocal Raman instrument (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with a 532 nm laser as the source. Glass spectral contamination was removed using non negatively constrained least squares (NNLS) algorithms. Corrected spectra were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA) which was able to differentiate the nucleus and cytoplasm regions of the cell; based on nucleic acid and protein features, respectively. However, no classification of the two anatomically different sites was observed according to PCA or PCA–LDA (linear discriminant analysis) using either the nuclear or cytoplasmic spectra. Nevertheless, the study has developed a standardised protocol for sample collection, sample preparation, spectral acquisition and data processing for future studies of oral exfoliated cells based on Raman microspectroscopy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDiatoms are {{important}} contributors to many biogeochemical cycles in aquatic environments {{due to their}} relatively large size and rapid growth rates. Amongst the factors that can limit their growth and productivity, the availability of silicic acid ranks high; the lack of this nutrient in the environment can also {{be the cause of}} increased toxicity in the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia. For these reasons, it is desirable to track the uptake and utilization of silicic acid by diatoms. Although stable and radio-labeled isotopes of silica exist, they are not commonly used by marine researchers because of the isotope cost and the complexity involved with analysis. PDMPO [2 -(4 -pyridyl) - 5 {[4 -dimethylaminoethyl-aminocarbamoyl) -methoxy]phenyl}oaxzole] is a low-cost, commercially available fluorophore for monitoring new silica production by siliceous phytoplankton species. PDMPO has been used by a variety of authors to study natural diatom populations for identifying which parts of a cell or which proportion of the phytoplankton assemblage are actively polymerizing silica. These studies however do not acknowledge possible false positive results due to exteriorly bound PDMPO on dinoflagellates and other non-siliceous organisms. Here, we use time series data from the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf (Monterey Bay California) to show the reactivity of PDMPO with non-silicifying species in a natural, mixed phytoplankton community. Lab experiments using the ionophoric antibiotics monensin and nigericin, show that when used as <b>rinsing</b> <b>agents,</b> the extra cellular binding of PDMPO to various dinoflagellate species can be significantly reduced. We feel that this is an important development for the application of the PDMPO probe to natural community Si kinetics studies in order to reduce false positive data when samples have been digested for quantification via spectrofluorometric analysis...|$|E

Whereas, contrary to the general tendency observed at much lower concentration of 	BSA, the amount of maximum adsorption decreased as the ionic st. rength decreased.

40|$|Aim: In this {{in-vitro}} {{study the}} cleaning {{performance of a}} dishwasher for cleaning removable orthodontic appliances was evaluated. Materials and methods: 140 acrylic resin specimens (Orthocryl) were produced according to manufacturer’s instructions: 20 for the pre-tests, 10 stained and 10 unstained for each dishwashing detergent (K Classic Geschirr-Reiniger-Pulver and Sodasan Maschinenspülmittel with corresponding <b>rinse</b> <b>agent</b> and dishwasher salt, Somat 10 Spülmaschinentabs) and each cleaning programme (short programme, 40 °C; intensive programme, 75 °C). Subsequent to sanding and polishing the specimens to a thickness of 1 ± 0. 1 mm, they were stained in accordance to the method of Jagger et al. (2002) {{with a combination of}} black-tea solution, 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and saliva as a plaque-substitute. The optical density of each specimen was determined before and after staining and after cleaning in the dishwasher. All measurements were done, using a spectrophotometer at 380 nm, the absorption maximum of the stains. In addition, in each series 10 unstained specimens were used {{in order to determine the}} average opacity caused by the cleaning as such, which was subtracted from the values measured for the stained specimens. The cleaning performance was expressed as a percentage of removed tea-chlorhexidine-salvia-stains (absorption) in relation to the total stain (absorption). The results were analysed for significant differences, using the Kruskal-Wallis- and Mann-Whitney-test. Results: All specimens showed less tea-chlorhexidine-saliva-stains after the cleaning. The cleaning performance was always significantly higher using the intensive programme. Only the short programme yielded significant differences for the tested detergents with K Classic Geschirr-Reiniger-Pulver being the most effective (median: 97. 65 %). Sodasan Maschinenspülmittel was the by far least effective product (median: 33. 11 %). No clinically relevant dimensional changes were measured after the cleaning in any case. Conclusions: The study shows that the cleaning of acrylic resin specimens in a dishwasher yielded good results. The cleaning performance of this method is comparable to the results of chemical cleaning tablets mentioned in literature. The cleaning performance depends on the programme and the dishwashing detergent. Nevertheless, from a hygienic point of view this method may be questionable, in particular when using low temperatures...|$|R

Because of its limited aqueous solubility it is currently being marketed as a suspension in hair-cleansing and hair-grooming preparations. A method has been developed in which clear, aqueous (as well as nonaqueous) products can be prepared. The method {{is based upon the}} COMPLEXATION of zinc pyrithione with certain ORGANIC AMINES. It appears that zinc pyrithione is highly soluble in many primary aliphatic amines. In other more complex amines, such as the poly-alkylenimines, a definite stable molecular complex is formed. The ability of such amines to complex and produce a soluble form of zinc pyrithione is discussed with respect to the physical and d•emical properties of the ensuing solutions.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the addition of TiO 2 on the properties of magnesium oxide obtained from seawater by substoichiometrical precipitation with 80 % of the stoichiometrically required quantity of dolomite lime as the precipitation agent. Magnesium oxide obtained from seawater by substoichiometrical precipitation contains boron(III) oxide as an impurity. During the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide, the boron present in seawater (in the form of non-dissociated orthoboric acid H 3 BO 3, and partly as borate ion H 2 BO 3 –) adsorbs onto the magnesium hydroxide precipitate, and therefore has to be reduced as much as possible using the appropriate method of rinsing the magnesium hydroxide precipitate. B 2 O 3 is an undesirable admixture in seawater magnesium oxide. Specifically, the properties of special purpose magnesium oxide, i. e. high strength magnesium oxide, are affected significantly by the content of boron in the product. Good quality sintered magnesium oxide contains a very small amount ofB 2 O 3. The impurity should not exceed w(B 2 O 3) = 0. 005 % in refractory magnesium oxide. The combined method of rinsing the magnesium hydroxide precipitate (3 + 2) was used in sample preparation, i. e. rinsing by decanting was done three times with alkalized distilled water of pH = 12. 50 and twice with distilled water of pH = 6. 74. Multiple rinsing on filter paper (five times) was done using the same <b>rinsing</b> <b>agent</b> (fresh distilled water of pH = 6. 74). The MgO (80 % precipitation) samples were then subjected to isothermal and activated sintering without TiO 2 addition, {{as well as with the}} addition of TiO 2, w(TiO 2) = 5 and 8 %, at the temperature of 1700 oC for 1 hour, with the aim of determining the properties of these samples primarily with regard to the B 2 O 3 content in the samples after sintering. The results indicate that the addition of TiO 2 strongly affects the reduction of the B 2 O 3 content during activated sintering of seawater magnesium oxide, and that the samples can be characterized as refractory material with very low B 2 O 3 content. The addition of TiO 2, w(TiO 2) = 5 %, is sufficient to bind the present CaO and thereby lead to greater evaporation of B 2 O 3 in the process of activated sintering of seawater magnesium oxide. The samples thickened significantly during sintering, i. e. all the samples examined had a very smallamount of open pores...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Traditional resin luting agents {{generally}} have mechanical properties that {{are superior to}} the newer so-called “universal” self-etching/self-adhesive resin luting agents. However, recent reports indicate that some properties of these new luting agents have been improved, approaching those of the traditional etch and <b>rinse</b> resin luting <b>agents.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to test some mechanical properties of four of these self-etching/self-adhesive resin luting agents [Maxcem Elite (ME), Multilink Automix (MA), RelyX Unicem (RU), SmartCem 2 (SC) ] and compare them to a traditional etch and <b>rinse</b> resin luting <b>agent</b> [RelyX ARC (RA) ] and a resin-modified glass ionomer luting cement [Fuji Plus (FP) ], both of which have much longer histories of clinical success. By comparing the properties of the newer cements to the standards, it may be possible to determine how clinically successful the newer cements may be. The mechanical properties tested were flexural strength (FS) and shear bond strength (SBS). The FS test included making beams of each material, storing them in water for periods of time (24 hours and 90 days) and then performing a three-point bending test on a universal testing machine. The 90 day groups were thermocycled. The SBS test involved preparing human molar specimens, making flat dentin surfaces. Composite cylinders were fabricated, luted to the dentin surfaces with each of the materials tested, stored in water for periods of time (24 hours or 90 days), and then a knife edge shear test was performed on a universal testing machine. The 90 day groups were thermocycled. A Weibull-distribution survival analysis was performed. The results revealed significant differences in the FS of all materials tested at 24 hours. After 90 days and thermocycling, only SC and RA were not significantly different. At both time periods, FP had the lowest and MA the highest FS. The SBS results showed MA, RA, and RU to have the highest bond strengths; SC and ME the lowest at 24 hours. After 90 days and thermocycling, RA had significantly higher bond strength than all other groups; ME, FP and SC had the lowest. The self-etching/self-adhesive resin luting agents all performed at least as well as FP, with the exception of SC (SBS 24 hour). They did not all perform as well as RA, with the exception of SC (FS 90 day), MA (SBS 24 hour, FS 24 hour and 90 day), and RU (SBS 24 hour). The newer luting agents should expect to have clinical success, regarding flexural strength and shear bond strength, at least as good as resin-modified glass ionomer luting cements and approach the level of traditional etch and <b>rinse</b> resin luting <b>agents...</b>|$|R

This review addresses the definition, assessment methods, prevalence, duration, etiology, and management strategies of metallic taste in chemotherapy treated cancer patients. Methods: Literature search for metallic taste and chemotherapy was performed in PubMed up to September 2014, resulting in 184 articles of which 13 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria: English publications addressing metallic taste in cancer patients treated with FDA-approved chemotherapy. An additional search in Google Scholar, in related articles of both search engines, and subsequent in the reference lists, resulted in 13 additional articles included in this review. Cancer patient forums were visited to explore management strategies. Findings: Prevalence of metallic taste ranged from 9. 7 % to 78 % among patients with various cancers, chemotherapy treatments, and treatment phases. No studies have been performed to investigate the influence of metallic taste on dietary intake, body weight, and quality of life. Several management strategies can be recommended for cancer patients: using plastic utensils, eating cold or frozen foods, adding strong herbs, spices, sweetener or acid to foods, eating sweet and sour foods, using 'miracle fruit' supplements, and <b>rinsing</b> with chelating <b>agents.</b> Interpretation: Although metallic taste is a frequent side effect of chemotherapy and a much discussed topic on cancer patient forums, literature regarding metallic taste among chemotherapy treated cancer patients is scarce.

The figure shows that no emulsification occurs in the SIR system, whereas the liquid-liquid system shows turbidity implying emulsification.

Depending on the pore size of the used particles, capillary forces may also play a role in retaining the extractant.

30|$|Some of the {{erroneous}} {{assumptions and}} misconceptions {{of the respondents}} must be regarded as dangerous as they thwart a decent safety behavior. This {{is especially true for}} persons who assumed that products manufactured in the European Union, products without hazard pictograms, natural pharmaceuticals, natural personal care products, homeopathic products or products with an eco-label would be free of harmful substances. There seems to be a lack of awareness of chemical risks even in motivated informed consumers. This results in a subjective feeling of security, which is actually pseudo safety due to insufficient understanding. Given that three out of four respondents postulate that consumers take over the responsibility for minimizing harmful substances in consumer products, this result is rather alarming. It remains unclear how end-users should bear responsibility and reduce the risk posed by harmful substances {{as long as they do}} not have the knowledge to make sufficiently informed choices. Avoidance is the favored risk reduction strategy chosen by the majority of the study participants (see answers b and c in Fig.  3), which is a useful general strategy for consumers. Reading the description and instructions on the packaging (see Fig.  3 answers d and e) is only helpful if this leads to the recommended safety behavior. Reading alone does not reduce risk. Also small doses of very toxic substances can lead to severe deleterious effects.
