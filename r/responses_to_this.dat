25|$|The {{two most}} popular {{approaches}} are injection of DNA in saline, using a standard hypodermic needle and gene gun delivery. Injection in saline is normally conducted intramuscularly (IM) in skeletal muscle, or intradermally (ID), delivering DNA to extracellular spaces. This can be assisted by electroporation; by temporarily damaging muscle fibres with myotoxins such as bupivacaine; or by using hypertonic solutions of saline or sucrose. Immune <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> method can be affected by factors including needle type, needle alignment, speed of injection, volume of injection, muscle type, and age, sex and physiological condition of the recipient.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century Europe was swept {{by a group}} of intellectual, social and {{political}} movements, together known as The Enlightenment. These movements promoted scientific thinking, free thought, and allowed people to question previously unshaken religious dogmas. Like Christianity, Judaism developed several <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> unprecedented phenomenon. One response saw the enlightenment as positive, while another saw it as negative. The enlightenment meant equality and freedom for many Jews in many countries, so it was felt that it should be warmly welcomed. Scientific study of religious texts would allow people to study the history of Judaism. Some Jews felt that Judaism should accept modern secular thought and change in response to these ideas. Others, however, believed that the divine nature of Judaism precluded changing any fundamental beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Mario's primary {{attack is}} jumping {{on top of}} enemies, though many enemies have differing <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>this.</b> For example, a Goomba will flatten and be defeated, while a Koopa Troopa will {{temporarily}} retract into its shell, allowing Mario {{to use it as}} a projectile. These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him. Another attack, for enemies standing overhead, is to jump up and hit beneath the brick that the enemy is standing on. Another is the Fire Flower; when picked up, this item changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs, or only upgrades Mario to Super Mario if he has not already. A less common item is the Starman, which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily invincible to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact.|$|E
25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who {{are concerned}} with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and everything else {{is a part of the}} cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.|$|E

Second, conservation of energy is not violated since the energy of each branch has to be weighted by its probability, according to the standard formula {{for the conservation of}} energy in quantum theory. This results in the total energy of the multiverse being conserved.|$|E

2500|$|From a humanism-psychotherapeutic {{point of}} view, the {{question}} of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as [...] "What is the meaning of my life?" [...] This approach emphasizes that the question is personal—and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> question. [...] For example, Viktor Frankl argues for [...] "Dereflection", which translates largely as: cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself—what is the meaning of life?—evaporates when one is fully engaged in life. (The question then morphs into more specific worries such as [...] "What delusions am I under?"; [...] "What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?"; [...] "Why do I neglect loved-ones?".)

2500|$|Hoyle and Wickramasinghe {{have speculated}} that several {{outbreaks}} of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the 1918 flu pandemic, and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease. [...] For the 1918 flu pandemic they hypothesized that cometary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations—a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. Hoyle also speculated that HIV came from outer space. After Hoyle's death, The Lancet published {{a letter to the}} editor from Wickramasinghe and two of his colleagues, in which they hypothesized that the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) could be extraterrestrial in origin and not originated from chickens. The Lancet subsequently published three <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> letter, showing that the hypothesis was not evidence-based, and casting doubts on the quality of the experiments referenced by Wickramasinghe in his letter.

2500|$|A {{critical}} set {{of phenomena}} that ties together {{various aspects of}} health interventions, such as drug sensitivity screening, cancer or autoimmune susceptibility screening, infectious disease prevalence and application of pharmacologic or nutrition therapies, is the systems biology of the immune response. [...] For example, the influenza epidemic of 1918, {{as well as the}} recent cases of human fatality due to H5N1 (avian flu), both illustrate the potentially dangerous sequence of immune <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> virus. [...] Also well documented is the only case of spontaneous [...] "immunity" [...] to HIV in humans, shown to be due to a mutation in a surface protein on CD4 T cells, the primary targets of HIV. [...] The immune system is truly a sentinel system of the body, with the result that health and disease are carefully balanced by the modulated response of each of its various parts, which then also act in concert as a whole. [...] Especially in industrialized and rapidly developing economies, the high rate of allergic and reactive respiratory disease, autoimmune conditions and cancers are also in part linked to aberrant immune responses that are elicited as the communities' genomes encounter swiftly changing environments. The causes of perturbed immune responses run the gamut of genome-environment interactions due to diet, supplements, sun exposure, workplace exposures, etc. [...] Public health genomics as a whole will absolutely require a rigorous understanding of the changing face of immune responses.|$|E
