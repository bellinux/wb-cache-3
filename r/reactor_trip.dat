25|$|On March 18, 2017, an {{electrical}} fault {{occurred in a}} Unit 3 switchgear room, resulting {{in the loss of}} a safety related electrical bus and a <b>reactor</b> <b>trip.</b> Other safety systems functioned as required, ensuring adequate reactor cooling. There was no threat to local residents or the environment, and the alert, the second-lowest Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) emergency declaration, was terminated later that same day. The electrical fault caused an arc flash, resulting in a minor burn of a plant worker who was in the room and was treated at a local hospital. On March 22, 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that it had initiated a special inspection into the failure of the electrical bus that resulted in the plant declaring an alert.|$|E

50|$|In December 2013, the {{circulating}} pump {{of the second}} <b>reactor</b> <b>tripped</b> due to the low lube oil pressure which caused a built-in lube oil pump. The Atomic Energy Council was criticized due to their very slow respond in giving answers to the public only 10 hours after the trip.|$|R
50|$|Given {{that there}} exists the {{assumption}} that there is simply one option in the procedures and that within training procedures optional actions are disregarded, {{the likelihood that a}} <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> failure will be incorrectly diagnosed is minimal.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{assumed that}} the {{behaviour}} of the operating crew under consideration is skill-based; the <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> event which takes place {{is not part of}} a routine, however the temporary behaviour adopted by the crew when the event is taking place is nevertheless recognised. Moreover, there are well set procedures which determine how the event should be conducted and these are comprehended and practised to required standards in training sessions.|$|E
50|$|On , one {{control rod}} {{assembly}} {{was found to}} be not fully inserted following a <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> at Unit 1. Subsequent rod drop tests showed the rod assembly stuck at or above the same not-fully-inserted position, leading to removal and examination of the rod assembly. The examination showed several rods were cracked, which were later determined to result from volumetric growth of the hafnium neutron absorber and differential thermal expansion (hafnium compared to the stainless steel rod cladding). Taipower later replaced all hafnium-containing rods with a different alloy to resolve the issue.|$|E
40|$|Human {{performance}} {{particularly during}} recovery actions from event initiators {{are the major}} contributors to plant risk.

30|$|The actions {{available}} to a SIPS include [56]: load shedding, generation start up/rejection, switching of shunt <b>reactors,</b> line <b>tripping,</b> tap changes, adjusting controller set points, tap blocking, controlled islanding, HVDC control and switching of braking resistors.|$|R
5000|$|Unit 1 was {{operating}} {{at full power}} on [...] when the <b>reactor</b> <b>tripped</b> on low-low water level in steam generator C. Prior to the trip, the high water level alarm in steam generator C was triggered when the water level kept rising and the main feedwater control valve {{did not respond to}} manual intervention. When control of the valve was switched to a backup system, the valve closed immediately, leading to a low-low water level condition in the steam generator before the valve could be re-opened. It was later determined the primary valve positioner had a loose mechanical connection, resulting in erroneous feedback of valve position.|$|R
50|$|Safety Shutdown System 1 (SDS1):SDS1 is {{designed}} to rapidly and automatically terminate reactor operation. Neutron-absorbing rods (control rods that shut down the nuclear chain reaction) are stored inside isolated channels located directly above the reactor vessel (calandria) and are controlled via a triple-channel logic circuit. When any 2 of the 3 circuit paths are activated (due to sensing the need for emergency <b>reactor</b> <b>trip),</b> the direct current-controlled clutches that keep each control-rod in the storage position are de-energized. The result is that each control-rod is inserted into the calandria, and the reactor heat output is reduced by 90% within 2 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|On [...] a {{turbine blade}} failure at Maanshan Unit 1 {{led to a}} fire and <b>reactor</b> <b>trip.</b> When the blades failed, the {{resulting}} turbine imbalance allowed hydrogen and seal oil {{to escape from the}} generator. It took approximately 2 hours for the fire to be extinguished, but no systems critical to safe operation and shutdown were affected. The subsequent repairs were so extensive that Unit 1 did not come back on-line for 11 months. The natural frequency of torsional vibration was 120 Hz, approximately twice that of the electrical frequency, so the resulting resonant vibration led to blade failure.|$|E
50|$|Safety Shutdown System 2 (SDS2):SDS2 is also {{designed}} to rapidly and automatically terminate reactor operation. Gadolinium nitrate (GdNO3) solution, a neutron-absorbing liquid that shuts down the nuclear chain reaction, is stored inside channels that feed into horizontal nozzle assemblies. Each nozzle has an electronically controlled valve, {{all of which}} are controlled via a triple-channel logic circuit. When any 2 of the 3 circuit paths are activated (due to sensing the need for emergency <b>reactor</b> <b>trip),</b> each of these valves are opened and GdNO3 solution is injected through the nozzles to mix with the heavy-water moderator liquid in the reactor vessel (calandria). The result is that the reactor heat output is reduced by 90% within 2 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The <b>reactor</b> is <b>tripped</b> {{in cases}} of high or low water level in the steam {{separators}} (with two selectable low-level thresholds); high steam pressure; low feedwater flow; loss of two main coolant pumps on either side. These trips can be manually disabled.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} main steam {{isolation}} valve (MSIV operating problems {{have resulted in}} significant operational transients (e. g., spurious <b>reactor</b> <b>trips,</b> steam generator dry out, excessive valve seat leakage), increased cost, and decreased plant availability. A key ingredient to an engineering-oriented reliability improvement effort is {{a thorough understanding of}} relevant historical experience. A detailed review of historical failure data available through the Institute of Nuclear Power Operation`s Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System has been conducted for several types of MSIVs and valve operators for both boiling-water reactors and pressurized-water reactors. The focus of this review is on MSIV failures modes, actuator failure modes, consequences of failure on plant operations, method of failure detection, and major stressors affecting both valves and valve operators...|$|R

Instances documented vary from minor instrument fluctuations to major plant transients including <b>reactor</b> <b>trips.</b> With the nuclear power industry moving toward digital technologies for control and reactor protection systems, concern exists regarding their potential susceptibility to contemporary wireless telecommunications technologies. This study evaluates the susceptibility of Comanche Peak's planned turbine controls upgrade to IEEE 802. 11 compliant wireless radio emissions. The study includes a review of previous research, industry emissions standards, and technical overview of the various IEEE 802. 11 protocols and details the testing methodology utilized to evaluate the digital control system. The results of this study concluded that the subject digital control system was unaffected by IEEE 802. 11 compliant emissions even when the transmitter was in direct contact with sensitive components...|$|R

50|$|While {{operating}} at reduced power {{in anticipation of}} typhoon Talim, on , the Unit 2 main transformer differential protective relay tripped because a damaged support insulator caused one phase to flash to ground. The main transformer trip was followed by main turbine trip and then reactor scram. Following the subsequent repair work, on , as the unit was in a hot standby condition, a water hammer occurred {{in one of the}} main steam lines. It was determined that condensed water accumulated while the unit was in warm standby with the drain valve closed. When that steam line started to supply steam to the turbine, the slug of water was pushed downstream, causing a water hammer and subsequent low steam pressure, resulting in another <b>reactor</b> <b>trip.</b>|$|E
30|$|When the <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> {{condition}} or ESF condition occurs, device status signal will be feedback via the uplink route A 1. Then SCID releases control commands through downlink route B 2, which {{would result in}} the <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> response and ESF response. It controls the related device to generate <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> and ESF action.|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} endured {{significant}} criticism concerning the slow return to operation {{of some of}} its nuclear generating stations which had been shut down by the 2003 North America blackout. The problem was that {{all but one of the}} <b>reactors</b> were <b>tripped</b> and allowed to poison out, preventing an early reconnection to the electricity grid. Once shut down, all nuclear reactors take several days to return to service.|$|R
40|$|Maintenance {{and testing}} of reactor {{protection}} systems is an important cause of unplanned <b>reactor</b> <b>trips</b> due to be commonly carried out in manual mode. The execution of surveillance procedures in this mode entails {{a great number of}} manual operations. Automated testing is the answer because it minimises test times and reduces the risk of human errors. GAMA-I is an automatic system for testing the reactor protection instrumentation which is based on VXI instrumentation cards. This system has important advantages over previous ones in terms of easiness to carry out software modifications related to configuration changes in the protection system. The system uses visual programming and the modifications can be implemented by ordinary instrumentation specialists without programming experience. The system has been developed at the Vandellos II Nuclear Power Plant by the I&C groups of Vandellos II, Tecnatom S. A. and ENWESA Servicios S. A. The representation for this project is held by the Spanish Association for the Nuclear Technologic Development (DTN).

40|$|Examinationof the Licensee Event Report (LER) database, by the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, {{provides}} {{a snapshot of}} instrumentation and control (I&C) impact on plant safety. The LER database consists of all reportable events that could affect the safety of Nuclear Power Plants. The LER database study uncovered digital I&C vulnerabilities in nuclear power plants from operational experience. This study considered digital-related LERs for a five-year period, starting in 1994. The LER study places LERs in three categories: hardware, software, and human/system interface (HSI). Analysis showed an nearly equal distribution of events {{in each of the}} three categories. The analysis also showed that approximately 8 % of all LERs, from 1994 to 1999, contain digital I&C failures, and 9 % of <b>reactor</b> <b>trips</b> for those years are attributed to digital I&C failures. Detailed examination of the digital I&C failures emphasizes that a significant percentage of the failures occurs as a result of failures in the requirements and Verification and Validation life-cycle stages. This database study shows I&C systems, including digital I&C systems, have a noticeable impact on nuclear power plant safety...|$|R

In order to facilitate the calculation, three conditions are selected for research, with the assumptions of 90  ms for the best {{response time}} and 110  ms for the worst one.

40|$|Revision I is {{the initial}} {{issue of the}} {{non-proprietary}} version of this WCAP. In {{order to reduce the}} potential for spurious actuation, thereby increasing plant availability, a method has been developed to enable testing of <b>Reactor</b> <b>Trip</b> System (RTS) and Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) channels in the bypass condition as opposed to the "tripped " condition. With a channel in the tripped condition, a second comparator trip in a redundant channel caused by human error, spurious transient, or channel failure will initiate a <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> or safeguards actuation. With the Bypass Test Instrumentation (BTI), this spurious <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> or safeguards actuation will be avoided, and plant availability will increase. A {{decrease in the number of}} reactor trips and safeguards actuation will also reduce the challenges to the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and avoid the transients associated with reactor trips and safeguards actuation. Test in bypass capability is being provided for NIS <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> functions and 7300 Process Protection System (PPS) <b>reactor</b> <b>trip</b> and ESF functions. Various aspects of the BTI installation are addressed in this report. These aspects include a demonstration of the functionality of the BTI hardware, the design features which enable the BTI to conform to U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidance governing testing in bypass, and the design features of the BTI that enable it to be in accordance with licensing requirements.

40|$|The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research at the NRC {{looked at}} two plant event {{databases}} {{to arrive at}} a snapshot of I&C impact on plant safety. These databases were the Accident Sequence Precursor(ASP) database and the Licensee Event Report(LER) database. The ASP database study considers events with a high conditional core damage probability. This study showed that (1) more than half of these events are affected by I&C failures, (2) many of the failed I&C components are found in pumps, valves, diesel generators, and power supply equipment, and (3) design/maintenance errors are as much of a cause of I&C failures as component failures. The LER database study was undertaken to determine if there is sufficient operational experience to uncover vulnerabilities of digital systems in nuclear power plants. This study considered those LERs involving digital-related failures over a five year period, beginning in 1994. The initial analysis placed the selected LERs in three categories, hardware, software, and human/system interface (HSI), and shows that the events are evenly disbursed in each of the categories. The analysis also shows that, during the time period, approximately 9 % of all LERs contained digital-related failures, and approximately 9 % of <b>reactor</b> <b>trips</b> are attributed to digital-related failures.

40|$|The cores and reflectors in modem High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactors (HTRs) are {{constructed}} from graphite components. There {{are two main}} designs; the Pebble Bed design and the Prism design, see Table 1. In both of these designs the graphite not only acts as a moderator, but is also a major structural component that may provide channels for the fuel and coolant gas, channels for control and safety shut off devices and provide thermal and neutron shielding. In addition, graphite components may act as a heat sink or conduction path during <b>reactor</b> <b>trips</b> and transients. During reactor operation, many of the graphite component physical properties are significantly changed by irradiation. These changes lead to the generation of significant internal shrinkage stresses and thermal shut down stresses {{that could lead to}} component failure. In addition, if the graphite is irradiated to a very high irradiation dose, irradiation swelling can lead to a rapid reduction in modulus and strength, making the component friable. The irradiation behaviour of graphite is strongly dependent on its virgin microstructure, which is determined by the manufacturing route. Nevertheless, there are available, irradiation data on many obsolete graphites of known microstructures. There is also a well-developed physical understandin...|$|R
