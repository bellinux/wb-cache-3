40|$|The <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> of ultracold Fermi atoms are {{calculated}} by including final-state interactions affecting the excited {{level of the}} transition and compared with the experimental data. A competition is revealed between pairing-gap effects which tend to push the oscillator strength toward high frequencies away from threshold and final-state effects which tend instead to pull the oscillator strength toward threshold.

40|$|Integrated master-oscillator power {{amplifiers}} driven under steady-state injection conditions {{are known to}} show a complex dynamics resulting {{in a variety of}} emission regimes. We present experimental results on the emission characteristics of a 1. 5 µm distributed feedback tapered master-oscillator power-amplifier {{in a wide range of}} steady-state injection conditions, showing different dynamic behaviors. The study combines the optical and <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> recorded under different levels of injected current into the master oscillator and the power amplifier sections. Under low injection current of the master oscillator the correlation between the optical and radio-frequency spectral maps allows to identify operation regimes in which the device emission arises from either the master oscillator mode or from the compound cavity modes allowed by the residual reflectance of the amplifier front facet. The quasi-periodic occurrence of these emission regimes as a function of the amplifier current is interpreted in terms of a thermally tuned competition between the modes of the master oscillator and the compound cavity modes. Under high injection current of the masteroscillator, two different regimes alternate quasi-periodically as a function of the injected current in the power amplifier: a stable regime with a single mode emission at the master oscillator frequency, and an unstable and complex self-pulsating regime showing strong peaks in the <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> as well as multiple frequencies in the optical spectra...|$|R

Different frequencies and modulation amplitudes are applied to the VCSEL. Regular periodic dynamics - with periods equal to the modulation period or twice the modulation period - and irregular pulsating dynamics are obtained. Different dynamical behaviors are illustrated by using power time traces, <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>spectra</b> and bifurcation diagrams. Our results show that irregular pulsating dynamics in multimode VCSELs subject to large-signal current modulatton can be obtained due to the competition between different transverse modes...|$|R

The regular operation mode with predominance of the master oscillator alternates with lasing of the compound cavity modes allowed by the residual reflectance of the amplifier front facet. The quasi-periodic occurrence of these two regimes as a function of the amplifier current has been consistently interpreted in terms of a thermally tuned competition between the modes of the master oscillator and the compound cavity modes...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{experimental}} protocol to study p-wave superfluidity in a spin-polarized cold Fermi gas tuned by an s-wave Feshbach resonance. A crucial ingredient {{is to add}} a quasi- 1 D optical lattice and tune the fillings of two spins to the s and p band, respectively. The pairing order parameter is confirmed to inherit p-wave symmetry in its center-of-mass motion.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we propose}} and {{experimentally}} demon-strate an enhanced <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>spectrum</b> analysis technique to simultaneously monitor optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) and polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) for re-turn-to-zero ON–OFF keying (RZ-OOK) systems. In this method, by cascading a large differential group delay element at the mon-itoring module, the PMD and OSNR parameters {{can be derived}} from the analysis of the position shift and the minimum power of the RF spectral dip, respectively. Experimental results show that this scheme can monitor PMD from 0 to 90 ps with less than 2 -ps error and OSNR from 16 to 35 dB with less than 1 -dB error in a 10 -Gb/s RZ-OOK transmission system with a pulsewidth of 2. 5 ps. The scheme possesses the advantages of simple implementation, large monitoring range, and high PMD monitoring sensitivity by using the RF spectrum analysis only at low-frequency range.

To make the system quasi-two dimensional, I adjust the Fermi energy in the weakly confined direction to be comparable to the harmonic oscillator energy level spacing in the tightly confined direction. For a perfectly two dimensional system, at low enough temperature, spin-up and spin-down atoms should form dimers in the ground state of the tightly confined direction.
