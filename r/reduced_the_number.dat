5|$|A {{significant}} crossbreeding influence used {{to revitalize}} the Appaloosa was the Arabian horse, as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: the Arabian horse, the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of trucks under the train, but it also dispensed {{with the need for}} couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
