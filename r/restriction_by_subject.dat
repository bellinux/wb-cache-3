40|$|Deletion {{analysis}} indicated that the phage lambda restriction alleviation gene(s) ral resides between the cIII and N genes. The Ral+ phenotype was expressed only when lambda ral+ carried a modification such that it was resistant to <b>restriction</b> <b>by</b> the host specificity system. Under these conditions, Ral function protected superinfecting unmodified phages from <b>restriction</b> <b>by</b> EcoK or EcoB but not from <b>restriction</b> <b>by</b> EcoP 1. Ral-protected phage DNA was not concomitantly K and B modified, but rather received only the modification specified by {{the system of the}} restricting host. Possible mechanisms for Ral action are discussed. Of the other lambdoid phages tested, the hybrid phage lambda rev had Ral activity, whereas phi 80 vir and one lambda-P 22 hybrid did not. The restriction alleviation activity of lambda rev called Lar, may be the same as the activity expressed in sbcA- strains of Escherichia coli, but it was functionally separable from exonuclease VIII activity (the product of the recE gene), which is also expressed in sbcA- strains...|$|R
