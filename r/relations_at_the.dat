5|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone. Recorded during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race <b>relations</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918 and the proclamation of the First Austrian Republic, diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were established on 25 February 1924. The first Soviet Plenipotentiary in Vienna was Yan Antonovich Berzin. Diplomatic relations were broken in March 1938 after the German invasion of Austria and its incorporation into Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, the USSR and Austria re-established diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> level of political representation, which in 1953 was converted into embassies. The preamble of the Austrian State Treaty, signed on 15 May 1955 by the USSR, United States, United Kingdom, France and Austria, established that the treaty formed the basis of Soviet relations with Austria. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations continued between the Russian Federation and the Austrian state.|$|E
5|$|GCC reorganized {{independently}} in 1992, {{with the}} first {{chairman of the board}} of directors being the director of government relations for the Phillips Petroleum Company. Exxon was a founding member, and a founding member of the GCC's board of directors. Exxon, and later ExxonMobil, had a leadership role in coalition. The American Petroleum Institute (API) was a leading member of the coalition. API's executive vice president was a chairman of the coalition's board of directors. Other GCC founding members included the National Coal Association, United States Chamber of Commerce, American Forest & Paper Association, and Edison Electric Institute.

40|$|A tube graph is a {{mathematical}} entity {{that can be}} used for modelling architectural designs of software systems. It consists of a tree (representing containment) with a set of edges called tubes (representing dependencies) between the tree's vertices (representing components). Tubes, for example, can model <b>the</b> import <b>relation</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> module level and <b>the</b> use dependency <b>relation</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> subsystem level. Well-formedness constraints are imposed on tube edges to define restricted tube graphs that model particular styles of architectural designs. In this paper, the well-formedness constraints define tube graphs that model SIL language architectural designs. Different mathematical formulations of these well-formed tube graphs are given and proven to be equivalent. Algorithms for manipulating tube graphs, for possible use in a software development environment, are also given and their complexities are shown to be modest in most cases. 1 Introduction An architectural design specifies a software [...] ...|$|R
5|$|In Egypt Darius built many {{temples and}} {{restored}} {{those that had}} previously been destroyed. Even though Darius was a Zoroastrian, he built temples dedicated to the Gods of the Ancient Egyptian religion. Several temples found were dedicated to Ptah and Nekhbet. Darius also created several roads and routes in Egypt. The monuments that Darius built were often inscribed in the official languages of the Persian Empire, Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian and Egyptian hieroglyphs. To construct these monuments Darius employed a large number of workers and artisans of diverse nationalities. Several of these workers were deportees who had been employed specifically for these projects. These deportees enhanced the empire's economy and improved inter-cultural <b>relations.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time of Darius's death construction projects were still under way. Xerxes completed these works and in some cases expanded his father's projects by erecting new buildings of his own.|$|E
5|$|In February 1799, Adams {{surprised}} many {{by sending}} diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. Napoleon, {{realizing that the}} conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly <b>relations.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and {{to allow for the}} peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States was then free of foreign entanglements, as Washington had advised in his farewell address. Adams brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army. Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{retired from}} St Bartholomew's in 1976. In 1975–1976, he was Montague Visiting Professor of International <b>Relations</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Edinburgh. He {{believed}} that scientists have an individual moral responsibility and, {{just as the}} Hippocratic Oath provides a code of conduct for physicians, he thought that scientists should have their own code of moral conduct, a Hippocratic Oath for scientists. During his tenure {{as president of the}} Pugwash conferences, Rotblat nominated Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu for the Nobel Peace Prize every year from 1988 to 2004. Vanunu had disclosed the extent of Israel's nuclear weapons programme and consequently spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in solitary confinement.|$|E

5|$|The lodge {{had a large}} Roman-style pool; when it {{was built}} in 1912, it was the largest outdoor pool in the world and was used for the 1924 Olympic trials. The Briarcliff Lodge was noted for its cuisine (including Briarcliff dairy and table water), a golf course, fifteen tennis courts, a music room, theater, indoor {{swimming}} pool (measuring 30 by 70 feet, with a depth of 4 to 10 feet), casino, library, stable, repair shops and a fleet of Fiat automobiles. The water tower at the property was constructed by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company. The grounds were decorated with Japanese lanterns that Law had obtained from missionaries. The lodge had elevator service and electric lighting.

5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, but it soon became apparent that the cost would be prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training launches from Vandenberg. This was known as Integrated Weapons System Training (IWST). The first of these launches was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile had exploded on the launch pad just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the Director of Public <b>Relations</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British Joint Staff Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST launches, the last of which, codenamed Red Caboose, was on 21 January 1960.|$|E

40|$|Concrete beams or slabs can be {{effectively}} retrofitted through the bonding of composite plates. Failure of the retrofitted member often occurs through delamination of the composite. Experimental investigations show that unstable delamination growth at ultimate failure is preceded by material damage along {{a significant part}} of the beam/composite interface. It is hence appropriate to analyze the problem with a non-linear fracture mechanics approach, where the delamination is treated as a fictitious interfacial crack, and interfacial damage is modelled using a softening shear stress vs slip (tau (s) - s) <b>relation</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crack wake. In this paper, a combined experimental/numerical approach is developed to obtain the (tau (s) - s) <b>relation</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> interface. Representative experimental results are presented to illustrate the novel approach. From our results, the softening behaviour exhibits a sharp drop followed by more progressive weakening, indicating sudden loss of cohesion/bond, followed by gradual decrease in interfacial friction with continued sliding and damage...|$|R
