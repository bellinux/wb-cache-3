50|$|Red {{is one of}} the {{additive}} {{primary colors}} of visible light, along with green and blue, which in <b>Red</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Blue</b> (<b>RGB)</b> color systems are combined to create all the colors on a computer monitor or television screen. Red {{is one of the}} subtractive secondary colors, resulting from the combination of yellow and magenta. (See CMYK color model.) Traditionally, it was viewed as a primary subtractive colour, along with yellow and blue, in the RYB color space and traditional color wheel formerly used by painters and artists. Reds can vary in shade from very light pink to very dark maroon or burgundy; and in hue from the bright orange-red scarlet or vermilion to the bluish-red crimson. Red is the complementary color of cyan.|$|E
5000|$|The Robert Bosch GmbH, Fernseh Div., {{which later}} became BTS inc. - Philips Digital Video Systems, Thomson's Grass Valley {{and now is}} DFT Digital Film Technology {{introduced}} the world's first CCD telecine in 1979, the FDL-60. The FDL-60 was designed and made in Darmstadt West Germany, {{this was the first}} all solid state Telecine. [...] FDL is short for Film Digital Line. The FDL-60 uses a three CCD single-line array system, whereby three lines, <b>Red</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Blue</b> (<b>RGB)</b> each with 1,024 pixels per line to record a single line of the film image. FDL60A uses three Fairchild Semiconductor CCD 133 CCDs for the image pickup. FDL60A released in 1979 used a 115 Volt lamp to light the film. The FDL60B released in 1982 added improve video quality features to the FDL60. The FDL60C released in 1987 used a Fairchild CCD 134 and a 24 volt light source. In 1983 an optional Grain Reduce was introduced by Bosch for the FDL-60, model FDGR 60. This was the first all digital noise reducer. The FDL 60 could operate stand alone or with a color grade system. Bosch made a scene by scene color corrector, model FRP 60, as an option for the FDL-60. About 568 FDL-60 telecines were manufacture from 1979 to 1989. FDL 60 were ordered in PAL or NTSC or Secam, a few were multi standard by changing a few electronic circuit cards.|$|E
30|$|In practise, however, {{it is not}} {{feasible}} to store, transmit or capture the 7 D function. A number of simplifications are therefore applied to reduce its dimensionality.

Secondly, the light rays can be recorded at a specific moment in time, thus dropping the t parameter. This simplification can for example be applied when viewing a stationary scene.

40|$|A new {{two-level}} real-time vehicle {{detection method}} is proposed {{in order to}} meet the robustness and efficiency requirements of real world applications. At the high level, pixels of the background image are classified into three categories according to the characteristics of <b>Red,</b> <b>Green,</b> <b>Blue</b> (<b>RGB)</b> curves. The robustness of the classification is further enhanced by using line detection and pattern connectivity. At the lower level, an exponential forgetting algorithm with adaptive parameters for different categories is utilised to calculate the background and reduce the distortion by the small motion of video cameras.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{possible}} correlation between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution and facial features in color images {{and to improve}} the accuracy of automated constitution classification. Methods: Color images were taken of 5150 individuals of different professions. Automated face detection and key point positioning were performed on the collected images, which were then transformed into a standard size. The relationship between facial features and TCM constitution based on the <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue</b> (<b>RGB)</b> pixel and the local binary pattern (LBP) texture features was explored. Results: The overall accuracy rate and robustness of TCM constitution classification based on RGB features were low. Classification results of the phlegm-dampness, damp-heat, blood stasis, and balance constitutions achieved high accuracy rates. Classification accuracy rate using the LBP texture feature was {{higher than that of}} the RGB feature, with the best accuracy observed for the balance constitution.

For land-use classification band 4, 5, 3 (Landsat TM) was assigned to <b>Red</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Blue</b> (<b>RGB).</b> A commercial software package (ERDAS Imagine v. 8. 5) was available for the processing of the Landsat data. With a supervised classification were used field data to train the classifier. A field survey is made on all classes present in the field. The grapes can be recognized by the bright orange colour (RGB: 4, 5, 3) and their rectangular shapes. Fully developed banana plantations are easily recognized by the very bright red colour (RGB: 4, 5, 3). Fruit trees are difficult to classify with satellite images in general due to the variable ground cover and growing stage. Some vegetables can be identified and thus classified on the image but mainly because large vegetable fields are irrigated by a pivot system. Pages: 205 - 21...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present an {{overview}} of sparse approximations of grey level images. The sparse representations are realized by classic, Matching Pursuit (MP) based, greedy selection strategies. One such technique, termed Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), is shown to be suitable for producing sparse approximations of images, if they are processed in small blocks. When the blocks are enlarged, the proposed Self Projected Matching Pursuit (SPMP) algorithm, successfully renders equivalent results to OMP. A simple coding algorithm is then proposed to store these sparse approximations. This is shown, under certain conditions, to be competitive with JPEG 2000 image compression standard. An application termed image folding, which partially secures the approximated images is then proposed. This is extended to produce a self contained folded image, containing all the information required to perform image recovery. Finally a modified OMP selection technique is applied to produce sparse approximations of <b>Red</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Blue</b> (<b>RGB)</b> images. These RGB approximations are then folded with the self contained approach...|$|E

These cameras required complex optics to keep the tubes aligned. Since temperature variations and vibration would easily put a three-tube system out of alignment, a more robust system was needed for lunar surface operations.|$|R

These QDs are typically composed of relatively expensive {{elements in the}} form of indium, cadmium, and gallium since alternative candidate materials exhibiting similar properties are yet to be realized. Herein, for the first time, we report <b>red</b> <b>green</b> <b>blue</b> (<b>RGB)</b> photoluminescences with quantum yields of 18 % from earth-abundant lead sulfide (PbS) QDs. The visible emissive property is mainly attributed to a high degree of crystallinity even for the extremely small QD sizes (1 – 3 nm), which is realized by employing a heterogeneous reaction methodology at high growth temperatures (> 170 °C). We demonstrate that the proposed heterogeneous synthetic method can be extended to the synthesis of other metal chalcogenide QDs, such as zinc sulfide and zinc selenide, which are promising for future industrial applications.

FMMs are used in the <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue</b> (<b>RGB)</b> evaporation process in Active Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode (AMOLED) manufacturing. The taper angle of the hole is adjusted by attaching the objective lens to a micro-vibrator and continuously changing the focal plane position. Eight laser pulses were used to examine how the hole characteristics vary with the first focal plane’s position, where the first pulse is focused at an initial position and the focal planes of subsequent pulses move downward. The results showed that the hole taper angle can be controlled by varying the amplitude of the continuously operating vibrator during femtosecond laser hole machining. The taper angles were changed between 31. 8 ° and 43. 9 ° by adjusting the vibrator amplitude at a frequency of 100 Hz.
