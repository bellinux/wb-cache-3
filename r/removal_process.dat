5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six {{disaster}} recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the Houston Police Academy. The team of 87medical personnel served over 1,000patients within two weeks of Allison's passage. Similarly, the National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. Debris removal, which was initially slow, was aided by FEMA to expedite the <b>removal</b> <b>process.</b> FEMA provided 75% of the federal cost of the removal. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses.|$|E

40|$|Conventional paint <b>removal</b> <b>processes,</b> {{based on}} {{application}} of chemicals and abrasion, are becoming inadequate for modern aircraft structures. In addition they {{are associated with}} severe environmental problems, mainly due {{to the production of}} hazardous waste. Several alternative novel techniques are being developed. However, the aspect of material property degradation due to the application of these new paint removal techniques has not been addressed adequately. The application of laser radiation (carbon dioxide and excimer), as well as plasma etching, has recently been associated with significant ductility deterioration and fatigue life extension. Residual stress measurements, roughness measurements and fractographic analysis were employed in order to rationalize the effect of these novel paint <b>removal</b> <b>processes</b> on the fatigue behavior of aluminum alloy 2024. The observed enhancement of fatigue life is attributed to the development of compressive residual stresses during paint removal processing At low fatigue stresses, the magnitude of the residual stress correlates with the relative enhancement in fatigue life for the three processes investigated. The effect of surface roughening towards decreasing fatigue life is surpassed by the effect of residual stresses in extending fatigue life. Finally, the decrease of toughness and associated damage tolerance ability which follows the application of paint <b>removal</b> <b>processes</b> has been confirmed by fractographic measurements.

25|$|Multiple {{explanations}} {{have been}} proposed for the relatively slow response of the snow cleanup in the New York City metropolitan area. For example, the local media did not fully alert the general public until Christmas Day about the impending storm due to the complexity and lateness of the forecast models predicting the storm; thus, public awareness was delayed. Another possible cause was that Mayor Bloomberg had previously laid off 400 New York City Sanitation workers due to budget cuts; therefore, fewer plows were at work. In addition, some city workers {{who are responsible for}} managing the snow <b>removal</b> <b>process</b> had taken the day off from work during the storm due to the Christmas holiday. Also, a snow emergency was not declared, contributing to the number of abandoned cars on the streets.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{numbers of}} organic micropollutants are emitted into rivers via {{municipal}} wastewaters. Due to their persistence many pollutants pass {{wastewater treatment plants}} without substantial removal. Transport and fate of pollutants in receiving waters and export to downstream ecosystems is not well understood. In particular, a better knowledge of processes governing their environmental behavior is needed. Although a lot of data are available concerning the ubiquitous presence of micropollutants in rivers, accurate data on transport and removal rates are lacking. In this paper, a mass balance approach is presented, {{which is based on}} the Lagrangian sampling scheme, but extended to account for precise transport velocities and mixing along river stretches. The calculated mass balances allow accurate quantification of pollutants' reactivity along river segments. This is demonstrated for representative members of important groups of micropollutants, e. g. pharmaceuticals, musk fragrances, flame retardants, and pesticides. A model-aided analysis of the measured data series gives insight into the temporal dynamics of <b>removal</b> <b>processes.</b> The occurrence of different removal mechanisms such as photooxidation, microbial degradation, and volatilization is discussed. The results demonstrate, that <b>removal</b> <b>processes</b> are highly variable in time and space and this has to be considered for future studies. The high precision sampling scheme presented could be a powerful tool for quantifying <b>removal</b> <b>processes</b> under different boundary conditions and in river segments with contrasting properties...|$|R
