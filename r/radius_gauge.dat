40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} extend the {{spectral}} action principle to non-compact spaces, we propose a framework for spectral triples where the algebra may be non-unital but the resolvent of the Dirac operator remains compact. We show that an example is given by the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator which, interestingly, provides two different Dirac operators. This leads to two different representations of the volume form in the Hilbert space, and only their product is the grading operator. The index of the even-to-odd part {{of each of these}} Dirac operators is 1. We also compute the spectral action for the corresponding Connes-Lott two-point model. There is an additional harmonic oscillator potential for the Higgs field, whereas the Yang-Mills part is unchanged. The total Higgs potential shows a two-phase structure with smooth transition between them: In the spontaneously broken phase below a critical radius, all fields are massive, with the Higgs field mass slightly smaller than the NCG prediction. In the unbroken phase above the critical <b>radius,</b> <b>gauge</b> fields and fermions are massless, whereas the Higgs field remains massive. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} charged black branes in type IIA flux compactifications {{that are}} dual to (2 + 1) –dimensional field theories at finite density. The internal space {{is a general}} Calabi-Yau manifold with fluxes, with internal dimensions {{much smaller than the}} AdS <b>radius.</b> <b>Gauge</b> fields descend from the 3 -form RR potential evaluated on harmonic forms of the Calabi-Yau, and Kaluza-Klein modes decouple. Black branes are described by a four-dimensional effective field theory that includes only a few light fields and is valid over a parametrically large range of scales. This effective theory determines the low energy dynamics, stability and thermodynamic properties. Tools from flux compactifications are also used to construct holographic CFTs with no relevant scalar operators, that can lead to symmetric phases of condensed matter systems stable to very low temperatures. The general formalism is illustrated with simple examples such as toroidal compactifications and manifolds with a single size modulus.

In the present paper, the effect of environmental variations on corrugation growth are investigated using field measurements and mechanics-based modelling. Statistically significant relationships between average daily rainfall, humidity {{and the growth of}} rail corrugation were investigated using meterological and railway site field monitoring of a metropolitan network test site with a recurring rail corrugation of about 95 mm wavelength. Corrugation growth rate (Gr) was determined by systematically measuring the longitudinal rail profile with a Corrugation Analysis Trolley (CAT) on the 240 m <b>radius,</b> narrow <b>gauge,</b> concrete-sleepered curve. Both roughness generated and weld initiated profile growths were investigated. The weather data was obtained from records held by the Bureau of Meteorology. The modelling is developed to provide insight and mechanics based analysis of the field corrugation growth under changes in environmental conditions and vehicle speed variability. Results show a strong correlation between variations in rainfall and corrugation growth that is consistent with changes in steady state wear. Changes in contact patch geometry and the damage mechanism as the corrugation amplitude grows are shown to have substantial but slower effects on growth.

Using a “bright ” sample selected {{in the same way}} as Ferraro et al. (1997 b), we found a bimodal radial distribution similar to those found in three other luminous clusters. When the radial distributions for different clusters are scaled using the core radius, there is good cluster-to-cluster agreement in the size of the core straggler sample and the center of the “zone of avoidance”. However, M 5 has the smallest fraction of stragglers in the zone of avoidance of any of the clusters measured to date, and its zone of avoidance appears to be wider (in r/rc) than that of M 3, which has a very similar surface brightness profile. Both of these facts indicate that M 5 ’s straggler population has dynamically evolved to a larger extent than M 3. Using an ultraviolet sample from Hubble Space Telescope selected {{in the same way as}} Ferraro et al. (2003) and Ferraro et al.

We investigate the cases of a massless scalar field {{as well as that}} of a tachyonic scalar field. The solitons with scalar hair exist for a particular range of the charge and the gauge coupling. This range is such that for intermediate values of the gauge coupling a "forbidden band" of charges for the hairy solitons exists. We also discuss the behaviour of the black holes with scalar hair when changing the horizon <b>radius</b> and/or the <b>gauge</b> coupling and find that various scenarios at the approach of a limiting solution appear. One observation is that hairy Gauss-Bonnet black holes never tend to a regular soliton solution in the limit of vanishing horizon radius.

The challenges to measure SRX and verify a proposed kinetic model of SRX are discussed and a least square technique is utilized to quantify the error in a proposed SRX kinetic model. This technique relies on an existing computational-experimental multi-layer formulation to account for the heterogeneity during the post interruption hot torsion deformation. The kinetics of static recrystallization for a type 304 austenitic stainless steel deformed at 900 °C and strain rate of 0. 01 s - 1 is characterized implementing the formulation. Minimizing the error between the measured and calculated torque-twist data, the parameters of the kinetic model and the flow behavior during the second hit are evaluated and compared with those obtained based on a conventional technique. Typical static recrystallization distributions in the test sample will be presented. It has been found that the major differences between the conventional and the presented technique results are due to the heterogeneous recrystallization in the cylindrical core of the specimen where the material is still partially recrystallized {{at the onset of the}} second hit deformation.

40|$|Recently, Volvo Construction Equipment AB has {{developed}} a weld class system forimperfections in welded joints, which contains demands for the toe radii, cold laps, undercutsetc. and where root defects are treated as requirements on the drawing. In this master thesis, thetoe radius has been studied more carefully along with the selection of reliable measurementsystems which are able to measure the toe radius along the weld. A computerized vision systemhas been evaluated by performing a measurement system analysis. FE-simulations anddestructive fatigue testing has also been carried out to determine which radial geometry beingcritical to the fatigue life. The {{results show that the}} currently used methods and gauges do not provide the requiredaccuracy when measuring the toe <b>radius.</b> The <b>gauges</b> are handled differently by differentoperators – even when using the vision system – which makes the methods subjective andtherefore unreliable. There are measuring systems that can gather surface data along the weldwith high accuracy, but there is no reliable method to assess the data. Therefore, the authors havedeveloped an algorithm – named STELIN – that assess the gathered surface data andautomatically identifies and calculates the toe radius and the toe angle along the weld. Using thatinformation an opportunity to improve the process control when welding is possible. The performed FE-calculations show that the surface roughness in the weld toe probably has aninfluence at the fatigue life of the joint. A more precise separate study should be made todetermine the impact of the surface roughness on the fatigue life. Those results should serve as abase when reviewing the theory used when predicting the fatigue life. Currently, stress averagingapproach is used in the notches of the root and the weld toe. In the future though, there might beanother stress condition to be taken into account, if the goal of reducing weight of the finishedproduct shall be achieved. Regarding measuring the surface roughness in the weld toe, theevaluated vision system has enough accuracy to deliver reliable data. More work remains with the STELIN-algorithm. The method used when assessing the calculatedtoe radii should be based on the conclusions from the performed FE-calculations. Integrating theSTELIN-algorithm in a fast feedback measurement system – for instance, on a laser – willprobably provide good opportunities for a better process control in order to achieve higherfatigue life of the welded joint...|$|R
40|$|We study two {{topics in}} string theory: {{consistency}} of D- branes and their intersections in topologically nontrivial background, and Noncommutative Geometry and “Little String Theories. ” When a D-brane wraps around {{a cycle of}} a curved manifold, the nontrivial topology of its normal bundle can induce chiral asymmetry in its worldvolume theory. We obtain the general form of the resulting anomalies for D-branes and their intersections. They are not cancelled among themselves, and the standard inflow mechanism does not apply at first sight because of their apparent lack of factorizability and the apparent vanishing of the corresponding inflow. We show, however, that after taking into consideration {{the effects of the}} twisting of the normal bundles, the anomalies can be transformed into factorized forms and precisely cancelled by finite inflow from the Chern-Simons actions for the D-branes as long as the latter are well defined. Such twisting of the normal bundle is shown to induce Ramond-Ramond charges on the D- branes. Generically, Noncommutative Geometry (NCG) appears in String Theory when a background Neveu-Schwarz B-field is turned on. We study a case of Type IIA D 0 -branes on T 2 with such background. The effect of the B-field is—shown explicitly—to replace the ordinary multiplication with a noncommutative product in D 0 -brane action. We calculate the <b>radii</b> and the <b>gauge</b> coupling for the resulting 2 + 1 SYM on a noncommutative torus, given the longitudinal momentum and membrane wrapping number of the original theory. NCG also appears, quite unexpectedly, in Little String Theory (LST) compactification. LST is the theory of NS 5 - branes with noncritical strings confined to their worldvolume.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} and technical expertise {{required for the}} development of telerobotic systems capable of needle distal tip manipulation is the focus of this thesis. An extensive prior literature review was conducted to examine (1) the current medical devices available to pulmonary radiologists and (2) the current steerable mechanism state of the art. Interviews were also conducted with interventional radiology and cardiology physicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital to define the mechanism functional requirements for a telerobotic system and a first order analysis was undertaken to evaluate three strategies. The selected strategy was based on the concept of deploying a flexible pre-curved stylet from a concentric straight cannula. Analytical models were developed to (1) understand what material properties are required to recover from the imposed strains, (2) compare stylet stiffness relative to each other and the cannulas, and (3) calculate the deployment and retraction forces required for moving the stylet relative to the cannula. Sixteen Nitinol stylets were prototyped and experiments were performed with four different diameter cannulas and an experimental setup and methodology was developed to measure the deployment and retraction forces. The data collected for 48 permutations of stylet diameter, stylet bend <b>radius,</b> and cannula <b>gauge</b> were compared to the analytical model. Retraction forces were measured between. 277 and 13. 9 N, and deployment forces were measured between. 191 and 6. 95 N. For a given cannula it was found that force increases as stylet diameter increases and bend radius decreases. The analytical model better matched the experimental retraction and deployment measurements for the smaller stylet diameters (0. 508 and 0. 635 mm) with low friction, retraction and deployment forces. It was found that the retraction and deployment force does not necessarily increase or decrease with cannula diameter and {{it was found that the}} stylets drawn through the 16 gauge cannula consistently had the lowest deployment and retraction forces recorded across the four cannulas tested.

An 11 km [...] gauge tramway was built from Mourilyan Harbour to the South Johnstone River about 5 km south of Geraldton in 1883 to {{facilitate}} construction of the Mourilyan sugar mill. By 1898 there were ~60 km of sugar tramways in the Geraldton district servicing the Mourilyan and Goondi mills. The Geraldton Shire Council decided to build a 26 km line to service the upper Johnston River valley, which opened to Nerada in 1902 featuring 1 in 30 (3.3%) grades and 3 chain (~60 m) <b>radius</b> curves. [...] <b>gauge</b> was chosen because of the existing tramways, and a branchline was built to service the South Johnstone mill (situated about 8 km further upstream from the Mourilyan mill). In addition to seasonal sugar cane, the line hauled passengers, bananas and timber. Under {{the provisions of the}} North Coast Railway Act 1910 ('NCRA), QR purchased the tramway from the Innisfail Shire Council in 1915, as well as the Mourilyan Harbour line from the Mourilyan mill and constructed a 5 km line featuring a 123 m timber trestle bridge over the South Johnstone River to connect the two lines. The NCRA authorised construction of a [...] gauge line from Innisfail to Mourilyan Harbour, and the QR purchase of the tramway lines was to enable transportation of construction materials for the NCL to a major works site established at Innisfail, a 1.5 km extension of the tramline to the QR station site being built for that purpose, with an engine shed that serviced both [...] and [...] QR locos. WW1 meant that construction of the NCL north and south from Innisfail did not start until 1920, and in the meantime QR operated the 'Innisfail Tramway' with 11 mixed services per week plus additional trains to haul sugar cane in season. Processed sugar from the South Johnstone mill began to be hauled to Mourilyan Harbour, and this traffic grew to the extent that a balloon loop was built at the expanded port to facilitate unloading in 1922. The NCL opened in 1924, connecting Innisfail to Townsville and Cairns, and whilst a short [...] branch was built to the South Johnstone mill, the proposed [...] line to Mourilyan Harbour was not, and QR continued to operate the tramway. Whilst passenger numbers declined from ~108,000 in 1922 to ~6,000 in 1937, and ceased in 1948, freight loadings grew from ~61,000 long tons (including 20,000 tons of cane) in 1922 to ~130,000 tons (95% cane) in 1934. Diesel locomotives were introduced in 1954, with steam locomotion ceasing in 1962, enabling tonnage to reach ~300,000 in 1967. Despite having an operating ratio of 43.9% in 1969, the tramway was seen as a non-core asset by QR and sold to the South Johnstone mill in 1977, which continues to operate the majority of the system for sugar cane haulage, though the transportation of processed sugar to Mourilyan Harbour was replaced by road transport in 1997.
