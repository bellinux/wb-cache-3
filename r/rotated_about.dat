5|$|Several effects {{influence}} the steering angle, the angle {{at which the}} front assembly is <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> the steering axis, necessary to maintain a steady-state turn. Some of these are unique to single-track vehicles, while others are also experienced by automobiles. Some of these may be mentioned elsewhere in this article, and they are repeated here, though not necessarily in order of importance, {{so that they may}} be found in one place.|$|E
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
25|$|A sphere {{can also}} be {{constructed}} as the surface formed by rotating a circle about any of its diameters. Since a circle is a special type of ellipse, a sphere is a special type of ellipsoid of revolution. Replacing the circle with an ellipse <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> its major axis, the shape becomes a prolate spheroid; <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> the minor axis, an oblate spheroid.|$|E

5000|$|Directional {{stability}} is frequently called [...] "weather vaning" [...] because a directionally stable vehicle free to <b>rotate</b> <b>about</b> its {{center of mass}} {{is similar to a}} weather vane <b>rotating</b> <b>about</b> its (vertical) pivot.|$|R

25|$|Euler proved in 1744 {{that the}} {{catenary}} is the curve which, when <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> the -axis, gives {{the surface of}} minimum surface area (the catenoid) for the given bounding circles.

25|$|During this {{rotation}} of the Coast Range the block of continental crust that is now the Blue Mountains (on {{the eastern side of}} the KBML) was also rifted away from the Idaho batholith, and also <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> 50 degrees, but about a point near the Wallula Gap (or perhaps further east).|$|E

5000|$|For example, if {{you have}} a sphere <b>rotating</b> <b>about</b> any point that is NOT the center of the sphere, the sphere is gyrating. If it was <b>rotating</b> <b>about</b> its center, the {{rotation}} would be symmetrical and it would not be considered gyration.|$|R
25|$|Mechanical {{changes can}} make {{equipment}} (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast {{to improve the}} stability of ships. Cruise ships use antiroll fins that extend transversely {{from the side of}} the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.|$|E
25|$|However, Aristotle in {{the fourth}} century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation. He {{established}} the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> the earth. This was accepted by most of those who came after, in particular Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE), who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.|$|E
25|$|The wheellock took {{around a}} minute to load, prepare and fire.

This means if the influence line for a reaction is asked for simply start by pretending the beam is no longer attached to the reaction in question and is free to <b>rotate</b> <b>about</b> the other support.

25|$|Sertaline binds to {{the same}} {{extracellular}} vestibule in LeuT as fluoxetine where the two chlorine atoms on the phenyl ring bind to HBP formed by Leu25, Gly26, Leu29, Arg30, Tyr108, Ile111 and Phe253. The halogens additionally make Van der Waals contact with Leu29, Tyr108 and Phe253. The tetralin (tetrahydronaphthalene) {{on the other end}} of sertralines structure is in contact with Leu400, Asp401 and Thr409 (which are a part of the TM10) as well as the molecule interacts with Ala319 of the EL4 hairpin loop and Arg30 and Gin34 of the TM1, where the amine tail points towards the cytoplasm. The bound sertraline molecule has its dichlorophenyl ring <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> the C4-C13 bond by 180 degrees compared to the free drug.|$|E

Within each turret, a red stripe {{on the wall of}} the turret, just inches from the railing, would have marked the boundary of the gun's recoil, providing the crew of each gun turret with a visual reference for the minimum safe distance range.|$|E

[...] The guns were never fired horizontally forward (in the 1980s refit, a satellite up-link antenna was mounted at the bow). To distinguish between the rounds fired from different battleships the Iowa class used dye bags which allowed artillery observers to determine which rounds had been fired by which ship. Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin were assigned the colors orange, blue, red and green, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Seeking {{to explain}} the {{observed}} clockwise paleorotation, and noting that Siletzia appeared to have rotated as a rigid block, [...] proposed two models. First was rotation about a southern pivot {{in contact with the}} Klamath Mountains. This has various problems, especially because at the northern end sediments and even boulders from the continent are found {{at the base of the}} Crescent Formation, showing that it was near the continent from the beginning. In the second model (subsequently refined by [...] ), Siletzia was originally adjacent to the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament, then rifted from the continent and <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> a northern pivot near the Olympic Peninsula. Because sediments also show the Klamaths in close contact from the start, this requires the Klamaths to have moved with Siletzia. Originally there were conflicts in the understanding of when the Klamaths moved, and with the age and amount of rotation of the Clarno Formation in central Oregon. These were largely cleared up in a study of the Clarno Formation by [...] and illustrated with a palinspastic reconstruction as of 38 Ma.|$|E
500|$|When the {{full-scale}} production began, {{the reverse}} eagle {{was surrounded by}} 26 stars rather than 24 as Patterson had originally requested of Sully, as the states of Arkansas and Michigan had been admitted to the Union since Patterson's letter was penned in 1835. Some of the Gobrecht dollars produced were struck with 'medal alignment', meaning that the obverse and reverse images both face upward when the coin is rotated around its vertical axis. For the 1837 production (which kept the 1836 date), Patterson ordered that the coins be struck in coin alignment, the opposite of medal alignment, and the practice with current US coins (the two faces both are upright when the coin is <b>rotated</b> <b>about</b> its horizontal axis). An act of January 18, 1837, officially changed the legal standard for silver coins from 89.2% to 90% silver. Numismatic historian Walter Breen asserts that those pieces struck before the passage of this act are technically patterns (or coins created to test their design, composition or other points), as they were not authorized by Congress. In total, 1,000 pieces dated 1836 were struck in 89.2% silver and 600 in 90% silver. Gobrecht dollars struck prior to passage of the act weighed , while those struck later weighed [...]|$|E
