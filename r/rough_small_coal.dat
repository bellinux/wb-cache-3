30|$|The closure {{policy has}} mainly brought {{two aspects of}} {{negative}} influence. Firstly, the closure of <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines {{was carried out in}} batches, so when a number of <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines was closed, other <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines would have a sense of crisis and then they would produce hastily and didn’t pay attention to safety issues more before they were shut down, which lead to the increase of accidents. Secondly, the supply of coal decreased greatly and may even in short supply owning to closing many <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines, which would lead to high coal prices and profits and then many other coal mines would be possible to increase their outputs and ignore the safety issues. Many illegal <b>small</b> township <b>coal</b> mines couldn’t be completely shut down. Some of them still recovered production behind closed doors, and they produced hastily and didn’t pay attention to safety issues more for compensating the considerable loss in their rectification period. In short, the negative effects from the closure period and recovery period greatly lead to the safety record worsened in the short term.|$|R

According to incomplete statistics, the destroyed areas by <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines amount to nearly one hundred square kilometers and have over three hundred million tons of resource reserves in Xinliu, Xinyu and Xinyang these three fields. <b>Small</b> <b>coal</b> mines tend to use outdated techniques such as replacing mining with advancement, small excavation with large stoping and room pillar mining technique, which have a stoping rate of only 10 % to 25 %. Some of the wellheads were not closed seamlessly, which resulted in self-combustion; some were damaged due to the mining of the lower coal seam. A serious security risk existed during the mining of the lower coal seam due to the uncertainty of gas, water and roof pressure. In addition, the destructed area by <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines is badly large in Shanxi Province and even the whole country which remains {{a huge amount of}} resources.

40|$|AbstractFilling {{repeated}} {{mining technology}} of <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines mainly researches on the gob or cavity {{in the coal}} seam formed by the mining method of <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines. Adopting the means of field exploration, indoor test, the simulation experiment, pumping filling material that is stable in mechanical property and low in price into the gob, it can {{meet the needs of}} normal mining and achieves the purpose of mining safety and efficiency. The keys of this technology are detecting, the stability and controlling method of the surrounding rock, management and safe-efficient mining process technology. The gob of <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines in B 909 working face of Anjialing No. 2 underground coal mine affected the advancing of the working face. In view of this situation, the detecting method and solution were researched. The results showed that, combining geophysical exploration and the trinity of detecting, releasing, controlling, ae specific location of the goal could be mastered accurately and the harmful factors could be removed. According to the characteristic of recovery, the suitable filling material and scheme were chosen to deal with the gob by grouting. This guaranteed the stability of the surrounding rock and the coal in the period of mining. These methods mentioned above realized the safely and efficiently mining of the coal seam affected by the gob of <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines and provided experiences to the coal resource exploitation of similar condition...|$|R
