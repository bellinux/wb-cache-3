5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E
5|$|He won quick {{victories}} in four consecutive battles: the Battle of Chains, fought in April 633; the Battle of River, {{fought in the}} third week of April 633; the Battle of Walaja, fought in May 633 (where he successfully used a double envelopment manoeuvre), and Battle of Ullais, fought in the mid-May 633. In the last week of May 633, al-Hira, the regional capital city of lower Mesopotamia, fell to Khalid. The inhabitants were given peace on the terms of annual payment of jizya (tribute) and agreed to provide intelligence for Muslims. After <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> armies, in June 633, Khalid laid siege to Anbar which despite fierce resistance fell in July 633 {{as a result of the}} siege imposed on the town. Khalid then moved towards the south, and captured Ein ul Tamr in the last week of July, 633.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the Pundalik legend, {{two of which are}} attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana (1.34–67). According to the first, the ascetic Pundarika (Pundalik) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents. The god Gopala-Krishna, a form of Vishnu, comes from Govardhana as a cowherd, accompanied by his grazing cows, to meet Pundarika. Krishna is described as in digambar form, wearing makara-kundala, the srivatsa mark (described above), a head-dress of peacock feathers, <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> hands on his waist and keeping his cow-stick between his thighs. Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form {{on the banks of the}} river Bhima. He believes that Krishna's presence will make the site a tirtha and a kshetra. The location is identified with modern-day Pandharpur, which is situated on the banks of the Bhima. The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba.|$|E

5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E
25|$|Van Gogh painted Gachet <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> {{right elbow}} {{on a red}} table, head in hand. Two yellow books {{as well as the}} purple {{medicinal}} herb foxglove are displayed on the table. The foxglove in the painting is a plant from which digitalis is extracted for the treatment of certain heart complaints, perhaps an attribute of Gachet as a physician.|$|E

25|$|Amundsen {{had used}} the {{opportunity}} of learning from the Inuit while on his Gjøa North West passage expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To {{make the most of}} the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey, and his team spent up to 16 hours a day <b>resting.</b> <b>His</b> dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.|$|E
25|$|While at Naco, Villa {{requested}} that several hundred of his wounded be trasported by rail through the United States to Juarez, Chiahuahua, as Carranza {{had been allowed}} to transport troops and supplies; that request was denied. After <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> troops at Naco, Villa gathered up the remainder of his forces and attacked the town of Hermosillo, Sonora, on November 21, 1915. In order to try to restore the morale of his troops, he promised them that after they took the city, they could do whatever they wanted with the town and its inhabitants. This actually ended up causing the attack to fail, as his men almost immediately turned to looting and rape rather than fighting, which allowed the defending forces to reorganize and drive the Villistas out.|$|E

25|$|Coleman {{took nearly}} a year off after having to get ACL surgery and {{returned}} at UFC 17. Coleman was originally scheduled to face Randy Couture in a title match for the UFC Heavyweight Championship, but Couture was injured during training {{and was forced to}} pull out of the fight. Coleman instead faced a relatively unknown (at that time) last minute replacement fighter, up and coming Lion's Den product Pete Williams. In what turned out to be another long and strenuous battle, Coleman appeared to be completely exhausted after 10 minutes; he was fatigued to the point of <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> hands on his knees during the fight. Williams took advantage of Coleman's fatigue and landed a heavy kick to the face, knocking 'The Hammer' out for the first time in his career.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{spent three}} days <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> troops at Reims while Marshal Michel Ney reoccupied Châlons-sur-Marne. Ney was joined by a 3,000-man {{division}} that Jan Willem Janssens brought in from the Ardennes garrisons. The French emperor desired to move east to gather up other garrisons, but Schwarzenberg's offensive to the south compelled him to march in that direction. While Napoleon operated against Blücher in the north, the main Allied army pressed MacDonald back toward Paris. On 27 February, Schwarzenberg defeated Oudinot in the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube, forcing MacDonald to withdraw to the west. The Allies overpowered MacDonald on 3–4 March at the Battle of Laubressel. Schwarzenberg occupied Troyes but halted there until 12 March in a welter of indecision. Encouraged by news of Blucher's victory at Laon, the main Allied army crossed the Seine River and drove MacDonald beyond Provins by 16 March. Schwarzenberg's offensive came to a sudden halt when tidings of Napoleon's success at Reims arrived in the Allied camp.|$|E
25|$|After {{entering}} Mesopotamia {{with his}} army of 18,000, Khalid won decisive victories in four consecutive battles: the Battle of Chains, fought in April 633; the Battle of River, {{fought in the}} third week of April 633 AD; the Battle of Walaja, fought in May 633 (where he successfully used a double envelopment manoeuvre), and the Battle of Ullais, fought in the mid of May, 633 AD. The Persian court, already disturbed by internal problems, was thrown into chaos. In the last week of May 633, the important city of Hira fell to the Muslims after their victory in the Siege of Hira. After <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> armies, in June 633 Khalid laid siege to the city of Al Anbar, which surrendered in July 633 after a siege lasting a few weeks. Khalid then moved towards the south, and conquered the city of Ein ul Tamr after the Battle of Ein ut Tamr in the last week of July. At this point, most of what is now Iraq was under Islamic control.|$|E

25|$|After <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> armies, Khalid {{moved in}} June 633 towards Al Anbar, which {{resisted}} and {{was defeated in}} the Battle of Al-Anbar, and eventually surrendered after a siege of a few weeks in July 633. Khalid then moved towards the south, and conquered the city of Ein ul Tamr after the Battle of ein-ul-tamr {{in the last week}} of July 633. By now, almost the whole of Iraq was under Islamic control. Khalid received a call of help from northern Arabia at Daumat-ul-jandal, where another Muslim Arab general, Iyad ibn Ghanm, was trapped among the rebel tribes. Khalid went to Daumat-ul-jandal and defeated the rebels in the Battle of Daumat-ul-jandal in the last week of August 633. Returning from Arabia, he received news of the assembling of a large Persian army. Within a few weeks, he decided to defeat them all separately {{in order to avoid the}} risk of defeat by a large unified Persian army. Four divisions of Persian and Christian Arab auxiliaries were present at Hanafiz, Zumiel, Sanni and Muzieh.|$|E
500|$|Members of {{the crew}} would later provide {{conflicting}} accounts of Heywood's actions during the mutiny. Boatswain William Cole testified that Heywood had been detained on the ship against his will. Ship's carpenter William Purcell thought that Heywood's ambiguous behaviour during the critical hours—he had been seen unwittingly <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> {{hand on top of}} a cutlass—was due to his youth and the excitement of the moment, and that he had no hand in the uprising itself. On the other hand, Midshipman John Hallett reported that Bligh, with a bayonet at his breast and his hands tied, had addressed a remark to Heywood who had [...] "laughed, turned round and walked away". Another midshipman, Thomas Hayward, claimed he had asked Heywood his intentions and been told by the latter that he would remain with the ship, from which Hayward assumed that his messmate had sided with the mutineers.|$|E
500|$|With Far Cry 3 being a {{commercial}} success, Ubisoft considered the Far Cry series {{one of their}} most important brands, and they hinted that a sequel was in development in June 2013. On October 3, 2013, Martinez mentioned that he was working on the soundtrack for the game. [...] In March 2014 the game's setting and features were leaked. The game was officially announced on May 15, 2014, and the first gameplay footage was revealed during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The game's cover art, which shows the light-skinned Pagan Min <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> hand on a dark-skinned person, caused controversy and accusation of racism. Hutchinson later responded and clarified by saying that Pagan Min is not a white person, and that the other person depicted is not the game's protagonist. Hutchinson added that the reaction of the community regarding the cover art was [...] "uncomfortable".|$|E

500|$|Dunmore's best {{intelligence}} {{had informed}} him that the rebel forces numbered about 400. [...] On the night and morning of December 8 and 9 Captain Samuel Leslie led reinforcements down to Fort Murray, arriving around 3:00 am. [...] Upon his arrival {{he learned that the}} Ethiopian detachment intended for the diversion was not in the fort. [...] They had been dispatched on a routine deployment to another nearby crossing, and Dunmore had failed to send orders ensuring their availability for the operation. [...] Leslie decided to proceed with the attack anyway. [...] After <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> troops until a little before dawn, he sent men out to replace the bridge planking. [...] Once this was finished, Captain Charles Fordyce led a company of 60 grenadiers across the bridge. [...] They briefly skirmished with militia sentries, raising the alarm in the camp beyond the entrenchments. [...] Fordyce's men were then joined by a company of navy gunners who had been brought along to operate the field artillery for the attack, while the Tory companies arrayed themselves on the Norfolk side of the bridge.|$|E
500|$|The gada {{appears as}} an {{attribute}} in the oldest known sculpture of Vishnu (from Malhar, Madhya Pradesh), dated to c. 200 BCE. One {{of the earliest}} images of Vishnu date to the Kushan period (30–375 CE) found around Mathura, the gada {{does not appear in}} a stylised design as in later depictions, but the mace is a simple [...] "round top-heavy rod" [...] held in his upper (back) right hand and lifted above the shoulders. In another Kushan sculpture, the gada is depicted as a long rod which is almost the height of Vishnu and is held in his upper right hand. It is depicted similar to a long pestle (musala). A similar image found in Jhusi as well as early images from Western India depict Vishnu <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> upper right hand on the mace or holding the mace in this hand. Gupta images continue the trend of having upper (back) right hand resting on or holding the gada. The gada started being depicted in other arms. Twenty-four configurations of Vishnu images are noted, where the order of the four attributes is changed.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, [...] "American Life" [...] {{was included}} on her Re-Invention World Tour. It opened the Military-Army segment and {{started with the}} sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies as though in the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret. She started performing the song as war footage of death and destruction flashed on screens behind her. At the end of the song, it showed a George W. Bush look-alike lovingly <b>resting</b> <b>his</b> head on the shoulder of a Saddam Hussein look-alike, as though the pair were waiting for a marriage license. During the performance, Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. Toronto Suns Jane Stevenson praised the performance, but called the background images [...] "sober". The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary.|$|E
