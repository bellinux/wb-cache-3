40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> temptation of three-, four-, and five-year-old children and parental attitudes toward child-rearing. Other variables explored included gender of the children, employment status of mothers, and socio-economic status of families. Fifty-two three-, four-, and five-year-old children from two centers were tested to determine their levels of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> temptation as measured by Grinder's Bean Bag Instrument. Parental attitudes toward child-rearing were measured by Schaefer and Bell's Parental Attitude Research Instrument (PARI). To determine the difference between the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> temptation <b>scores</b> and socio-economic status, gender, and employment status of mothers, Jt tests were employed. No significant differences were found with regard to these variables. Factor analysis of the PARI resulted in three primary factors: Hostility-Rejection, Authoritarian- Control, and Democratic-Attitude. To determine the difference between the Hostility-Rejection scores, Authoritarian-Control scores, and Democratic-Attitude scores of the mothers and socio-economic status, _t tests were employed. There {{were no significant differences between}} mothers of a lower socio-economic level and their Hostility- Rejection and Democratic-Attitude scores. However, mothers of a lower/upper socio-economic level showed significantly higher levels of Authoritarian-Control than mothers of an upper socio-economic level. To determine the difference between the Hostility-Rejection scores, Authoritarian- Control scores, and Democratic-Attitude scores of the mothers and employment status of the mothers, t_ tests were employed. No significant differences were found regarding these variables. To determine the relationship between the Hostility-Rejection scores, Authoritarian-Control scores, and Democratic-Attitude scores of the mothers and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> temptation <b>scores</b> of the children, a Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient was employed. Results indicated that there was no significant relationship between the Hostility-Rejection scores and the Authoritarian-Control scores of the mothers and the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> temptation <b>score</b> of the children.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to {{determine}} whether or not relationships exist among belief systems and tenure status of junior high school teachers in a metropolitan school system, and their attitudes toward educational innovation. On the basis of previous theory and research it was anticipated that closed and open personalities should differ in their receptivity toward educational innovation. It was also assumed that tenured and non-tenured teachers should differ in receptivity toward educational innovation. Specifically, the thesis was designed to investigate this question: Do dogmatism and tenure status of junior high school teachers influence their attitudes towards educational innovation? The following three statistical null hypotheses were developed to investigate the above question: (1) There are no statistically significant differences on <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> educational innovation <b>scores</b> between open-minded teachers and closed-minded teachers. (2) There are no statistically significant tenure status differences related <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> educational innovation <b>scores.</b> (3) There is no statistically significant interaction effect between tenure status and dogmatism when the criterion is <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> educational innovation. The sample for the study consists of 302 junior high school teachers in a large eastern metropolitan school system in the United States. The measuring instruments include the Educational Innovation Attitude Scale, the twenty-item Dogmatism Scale, and a Personal Data Form. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance techniques. Conclusions drawn from the data reveal that there were significant positive relationships between tenure status and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> educational innovation, and between closed-mindedness and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> educational innovation. It is also revealed that dogmatism-tenure status interactions were not significant on the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> educational innovation measure. The findings tend to support the independent nature of dogmatism and tenure status as significant predictors of resistance toward educational innovation. Furthermore, this study shows that tenure status and Rokeach's theory of dogmatism can be empirically defined and their effects on innovative behavior investigated. As a result of this study, the following are suggestions for further research: (1) That replicative studies with samples of teachers other than junior high school teachers be chosen from different school systems; (2) That further investigations of dogmatism and tenure status dimensions in relation to operative innovations be conducted; (3) That further examinations of the interaction of personality factors and environmental conditions in relation to innovativeness be made...|$|R

In a greenhouse screen, 11 of the 155 accessions exhibited seedling leaf blast <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the same isolate. Further evaluation of the selected 28 accessions (found resistant to neck and head blast under field conditions during 2009 and 2010, and/or leaf blast in the greenhouse screen) against four M. grisea isolates Fx 57, Fx 58, Fx 60 and Fx 62 from Patancheru, Nandyal, Vizianagaram and Mandya, respectively, led to the identification of 16 accessions with leaf, sheath, neck and head blast <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> at least one isolate. Two accessions (ISe 1181 and ISe 1547) were free from head blast infection and showed <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> leaf (<b>score</b> ≤ 3. 0 on a 1 -to- 9 scale), neck and sheath blast (score ≤ 2. 0 on a 1 -to- 5 scale) against all the four isolates.

The research was conducted via self-administered questionnaires on a group of 324 adults, men and women, currently employed. Correlations were computed between RTC and measures of personality factors (Big Five), sensation seeking, need for cognitive closure, emotional control, cognitive abilities, and political orientation. Then, the correlation between RTC and social desirability was computed. Moreover, differences in RTC scores between sub-groups with a different amount of change experiences were analysed. Finally, via multiple regression analysis, the best predictors of RTC were identified. RTC factorial structure, made up of four first-order factors and a single second-order factor, was supported by confirmatory factor analysis results. The internal consistency was also acceptable. RTC measure was negatively correlated with extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability and openness (Big Five), sensation seeking, and emotional control. The correlation between RTC and need for cognitive closure was high and positive. The correlation between RTC and social desirability was week and negative, and no correlations at all resulted between RTC, cognitive ability and political orientation. Participants with a high number of change experiences had a lower RTC scores when compared with those with a low number of change experiences.

40|$|At present, {{the ease}} of {{subdivision}} of scored tablets is estimated in vivo. In order to replace such in vivo testing {{and to develop a}} surrogate test which uses in vitro techniques, the association between physical parameters of scored tablets and their ease of subdivision was studied. The physical properties of 23 brands of scored tablets of which their ease of subdivision in vivo was known were established. Statistical modeling using a logistic regression model was used to fit the data and estimate the contribution of each physical parameter to the goodness of the fit. For scored oblong tablets, the critical parameters for their ease of subdivision are: diameter; diameter/width ratio; depth of <b>score</b> line and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> crushing. Criteria for each of these parameters were derived. All criteria need to be complied with to guarantee sufficient ease of subdivision of scored oblong tablets. For scored round tablets the critical parameters, in decreasing order of importance, for their ease of subdivision, are: <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> crushing, diameter, <b>score</b> mark (one- or two-sided), and shape (flat or biconvex). A five-parameter predictive model was developed, showing excellent discrimination. For development, the proposed surrogate tests are sufficiently reliable.

40|$|Late {{leaf spot}} (LLS), caused by Phaeoisariopsis personata, is an {{important}} foliar fungal disease of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), which causes significant economic losses globally to the crop. Inheritance of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> LLS disease was studied in three crosses and their reciprocals involving two resistant interspecific derivatives and a susceptible cultivar to refine strategy for LLS resistance breeding. The traits associated with LLS resistance, measured both {{in the field and}} under controlled conditions were studied following generation mean analysis. Results suggested that <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> LLS is controlled by a combination of both, nuclear and maternal gene effects. Among nuclear gene effects, additive effect controlled majority of the variation. In JL 24 × ICG 11337 cross and its reciprocal only additive effects were important, while in JL 24 × ICG 13919 cross and its reciprocal, both additive and dominance effects contributed to the variation. Among digenic epistatic effects, additive × dominance interactions were significant. Additive–maternal effects were significant in both the crosses, while dominance–maternal effects also contributed to the variation in the crosses between the parents, JL 24 and ICG 13919. Due to significant contribution of additive effects of both nuclear and maternal inheritance <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> LLS, the parent, ICG 11337 would be a good donor in breeding programs.

Church leaders continue to act in ways that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and ultimately failed change efforts. These actions on the part of church leaders often strengthen and reinforce the sources of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, making it very difficult for change to be accepted by church members. A literature study design was used to conduct this research. The purpose of this research was to: • Understand the phenomenon of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • To determine the actions of leaders that generate <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • To determine how church leaders can overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change The research indicates that church leaders make too many errors in a change process that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The research has found eight actions of leaders that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change by followers. Apart from the eight actions of leaders that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, many change agents continue to function as managers and not leaders in a change process. This results in further <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change.

The {{management}} of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change by school principals of secondary {{schools in the}} North-West Province was investigated in this study. Changes are continually occurring on all levels of a rapidly developing society, and resistance is an inseparable part of this process. Since the school stands {{in the center of}} the developing community, the school principal, as education manager, should have a firm knowledge of skills which will enable him to efficiently implement the {{management of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. Examples of large-scale changes that occurred in education during the past five years are the implementation of Curriculum 2005 and the transformation of Model C schools. The aim of this research centered on the following problems: What is the nature of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change? What does the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change encompass? To what extent and in which way do school principals manage <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change? Firstly a literature study was undertaken to ascertain the nature of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, as well as methods and models according <b>to</b> which <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change can be managed. Findings from the literature study points to a number of aspects of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change which plays a decisive role in the management of change. These include factors giving rise <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, types of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, manifestations of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and reaction phases of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The way in which <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change is managed is influenced by, among others, factors indicating whether or not the school is ready for change, techniques which can be employed in the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, and also existing models which can be used successfully to facilitate the management process of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. Secondly an empirical investigation was undertaken to investigate the degree and way in which school principals manage <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. For this purpose a structured questionnaire as well as a semi-structured interview schedule was used. Findings from the empirical interview revealed that in general school principals handled the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change better than what was initially surmised, although few of them had enough relevant knowledge to be considered specialists in this field. Recommendations ensuing from this study comprise the inclusion of a module in educational management courses specifically aimed at change, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and especially the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change with the view to better equip education managers, the development of a refined model for the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change in schools, and also further research into such management model(s) to ascertain the practical application or its relevance in practice.

The objectives of this study were to (i) construct a molecular map of the sorghum genome and to map the (lgs) gene, (ii) estimate heritability and response <b>to</b> selection of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> these two Striga species (iii) estimate genetic correlation between field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> these two Striga species (iv) identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> two species of Striga in sorghum (v) compare the efficiency of predicted response to marker-based selection (MBS) and marker-assisted (MAS) selection relative to phenotypic selection for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Striga. A sorghum linkage map based on one 168 RI lines and 236 molecular marker loci was constructed. The population was mapped using RAPDs, RFLPs, I-SSR and SSR markers. The estimated map size was 1628 cM, with an average interval of 9. 5 cM between adjacent loci. The lgs gene mapped 11. 8 cM from RFLP marker PI 0200725. Narrow sense heritability (h 2) of field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica was estimated at 0. 35 and that of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica at 0. 24.

In Salmonella typhimurium, SoxS is also required for enhanced expression of Mn-superoxide dismutase and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> paraquat, but not for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> nitric oxide donor compounds in vitro, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> macrophage killing, or virulence in mice. Differences in other antioxidant defense systems or compensation by homologous regulons may account for species-specific differences in the role of SoxS...|$|R
40|$|A self-transferable plasmid of ca. 80 kb, pIP 1204, conferred multiple-antibiotic <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Klebsiella pneumoniae BM 4536, {{which was}} {{isolated}} from a urinary tract infection. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> β-lactams {{was due to}} the blaTEM 1 and blaCTX-M genes, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> trimethroprim {{was due to the}} dhfrXII gene, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> sulfonamides was due to the sul 1 gene, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> streptomycin-spectinomycin was due to the ant 3 " 9 gene, and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> nearly all remaining aminoglycosides was due to the aac 3 -II gene and a new gene designated armA (aminoglycoside resistance methylase). The cloning of armA into a plasmid in Escherichia coli conferred to the new host high-level <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> 4, 6 -disubstituted deoxystreptamines and fortimicin. The deduced sequence of ArmA displayed from 37 to 47 % similarity to those of 16 S rRNA m 7 G methyltransferases from various actinomycetes, which confer <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> aminoglycoside-producing strains. However, the low guanine-plus-cytosine content of armA (30 %) does not favor an actinomycete origin for the gene. It therefore appears that posttranscriptional modification of 16 S rRNA can confer high-level broad-range <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> aminoglycosides in gram-negative human pathogens...|$|R
40|$|One hundred thirty-nine cultivars of soybean (Glycine max) in Maturity Groups V, VI, VII, and VIII were {{evaluated}} in a greenhouse for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Heterodera glycines races 3 and 14 and Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria, and M. javanica. Of the cultivars tested, 37 % had <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> H. glycines race 3 alone, 12 % had <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> both races 3 and 14, and 69 % exhibited a moderate or {{high level of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> {{one or more of}} the Meloidogyne spp. However, 24 % were susceptible to each race of H. glycines and to all Meloidogyne spp. Whereas 40 % of the cultivars were moderately resistant to M. javanica, only 23 % were moderately resistant to M. incognita and 24 % to M. arenaria. Although 28 % of the cultivars had a high level of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> M. incognita, only 6 and 3 % had this level of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> M. javanica and M. arenaria, respectively. Seventeen percent of the cultivars possessed a moderate or high level of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> all three Meloidogyne spp., and 37 % had <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> H. glycines race 3 and M. incognita. With the exception of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> H. glycines race 14, <b>resistance</b> in soybean <b>to</b> these nematodes was fairly uniformly distributed across maturity groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{genetics}} of low-level <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> penicillin {{and other}} antibiotics {{in a clinical}} isolate and a multistep laboratory mutant of Neisseria gonorrhoea was studied by transformation. Mutations at three loci affected sensitivity to penicillin. Mutation at penA resulted in an eightfold increase in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> penicillin without affecting response to other antimicrobial agents. Mutation at ery resulted in a two- to fourfold increase in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> penicillin and similar increases in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> many other antibiotics, dyes, and detergents. Mutation at penB resulted in a fourfold increase in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> penicillin and tetracycline, the phenotypic expression of which was dependent {{on the presence of}} mutation at ery. The cumulative effect of mutations at penA, ery, and penB was an approximate 128 -fold increase in penicillin <b>resistance,</b> <b>to</b> a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1. 0 mug/ml. Low-level <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> tetracycline or chloramphenicol was due to similar additive effects between mutations at the nonspecific ery and penB loci and a locus specific for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> each drug (tet and chl, respectively). No evidence was found for penicillinases or other drug-inactivating enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Metallothioneins (MTs) mediate <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> {{metal and}} {{non-metal}} toxicants. To differentiate {{the role of}} MTs from other protective factors, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), tertbutyl hydroperoxide (tBH), and cisplatin (CDDP) was compared in renal cell lines from wild type (MT-WT) and MT- 1 /MT- 2 knockout (MT-KO) mice. MT-WT cells were more resistant to tBH than MT-KO cells but, unexpectedly, were more sensitive to Zn, Cd, and CDDP. Thus, basal expression of MT conferred <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> tBH, but not to Cd or CDDP. Pretreatment with Zn increased MT expression and enhanced <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Cd and CDDP only in MT-WT cells, indicating a critical role for MT in this form of resistance. By contrast, Zn-pretreatment increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> subsequent Zn exposure, but did not alter <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> tBH, regardless of MT-status. Therefore, Zn-induced <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> subsequent exposure to Zn (but not to Cd or CDDP) wa...|$|R
