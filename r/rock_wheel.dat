These two Detroit companies also contracted with the military in WWI sending a convoy of supplies, men and equipment from Detroit to Norfolk, Virginia shipyards for travel to the front in Europe.|$|R

50|$|Each wheel {{could also}} be raised and lowered {{independently}} by up to 500mm so that the vehicle could remain level at all times or so that the vehicle could be raised to clear stumps and large <b>rocks.</b> Each <b>wheel</b> was automatically adjusted to keep equal pressure on all wheels - helping to maintain grip. For extremely rough ground, the wheels could be replaced by 4 individual caterpillar tracks - the front tracks were steerable to lessen damage to the ground.|$|R

50|$|Fruehauf {{used the}} Martin <b>Rocking</b> 5th <b>Wheel</b> up {{until at least}} 1919. Early that year, the manual coupler was {{introduced}} to the industry by Fruehauf and the jacks acting as front supports for the semi-trailer were supplanted by wheels, raised and lowered manually. In 1926, Fruehauf introduced the automatic semi-trailer in which the coupling and the uncoupling of the tractor were accomplished mechanically by the motion of the tractor. Fruehauf's introduction of the automatic semi-trailer was instantly recognized by transportation experts as a major contribution to the industry.|$|R

Fruehauf's slogan, [...] "A Horse can pull more than it can carry, so can a truck" [...] became their advertising motto. Merchants, manufacturers and businesses in every industry clamored for a semi-trailer and the shuttle concept introduced by Fruehauf using one tractor truck and 2 or more semi-trailers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{invention}} of the fifth wheel for motorized trucks is often credited to US inventor Charles H. Martin of the Martin <b>Rocking</b> Fifth <b>Wheel</b> Co. who invented the device in 1915. [...] It was submitted for patent in 1915, and finalized in 1916. Herman Farr invented it, and Martin hooked up with him and became the assignee. When they formed the Martin Fifth Wheel company Martin was president and Farr was named secretary. The 5th wheel was Farr's invention. Martin capitalized on it. [...] "It's a fair question whether you really can consider the fifth wheel as a milestone separate from the semi-trailer. After all, {{the purpose of the}} fifth wheel is to link the tractor and the trailer; indeed, trailers existed before Charles H. Martin introduced the Martin <b>Rocking</b> Fifth <b>Wheel</b> in 1915. At the time, the fifth wheel literally was a wheel that moved with the trailer—unlike today’s technology that secures a kingpin. What makes the fifth wheel so important is the ability it gave fleet owners to attach large trailers to tractors easily and safely and the freedom it gave them to switch out trailers. Without a fifth wheel, the modern distribution system would look quite different as drop-and-hook would not be easy. The semi-trailer increased the capacity of trucks, but it was the fifth wheel that brought the flexibility for drivers to keep moving while receivers unloaded the loads they just delivered." ...|$|R

60|$|Accidents, {{as may be}} supposed, often happen; and to-day {{we found}} that there is danger as well as {{pleasure}} in running the rapids. We had got over {{a great part of}} the day in safety, and were in the act of running {{the first part of the}} Rose Rapid, when our canoe struck upon a <b>rock,</b> and <b>wheeling</b> round with its broadside to the stream, began to fill quickly. I could hear the timbers cracking beneath me under the immense pressure. Another minute, and we should have been gone; but our men, who were active fellows, and well accustomed to such dangers, sprang simultaneously over the side of the canoe, which, being thus lightened, passed over the rock, and rushed down the remainder of the rapid stern foremost ere the men could scramble in and resume their paddles. When rapids were very dangerous, most of the cargo was generally disembarked; and while one half of the crew carried it round to the still water below, the other half ran down light.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there were}} a great {{diversity}} of case shapes, {{the most common and}} popular ones were the clocks with a rectangular or oblong base sustained by four (or more) legs of different forms and patterns. The pedestal front was normally decorated with either garlands, acanthus tendrils, acroterions, laurel wreaths, scrolls, flowers and other classical decorative motifs, or depicting finely chased mythological and allegoric scenes in relief as a frieze of a Greek-Roman temple. On top of the base (in the center or to one side) sat the plinth that accommodated the clock dial, however in other models it was also placed in cart <b>wheels,</b> <b>rocks,</b> shields, globes, tree trunks, etc.|$|R
