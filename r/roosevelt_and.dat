5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>and</b> the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>and</b> his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E

In 1936, he cofounded the American Labor Party, a pro-union political party active in New York, along with David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, partly as a vehicle to organize support for the re-election that year of President Franklin D. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>and</b> mayor Fiorello La Guardia among socialists in the union movement.|$|E

The power of labor unions had expanded under <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>and</b> the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E

Stennis. More recently, older ships have had their flight decks upgraded with a new non-slip material fitted on new-build ships, to improve safety for both crew members and aircraft.|$|E

Marshall became new proponents of long-range air power.|$|E
