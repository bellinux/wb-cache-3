40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents pricing {{models for}} stop-loss <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts</b> for catastrophic events and for catastrophe insurance derivatives. We use doubly stochastic Poisson process or the Cox {{process for the}} claim arrival process for catastrophic events. The shot noise process is able to measure the frequency, magnitude and time period needed {{to determine the effect}} of the catastrophe. This process is used for the claim intensity function within the Cox process. The Cox process with shot noise intensity is examined by piecewise deterministic Markov process theory. We apply the Cox process incorporating the shot noise process as its intensity to price stop-loss catastrophe <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts</b> and catastrophe insurance derivatives. In order to calculate fair prices for <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts</b> and catastrophe insurance derivatives we need to assume that there is an absence of arbitrage opportunities in the market. This can be achieved by using an equivalent martingale probability measure in our pricing models. The Esscher transform is used to change probability measure. The dissertation also shows how to estimate the parameters of claim intensity using the likelihood function. In order to estimate the distribution of claim intensity, state estimation is employed as well. Since the claim intensity is not observable we filter it out {{on the basis of the}} number of claims, i. e. we employ the Kalman-Bucy filter. We also derive pricing formulae for stop-loss <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts</b> for catastrophic events using the distribution of claim intensity that is obtained by the Kalman-Bucy filter. Both estimations are essential in pricing stop-loss <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts</b> and catastrophe insurance derivatives...|$|R

50|$|The NRRA {{provides}} {{that if the}} ceding insurer’s state of domicile is an NAIC-accredited state, or has financial solvency requirements substantially similar thereto, {{and the state of}} domicile recognizes credit for reinsurance, then no other state may deny such credit for reinsurance. In addition, a state that is not the ceding insurer’s domiciliary state is preempted to the extent that any of its laws or regulations: restrict or eliminate the rights of ceding and assuming insurers to resolve disputes pursuant to contractual arbitration; require that a certain state’s laws govern a <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contract,</b> disputes arising from such contract, or requirements of the contract; attempt to enforce a <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contract</b> on terms different from those set forth in the reinsurance contract; or otherwise apply the laws of the state to reinsurance agreements of ceding insurers not domiciled in the state.|$|E
50|$|Many {{reinsurance}} placements are not {{placed with}} a single reinsurer but are shared between a number of reinsurers. For example, a $30,000,000 excess of $20,000,000 layer may be shared by 30 or more reinsurers. The reinsurer who sets the terms (premium and contract conditions) for the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contract</b> is called the lead reinsurer; the other companies subscribing to the contract are called following reinsurers. Alternatively, one reinsurer can accept {{the whole of the}} reinsurance and then retrocede it (pass it on in a further reinsurance arrangement) to other companies.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the above}} {{examples}} concern <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts</b> that cover more than one policy (treaty). Reinsurance can also be purchased on a per policy basis, in which case it is known as facultative reinsurance. Facultative reinsurance can be written on either a quota share or excess of loss basis. Facultative <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts</b> are commonly memorialized in relatively brief contracts known as facultative certificates and often are used for large or unusual risks that do not fit within standard reinsurance treaties due to their exclusions. The term of a facultative agreement coincides with the term of the policy. Facultative reinsurance is usually purchased by the insurance underwriter who underwrote the original insurance policy, whereas treaty reinsurance is typically purchased by a senior executive at the insurance company.|$|R
40|$|Reinsurance is a {{mechanism}} {{the insurance industry}} uses to spread the risk it assumes from policyholders. Through reinsurance, the industry's losses are absorbed and distributed {{among a group of}} companies so that no single company is overburdened with the financial responsibility of offering coverage to its policyholders. Catastrophes, unexpected liabilities, and a series of large losses that might be too great for an individual insurer to absorb can be handled through reinsurance. Without it, most insurers would be able to cover only the safest of ventures, leaving many risky but worthwhile ventures without coverage. The authors present a primer of reinsurance concepts, explaining such terms as ceding company, primary carrier, direct underwriter, cession, retrocessions, ceding commission, and surplus relief reinsurance. There are separate sections on: 1) The purposes of reinsurance (for example, underwriting capacity, earnings stability, reserve requirement reduction, and mechanism for existing business), 2) Methods of cession for <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts</b> (treaty, facultative, and automatic facultative), 3) Types of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts</b> (proportional, nonproportional, hybrid, and retrocessions), 4) Prices and usage of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contracts,</b> 5) The economics of risk transfer, 6) The characteristics of reinsurance risk, 7) The reinsurance market and 8) Reinsurance regulation.

50|$|In {{catastrophe}} {{excess of}} loss, the cedant's retention {{is usually a}} multiple of the underlying policy limits, and the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contract</b> usually contains a two risk warranty (i.e. {{they are designed to}} protect the cedant against catastrophic events that involve more than one policy, usually very many policies). For example, an insurance company issues homeowners' policies with limits of up to $500,000 and then buys catastrophe reinsurance of $22,000,000 in excess of $3,000,000. In that case, the insurance company would only recover from reinsurers in the event of multiple policy losses in one event (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, flood).|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes {{insurance}} companies wish to offer insurance in jurisdictions {{where they are}} not licensed: for example, an insurer may wish to offer an insurance programme to a multinational company, to cover property and liability risks in many countries around the world. In such situations, the insurance company may find a local insurance company which is authorised in the relevant country, arrange for the local insurer to issue an insurance policy covering the risks in that country, and enter into a <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contract</b> with the local insurer to transfer the risks. In {{the event of a}} loss, the policyholder would claim against the local insurer under the local insurance policy, the local insurer would pay the claim and would claim reimbursement under the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contract.</b> Such an arrangement is called [...] "fronting". Fronting is also sometimes used where an insurance buyer requires its insurers to have a certain financial strength rating and the prospective insurer does not satisfy that requirement: the prospective insurer may be able to persuade another insurer, with the requisite credit rating, to provide the coverage to the insurance buyer, and to take out reinsurance in respect of the risk. An insurer which acts as a [...] "fronting insurer" [...] receives a fronting fee for this service to cover administration and the potential default of the reinsurer. The fronting insurer is taking a risk in such transactions, because it has an obligation to pay its insurance claims even if the reinsurer becomes insolvent and fails to reimburse the claims.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Risk hedging {{strategies}} {{are at the}} heart of financial risk management. As with many financial institutions, insurance companies try to hedge their risk against potentially large losses, such as those associated with natural catastrophes. Much of this hedging is facilitated by engaging in risk transfer contracts with the global reinsurance market. Devising an effective hedging strategy depends on careful data analysis and optimization. In this paper, we study from the perspective of an insurance company a <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>Contract</b> Optimization problem in which we are given a <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contract</b> consisting of a fixed number of contractual layers and a simulated set of expected loss distri-butions (one per layer), plus a model of reinsurance market costs. Our task is to identify optimal combinations of placements such that for a given expected return the associated risk value is minimized. The solution to this high-dimensional multi-objective data analysis and optimization problem is a Pareto frontier that quantifies the best available trade-offs between expected risk and returns. Our approach to this <b>reinsurance</b> <b>contract</b> optimization problem is to adapt the evolutionary heuristic search method called Population Based Incremental Learning, or PBIL, to work with discretized solution spaces. Our multi-threaded Discretized PBIL method (or DiPBIL) is able to solve larger “real world” problem instances than previous methods. For example, problems with a 5 % discretization and 7 or less contractual layers can be solved in less than 1 h: 20 m, while previously infeasible problems that would have taken weeks or even months to run with as many as 15 layers can be solved in less than a day...|$|E
