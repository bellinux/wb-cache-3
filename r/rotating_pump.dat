40|$|Abstract — Over {{the past}} few decades, {{we have seen a}} tremen-dous {{progress}} in the development of implantable ventricular assist devices (VAD). However, these devices are mainly devel-oped for adult patients. For the patients under age 5 who have chronic heart failures, physicians must resort to extracorporeal circulatory support devices which often result in infection, thromboembolism, or excessive blood transfusions. In this paper, we describe a design process for a pediatric ventricular assist device (PVAD). The central part of the device is a magnetically levitated <b>rotating</b> <b>pump</b> which creates a pressure rise (∼ 100 mmHg) at a required flow rate (∼ 0. 5 L/min) suitable for infants and small children. We have considered several different pump topologies, of which an axial mixed– flow pump configuration was chosen for further development. The pump impeller is supported by two radial permanent– magnet passive bearings. The rotor–dynamics analysis of the pump shows that the critical speeds of the pump are affected by the radial and yaw stiffnesses of the PM bearings. Hence, analytical expressions for the stiffnesses are derived and verified through FEA. In contrast to the radial suspension, the axial motion of the impeller is actively controlled using a voice– coil actuator. A toroidally–wound motor drives the pump with high efficiency and little additional negative radial stiffness. The design process relies heavily on optimization at the component– level and system–level. The preliminary results of the design optimization are presented in this paper. I...|$|E

The next section describes the pump operating and design characteristics, including information on the pump?s NPSH requirement and other standard pump performance data.

Although superficially the disc pump looks like a centrifugal unit, it has no impeller in the traditional sense, and uses instead a series of parallel, rotating discs, referred to in this paper as the ?disc assembly,? to generate the energy necessary to move product. The key difference between the disc assembly and a standard centrifugal pump impeller is that, with the disc assembly, the pumpage does not impinge on the <b>rotating</b> <b>pump</b> mechanism, so that it generates a pulsation-free, laminar flow pattern through the pump.

During the sluicing process, {{it is important to}} know the mass of the solids being transferred into AY- 102. One of the primary instruments used to measure solids transfer is an E+ densitometer located near the periphery of the tank at riser 15 S. This study was undert. dcen to assess how well a densitometer measurement could represent the total mass of soiids transferred if a uniform lateral distribution was assumed. The study evaluated the C- 1 06 slurry mixing and accumulation in Tank AY- 102 for the following five cases: Case 1 : 3 wt'% 0 slurry in 6. 4 -m AY- 102 waste Case 2 : 3 w-t% slurry in 4. 3 -m AY- 102 waste Case 3 : 30 wtYo slurry in 6. 4 -m AY- 102 waste Case 4 : 30 wt% slurry in 4. 3 -m AY- 102 waste Case 5 : 30 wt% slurry in 5.

40|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} wall rotating-driven flows is {{the tendency of}} fluid with high angular momentum to be flung radially outward. For a generator, the rotor rotating-driven flow, usually {{referred to as the}} <b>rotating</b> <b>pumping</b> flow, {{plays an important role in}} rotor winding cooling. In this study, three-dimensional numerical analyzes are presented for turbulent pumping flow in the inter-coil rotor cavity and short cooling grooves of a generator. Calculations of the flow field and the mass flux distribution through the grooves were carried out in a sequence of four related cases Under an isothermal condition: (a) pumping flow, which is the self-generated flow resulted from the rotor pumping action; (b) mixing flow, which is the combination of the ventilating flow and pumping flow, under a constant density condition; (c) mixing flow, with density modeled by the ideal gas law; and (d) mixing flow, with different pressure differentials applied on the system. The comparisons of the results from these cases can provide useful information regarding the impacts of the ventilating flow, gas density, and system pressure differential on the mass flux distribution in the short cooling grooves. Results show that the pumping effect is strong enough to generate the cooling flow for rotor winding cooling. Therefore, for small- or mid-size generators ventilation fans may be eliminated. It also suggests that increasing the chimney dimension can improve the distribution uniformity of mass flux through the cooling grooves...|$|R

40|$|Tank 40 {{simulation}} models with four submersible slurry pumps {{available for the}} CST suspension operations {{have been developed to}} provide operational guidance of slurry pumps for an efficient sludge removal. A series of the modeling calculations have been performed for key operational parameters such as pump operation mode, number of operating pumps, and to provide a recommendation for CST suspension and mixing operations in Tank 40. Reference design and operating conditions shown in Table 1 were used to perform the modeling analysis of the tank CST mixing. In the analysis, the pump was assumed to be stationary or rotating. Solid obstructions including the pump housing, the 14 inches riser, and 6. 75 -ft tank support column were included in the {{simulation models}}. Free surface motion of the tank liquid was neglected for high tank liquid level using the literature information. Steady-state and transient analyses with a two-equation turbulence model were performed with FLUENTTM. All analyses we re based on three-dimensional results. A suspension capability was evaluated assuming that local fluid velocity {{can be used as a}} measure of CST suspension and mixing. For a minimum suspension velocity of 1. 1 ft/sec for the largest CST size of 700 microns, the results indicated that at least two existing slurry mixers running at 3800 gpm flowrate per nozzle could keep CST solids suspended from the tank with a 200 in liquid level. In this case, the exception is for the fluid region with less than 20 wt contents of CST material. This is based on the conservative assumption that the largest CST size of 700 micron diameter remains unchanged neglecting a friable effect during the entire period of pump operations. The length of time that the CST material is exposed to the liquid stream lower than minimum suspension velocity is also important in affecting the ability of the liquid stream to suspend CST particle, and this effect is quantified in the present analysis by using the literature result s. The model results show that at least two pumps on opposite sides could keep suspending the CST material based on the slurry with 35 wt contents, but that at lower concentrations, particles larger than about 400 microns would tend to settle quickly and probably not remain in suspension long enough for the opposite jet to come around and stir that region of the tank. The main conclusions are as follows: The steady-state flow patterns on the horizontal discharge plane follow a series of parabolic curves similar to that of a free jet available in the literature. For the simulations, a series of the modeling calculations was performed with indexed stationary and <b>rotating</b> <b>pump</b> operations. The calculated results demonstrated that the existing slurry pumps running at 7600 gpm could suspend the CST particles from the tank with a 200 in liquid level, based on a minimum sludge suspension velocity of about 1. 1 ft/sec for 700 micron CST particle. The suspension distance for the transient model with pump rotations is smaller than that of the steady-state model with indexed pump orientations for given operating conditions. However, total suspension extents for the two modeling cases have about the same area...|$|E
