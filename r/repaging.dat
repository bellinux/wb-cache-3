40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{compared}} two independent models implemented {{to analyze the}} e ects of social information transmission. The rst of them, <b>Repage,</b> is centered on an articulated theory of social evaluations. The second system, that has been developed in NetLogo, follows the same speci cations of the <b>Repage</b> model but with several simpli cations. We implemented the second model to con rm {{the reliability of the}} most simple results that can be obtained with <b>Repage.</b> We model the spreading of information in a simple market with the presence of liars and the possibility of retaliation. We want to compare the use of the experience alone with the usage of image (agents believed evaluation of a target) to nd the good sellers. Both models give the same results in the di erent simulation sets. Image is shown to be preferable over experience only in particular situations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Since {{electronic}} and open environments became a reality, computational trust and reputation models have attracted increasing {{interest in the}} field of multi-agent systems (MAS). Some of them are based on cognitive theories of reputation that require cognitive agents to display all their potential. One of them is <b>Repage,</b> a computational system based on a cognitive theory of reputation that focuses on the study of two important concepts: Image and Reputation. The possible integration of these <b>Repage</b> predicates into a cognitive agent architecture, like the well-known Belief, Desire, Intention (BDI) approach implies the definition of these two con-cepts as mental states, as a set of beliefs. In this paper, we specify a belief logic that captures the necessary elements to express Image and Reputation and we study their interplay by analyzing a classical definition of trust on information sources...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>Repage,</b> a computational {{system that}} adopts a cognitive theory of reputation. We propose {{a fundamental difference}} between image and reputation, which suggests a way out from the paradox of sociality, i. e. the trade-off between agents' autonomy and their need to adapt to social environment. On one hand, agents are autonomous if they select partners based on their social evaluations (images). On the other, they need to update evaluations by taking into account others'. Hence, social evaluations must circulate and be represented as "reported evaluations" (reputation), before and in order for agents {{to decide whether to}} accept them or not. To represent this level of cognitive detail in artificial agents' design, {{there is a need for}} a specialised subsystem, which we are in the course of developing for the public domain. In the paper, after a short presentation of the cognitive theory of reputation and its motivations, we describe the implementation of <b>Repage.</b> Reputation, Agent Systems, Cognitive Design, Fuzzy Evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{trust and}} {{reputation}} {{models have been}} {{recognized as one of}} the key technologies required to design and implement agent systems. These models manage and aggregate the information needed by agents to efficiently perform partner selection in uncertain situations. For simple applications, a game theoretical approach similar to that used in most models can suffice. However, if we want to undertake problems found in socially complex virtual societies, we need more sophisticated trust and reputation systems. In this context, reputation-based decisions that agents make take on special relevance and can be as important as the reputation model itself. In this paper, we propose a possible integration of a cognitive reputation model, <b>Repage,</b> into a cognitive BDI agent. First, we specify a belief logic capable to capture the semantics of <b>Repage</b> information, which encodes probabilities. This logic is defined by means of a two first-order languages hierarchy, allowing the specification of axioms as first-order theories. The belief logic integrates the information coming from <b>Repage</b> in terms if image and reputation, and combines them, defining a typology of agents depending of such combination. We use this logic to build a complete graded BDI model specified as a multi-context system where beliefs, desires, intentions and plans interact among each other to perform a BDI reasoning. We conclude the paper with an example and a related work section that compares our approach with current state-of-the-art models. © 2010 The Author(s).

In this paper, a simulation-based exploration of the effect of false information on social evaluation formation is presented. We perform simulative experiments on the <b>RepAge</b> platform, a computational system allowing agents to communicate and acquire both direct (image) and indirect and unchecked (reputation) information. Informational cheating, when the number of liars becomes substantial, is shown to seriously affect quality achievement obtained through reputation.

One {{of the most important}} aspects of these models is how they deal with information received from other individuals.

In this article, we make an analysis of the current approaches of representation and aggregation of social evaluations under the guidelines of a set of basic requirements. Then we present two different proposals of dealing with uncertainty {{in the context of the}} <b>Repage</b> system [J. Sabater, M. Paolucci, R.

Developed within the domain of electronic auctions, reputation technol-ogy is being been imported into other applications, from social networks to institutional evaluation. Its impact on trust enforcement is uncontro-versial and its management is of primary concern for entrepreneurs and other economic operators. In the present paper, we will shortly report upon simulation-based stud-ies {{on the role of}} reputation as a more tolerant form of social capital than familiarity networks. Whereas the latter exclude non-trustworthy partners, reputation is a more inclusive mechanism upon which larger and more dynamic networks are constructed. After the presentation of the theory of reputation developed by the authors in the last decade, a computational system (<b>REPAGE)</b> for forming and exchanging reputation information will be presented and findings from experimental simulations recently run on this system will be resumed. Final remarks and ideas for future works will conclude the paper...|$|R

40|$|In an {{uncertain}} world, humans or artificial agents, {{to cope with}} uncertainty, need to communicate and share information {{to increase the number}} of their experiences, and consequently their possibility of success. The information shared by agents in a society can have different nature: accepted evaluations (Image) or reported voices (Reputation). In this work we model a simulative context where information acquisition is strongly affected by false information; in the experiments presented, performed on the <b>RepAge</b> Platform which is a computational module for the management of reputational information, agents can lie or report others’ lies. In this work we explore the effect of informational cheating under extreme setting, focusing to study from one hand, the effect of cheating on the quality achievement when the society is composed by a large amount of liars, and on the other hand, the beliefs formation and revision dynamics when the informational domain is not reliable. Information accuracy has effect on the market in relation with its trustworthiness; if social information is not reliable communication loses its importance...|$|R
5000|$|The idea of {{translating}} Herzog in {{a slightly}} condensed form occurred to John Henry Augustus Bomberger, a minister of the German Reformed Church, and then president of Ursinus College, Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and in 1856 he brought out in Philadelphia the first volume, whose title-page reads thus: The Protestant Theological and Ecclesiastical Encyclopedia: Being a Condensed Translation of Herzog’s Real Encyclopedia. With Additions from Other Sources. By Rev. J. H. A. Bomberger, D.D., Assisted by Distinguished Theologians of Various Denominations. Vol. I. Philadelphia: Lindsay & Blakiston, x 1856. In this work he associated with himself twelve persons, all but one ministers. In 1860 he issued the second volume. But the American Civil War breaking out the next year {{put a stop to}} so costly an enterprise and it was never resumed. The first volume included the article [...] "Concubinage", the second [...] "Josiah". It had been issued in numbers, of which the last was the twelfth.In 1877 Professor Philip Schaff (1819-93) was asked by Dr. Herzog himself to undertake an English reproduction of the second edition of his encyclopedia, and this work was fairly begun when, in the autumn of 1880, Clemens Petersen and Samuel Macauley Jackson were engaged to work daily on it in Dr. Schaff’s study in the Bible House, New York City. The next year Dr. Schaff’s son, the Rev. David Schley Schaff, later professor of church history in the Western Theological Seminary, Allegheny, Pa., joined the staff. The original publishers were S. S. Scranton & Company, Hartford, Conn., but a change was made before the issue of the first volume and the encyclopedia was issued by Funk & Wagnalls. The title-page read thus: A Religious Encyclopædia: or Dictionary of Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology. Based on the Real-Encyklopädie of Herzog, Plitt, and Hauck. Edited by Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., Professor in the Union Theological Seminary, New York. Associate editors: Rev. Samuel M. Jackson, M. A., and Rev. D. S. Schaff. Volume I. New York: Funk & Wagnalls, Publishers, 10 and 18 Dey Street. The first volume was issued Wednesday, November 1, 1882, the second Thursday, March 1, 1883, and the third Tuesday, March 4, 1884. Volume I. had pp. xix. 1-847; volume II. pp. xvii. 848-1714; and volume III. pp. xix. 1715-2631. In November, 1886, a revised edition was issued {{and at the same time}} the Encyclopedia of Living Divines and Christian Workers of All Denominations in Europe and America, Being a Supplement to Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. Edited by Rev. Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., and Rev. Samuel Macauley Jackson, M. A. New York: Funk & Wagnalls, Publishers, 18 and 20 Astor Place, 1887. In 1891 the third edition of the encyclopedia was issued and with it was incorporated the Encyclopedia of Living Divines, with an appendix, largely the work of Rev. George William Gilmore, bringing the biographical and literary notices down to December, 1890. The entire work was <b>repaged</b> sufficiently to make it one of four volumes of about equal size, and it is this four-volume edition which is known to the public as the Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia, the volumes being respectively of pp. xlviii. 679 and four pages unnumbered; 680-1378; 1379-2086; iv. 2087-2629, viii. 296. As the German work at its base was overtaken by the time [...] "S" [...] had been reached, the Schaff-Herzog from that letter on was based on the first edition of Herzog. Therefore, much of its matter is now very old. Yet it has been a useful work, and in 1903 its publishers determined on a new edition based on the third edition of Herzog which had been appearing since 1896. But inasmuch as there was a space of ten years between the beginnings of the two works, it has been necessary to bring the matter from the German down to date. This end has been accomplished by two courses: first by securing from the German contributors to Herzog condensations of their contributions, in which way matter contributed to the German work has in many instances been brought down to date, and second by calling on department editors for supplementary matter.|$|R
