If the business that bought the vehicle then rented it to someone, that individual would then have possession but would not have right of possession. The company renting the vehicle to them could repossess the vehicle, for example, if they hold the vehicle past the contract period. Also, if the rental company missed payments to the lienholder, the lienholder could repossess the vehicle from the person having possession as well.|$|E
50|$|A lien, {{also known}} as a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> may be a real {{security}} right which arises by operation of law, or it may be a personal right. Its purpose is to secure the repayment of money or labour that the lienholder has expended on the lienor’s movable or immovable property. It operates as a defence to the lienor’s rei vindicatio and entitles the lienholder to retain possession of the property until compensated for the expenditure incurred. It does not include the right to have the property sold in execution. In Singh v Santam, the court held that the lienholder must have been in physical possession of the property at the time he incurred the expense. (A lien differs from a tacit hypothec most obviously in this respect.) As soon as the lienholder’s claim has been paid, the lien terminates automatically; it is accessory to the principal debt.|$|E
40|$|The South African law {{acknowledges}} {{two types}} <b>of</b> liens or <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> namely enrichment liens and contractual liens (also known as debtor and creditor liens). Enrichment liens {{are regarded as}} limited real rights which are enforceable against {{the owner of the}} thing. Contractual liens are not regarded as limited real rights: sometimes they are referred to as personal rights which are enforceable only inter partes. Thus, a lien is classified as a right (subjektiewe reg) (ie a real right or a personal right). This article reflects on the correctness of this classification of liens. The term "right" can have various meanings and the aim {{of this article is to}} determine the exact meaning of the term "right" in the context of "right of retention". In my opinion a lien is not a right. I therefore reject the classification of liens into contractual liens and enrichment liens with its concomitant consequences. A lien is a defence against an ownerʹs rei vindicatio in that it allows a creditor (a lienholder) to retain control of the ownerʹs thing until the debt has been paid. Because the law grants a defence to a creditor in control of a thing, the owner cannot succeed with her rei vindicatio. A distinction should be drawn between an entitlement that flows from a right (it describes the content <b>of</b> the <b>right)</b> and a competency or capacity which emanates directly from the law. A lien is not an entitlement flowing from a lienholderʹs personal right - based on a contract or an enrichment claim - against the debtor. It is rather a capacity to withhold because the law grants this defence. The term "capacity" is not used in a technical sense but rather in the context of the ability to withhold, which is granted by the law...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{technological}} developments have brought {{into question the}} protection of personal data and individual privacy. This contribution focuses on the harmonisation of ‘data retention’ rules in the European Union (EU), in particular, the controversy surrounding the adoption and implementation <b>of</b> the Data <b>Retention</b> Directive (2006 / 24 /EC).

It then discusses challenges against domestic implementation legislation that have been initiated by NGOs. The analysis leads to the conclusion that harmonisation of the length of time that telecom operators and internet providers must retain data, along with other measures regarding the prosecution of crime, have not been met with success. These measures have rather generated uncertainty as to the form that data retention should take vis-à-vis the permissible degree of centralisation of power to the EU and the adoption of legislation that allows for abuses of retained data contrary {{to the rule of law}} and fundamental rights.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal design <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> in securitisation, {{in order to}} maximize welfare of screening per unit <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> assuming that screening is costly and that the bank intends to securitise its loans. In contrast to the focus of previous literature on tranche retention, we deviate from the constitutional mechanisms <b>of</b> tranche <b>retention</b> to present a pareto-optimal method <b>of</b> tranche <b>retention.</b> Unlike the current ad-hoc-regulations, we derive the optimal design <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> from a utility maximization problem. We show that the level <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> per tranche should be dependent on the rate of credit default, i. e. the higher the rate of default, the higher the optimal rate <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> required to provide an incentive to screen carefully. From this approach, it follows that the rate <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> per tranche should be higher, the higher the position within the ranking order of subordination. Accordingly, the efficiency <b>of</b> tranche <b>retention</b> can be enhanced, reducing the level <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> required to maintain a given level <b>of</b> screening-effort.

40|$|Text in AfrikaansTheft in South African law {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} common law crimes. It is also one of the crimes in respect of which opinions vary considerably. Furtum possessionis {{is one of the}} manifestations of the crime of theft at common law. The general requirements of furtum possessionis were already established in Roman law. Emphasis was not placed on the taker of the thing but on the particular position of the person who was deprived of the property. This approach was also followed in Roman-Dutch law. Fur tum possessionis in South African law can be defined as follows: It is the unlawful and intentional appropriation by the owner or someone else of a movable corporeal thing in commercio, in circumstances in which the possessor of the thing has a valid <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> of the thing, with the intention of depriving the possessor permanently of control of the thing. Theft in the form of furtum possessionis differs in an important respect from theft in the form of the removal of a thing. In the case of removal the complainant can also be a person acting as a holder, that is someone exercising control of the thing on behalf of the owner. In the case of furtum possessionis the complainant is the person with the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> and from whose possession the thing is taken away. The accused either possesses the thing as an owner or as a holder before possession of the thing was transferred to the complainant. Mere possession is not enough. The possession of the complainant has to be accompanied by a right to retention. Furthermore the possession of the thing has to be lawfulCriminal and Procedural LawLL. M.

Literature revealed the use <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> bond as the best solution to the problems <b>of</b> cash <b>retention.</b> Hence, the need to evaluate and compare the cost of ‘cash retention’ and ‘retention bond’ costs to the contractor. This study will assist in improving payment practice {{in the construction industry}} and also improves financial stability of the contractor. Data were collected from interim valuations of completed projects and subsequently analyzed using “compounding method” to evaluate the compound interest loss on cash retained by the client and the cost <b>of</b> providing <b>retention</b> bond in-lieu <b>of</b> cash <b>retention.</b> T-test analysis was further used to determine the level of significance of the difference between both costs.

Main objective of this thesis is to provide comprehensive look on the monetary satisfaction of the immaterial loss relating personality rights. Personality rights protection is a fundamental right, which is executed throughout legal environments of every democratic country. Czech Civil Code regulates personality rights protection in sections 11 to 16 and it grants four different types of the protection - the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> the right to restitution and the right to adequate satisfaction that can take both moral and monetary form. The monetary satisfaction is expressly regulated in section 13 paragraph 2 and it can be used only in cases when moral satisfaction is insufficient or the interference is so intense, it seriously affects person's dignity or honor. The expression of monetary satisfaction is pretty self-explanatory, but not only that it remedies the party that suffered, it should also prevent offenders from repeating their unlawful [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This Master Thesis {{deals with}} {{institute}} of monetary satisfaction {{as a legal}} tool {{for the protection of}} personality under civil law. The aim of this thesis is to give a comprehensive explanation of the Institute of monetary satisfaction. This work uses descriptive and analytical method.

The right of personality protection is a fundamental right of every individual that guarantees his or her dignified existence and free development in society. The Czech Republic provides a modern legal regime for the protection of personality since 1990, when the Civil Code has been amended. Protection of personality is regulated by the Civil Code in sections 11 to 16. In Section 13, the Civil Code expressly grants four types of civil tools for protection of personality - the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> the right to restitution and the right to adequate satisfaction that can take either moral or material form. In serious cases of violations of personality rights, the monetary satisfaction is the only sufficient and therefore effective and fair remedy for the immaterial injury on personality of affected person that has been caused by the unlawful interference into his or her personality.

40|$|Again and again, economists, {{corporate}} law scholars, and Congress {{have turned to}} reforms, such as executive compensation reforms, {{as a solution to}} executive misbehavior. The root of the evil, they muse, is skyhigh pay with only a flimsy connection to managerial performance. If CEO pay can only be rejiggered on the front end and tied to performance, the argument goes, executives can be expected to pursue shareholder interests and put aside egos, and firms will prosper. This Article argues that such reforms are, despite the best of intention, fool’s gold. The fallacy is not in thinking that CEOs and other executives who have abused their position and have {{failed to live up to}} expectations should be paid less—they should. However, this Article argues that when CEOs and other executives fail, they should be out of a job altogether. This Article goes on to describe how to create a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> by drawing the analogy to the public sphere. Specifically, one way to check CEO conduct is through periodic up-or down votes, the same kind of retention-style elections a plurality of states use to give voters a say in whether judges should be ousted. Importantly, in states that use them, retention elections have treaded lightly—they have created a monitoring device to hold in check the worse abuses without undermining the authority of public officials (governor and judicial nominating committees) from making their selections about whom should be appointed. Thus, I suggest that retention elections provide a useful path, after bad conduct occurs, to checking corporate executive abuses. Incidentally, as I have suggested in the past, this approach demonstrates that, once again, a solution from the public sphere might mitigate another long-standing problem in the private sphere—this time, CEO accountability. Finally, this Article proposes a new classification scheme for efforts to rein in CEO misbehavior and promote accountability. The expected success of efforts to rein corporate leadership abuses depends, crucially, on timing. Reforms have a higher chance of achieving their goals if the focus is on actual (or past) performance, not anticipated performance. Thus, this Article makes some initial claims about when to create prospective incentives for good behavior versus retrospective punishments for bad behavior...|$|E

Die stereotiepe benadering is gebaseer op die teenstelling Engels-Afrikaans, wat gedurende die 20 ste eeu die universiteite en gevolglik die paradigmas regeer het. Die doel van hierdie artikel is om die uitwerking van die stare decisis-leerstuk (Engelse reg) en die curia ius novit-reël (Europese siviele reg) op die Suid-Afrikaanse regsontwikkeling vas te stel. Vir hierdie doel is twee hofbeslissings ontleed ten aansien van hul keuse en toepassing van bronne, die eerste gegee gedurende die beginjare van die Kaapse hooggeregshof, en die ander gedurende die tagtigerjare van die 20 ste eeu. Albei sake het betrekking op die bankier-kliënt-verhouding en meer spesifiek die toepaslikheid van die exceptio doli in hierdie konteks. The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{ascertain}} the effect of the stare decisis doctrine of English law and the curia ius novit rule of European civil law on the development of South African law. For this purpose two decisions are analysed with regard to their choice and application of sources, the one given during the initial years of the Cape supreme court, and the other during the eighties of the 20 th century. The Charters of Justice of 1827 and 1832 reorganised the administration of justice in the Cape colony. An independent supreme court with professional judges was created and the laws of criminal and civil procedure were reformed. Absence of the curia ius novit rule frustrated the aspired assimilation of colonial law to British jurisprudence. This rule instructs the judge to find and apply the law ex officio, but in common law the English judge limits himself to the legal arguments raised by parties. Thus reception of Roman-Dutch law depended to a large extent on the legal practitioners in the Cape. The pre- 1828 advocates were all doctors of law who had studied in the Netherlands. The Charters of Justice did not introduce the binding force of precedent, but it has been generally accepted that from the earliest days of the Cape supreme court this doctrine constituted an essential element of South African common law.

In Brink’s Trustees v South African Bank the trustees of the insolvent Brink offered to pay the bank the amount of the secured debt in return for the transferred security. The bank refused this offer, maintaining that Brink’s other, unsecured, debts to the bank had to be repaid first. Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that Codex 8, 26, 1 granted the bank a jus retentionis against Brink himself until all other debts due by him to the bank had been paid. However, this <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> could not be exercised against his creditors after his insolvency, since the remedy to enforce the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> the exceptio doli mali, could not be pleaded against the other creditors of the insolvent debtor. Insolvency had divested the latter of his whole estate and vested it in the general body of the creditors, represented by the trustees. Counsel relied on Roman-Dutch law, European ius commune, colonial law, Scottish law, Anglo-American common law, and a Chancery decision. Counsel for the defendant relied more on Dutch and continental authors and maintained that Codex 8, 26, 1 granted the ius retentionis not only against the debtor himself, but also against all persons deriving any right from him or through him, except a secundus creditor hypothecarius. The court gave judgment for the plaintiffs and no grounds were reported, which provides an excellent example of Denis Cowen’s observation that while in form our law is largely judge-made, the work of the judge is often the work of intelligent selection, as in many instances judges simply put the stamp of the state’s authority on propositions which counsels have worked out for them in advance. In Bank of Lisbon and South Africa v De Ornelas the Ornelas Fishing Company paid off the overdraft and closed its account with the bank. The De Ornelas brothers demanded return of the securities provided, which the bank refused to do until the outcome of an action which the bank intended to institute against the company for damages resulting from alleged breach of contract. The court a quo upheld the application for the return of the furnished securities, against which judgment the bank appealed. For the bank it was argued that the application was based on the replicatio doli and that the exceptio doli did not exist anymore in modern law, which argument was founded on a long list of precedents. The respondents maintained that the bank was attempting to use the securities for a purpose not intended by the parties when the contracts were concluded. Such an attempt to abuse a right would constitute unconscionable conduct and result in gross injustice or great inequity. Again the argument was nearly exclusively based on case law. The fact that the Codex text remained unmentioned may be explained by the conclusion drawn by Chorus, namely that each time a text from the Corpus Iuris is used by a court in a precedent system, the text in question ceases to be a source of law as it has been replaced by the decision which serves as precedent. The citation of Brink’s Trustees can be explained only by the supposition that the 19 th century fell outside the scope of counsel’s concept of relevance. The question arises whether the absence of curia ius novit does prohibit independent judicial research. In the 1876 decision of Mills and Sons v Trustee of Benjamin Bros De Villiers DJ had attended counsels to the possible application of constitutum possessorium and given them the opportunity of handing in authorities on this point. In the Lisbon case Joubert JA limited himself to the legal question as determined by the parties, but undertook a thorough investigation into the origin, development, scope and applicability of the exceptio doli. The court decided on the basis of primary and secondary sources that the supersession of the formula procedure by the cognitio extraordinaria was the end of the exceptio doli as a technical term of pleading; that as the result of the new rule pacta sunt servanda and new principle that all contracts were regulated by good faith, the exceptio doli was never part of Roman-Dutch law. Joubert JA held that all sources deviating from this decision, such as Donellus, Brunneman, Zoesius, Tuldenus, Voet, Van der Keessel, Van der Linden et al. stated Roman law and not Roman-Dutch law. Finally, the court was of the opinion that the previous dicta of the appellate division relative to this defence were not binding. Thus the observation that once a Roman law or Roman-Dutch law text has been recepted by a court, such text is replaced by the decision which now serves as precedent has been proven correct in the Lisbon case where counsel deemed it superfluous to research outside precedent and outside a certain period. Another conclusion is that absence of the curia ius novit rule in common law does not prevent judicial research, although in the common law tradition such research is critically received as motivated by the desire to ignore precedent. The merits of the judgment in the Lisbon case are not discussed, but a concluding remark is made that judicial research involving reception or rejection of Roman law is increasingly unlikely in modern South African law since the Latin requirement for a law degree has been abolished.
