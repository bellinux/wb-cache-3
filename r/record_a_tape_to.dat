5000|$|Dan {{started singing}} {{at a young}} age, taking his first heavy metal and punk inspirations from Black Sabbath and The Police respectively. In 1983, {{at the age of}} 16 years he left home and went to live with a friend at Venice High, soon after Dan's friend cousin, Adam Siegel, moved in. Then Clements <b>recorded</b> <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> give it to Adam, and they started talking about forming a band. The group was called [...] "Chaotic Noise" [...] with Evan Warech on drums and some {{temporary}} bassists during 1984, they played a lot of shows around L.A. with different bands of the same scene like No Mercy, Suicidal Tendencies, Beowülf and Cryptic Slaughter. They became very good friends of all those musicians and adopted each other as early influences.|$|R
50|$|The {{son of an}} Israeli-British {{businessman}} and a folk singer, Broza was born in Haifa, Israel. He was raised and educated in England and Spain, where he was schooled at Runnymede College, in Madrid. Broza's grandfather, Wellesley Aron, co-founded the Arab-Israeli peace settlement, Neve Shalom - Wāħat as-Salām (The Oasis of Peace) and the Habonim youth movement. Young David Broza originally planned to become a graphic artist, and by age 17 he was selling his paintings in the Rastro, Madrid's Sunday flea market. Following high school, and while serving in the Israel Defense Forces, he began playing guitar in cafes to earn extra money. Eventually he was offered <b>a</b> <b>record</b> deal, but as he still hoped to attend the Rhode Island School of Design, he declined. He later <b>recorded</b> <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> promote his live shows.|$|R
50|$|After {{a number}} of years {{performing}} with local California bands and folk trios like Good Shepherd, Judge Rainbow and the Prophetic Trumpets, The Cardboard Scheme, and The Scarlet Staircase, Taylor formed Jubal's Last Band with Steve Baxter, Kenny Paxton, and Chuck Starnes in 1972. In 1974, the band <b>recorded</b> <b>a</b> demo <b>tape</b> together <b>to</b> shop around to record labels. Later that year, the band lost Paxton and Starnes, and added bassist Marty Dieckmeyer and guitarist Jerry Chamberlain to the line-up.|$|R
50|$|Huth and Claypool {{began playing}} together, {{along with a}} drum machine, in or around 1984, {{originally}} calling themselves Primate until about 1986 when they changed their band name to Primus. With the lineup of Huth, Claypool, and Lane, Primus became an underground sensation in and around San Francisco, prompting them <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>a</b> demo <b>tape,</b> Sausage, <b>to</b> distribute at their shows. Around 1989, however, with his wife expecting a child, Huth decided to leave Primus to dedicate time to his family. Huth was replaced by Larry LaLonde, {{an old friend of}} Claypool's who remains in the band to this day.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of digital transcription aids, musicians would slow down <b>a</b> <b>record</b> or <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recording</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to hear}} the melodic lines and chords at a slower, more digestible pace. The problem with this approach was that it also changed the pitches, so once a piece was transcribed, it would then have to be transposed into the correct key. Software designed to slow down the tempo of music without changing the pitch of the music can be very helpful for recognizing pitches, melodies, chords, rhythms and lyrics when transcribing music. However, unlike the slow-down effect of <b>a</b> <b>record</b> player, the pitch and original octave of the notes will stay the same, and not descend in pitch. This technology is simple enough that it is available in many free software applications.|$|R
2500|$|During 1994, Alchemist <b>recorded</b> <b>a</b> promotional <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> shop to <b>record</b> {{companies}} and <b>a</b> {{version of the}} Venom song [...] "Black Metal" [...] for a Swedish tribute album called The Promoters of the Third World War: A Tribute to Venom, now a collector's item. The band also began work on its next album, titled Lunasphere, which was released in 1995 by Melbourne label Shock Records through its subsidiary Thrust. Lunasphere showed a further development of Alchemist's unusual style, adding Eastern motifs and keyboards to its already diverse style. The track [...] "Garden of Eroticism" [...] {{was added to the}} Triple J compilation album This Is Twelve (ABC/EMI) in 1996 and both this song and [...] "Yoni Kunda" [...] remain live staples. The group supported the release of Lunasphere with a heavy touring schedule that included several shows with joint UK/Australian ambient act Deathless, a slot on the Sydney leg of the 1996 Big Day Out, supporting Cathedral and Paradise Lost on their dual headlining tour, and also opening for Fear Factory a second time. They performed live-to-air on the Triple J metal program Three Hours of Power. Two songs from this session would later be included on the Embryonics compilation album in 2005. During the same year, pioneering Canberra death metal band Armoured Angel disbanded. The band's drummer Joel Green handed over the running of the festival to Holder, who with the rest of Alchemist was responsible for the event for the next decade.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by Lee Hazlewood and Lester Sill. [...] Recorded at Audio Recorders in Phoenix and originally released on the tiny Ford record label in 1957 as by [...] "Duane Eddy and His Rock-A-Billies" [...] because Casey was under contract to Dot Records at the time. Casey is the lead guitarist on his song {{as well as the}} flip side, [...] "Caravan." [...] The plan was for Eddy to make his own recording of the song as the follow up to the hit [...] "Rebel-'Rouser" [...] in 1958. That same year, during a live appearance on the Dick Clark show, Clark asked Eddy if he had a short song to play over the credits {{at the end of the}} show as it ran faster than expected. Instead of playing a song that he had already recorded he decided to play [...] "Ramrod" [...] that he had been rehearsing while on the road, (with Casey playing bass.) The following week Jamie Records in Philadelphia was getting calls from it's distributors for copies of <b>a</b> <b>record</b> that had not been recorded. Eddy was still touring on the East Coast and there was not time to get back to Audio Recorders for a session. With pressure from Jamie <b>Records</b> for <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> make <b>records</b> from, Hazlewood (with Casey's approval) in Los Angeles, took the original Ford [...] "Ramrod" [...] master tape, sped it up slightly to add a saxophone solo, and yelps and claps by The Sharps as per usual and he made it slightly longer. Shortly thereafter Jamie was pressing [...] "Duane Eddy 'Ramrod'" [...] records with [...] "Rebel-'Rouser" [...] still high on the charts.|$|R
2500|$|Yamaguchi {{wrote the}} single's B-side [...] "Years" [...] to {{complement}} [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu", feeling personally that the single {{was like a}} double A-side. Yamaguchi wrote these two songs at {{during the same period}} in his life, as therapy for him after the earthquake. [...] "Years" [...] is similarly a love song, but instead of taking inspiration from everyday ideas, focused on messages reacting to the [...] "great anxiety" [...] in society during the post-earthquake time in Japan. Yamaguchi was inspired to write the lyrics while reading Twitter in a café. He noticed a great gap between what people on his Twitter were tweeting, primarily messages about the earthquake, and what the people who were in the café were talking about, their love lives and employment. The song was primarily arranged by Ejima, who aimed to create something [...] "beautiful". Iwadera's performance was <b>recorded</b> onto <b>a</b> cassette <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> alter the audio quality. As Yamaguchi felt that both songs were so similar conceptually, the band included both [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu" [...] and [...] "Years" [...] on Documentaly in the same order as they appear on the single.|$|R
5000|$|Siegel {{was born}} and raised in Venice, California. At the age of 13 years he bought a guitar, and went to live with his cousin for a few months. There he met Dan Clements, who was living with his cousin. Dan <b>recorded</b> <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> give to Adam and started talking about forming a band. The group was called [...] "Chaotic Noise" [...] with Evan Warech on drums and some {{temporary}} bassists during 1984, they played a lot of shows around L.A. with different bands of the same scene like No Mercy, Suicidal Tendencies, Beowülf and Cryptic Slaughter. They became very good friends of all those musicians and adopted each other as early influences. A few months later, Rickey Pallamino took over the four strings and Chaotic Noise recorded their first Demo. They also became close friends of a graffiti crew, Kings Stop at Nothing, specially with a boy called Shaun Ross, Adam and Dan learned to paint with him and included the graffiti in the style of the band. When Pallamino left Chaotic Noise, there was no one better than Shaun to replace him, then they changed their name to Excel, name that was created by Shaun Ross when he was in Kings Stop at Nothing.A few weeks later a new drummer joined the group: Greg Saenz. They recorded 3 more demos between 1985 and 1986 (Sonic Decapitation, Personal Onslaught and Refuse to Quit), editing their first studio album, Split Image in 1987 (the recording was paid by Mike Muir and distribution was conducted by Caroline Records), the second one, The Joke's on You in 1989, and a tour in Netherlands the same year with that line-up. In 1990 Siegel left Excel to join (as lead guitarist) the Suicidal Tendencies side project, Infectious Grooves to record their first studio album: The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move...It's the Infectious Grooves. In 1992 he came back to Excel to record their fifth and final demo: Third album demos. The May 22 he appeared in the movie Encino Man with the Infectious Grooves. Then he definitely left Excel to form his own power trio (called My Head) with Greg Saenz on drums, the former Bad Radio member Dave Silva on bass and himself on guitar and lead vocals. However, this project was interrupted for Adam's participation in the second studio release by Infectious Grooves, Sarsippius' Ark, released on February, 1993, and again in 1994 for their following album, Groove Family Cyco. On January 16, 1996 Siegel recorded various tracks for the first Mike Muir solo album: Lost My Brain! (Once Again). Then My Head signed <b>a</b> <b>record</b> contract with Capitol Records and released their first and only album Endless Bummer, the song [...] "Humbucker" [...] became their only single and music video. The sound of this album left the heavy metal music that Siegel had been playing earlier in Excel and Infectious Grooves to approach to styles more similar to alternative rock and grunge. The band broke up the January 1, 1998. Later that year, Siegel became the Eels bassist (this was the first time he played the bass on a group). The song [...] "Souljacker part I", performed with Siegel was included in the album Souljacker in 2001 and a live version in the live album Electro-Shock Blues Show, released in 2002. A few months later he created the band Eagle (who would become [...] "The Blondes" [...] in 2000) with Bill Dusha (ex-Sacred Hearts and Sexy Death Soda) on guitar and vocals, Jimmy James (ex-Coma-Tones and The mansons) on bass, Autumn de Wilde (also graphic designer and art director; her photography and paintings have been used for releases by Beachwood Sparks, Beck, Neal Casal, Eels, Lilys, Elliott Smith, and other artists) on keyboards and back vocals, Byron Maiden (ex-Possum Dixon and the Liquor Giants) on drums and himself on lead guitar and vocals. They did some shows around L.A. and suffered several line-up changes. In 2000 he returned for fourth and last time to Infectious Grooves to record their fourth studio album: Mas Borracho released the August 29.|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, he {{experienced}} tragedy {{when his mother}} died. Four years after her death, he <b>recorded</b> <b>a</b> <b>tape</b> that led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> deal with Divine Mill <b>Records</b> (<b>a</b> division of Warner Bros. Records). Hoagland received good reactions from two singles [...] "Could It Be" [...] and [...] "Lil' Nigga Ain't Mine" [...] on BET video shows. Appearing with Hoagland on his first album was RL (from Next), Blackstreet, and Darren and Cliff Lighty. His second album, Still Ghetto, was released on November 5, 2002. Another Top Ten hit, it placed two singles in the Top 40, [...] "Fabulous" [...] and [...] "Anything" [...] (released November 13, 2001). Ghetto Classics followed in early 2006 and became his first number one album. In 2007 Jaheim signed to Atlantic Records and released his fourth album The Makings of a Man in December 2007. In late 2009 the single [...] "Ain't Leavin Without You" [...] preceded his 2010 album Another Round. In 2013 Jaheim returned to the music industry with a new single titled, [...] "Age Ain't a Factor" [...] and new album. His sixth album Appreciation Day was released in September 3, 2013. In 2014, Jaheim restarted his own label called [...] "Julie's Dream Music Group", which had first been started in 1997, then restarted in 2002. Following the relaunch of his new label, in February 2015, Jaheim signed <b>a</b> new <b>record</b> deal with BMG Records after parting ways with Atlantic Records in conjunction with his Julie's Dream label.

Struggle Love was released on March 18, 2016. To date Jaheim has sold 5 million records worldwide along with 3 Grammy nominations.|$|R
40|$|Adherence to HIV/AIDS therapies {{has been}} an {{important}} health problem since the early 1980 s when AZT was first prescribed as a therapy for HIV/AIDS. It became particularly important between 1995 and 1997 with the advent of protease inhibitors (Chesney, Ickovics, Hecht, Sikipa, 2 ̆ 6 Rabkin J., 1999) and became even more significant as persons with HIV/AIDS began to develop resistance to medications. Low-literacy populations have poorer health (Brez 2 ̆ 6 Taylor, 1997) and higher AIDS rates (Simon, Hu, Diaz, 2 ̆ 6 Kerndt, 1995), than their higher literacy counterparts due to delayed treatment (Baker, Parker, Williams, Clark, 2 ̆ 6 Nurss, 1997), shame of literacy skills (Parikh, 1996), and poor access to care (Williams, et al., 1995). Poorer health and higher AIDS rates can also be attributed to poor patient-provider relationships (Crespo-Fierro, 1997; Eldred, Wu, Chaisson, 2 ̆ 6 Moore, 1998) to a poorer understanding of medical protocols (Murphy, 1997), and inadequate patient education (Ungvarski, 1997; Davis, Michielutte, Askov, Williams, 2 ̆ 6 Weiss, 1998, Doak, Doak, 2 ̆ 6 Root, 1996). ^ The ALP intervention was developed for HIV positive low-literacy populations of African American women in Houston, Texas. The intervention was based on a needs assessment, using the PRECEDE model, an innovative process referred to as Intervention Mapping, and validated using formative evaluation methods with 54 individuals. The needs assessment resulted in a list of behavioral, environmental, predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing determinants of adherence. The Intervention Mapping framework was used to refine these determinants and develop a list of objectives describing what must be learned or changed to for the target population to adhere to HIV/AIDS therapies. Methods and strategies, were developed using theoretical constructs from the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1974) and Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986). These theories, empirical evidence, and information from the target population indicated that perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, outcome expectations, and self-efficacy were important and changeable determinants of adherence to HIV/AIDS therapies for this population. ^ These components were brought together {{in the form of a}} theory-based color cartoon book and 10 -minute cassette tape. The book was developed for people with 2. 9 years of U. S. education as measured with the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level method and the script was <b>recorded</b> onto <b>a</b> cassette <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> make it suitable for populations with even lower-literacy skills. A formative evaluation was conducted to ensure that the content and structure were accurate, clear, realistic, readable, appropriate, and likely to be used as intended. ...|$|R
