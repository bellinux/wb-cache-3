5|$|With {{its recent}} {{economic}} reforms, the People's Republic of China {{has become the}} world's largest silk producer. In 1996 it produced 58,000 tonnes out of a world production of 81,000, followed by India at 13,000 tonnes. Japanese production is now marginal, at only 2500 tonnes. Between 1995 and 1997 Chinese silk production went down 40% {{in an effort to}} <b>raise</b> <b>prices,</b> reminiscent of earlier shortages.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{raised its}} prices for coal haulage. All coal hauled on the Tramway needed {{to pass along}} the A from Verney Junction or Aylesbury and Jones had to <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> to cover the {{surcharge}} or keep prices stable despite the loss of profits. Road-hauled coal from Bicester was already undercutting the Tramway and the unreliable engines had given the Tramway a poor reputation. Jones kept prices fixed and absorb the increased costs, wrecking the Tramway's already declining business.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this increasing competition, natural ice companies examined various options. Some invested in plant ice themselves. New tools were brought in {{to speed up the}} harvesting of ice, but these efficiency improvements were outstripped by technical advances in plant ice manufacture. The Natural Ice Association of America was formed to promote the benefits of natural ice, and companies played on the erroneous belief amongst customers that natural ice melted less slowly than manufactured ice. Under pressure, some ice companies attempted to exploit their local monopolies on ice distribution networks to artificially <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> for urban customers. One of the most prominent cases of this involved Charles Morse and his American Ice Company, which suddenly almost tripled wholesale and doubled the retail prices in New York in 1900 {{in the midst of a}} heat wave; this created a scandal that caused Morse to sell up his assets in the ice trade altogether to escape prosecution, making a profit of $12 million ($320 million) in the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Sunkist v. Sunkist and Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills, the court created a long-standing {{precedent}} in their decision {{making it possible for}} different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products. In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive. After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business. Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, usually to end worker strikes.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an economy would be expected only to <b>raise</b> <b>prices,</b> not to create more goods.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} remembered {{that in the early}} part of the 20th century matches were a {{necessity}} for smoking and the lighting of stoves and gas appliances among other uses and therefore demand for them was highly inelastic, meaning that a monopolist could <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> (and hence profits) significantly without much affecting the quantity sold.|$|E
5000|$|Market {{power is}} the ability to <b>raise</b> <b>price</b> above {{marginal}} cost and earn a positive profit.

25|$|The most {{dramatic}} immediate action was to eliminate price controls for private-sector products and to <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> of public-sector products to restore financial balance for public firms.

During the Revolutionary War, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> dramatically; this was also due to the reduced availability of tea from British merchants, and a general resolution among many Americans to avoid drinking tea following the 1773 Boston Tea Party.|$|E

25|$|On one side, {{consumer}} devices can bid for power {{based on how}} much {{the owner of the}} device were willing to pay, set ahead of time by the consumer. On the other side, suppliers can enter bids automatically from their electricity generators, based on how much it would cost to start up and run the generators. Further, the electricity suppliers could perform real-time market analysis to determine return-on-investment for optimizing profitability or reducing end-user cost of goods. The effects of a competitive retail electricity market are mixed across states, but generally appear to lower prices in states with high participation and <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> in states that have little customer participation.|$|E

They attacked Miller {{as trying to}} push the plan through without input from the Port Authority. The Port Authority wanted a system of inland terminals and belt-line railroads. According to Port Authority Chairman Julian Gregory, it was almost certain that NYCRR would not {{go along with the}} Port Authority plan. It was also believed that giving NYCRR elevated tracks on the west side would allow the railroad to monopolize freight and <b>raise</b> <b>prices.</b> The Port Authority believed it was primarily a freight problem, but NYCRR and New York City considered it to be a grade-crossing elimination project.|$|E
25|$|As {{economic}} difficulties worsened, Iowa farmers sought to find local solutions. Faced with extremely low farm prices, including corn at ten cents a bushel and pork at three cents a pound, some farmers in western Iowa formed the Farmers Holiday Association. This group, {{which had its}} greatest strength {{in the area around}} Sioux City, tried to withhold farm products from markets. They believed this practice would force up farm prices. The Farm Holiday Association had only limited success as many farmers did not cooperate and the withholding itself did little to <b>raise</b> <b>prices.</b> Farmers experienced little relief until 1933 when the federal government, as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, created a federal farm aid program.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the primary}} {{concerns}} was the price of coffee, Colombia's largest export and {{the main source of}} its foreign exchange. The American Office of Price Administration (OPA) attempted to have the maximum price of coffee frozen at the level existing on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, Colombia objected on the basis that the cost of producing and transporting coffee had increased due to wartime conditions, and, if the price was not adjusted to factor in these conditions, the economy would decline. The OPA relented, and agreed to <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> immediately and to adjust them in the future based on increased production and transportation costs.|$|E
25|$|After STW-9 {{entered the}} market, a 'cartel' was formed {{between the two}} {{stations}} for the duty of buying from both Australian and overseas production sources. The two stations set up a separate company, TV Facilities, (50%/50% partners). This allowed the stations to purchase programs cheaper than if they were two separate entities, which would bid on shows and subsequently <b>raise</b> <b>prices.</b> This partnership was disliked by Eastern States stations who could not increase their charges to the extent which they would have liked. Allocation of programs was decided by a coin toss, which would allow the winner to pick first and then alternate the picking of programs. However TVW would always be in a more dominant position as it had the rights to continuing shows from the previous six years as well as half of the new programs.|$|E
25|$|Falling {{sales and}} market share have {{resulted}} in the Big Three's plants operating below capacity (GM's plants were at 85% in November 2005, well below the plants of its Asian competitors), leading to production cuts, plant closures and layoffs. They have been relying heavily on considerable incentives and subsidized leases to sell vehicles. which was crucial to keeping the plants running, which in turn drove {{a significant portion of the}} Michigan economy. These promotional strategies, including rebates, employee pricing and 0% financing, have boosted sales but have also cut into profits. More importantly such promotions drain the automaker's cash reserves in the near term while in the long run the company suffers the stigma of selling vehicles because of low price instead of technical merit. Automakers have since been trying to scale back on incentives and <b>raise</b> <b>prices,</b> while cutting production. The subprime mortgage crisis and high oil prices in 2008 resulting in the plummeting popularity of best-selling trucks and SUVs, perhaps forcing automakers to continue offering heavy incentives to help clear excess inventory.|$|E
