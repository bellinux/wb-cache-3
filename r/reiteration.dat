A year later, {{a section of the}} highway became paved in northwest Warren County, and its southern terminus was realigned to north of Vicksburg by 1958. The terminus continued to shift north to parallel the Yazoo River the next two years, ending near Redwood. The southern half of the route was fully paved by 1964, and the northern by 1984. The route has not changed significantly since. The route was proposed {{to be part of the}} Great River Road, but it was not included in the most recent <b>reiteration</b> of the route.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet attempts, {{which started}} after 1924 and were fully {{implemented}} after 1940, to strongly emphasize the local Moldovan identity and {{transform it into}} a separate ethnicity, {{as well as its}} <b>reiteration</b> in the post-independence Moldovan politics, especially during the Communist government (2001–2009), {{is often referred to as}} Moldovanism. The Moldovanist position refutes the purported Romanian-Moldovan ethnic identity, and also at times the existence of a common language. US historian James Stuart Olson, in his book – An Ethnohistorical dictionary of the Russian and Soviet empires – considers that Moldovans and Romanians are so closely related to the Romanian language, ethnicity and historical development that they can be considered one and the same people.|$|E
25|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} one of the nine codon <b>reiteration</b> {{disorders}} caused by polyglutamine expansion mutations that include spino-cerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1, 2, 6, 7 and 3, spinobulbar muscular atrophy and dentatorubal-pallidoluysianatrophy. There may be a link between diseases caused by polyglutamine and polyalanine expansion mutations, as frame shifting of the original SCA3 gene product encoding CAG/polyglutamines to GCA/polyalanines. Ribosomal slippage during translation of the SCA3 protein has been proposed as the mechanism resulting in shifting from the polyglutamine to the polyalanine-encoding frame. A dinucleotide deletion or single nucleotide insertion within the polyglutamine tract of huntingtin exon 1 would shift the CAG, polyglutamineen coding frame by +1 (+1 frame shift) to the GCA, polyalanine-encoding frame and introduce a novel epitope to the C terminus of Htt exon 1 (APAAAPAATRPGCG).|$|E

40|$|Site-specific {{proteolysis}} is {{an important}} biological mechanism for the regulation of cellular processes such as gene expression, cell signaling, development, and apoptosis. In transcriptional regulation, specific proteolysis regulates the localization and activity of many regulatory factors. The C 1 factor (HCF), a cellular transcription factor and coactivator, undergoes site-specific proteolytic processing at a series of unusual amino acid <b>reiterations</b> to generate a family of amino- and carboxyl-terminal polypeptides that remain tightly associated. Expression and purification of bacterially expressed domains of the C 1 factor identifies an autocatalytic activity {{that is responsible for}} the specific cleavage of the <b>reiterations.</b> In addition, coexpression of the autocatalytic domain with a heterologous protein containing a target cleavage site demonstrates that the C 1 protease may also function in trans...|$|R
25|$|Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced {{throughout}} the Muslim {{world in a}} non-codified form, with the Ottoman Empire's Mecelle code in the 19th century being a first attempt at codifying elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions. In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as {{the religion of the}} state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia. Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law. Iran has also witnessed a <b>reiteration</b> of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979. During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of Islamic resurgence has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected world politics.|$|E
25|$|Like {{elsewhere}} in the world, spikes in anti-Americanism in the region correlate with the adoption or <b>reiteration</b> of certain policies by the U.S. government, in special its support for Israel in the occupation of Palestine and the Iraq War. In regards to 9/11, a Gallup poll noted, for example, that while most (93%) Muslims polled opposed the attack, 7% of them (called 'radicals' in the survey) supported it, citing in their favor, not religious view points, but disgust at U.S. policies. In effect, when targeting U.S. or other Western assets in the region, radical armed groups in the Middle East, Al-Qaeda included, have made reference to U.S. policies and alleged crimes against humanity to justify their attacks. For example, to explain the Khobar Towers bombing (in which 19 American airmen were killed), Bin Laden, although proven to have not committed the attack, named U.S. support for Israel in instances of attacks against Muslims, such as the Sabra and Shatila massacre and the Qana massacre, as the reasons behind the attack.|$|E

40|$|A {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of}} the Rhizobium genome is the frequent finding of reiterated sequences, which often constitute multigene families. Interestingly, these families usually maintain {{a high degree of}} nucleotide sequence identity. It is commonly assumed that apparent gene conversion between reiterated elements might lead to concerted variation among members of a multigene family. However, the operation of this mechanism has not yet been demonstrated in the Rhizobiaceae. In this work, we employed different genetic constructions to address the role of apparent gene conversion as a homogenizing mechanism between members of the plasmid-located nitrogenase multigene family in Rhizobium etli. Our results show that a 28 -bp insertion into one of the nitrogenase <b>reiterations</b> can be corrected by multiple recombination events, including apparent gene conversion. The correction process was dependent on the presence of both a wild-type recA gene and wild-type copies of the nitrogenase <b>reiterations.</b> Frequencies of apparent gene conversion to the wild-type nitrogenase <b>reiterations</b> were the same when the insertion to be corrected was located either in cis or in trans, indicating that this event frequently occurs through intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, a high frequency of multiple crossovers was observed, suggesting that these large plasmid molecules are engaging repeatedly in recombination events, in a situation akin to phage recombination or recombination among small, high-copy number plasmids...|$|R

40|$|The thesis Med Lenin på byrån (With Lenin on the drawer) studies {{magazines}} {{produced by}} the Swedish communist movement during the inter-war years and has two aims; firstly to determine if (and how) class-norms were constructed through descriptions of gender and sexuality, and secondly if (and how) norms regarding gender and sexuality were constructed through descriptions of class. One of the underlying motivations has been to highlight {{a different approach to}} labour history than those commonly used in Sweden to date. The study differs from earlier Swedish labour historical traditions in its use of a methodological apparatus derived from Judith Butlers theories on how the subject is brought into being by performative <b>reiterations</b> of norms. The method choice has steered the study towards fictional material; a material that is well adapted for exploring how <b>reiterations</b> of norms through described subjectivations enables some subject positions and which consequently makes other impossible. It is possible, based on the research underpinning this thesis, to identify the type of subject position that the communist press enabled through <b>reiterations</b> of norms regarding class, gender and sexuality. The working class subjects that the short stories and articles described were men who worked in manual labour and women that either worked in service jobs or were housewives; both genders were class-conscious communists but working under different conditions.

500|$|Thomas de Rossy was {{a theologian}} and known as such, though his extant {{writings}} {{are dominated by}} political invective. He authored two extant tractates and probably at least two others not extant. His Quaestio de Conceptione Virginis Immaculatae was a <b>reiteration</b> {{of some of the}} arguments for the Immaculate Conception made by Duns Scotus.

500|$|Washington's {{third and}} most {{important}} role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, the representative man of the Revolution.

Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant <b>reiteration</b> that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as erratic militias.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the impact of analysts' {{recommendation}} downgrades, upgrades, and <b>reiterations</b> on German stock returns and as to whether prof- itable investment strategies could potentially be designed around these recommendations. The paper provides a unique detailed descriptive analysis of financial analysts' recommendations changes on German stock market over the last decade. First, we show that changes in recommendations yield significant positive (negative) abnormal gross returns for upgrades (downgrades), respectively. <b>Reiterations,</b> on the other hand, do not cause statistically significant stock market reactions. We show, that stock price reactions following recommendation revisions are strongest at the announcement day and last up to six months for upgrades and four month for downgrades. A bulk of market reactions, appears on the recommendation event date and shortly before so that investors must trade in a timely manner to profit from analyst recommendations. A one-day delayed reaction to the change in recommendations do not allow for significant abnormal returns for most of the recommendation shifts...|$|R
