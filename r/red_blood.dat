5|$|The chronically low oxygen {{levels in}} the blood also lead to {{increased}} release of erythropoietin and the activation of erythropoeisis, the production of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells. This results in polycythemia, abnormally increased numbers of circulating <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells and an elevated hematocrit.|$|E
5|$|Within the <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells, the parasites {{multiply}} further, again asexually, periodically {{breaking out}} of their host cells to invade fresh <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|Blood film {{examination}} {{may reveal}} basophilic stippling of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells (dots in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells visible through a microscope), {{as well as}} the changes normally associated with iron-deficiency anemia (microcytosis and hypochromasia). However, basophilic stippling is also seen in unrelated conditions, such as megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 (colbalamin) and folate deficiencies.|$|E

In at least one case, the gangs aligned because they share the same gang color (<b>red).</b> <b>Bloods</b> and Juggalos have also collaborated to commit drive-by shootings.|$|R

40|$|The {{changes of}} <b>red</b> and white <b>blood</b> cells counts in intact and {{castrated}} rats with hyperthyroidism were analysed. A total of 108 five-month-old female Wistar rats, {{divided into four}} groups, were used as following: euthyroid castrated, euthyroid intact, hyperthyroid castrated and hyperthyroid intact. Nine animals of each group were killed at 30, 60 and 90 days to evaluate the <b>red</b> and white <b>blood</b> cells counts. The conclusion was that castration or hyperthyroidism did not affect both the <b>red</b> and white <b>blood</b> cells...|$|R
5|$|Most {{eukaryotic}} cell types {{usually have a}} single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells, or from faulty cell division.|$|E
5|$|Rh factor, {{also known}} as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells; {{individuals}} that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother's system. In {{the case of an}} Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.|$|E

5|$|After a {{potential}} dormant {{period in the}} liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle. The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
