5|$|During matches, wrestlers have {{a health}} meter that drains as they perform special moves, and {{gradually}} refills {{when they are}} not attacking. Different moves use up different amounts of energy, and certain characters can win any match by repeatedly using a particularly damaging move that does not <b>require</b> <b>much</b> energy. Several different power-ups are also available in the game, including a donut that increases speed, bowling pins that can be used as clubs, and bubble gum that slows players down.|$|E
5|$|Mass loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models <b>require</b> <b>much</b> higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not <b>require</b> <b>much</b> water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E

Also, AF <b>requires</b> <b>much</b> less computing power as no decoding or quantizing operation is performed at the relay side.|$|R
5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs <b>require</b> <b>much</b> less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October, Bazaine's {{infantry}} conducted reconnaissance toward Kherson and met no organized resistance before withdrawing. After {{they returned}} to Kinburn, the French and British commanders determined that the fort could be rebuilt and held through the upcoming winter. A force of 1,700 men was left behind to garrison the position, along with the three ironclad batteries. The rest of the force returned to the Crimea. Though the British had initially considered continuing up the Dneiper to capture Nikolaev, it became clear after the seizure of Kinburn that {{to do so would}} <b>require</b> <b>much</b> larger numbers of soldiers to clear the cliffs that dominated the river than had been originally estimated. The British planned to eventually launch an offensive to take Nikolaev in 1856, but the war ended before it could be begun.|$|E

25|$|Spacecraft {{propulsion}} systems are often first statically tested on Earth's surface, within the atmosphere but many systems require a vacuum chamber to test fully.

25|$|Most radial engines use {{overhead}} poppet valves {{driven by}} pushrods and lifters on a cam plate which is concentric with the crankshaft, {{with a few}} smaller radials, like the Kinner B-5 and Russian Shvetsov M-11, using individual camshafts within the crankcase for each cylinder. A few engines use sleeve valves such as the 14-cylinder Bristol Hercules and the 18-cylinder Bristol Centaurus, which are quieter and smoother running but <b>require</b> <b>much</b> tighter manufacturing tolerances.|$|E

25|$|An {{additional}} {{reason for}} waving the four species {{in all directions}} alludes {{to the fact that}} all these species <b>require</b> <b>much</b> water to grow. The lulav (date palm) grows in watered valleys, hadass and aravah grow near water sources, and the etrog requires more water than other fruit trees. By taking these particular species and waving them in all directions, the Jew symbolically voices a prayer for abundant rainfall for all the vegetation of the earth in the coming year.|$|E
25|$|Because the Moke's A-Series engine, {{manual gearbox}} and {{suspension}} are {{identical to those}} of a standard Mini (which was still in production up to October 2000), most spare parts are still readily available.

25|$|Bicycle {{lighting}} is illumination attached to bicycles whose purpose above all is, along with reflectors, {{to improve the}} visibility of the bicycle and its rider to other road users under circumstances of poor ambient illumination. A secondary purpose is to illuminate reflective materials such as cat's eyes and traffic signs. A third purpose may be to illuminate the roadway so that the rider can see the way ahead. Serving the latter purposes <b>require</b> <b>much</b> more luminous flux and thus more power.|$|E
25|$|Unlike dingoes other feral {{domestic}} {{dogs and}} dingo-hybrids are theoretically capable two come in heat twice annually {{and tend to}} have a breeding cycle less influenced by the seasons. However, it is considered to be unlikely that they are capable of rearing two litters per year in the wild since this would <b>require</b> <b>much</b> time and energy. Successful rearing of two successive litters would probably only be possible in the wild under very favourable conditions and there is currently no proof that it ever happened in the wild.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the first calculators {{appeared}} with field-effect, twisted nematic (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them {{to cut out}} damaging ultraviolet rays. The advantage of LCDs {{is that they are}} passive light modulators reflecting light, which <b>require</b> <b>much</b> less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the Casio Mini Card LC-78 of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.|$|E
