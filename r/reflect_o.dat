If so much of your old mortal weakness clings to you yet as to make you feel aggrieved (it was the note of your earthly voice, Almayer), then, I entreat you, seek speech without delay with our sublime fellow-Shade--with him who, in his transient existence as a poet, commented upon the smell of the rose. He will comfort you. You came to me stripped of all prestige by men's queer smiles and the disrespectful chatter of every vagrant trader in the Islands. Your name was the common property of the winds: it, as it were, floated naked over the waters about the Equator. I wrapped round its unhonoured form the royal mantle of the tropics and have essayed to put into the hollow sound the very anguish of paternity--feats which you did not demand from me--but remember that all the toil and all the pain were mine. In your earthly life you haunted me, Almayer. Consider that this was taking a great liberty. Since you were always complaining of being lost to the world, you should remember that if I had not believed enough in your existence to let you haunt my rooms in Bessborough Gardens, you would have been much more lost. You affirm that had I been capable of looking at you with a more perfect detachment and a greater simplicity, I might have perceived better the inward marvellousness which, you insist, attended your career upon that tiny pin-point of light, hardly visible far, far below us, where both our graves lie. No doubt! But <b>reflect,</b> <b>O</b> complaining Shade! that this was not so much my fault as your crowning misfortune. I believed in you in the only way it was possible for me to believe. It was not worthy of your merits? So be it. But you were always an unlucky man, Almayer. Nothing was ever quite worthy of you. What made you so real to me was that you held this lofty theory with some force of conviction and with an admirable consistency." ...|$|E

Pellegrino[1] affirms that health care professionals (HCPs), like all professionals, possess a special body of knowledge, practise within an ethical framework and commit to the fulfilment of a broad societal need. Since professionalism is a contract between the professional and society, serious ethical obligations are linked to the ideal of a profession. [1, 2] Faculties of health sciences at South African (SA) universities have made a collective effort to commit to professionalism, by instilling the qualities, attitudes and values of a ‘fivestar doctor’[3] in students.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} light {{scattering}} by a particle {{on or near}} a surface is treated using the eld decomposition method and the free-eld T-matrix method. The model takes into account that the incident eld strikes the particle either directly or after interacting with the surface, while the elds emanating from the particle may also <b>reflect</b> <b>o</b> the surface and interact with the particle again. The reflection of the scattered and incident elds are determined {{in the context of}} a T-operator formalism which enables us to compute scattering by innite surfaces. The solution for a plane interface is obtained as a special case of this general formalism. An approximate solution is also given by assuming that the scattered eld, reflecting o the surface and interacting with the particle, is incident upon the surface at near-normal incidence. The range of validity of the approximate and rigorous method is checked from a numerical point of view. ...|$|E

40|$|Developing {{systems that}} {{learn how to}} perform complex tasks {{presents}} a significant challenge to the artificial intelligence community. As the knowledge to be learned becomes complex, with diverse procedural constructs and uncertainties to be validated, the system needs to integrate {{a wide range of}} learning and reasoning methods with different focuses and strengths. For example, one learning method may be used to generalize from user demonstrations, another to learn by practice and exploration, and another to test hypotheses with experiments. The POIROT system pursues such a multistrategy learning methodology that employs multiple integrated learners and knowledge validation modules to acquire complex process knowledge for a medical logistics domain (Burstein et al., 2008). For a learning system of such complexity, activities of participating agents must be coordinated to ensure that their collective activities produce the desired procedural knowledge.

40|$|There is an {{essential}} difference between radical constructivism and socioculturism. It is that the former takes social interaction (specifically, communication) as a phenomenon needing explanation, whereas the latter takes it as a constitutive element of human activity. This difference expresses itself most vividly {{in the types of}} explanations coming from radical constructivists and socioculturists. The former tend to focus on human discourse as emanating from interactions among self-organizing, autonomous individuals. The latter tend to focus on the collective activity in which individuals participate. That is, from a radical constructivist perspective, what we take as collective activity is constituted by interactions among individuals each having schemes by which they generate their activity and by which they make sense of other’s actions. From a sociocultural perspective, collective activity and social interaction are given, predating any individual’s participation in it. The individual accommodates to social meaning and practice. Social interaction, from a radical constructivist perspective, is constituted by individuals’ mutual interpretation of what each perceives as other-oriented action. These interactions, collectively and over time, constitute social activity. i If we also assume that individuals <b>reflect</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{energetics}} of {{the individual}} reaction steps {{in the catalytic cycle}} of photosynthetic water oxidation at the Mn 4 Ca complex of photosystem II (PSII) are of prime interest. We studied the electron transfer reactions in oxygen-evolving PSII membrane particles from spinach by a photothermal beam deflection technique, allowing for time-resolved calorimetry in the micro- to millisecond domain. For an ideal quantum yield of 100 %, the enthalpy change, ΔH, coupled to the formation of the radical pair YZ⋅+QA− (where YZ is Tyr- 161 of the D 1 subunit of PSII) is estimated as − 820  ±  250  meV. For a lower quantum yield of 70 %, the enthalpy change is estimated to be − 400  ±  250  meV. The observed nonthermal signal possibly is due to a contraction of the PSII protein volume (apparent ΔV of about − 13  Å 3). For the first time, the enthalpy change of the O 2 -evolving transition of the S-state cycle was monitored directly. Surprisingly, the reaction is only slightly exergonic. A value of ΔH(S 3  ⇒ S 0) of − 210 meV is estimated, but also an enthalpy change of zero is within the error range.

The interns use an application designed to foster a dialectical record of their experiences and differences of opinion about how to understand those experiences.

We describe how students' presuppositions that good communication is "open and honest" conflicts with their experience of superior-subordinate relationships. We suggest that conflicts with presuppositions {{can be used to}} facilitate further reflective learning and to shape the online dialogue. Keywords: Collaborative Learning, Reflective Learning, Internships, Professional Development, Discourse Analysis A central part of reflective learning (Schon, 1983) is the uncovering and questioning of assumptions. Reflective learning depends on learners surfacing their assumptions about the world that are represented in the actions they take to handle everyday dilemmas. Thus, in order to learn from experience, it is necessary for learners to reflect on how they make decisions and the assumptions that those decisions are based on. An application designed by the second author incorporates a model of argumentative dialogue that facilitates reflective learning among student interns. The application facilitates the collaborative production of disagreement and a natural, dialectical history of the interns' experiences and evolving differences of opinion about communication at work and in professional life (Aakhus, 2000; 2001).

First, to detect an oxygenation breakpoint (Δ[O 2 HbMb-HHbMb]-BP) and compare this breakpoint to ventilatory thresholds during a maximal incremental test across sexes and training status. Second, to assess reproducibility of NIRS signals and exercise thresholds and investigate confounding effects of adipose tissue thickness on NIRS measurements. Forty subjects (10 trained male cyclists, 10 trained female cyclists, 11 endurance trained males and 9 recreationally trained males) performed maximal incremental cycling exercise to determine Δ[O 2 HbMb-HHbMb]-BP and ventilatory thresholds (VT 1 and VT 2). Muscle haemoglobin and myoglobin O 2 oxygenation ([HHbMb], [O 2 HbMb], SmO 2) was determined in m. vastus lateralis. Δ[O 2 HbMb-HHbMb]-BP was determined by double linear regression. Trained cyclists performed the maximal incremental test twice to assess reproducibility. Adipose tissue thickness (ATT) was determined by skinfold measurements. Δ[O 2 HbMb-HHbMb]-BP was not different from VT 1, but only moderately related (r = 0. 58 - 0. 63, p< 0. 001). VT 1 was different across sexes and training status, whereas Δ[O 2 HbMb-HHbMb]-BP differed only across sexes. Reproducibility was high for SmO 2 (ICC = 0. 69 - 0. 97), Δ[O 2 HbMb-HHbMb]-BP (ICC = 0. 80 - 0. 88) and ventilatory thresholds (ICC = 0. 96 - 0. 99). SmO 2 at peak exercise and at occlusion were strongly related to adipose tissue thickness (r 2 = 0. 81, p< 0. 001; r 2 = 0. 79, p< 0. 001). Moreover, ATT was related to asymmetric changes in Δ[HHbMb] and Δ[O 2 HbMb] during incremental exercise (r = - 0. 64, p< 0. 001) and during occlusion (r = - 0. 50, p< 0. 05). Although the oxygenation threshold is reproducible and potentially a suitable exercise threshold, VT 1 discriminates better across sexes and training status during maximal stepwise incremental exercise.
