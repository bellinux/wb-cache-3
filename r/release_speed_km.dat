40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} significant relationships between selected anthropometric and kinematic variables and ball <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> Nine collegiate fast-medium bowlers (mean ± s: age 21. 0 ± 0. 9 years, body mass 77. 2 ± 8. 1 kg, height 1. 83 ± 0. 1 m) were filmed and reconstructed three-dimensionally. Ball <b>release</b> <b>speeds</b> were measured by a previously validated SpeedchekTM Personal Sports Radar (Tribar Industries, Canada). Relationships between selected anthropometric variables and ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> and between kinematic variables and ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> were investigated using Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficients (r). A significant relationship was found between the horizontal velocity during the pre-delivery stride (r = 0. 728, P 0. 05) with ball <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> Although the action of the wrist was not analysed because of an inadequate frame rate, we found high correlations between ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> and shoulder-wrist length (661 ± 31 mm; r = 0. 626, P < 0. 05) and ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> and total arm length (860 ± 36 mm; r = 0. 583, P < 0. 05). We conclude that the variance in <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> within this group may be accounted for by the difference in radial length between the axis of rotation at the glenohumeral joint and the release point...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{kinematic}} {{model is}} used to analyze basketball shooting arm motions in the vertical plane that produce desired ball <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> angle and backspin. The release conditions are related to arm motions using general kinematic equations. The paper compares three types of shooting arm motions: pure hand shots, hand-forearm shots, and general shots controlled by hand, forearm and upper arm motions. In pure hand shots, <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> angle and backspin are severely limited. All hand-forearm shot configurations are able to produce desired <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> angle and backspin. General shots redundantly provide shooters with any desired ball <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> angle and backspin, and {{they are required to}} suitably control each joint angular velocity and acceleration...|$|R

The journal's website is at: [URL] aim {{of this study was to}} identify the key aspects of technique that characterize the fastest bowlers. Kinematic data were collected for 20 elite male fast bowlers with 11 kinematic parameters calculated, describing elements of fast bowling technique that have previously been linked to ball <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> Four technique variables were identified as being the best predictors of ball <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> explaining 74 % of the observed variation in ball <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> The results indicate that the fastest bowlers have a quicker run-up and maintain a straighter knee throughout the front foot contact phase. The fastest bowlers were also observed to exhibit larger amounts of upper trunk flexion up to ball release and to delay the onset of arm circumduction. This study identifies those technique variables that best explain the differences in <b>release</b> <b>speeds</b> among fast bowlers. These results are likely to be useful in both the coaching and talent identification of fast bowlers. © 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the release angle that maximises the distance attained {{in a long}} soccer throw-in. One male soccer player performed maximum-effort throws using release angles of between 10 and 60 degrees, and the throws were analysed using 2 -D video. The player's optimum release angle was calculated by substituting mathematical expressions for the measured relations between <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>release</b> height, and release angle into the equations for the flight of a spherical projectile. We found that the musculoskeletal structure of the player's body had a strong influence on the optimum release angle. When using low release angles the player released the ball with a greater <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> and because the range of a projectile {{is strongly dependent on}} the <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> this bias toward low release angles reduced the optimum release angle to about 30 degrees. Calculations showed that the distance of a throw may be increased by a few metres by launching the ball with a fast backspin, but the ball must be launched at a slightly lower release angle.

40|$|The jump throw is {{the most}} applied {{throwing}} technique in team- handball (Wagner et al., 2008); however, a comprehensive analysis of 3 D-kinematics of the team-handball jump throw is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of our study was: 1) to measure differences in ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> in team- handball jump throw and anthropometric parameters between groups of different levels of performance and (2) to analyze upper body 3 D-kinematics (flexion/extension and rotation) to determine significant differences between these groups. Three-dimensional kinematic data was analyzed via the Vicon MX 13 motion capturing system (Vicon Peak, Oxford, UK) from 26 male team-handball players of different performance levels (mean age: 21. 2 ± 5. 0 years). The participants were instructed {{to throw the ball}} (IHF Size 3) onto a target at 8 m distance, and to hit the center of a square of 1 × 1 m at about eye level (1. 75 m), with maximum ball <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> Significant differences between elite vs. low level players were found in the ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> (p < 0. 001), body height (p < 0. 05), body weight (p < 0. 05), maximal trunk internal rotation (p < 0. 05), trunk flexion (p < 0. 01) and forearm pronation (p < 0. 05) as well as trunk flexion (p < 0. 05) and shoulder internal rotation (p < 0. 001) angular velocity at ball release. Results of our study suggest that team-handball players who were taller and of greater body weight have the ability to achieve a higher ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> in the jump throw, and that an increase in trunk flexion and rotation angular velocity improve the performance in team-handball jump throw that should result in an increase of ball <b>release</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|R
40|$|Biomechanics {{testimony}} was sought {{to assess the}} feasibility of a claim made by the defendant that a fatal head injury sustained by the victim arose {{as a result of}} the defendant throwing a child's bicycle a horizontal distance of 7 m which accidentally struck the victim. The method of projection was claimed to involve pushing the bicycle from the chest equally with both hands from a stationary upright standing position in a manner similar to a chest pass in basketball. A further consideration in the case was that the maximum height of the projectile during flight was constrained by the presence of an overhead ceiling. Using equations for uniform motion and based on measurements made at the crime scene, it was determined that the theoretical <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> of the projectile could not have been less than 10. 0 - 11. 0 m/s and was probably closer to 14 m/s. These estimated <b>release</b> <b>speeds</b> are substantially higher than the <b>release</b> <b>speeds</b> associated with a comparable movement pattern, namely, the maximal two-handed bench throw (~ 2. 5 m/s), and instead approximate the <b>release</b> <b>speeds</b> recorded by the best three throwers in the Men's Shot Put at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games (13. 60 - 13. 95 m/s).

The model has three rigid planar links with rotational joints imitating an upper arm, forearm and hand with shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. The kinematics of the shooting arm is solved to calculate the joint angles, and the velocity and angular velocity of links at release. There are many angular displacement and velocity combinations of shoulder, elbow and wrist joints to produce the optimal <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> angle and backspin of the ball at release.

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Journal of Sports Sciences on 28 / 01 / 2016, available online: [URL] study investigates how elbow hyperextension affects ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> in fast bowling. A two-segment planar computer simulation model comprising an upper arm and forearm + hand was customised to an elite fast bowler. A constant torque was applied at the shoulder and elbow hyperextension was represented using a damped linear torsional spring at the elbow. The magnitude of the constant shoulder torque and the torsional spring parameters were determined by concurrently matching three performances. Close agreement {{was found between the}} simulations and the performances with an average difference of 3. 8 %. The simulation model with these parameter values was then evaluated using one additional performance. Optimising ball speed by varying the torsional spring parameters found that elbow hyperextension increased ball <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> Perturbing the elbow torsional spring stiffness indicated that the increase in ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> was governed by the magnitude of peak elbow hyperextension and the amount that the elbow recoils back towards a straight arm after reaching peak elbow hyperextension. This finding provides a clear understanding that a bowler who hyperextends at the elbow and recoils optimally will have an increase in ball speed compared to a similar bowler who cannot hyperextend. A fast bowler with 20 ° of elbow hyperextension and an optimal level of recoil will have increased ball speeds of around 5 % over a bowler without hyperextension...|$|R

This study aimed at evaluating the decomposition rate, cellulose, lignin and nutrients <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> from palisadegrass {{as a function of}} N fertilization. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications, in a factorial scheme constituted by two N fertilization levels and six sampling times after desiccation [0, 14, 34, 41, 51 and 68 days after management (DAM) ]. The topdressing N fertilization on palisadegrass increases the dry matter production and N accumulation, but does not alter the decomposition and <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> N fertilization reduces the C/N ratio, but it does not change the contents of cellulose and lignin and the decomposition and release of N, K, Ca, Mg, C and Si. The amounts of P and S accumulated in the plant and released into the soil increase with N fertilization. The maximum release rates occur within 0 - 14 DAM, being more intensive for P and S when N is applied.
