5|$|The overall case-fatality <b>rate</b> <b>for</b> ordinary-type {{smallpox}} {{is about}} 30 percent, but varies by pock distribution: ordinary type-confluent is fatal about 50–75 {{percent of the}} time, ordinary-type semi-confluent about 25–50 percent of the time, {{in cases where the}} rash is discrete the case-fatality rate is less than 10 percent. The overall fatality <b>rate</b> <b>for</b> children younger than 1 year of age is 40–50 percent. Hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates. The fatality <b>rate</b> <b>for</b> flat-type is 90 percent or greater and nearly 100 percent is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox.
