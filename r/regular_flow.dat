5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no <b>regular</b> <b>flow</b> in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined sewer overflow.|$|E

2500|$|The Welland Canal Company was {{incorporated}} by the Province of Upper Canada, in 1824, after a petition by nine [...] "freeholders of the District of Niagara".

"As to his {{personal}} qualities, of a higher order, these were cheerfulness and sympathy in a very eminent degree; so eminent, indeed, that as no afflictions of his own could divest him of the former, so neither could the afflictions of others find him destitute of the latter.

The hurricanes of the West Indies are among the most violent in the world.

A vessel named the Ledbnry Snow attempted to ride it out. When it abated, she found herself high up on the dry land, having let go her anchor among the tree-tops of Elliott's quay! The Florida quays were inundated many feet; and it is said the scene presented in the Gulf Stream was never surpassed in awful sublimity on the ocean. The water thus dammed up rushed out with frightful velocity against the fury of the gale, producing a sea that beggared description." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{primary cause}} of all wind is the {{combined}} action of heat and cold. If the world were heated with perfect equality all round, there would be, as far at least as heat is concerned, a perfect and permanent stagnation of the atmosphere; and this would speedily result {{in the destruction of}} every living thing. But by the varied and beautiful arrangements which the Almighty has made in nature He has secured a <b>regular</b> <b>flow</b> of atmospheric currents, which will continue unalterably to move as long as the present economy of things exists. The intense and constant action of the sun's rays in the torrid zone produces great heat, while the less powerful and frequently interrupted influence of his rays in the frigid zones induces extreme cold. Hence we have in one region heated air, in another cool air. Now, the effect of heat upon air is to expand it, make it light, and cause it to rise. The moment it does so, the cold air rushes in to supply its place; and this rushing in of the cold air is what we call wind.|$|E

As an application we show that a Hamiltonian system that is perturbed by a white noise produces a symplectic flow provided that the corresponding Hamiltonian function H satisfies ∇ H∈ L^r,q with r/d+ 2 /q< 1.
