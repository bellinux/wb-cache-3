As coordinator of an Integrated Bridging Program for international research students in a conventional Australian university, I have primarily seen my role as investigating the contextual expectations, {{as well as the}} text features, of the target research genres required in my teaching. In pursuing the first of these goals, I surveyed faculty research supervisors, asking them to prioritise the particular features they expected to see in a successful 'research proposal', as this is the compulsory assessment task for each research student's initial probationary period. I also invited them to add personal written comments about their priorities. I then interviewed seven experienced supervisors representing all University faculties about the same issues. The results demonstrated an overwhelming concurrence of criteria for success in the research proposal across the University. Perhaps even more significantly, however, supervisors' personal responses presented in writing and in interview suggested a <b>recurring</b> <b>reading</b> of the proposal not in terms of document features {{but in terms of the}} student who wrote it, constructed either as the discoursally instantiated writer/persona, or even as the embodied student as subject. For me, the implications of such assessment practices provoke a reconsideration of genre-oriented pedagogy and strongly support a critical rather than a purely pragmatic EAP in research contexts.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{illuminate}} the meaning of being supportive to family caregivers who care for a relative at home as narrated by registered nurses. The context used to allow for the meaning of being supportive to be illuminated was palliative home care. The study uses a phenomenological-hermeneutical method inspired by the philosophy of Ricoeur. Data consisted of narrative interviews, which were analyzed in three <b>recurring</b> phases: naive <b>reading,</b> structural analysis and interpreted whole. Twenty nurses from the hospitals in Sweden participated in the study. Two core themes were found: forming a relationship and keeping caregiving at home.

He also guest-starred in Hannah Montana as Barny Bittmen. In January 2009, Gottfried worked again with David Faustino for an episode of Faustino's show Star-ving. In 2011, Gottfried appeared in the episode [...] "Lost Traveler" [...] on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Leo Gerber, a sarcastic computer professional working for the NYPD's Technical Assistance Response Unit, which producer Warren Leight said could become a <b>recurring</b> character. Gottfried <b>read</b> a section from the hit book Fifty Shades of Grey in a June 2012 YouTube video, which was created {{with the aim of}} using Gottfried's trademark voice to make fun of the book's graphic sexual content.|$|R
40|$|This article {{combines}} {{a study of}} Peter Martyr Vermigli’s Sacred Prayers with a methodological concern for the particular challenges involved in {{coming to grips with}} prayers as historical sources. It demonstrates that in the reception history of Vermigli’s prayers there has been a <b>recurring</b> tendency to <b>read</b> them as something other than prayers, a commentary on the Psalms for instance. By contrast, this article attends to the specificity of their genre and form as prayers. This approach leads, first, to a fresh appreciation of the Preces sacrae as a rare and revealing source of their kind, since not many prayers offered before lectures in sixteenth-century Protestant universities have survived; secondly, to the discovery of important, as yet unknown connections between Vermigli’s Preces sacrae and Wolfgang Capito’s Precationes; and thirdly {{to an understanding of the}} spiritual depth of the Preces sacrae going beyond their propositional theological content...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{illuminate}} the meaning of being supportive to family carers who care for a relative at home as narrated by registered nurses. The context used to allow for the meaning of being supportive to be illuminated was palliative home care. The study uses a phenomenological hermeneutical method based on the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur. Data consisted of narrative interviews, transcribed verbatim into text which was analysed in three <b>recurring</b> phases: naive <b>reading,</b> structural analyses and interpreted whole. The total of 20 nurses who participated in the study were affiliated with three different hospitals in southern Sweden. Several subthemes and themes were formed from the rich material into two core themes: ‘Forming a relationship’ and ‘Keeping caregiving at home’. In the interpreted whole, dimensions to the meaning of being supportive as illuminated by the nurses narratives are discussed in relation to literature that has potential to open up for a widened and deepened understanding of the phenomenon...|$|R

Face after face, stolid and apathetic, expressed nothing, no active desire, certainly no enthusiasm, hardly any dread. Poor devils! The thing, after all, was no more within their control than it was within the power of ants to stop the ruination of their ant-heap by some passing boy! It was no doubt quite true, that the people had never had much voice in the making of war. And the words of a Radical weekly, which as an impartial man he always forced himself to <b>read,</b> <b>recurred</b> to him. [...] "Ignorant of the facts, hypnotized by the words 'Country' and 'Patriotism'; in the grip of mob-instinct and inborn prejudice against the foreigner; helpless by reason of his patience, stoicism, good faith, and confidence in those above him; helpless by reason of his snobbery, mutual distrust, carelessness for the morrow, and lack of public spirit-in the face of War how impotent and to be pitied is the man in the street!" [...] That paper, though clever, always seemed to him intolerably hifalutin'! ...|$|R
50|$|After the Second Vatican Council of 1962-1965, the Holy See, {{even before}} {{producing}} an actual lectionary (in Latin), promulgated the Ordo Lectionum Missae (Order of the Readings for Mass), giving indications of the revised {{structure and the}} references to the passages chosen {{for inclusion in the}} new official lectionary of the Roman Rite of Mass. It introduced an arrangement by which the readings on Sundays and on some principal feasts recur in a three-year cycle, with four passages from Scripture (including one from the Psalms) being used in each celebration, while on weekdays only three passages (again including one from the Psalms) are used, with the first reading and the psalm recurring in a two-year cycle, while the Gospel <b>reading</b> <b>recurs</b> after a single year. This revised Mass Lectionary, covering much more of the Bible than the readings in the Tridentine Roman Missal, which recurred after a single year, has been translated into the many languages in which the Roman Rite Mass is now celebrated, incorporating existing or specially prepared translations of the Bible and with readings for national celebrations added either as an appendix or, in some cases, incorporated into {{the main part of the}} lectionary.|$|R

I am glad of it; but it is not original--at least not mine; it may be found much better expressed in pages 182-3-4 of the English version of [...] "Vathek" [...] (I forget the precise page of the French), a work to which I have before referred; and never <b>recur</b> to, or <b>read,</b> without a renewal of gratification.--[The following is the passage: [...] "'Deluded prince!' said the Genius, addressing the Caliph ...

Thou beholdest the clouds that obscure the sun: at the instant he recovers his splendour, if thy heart be not changed, the time of mercy assigned thee will be past for ever.'" ...|$|R
