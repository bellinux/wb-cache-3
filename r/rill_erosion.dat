50|$|Land quality {{decline is}} {{sometimes}} associated with overgrazing. Rangeland health classification reflects soil and site stability, hydrologic function, and biotic integrity. By {{the end of}} 2002, the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had evaluated rangeland health on 7,437 grazing allotments (i.e., 35 percent of its grazing allotments or 36 {{percent of the land}} area contained in its grazing allotments) and found that 16 percent of these failed to meet rangeland health standards due to existing grazing practices or levels of grazing use. This led the BLM to infer that a similar percentage would be obtained when such evaluations were completed. Soil erosion associated with overgrazing is an important issue in many dry regions of the world. However, on US farmland, much less soil erosion is associated with pastureland used for livestock grazing than with land used for production of crops. Sheet and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> is within estimated soil loss tolerance on 95.1 percent, and wind erosion is within estimated soil loss tolerance on 99.4 percent of US pastureland inventoried by the US Natural Resources Conservation Service.|$|E
5000|$|Surface runoff {{can cause}} {{erosion of the}} Earth's surface; eroded {{material}} may be deposited a considerable distance away. There are four main types of soil erosion by water: splash erosion, sheet erosion, <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> and gully erosion. Splash erosion {{is the result of}} mechanical collision of raindrops with the soil surface: soil particles which are dislodged by the impact then move with the surface runoff. Sheet erosion is the overland transport of sediment by runoff without a well defined channel. Soil surface roughness causes may cause runoff to become concentrated into narrower flow paths: as these incise, the small but well-defined channels which are formed are known as rills. These channels can be as small as one centimeter wide or as large as several meters. If runoff continue to incise and enlarge rills, they may eventually grow to become gullies. Gully erosion can transport large amounts of eroded material in a small time period. Reduced crop productivity usually results from erosion, and these effects are studied in the field of soil conservation. The soil particles carried in runoff vary in size from about [...]001 millimeter to 1.0 millimeter in diameter. Larger particles settle over short transport distances, whereas small particles can be carried over long distances suspended in the water column. Erosion of silty soils that contain smaller particles generates turbidity and diminishes light transmission, which disrupts aquatic ecosystems.|$|E

This study was conducted to explore how satellite imagery could be used for evaluating erosion in a 10 * 10 km area in the Brazilian Cerrados. Products obtained from a variety of satellite sensors were analyzed for the purpose of (1) detecting erosion features; and (2) qualitatively mapping erosion risk. Erosion detection was done through visual image interpretation. Optical TerraASTER images allowed for a better detection and delineation of major gullies as ENVISAT ASAR imagery. Gully dynamics could be assessed by jointly interpreting aerial photos of 1979 and a high-resolution QuickBird image of 2003. QuickBird also allowed for the detection of smaller <b>erosion</b> features, like <b>rills.</b> <b>Erosion</b> risk mapping was performed for the complete study area with a simple qualitative method integrating information on slope and vegetation cover. Slope was calculated from the SRTM DEM, and NDVI, being indicative of vegetation cover, was obtained from a wet-season ASTER image. Both factors were automatically classified based on their relative susceptibility to erosion. The erosion risk map was constructed by combining both classifications with the minimum-operator.

Laboratory simulations have been vital to understanding <b>rill</b> <b>erosion.</b> Previous experiments obtained sediment yields using rills of various lengths to get the sedimentation process, which disrupted {{the continuity of the}} <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> process and was time-consuming. In this study, an improved experimental method was used to measure the <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> processes by concentrated channel flow. By using this method, a laboratory platform, 12 m long and 3 m wide, was used to construct rills of 0. 1 m wide and 12 m long for experiments under five slope gradients (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees) and three flow rates (2, 4, and 8 L min(- 1)). Sediment laden water was simultaneously sampled along the rill at locations 0. 5 m, 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 4 m, 5 m, 6 m, 7 m, 8 m, 10 m, and 12 m from the water inlet to determine the sediment concentration distribution. The <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> process measured by the method used in this study and that by previous experimental methods are approximately the same.

40|$|Sheet and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the transformation of agricultural slopes in the Carpathians. It is an episodic process of short duration which can take place both in the winter and summer hydrological half-years as a result of meteorological short-term and high-intensity events like short downpours, intense continuous rainfall and rapid thaws. The climate of the Carpathians is characterized by the variability of its parameters caused by the growing height of the mountain belts from the north to the south as well as by the considerable latitudinal extent of the mountain range. The summer season is crucial to annual precipitation totals. Maximum daily precipitation totals are the result of intense continuous rainfall (mainly in June and July) and short local downpours (mainly in May). In the flysch Polish Carpathians the role of sheet and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> on agricultural slopes is different in areas characterized by mountain relief (Beskidy Mountains) and foothill relief, because the two regions have different water circulation patterns and weathered material displacement patterns. Another crucial factor that helps account for the differences in the effectiveness of sheet and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> is vegetation cover. The lack of sufficiently long measurement series or diversification between regions of the Carpathians makes it difficult to determine the frequency of extreme sheet and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> and their recurrence, which means it is not possible to define the quantitative criteria for establishing extreme sheet and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> processes for the whole area of the Polish Carpathians.

The aim {{of the study was}} to develop a database to support soil conservation in the area. The study was done on two distinct geomorphic units with respect to altitude and hence rainfall distribution pattern: mountain ridges with an altitude ranging from 1000 to 1500 masl and mean annual rainfall of 2300 mmand mountain foothills whose altitude and mean annual rainfall are 550 to 900 masl and 900 mm, respectively. Total soil losswas measured on 36 individual bounded plots measuring 1. 2 m× 20 m using Gerlarch troughs on each day with rain from July 2000 to June 2001. The plots were located on six different geopedologic units, nine on mountain ridges and the rest on the mountain foothills. The slope gradient on the terrain ranged from 30 % to 70 %. The plots were put under maize cultivation as the main crop. Soil loss through rill erosionwas estimated by volumetric measurements of rills on each soil erosion plot. The soil loss due to interrill erosionwas obtained by subtracting soil loss through <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> from the total soil loss measured in the Gerlarch troughs. The results indicate that soil loss due to both interrill and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> was very high with mean soil loss of 69 and 163 t/ha/year, respectively. <b>Rill</b> <b>erosion</b> accounted for about 58 % of the total soil loss while interrill erosion contributed to the remaining 42 %. Both interrill and rill erosionwere higher in the mountain ridges with mean soil loss of 88 t/ha/year and 210 t/ha/year compared to 49 and 116 t/ha/year in the mountain foothills, respectively. Rill erosionwas significantly higher (P≤ 0. 001) in all geopedologic units with slope gradient above 40 % (mean soil loss ranged between 91 and 258 t/ha/year) compared to interrill erosion with mean soil loss varying from 41 to 115 t/ha/year. In geopedologic units with slope gradient above 60 % both interrill and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> were highly active while in geopedologic units with slope gradient below 40 % the two processes were less active. The results demonstrate that <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> is more important than interrill erosion in the study area particularly where the slope gradient exceeds 40 %.

Most current studies on <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> use {{spatially}} averaged soil erosion data, providing little information on soil erosion dynamics. A method is proposed to use rare earth elements (REEs) to trace sediment distribution in eroding rills. Laboratory flume simulation experiments were conducted at three flow rates (2, 4 and 8 litres minute(- 1)) and five slope gradients (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees) with three replicates of each treatment. The rills, of 8 m length, were subdivided into 10 equal segments of 0. 8 m length and 0. 1 m width, with a different REE applied to each segment.

40|$|International audienceRill erosion {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} Mediterranean cultivated landscapes {{due to high}} rainfall intensities, low soil organic matter concentrations and low vegetation coverage. Among other <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> mitigation practices, farmers have historically built ditch networks to intercept runoff upstream of cultivated plots. However, the construction and maintenance of these ditches generate indirect costs for farmers and land managers. Therefore, a compromise must be found between these costs and {{the efficiency of the}} ditch network for mitigating erosion. Thus, tools and methods are required for determining an optimised cost-efficient compromise or for diagnosing existing ditch networks. This paper proposes an experimental approach to test in silico how well an actual soil conservation practice (i. e., a ditch network) reaches a cost-efficiency compromise at the catchment scale. The costs are approximated from the density of the ditches, and the <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> mitigation efficiency is summarised using an aggregated modified stream power index. The actual ditch network is compared to a set of virtual ditch networks that are generated by a stochastic network simulator that optimises the network geometries with regard to preventing <b>rill</b> <b>erosion.</b> This approach was applied in four small vineyard sub-catchments located in the Peyne catchment in Languedoc, southern France. Actual ditch networks are compared to virtual networks, which present a large range of ditch network densities. The ditch network highly mitigates <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> because the Stream Power Index (SPI) values exponentially decrease with the ditch network density and because the actual SPI maps are homogeneous. In addition, the results from the four different sub-catchments indicated that the <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> risk was mitigated by using minimal drainage network lengths, which suggested that the actual ditch networks that resulted from historical farmers were optimised. The proposed approach can be used to determine if the efficiency of ditch networks for mitigating erosion can be improved...|$|E

Rill erodibilities and critical shear values were calculated for all treatments using the shear stress model that was originally developed for soil. Rill erodibilities were higher on topsoil-treated plots than on control and compost-treated areas. Yard waste had significantly lower rill erodibility than all other compost and soil treatments. There were no significant differences between critical shear values for the composts and soil. Yard waste compost exhibited greater resistance to rill formation than the biosolids and bio-industrial composts or the two soils. Low R 2 values for compost erodibility and critical shear suggest that the shear stress model used in this analysis is not well suited for use with composted organics.

The suggested method {{is based on the}} establishment of the functional power connection between mean monthly water discharges (WD, Q i) and suspended sediment fluxes (r i) calculated for the low-water-discharge phases of a rivers hydrological regime in various (on mean annual water discharges) years: r i = a×Q i (where a, ì are some empirical coefficients), and further extrapolation of this connection for other phases of the hydrological regime. Thus, the extrapolation allows us to calculate (in a long-term annual SSF) the proportions of sediments originating in river beds and drainage basins. The proposed method is tested using a long-term (not less than 10 years) series of observations for WD and SSF of 124 chiefly small and midsize rivers of the East-European plain, the Urals, the Eastern Carpathians, the Ciscaucasia and the Caucasus, and Central Asian mountains, containing data on the mean monthly values of WD and SSF.

Furthermore, this analytical approach allows the determination of threshold values for the state variables (i. e. vegetation cover and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion)</b> that drive the system's stability, facilitating the identification of critical situations that require specific human intervention (e. g. revegetation or, in very problematic cases, revegetation combined with rill network destruction) to ensure the long-term sustainability of the restored ecosystem. The application of our threshold analysis framework in Mediterranean-dry reclaimed slopes derived from surface coal mining (the Teruel coalfield in central-eastern Spain) showed a good field-based performance. Therefore, {{we believe that this}} model is a valuable contribution for the {{management of}} water-limited reclaimed systems, including those associated with <b>rill</b> <b>erosion,</b> as it provides a tool for the evaluation of restoration success and can {{play an important role in}} decision-making during ecosystem restoration in severely disturbed landscapes...|$|E
40|$|Wildfire is an {{important}} ecological process and management issue on western rangelands. Major unknowns associated with wildfire are its affects on vegetation and soil conditions that influence hydrologic processes including infiltration, surface runoff, erosion, sediment transport, and flooding. Post wildfire hydrologic response was studied in big sagebrush plant communities on steep slopes with coarse-textured soils. Significant <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> was observed following both thunderstorm and rapid snowmelt events. Rainfall simulation and controlled overland flow techniques were used to study post-fire effects on infiltration, and interrill and <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> processes on burned and adjacent unburned areas. Results indicate that burn severity {{and the development of}} water repellent soil conditions play significant roles in determining infiltration and interrill erosion rates, particularly on shrub coppice dunes characterized by high surface litter accumulations. The most dramatic and long-lasting affect of fire was on <b>rill</b> <b>erosion</b> processes by reducing ground cover needed to slow and spread water as it moves across the soil surface. Ongoing research efforts are aimed at characterizing the hydrologic impacts of prescribed fire used as a tool to manage vegetation and mitigate the impacts of catastrophic wildfire events...|$|E
40|$|The study {{summarizes}} principal {{natural and}} social hazards related to planned clearance of dwarf pine covers in the Hrubý Jeseník Mts. and proposes preparation procedure of its future projects leading to their minimalization. The main hazardous factors include change of hydrological condidions, <b>rill</b> and sheet <b>erosion,</b> introskeletal erosion, snow movements, changes of soil rentention ability, increased motion of visitors, changes of timberline and spruce growth and biomass quantity of dwarf pine covers. The report is completed with calculation of damage amounts caused to forest owners due to dwarf pine clearance from forest grounds and some additional economic {{aspects of this}} activity...|$|R
40|$|The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} tool for erosion prediction and conservation planning. Solving this equation yields the long-term average annual soil loss that can be expected from <b>rill</b> and inter-rill <b>erosion.</b> In this study, manual interpretation of color and color infrared 70 mm photography at the scale of 1 : 60, 000 is {{used to determine the}} cropping management factor in the USLE. Accurate information was collected about plowing practices and crop residue cover (unharvested vegetation) for the winter season on agricultural land in Pheasant Branch Creek watershed in Dane County, Wisconsin...|$|R
40|$|The Sediment Assessment Tool for Effective Erosion Control (SATEEC) {{acts as an}} {{extension}} for ArcView GIS 3, with easy to use commands. The erosion assessment {{is divided into two}} modules that consist of Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) for sheet/rill erosion and the nLS/USPED modeling for gully head erosion. The SATEEC erosion modules can be successfully implemented for areas where sheet, <b>rill</b> and gully <b>erosion</b> occurs, such as the Prislop Catchment. The enhanced SATEEC system does not require experienced GIS users to operate the system therefore it is suitable for local authorities and/or students not so familiar with erosion modeling...|$|R
