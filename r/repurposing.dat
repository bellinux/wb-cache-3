5|$|The first {{assemblies}} of the Republic {{emerged during}} the Kingdom, with their use to ratify regal elections and the <b>repurposing</b> of the comitia centuriata to elect the first consuls. This regime was dominated by the patricians, and the sources on the early Republic overwhelmingly focus on the conflicts between the patricians and the plebs, in {{what is known as}} the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E
5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line in right field. A fourth party area was created by <b>repurposing</b> unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.|$|E
5|$|One {{possibility}} is that the Dressel 20 amphora, the principal type found at Monte Testaccio, may have been unusually difficult to recycle. Many types of amphora could be re-used to carry {{the same type of}} product or modified to serve a different purpose—for instance, as drain pipes or flower pots. Fragmentary amphorae could be pounded into chips to use in opus signinum, a type of concrete widely used as a building material, or could simply be used as landfill. The Dressel 20 amphora, however, broke into large curved fragments that could not readily be reduced to small shards. It is likely that the difficulty of reusing or <b>repurposing</b> the Dressel 20s meant that it was more economical to discard them.|$|E

5|$|Introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long is {{an assassin}} {{sent by the}} Emperor of China to kill a pirate lord, but failed. Badly injured, he was rescued by a woman named Chie and {{eventually}} {{fell in love with}} her. While out one day, a fight broke out at the inn and Chie was believed to be dead. Told falsely the swordsman Heishirō Mitsurugi was responsible, he set out after Soul Edge knowing Mitsurugi was also after the blade. Along the way he takes the weapons of other fighters he defeats, <b>repurposing</b> some for his own use. Upon finding and defeating him, he realized Mitsurugi had no part in the attack upon Chie, and continued his goal of searching for Soul Edge. He located its wielder, Cervantes, but was beaten severely. Revealed to have survived in Soulcalibur III but having lost an eye, he found himself on the run from assassins sent by his former employer. Traveling by night under a false name, he was taken in by a girl that reminded him of Chie. When the assassins eventually found him, Li Long stood his ground and defeated them. Remembering the feel of fighting for something other than revenge, he set out to find himself, not knowing that Chie was actually alive and, after giving birth to their son, had set out to find him.|$|E

25|$|The {{architecture}} {{is defined by}} a combination of Brutalist and Postmodern buildings spread across campus, most of them built between 1960 and 1980. In 2016, the campus finished <b>repurposing</b> and renovating the Canadian Natural Resources Limited Engineering Complex situated within the Schulich School of Engineering. In 2017, the university has recently started on rehabilitating the aging MacKimmie Complex.|$|E

The plans call for {{demolishing}} concourses A, B and C of the existing southside terminal complex, while <b>repurposing</b> concourse D for charter services and administrative offices. The airport currently has 34 gates but only uses 30 gates; the new terminal is designed for 35 gates, with an option to expand to 42.|$|E
25|$|Consumer {{resources}} {{exist for}} exchanging usable materials, such as freecycling sites {{which are often}} grassroots and entirely nonprofit movements {{of people who are}} giving (and getting) stuff for free in their own towns. It's all about reuse and keeping good stuff out of landfills. Membership is normally free. In, addition, there are directory-based resources such as RecycleChicken.com which point consumers to local and national locations for reuse and <b>repurposing</b> of materials not normally accepted in recycling programs.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{started on}} 12 August 2002 with an {{estimated}} cost of $11.4 million. In June 2003, Mark Williams - pastor of Holy Trinity Parish - announced the decision to demolish the old school building as renovation and <b>repurposing</b> at an estimated cost of $4 million was considered too expensive. The new building at 1201 Airport Road opened on 25 August 2003 with 323 students enrolled that fall. In June and July 2004, the Center Street school building was razed and {{in the following year}} Bill Hundman Memorial Field was completed.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{land use}} {{conflicts}} have arisen between established {{areas in the}} north and less developed areas in the south. These conflicts have regarded issues such as construction of new toll roads and the <b>repurposing</b> of a decommissioned air base. El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was designated by a voter measure in 1994 to be developed into an international airport to complement the existing John Wayne Airport. But subsequent voter initiatives and court actions have caused the airport plan to be permanently shelved. Instead, it will become the Orange County Great Park.|$|E
25|$|Heck {{was born}} in the Jamaica {{neighborhood}} of Queens, New York City, New York, the son of Bertha and John Heck. Heck learned art through correspondence courses as well as at Woodrow Wilson Vocational High School in Jamaica and at a community college in Brooklyn. He continued with an impromptu art education in December 1949 when at the recommendation of a college friend he landed a job at Harvey Comics, <b>repurposing</b> newspaper comic strip Photostats into comic-book form — including the work of Heck's idol, famed cartoonist Milton Caniff.|$|E
25|$|New {{features}} {{provided by}} ThumbEE include automatic null pointer checks on every load and store instruction, an instruction {{to perform an}} array bounds check, and special instructions that call a handler. In addition, because it utilises Thumb-2 technology, ThumbEE provides access to registers r8-r15 (where the Jazelle/DBX Java VM state is held). Handlers are small sections of frequently called code, commonly used to implement high level languages, such as allocating memory for a new object. These changes come from <b>repurposing</b> a handful of opcodes, and knowing the core is in the new ThumbEE state.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Frank Lloyd Wright, {{who was in}} Tokyo {{building}} the Imperial Hotel, drew designs for a proposed new campus, as did Antonin Raymond. Although neither of the designs were constructed, Raymond assisted in the move and <b>repurposing</b> of some buildings when the school moved to Nakameguro in 1927. In 1933, local expatriate architect William Merrell Vories was asked to design and build a new main concrete building for the campus, which was completed in 1934. After closing during the war years, the school reopened in 1946. The current campus in Chofu was opened in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Reuse is {{the action}} or {{practice}} of using something again, whether for its original purpose (conventional reuse) or to fulfil a different function (creative reuse or <b>repurposing).</b> It should {{be distinguished from}} recycling, which is the breaking down of used items to make raw materials for the manufacture of new products. Reuse – by taking, but not reprocessing, previously used items – helps save time, money, energy, and resources. In broader economic terms, it can make quality products available to people and organizations with limited means, while generating jobs and business activity {{that contribute to the}} economy.|$|E
25|$|At {{the heart}} of {{scholarly}} text production, preservation, and dissemination lies the university. In a time of unfavorable economic conditions, Fitzpatrick suggests that the university may continue to fulfill its role in these endeavors only by rethinking its mission and <b>repurposing</b> its operational units. While the university press may have originally functioned to disseminate {{the work of an}} institution’s faculty to the larger community, in recent years, the university press has become a market-driven entity that is separate from the academic core of the university. Though university presses typically do not turn a profit and must depend on university subsidies to operate, they are often expected to be financially self-sustaining and, driven by this expectation, function to fulfill a mission much {{different from that of the}} university. Fitzpatrick attributes the recent trend of shuttering university presses to shrinking university budgets and the unsustainable business models in which many presses are forced to operate.|$|E
