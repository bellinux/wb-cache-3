5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>system.</b> Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E
25|$|The first {{practical}} vapour-compression <b>refrigeration</b> <b>system</b> {{was built}} by James Harrison, a British journalist who had emigrated to Australia. His 1856 patent was for a vapour-compression system using ether, alcohol, or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 {{on the banks of}} the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong, Victoria, and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapour-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat-packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation. He later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom. In 1873 he prepared the sailing ship Norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom, which used a cold room system instead of a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>system.</b> The venture was a failure as the ice was consumed faster than expected.|$|E

25|$|This {{point of}} view argues that {{management}} (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop. Factors cited include the filling of the MIC tanks beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production {{at the end of}} 1984, allowing several safety systems to be inoperable due to poor maintenance, and switching off safety systems to save money— including the MIC tank <b>refrigeration</b> <b>system</b> which could have mitigated the disaster severity, and non-existent catastrophe management plans. Other factors identified by government inquiries included undersized safety devices and the dependence on manual operations.

25|$|A {{refrigeration}} system's {{coefficient of}} performance (CoP) {{is very important in}} determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use performance factor (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It {{is important to note that}} both CoP and PF for a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>system</b> are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system's performance.|$|E

25|$|The main {{inefficiency}} in {{a common}} thermal working machine is the expansion valve, which allows to pass the refrigerant liquid from the low pressure blow pressure without using the potential energy available. This patented and published invention in 2017 by Giuseppe Verde adopts a special technique based on power regeneration for internal cycles, {{in order to reduce}} the consumption of electricity. Innovation is therefore linked to the insertion of a heat exchanger for the recovery of energy and an alternator within a conventional <b>refrigeration</b> <b>system.</b> Applying this device results in a high improvement in energy efficiency and refrigeration capacity. Both of these effects increase when the operating temperature and the evaporation temperature decrease. In addition, an advantageous object of the present invention is the insertion of an electric charge accumulator comprising an automatic timed control system for switching off the electric circuit, which guarantees the possibility of economically benefiting the multi-hour tariff electric energy.|$|E
25|$|After delivery, Irma {{served on}} the BergenNewcastle route until she was {{transferred}} to Norway {{in the autumn of}} 1921 to carry out tourist voyages to the North Cape and Spitsbergen in the summer seasons. In 1927, she was put on the NorwayHamburg route, replacing SS Neptun and SS Mira. A new heating system was installed in 1913 and wireless radio in 1914. Irma had a new streamlined rudder put in place in 1928. In 1931, she joined the Hurtigruten route in Norway, replacing SS Hera after the latter's shipwreck in March that year. Irma was rebuilt that year and once again the year after that. In a series of upgrades she received a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>system</b> in 1933, improved navigational equipment in 1938 and an echo sounding device in 1939. Irma was a very popular ship amongst her passengers, with her smoking salon receiving particular praise. She had only one serious accident in the pre-war years, which occurred when she hit a reef off Kabelvåg in the Lofoten islands in 1937. Although suffering leaks in her port side, Irma managed to make port in Kabelvåg and put ashore all of her 120 passengers. Repairs were carried out at a shipyard in Bergen.|$|E
25|$|The factory was {{not well}} {{equipped}} to handle the gas created by the sudden addition of water to the MIC tank. The MIC tank alarms had not been working {{for four years and}} there was only one manual back-up system, compared to a four-stage system used in the United States. The flare tower and several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service for five months before the disaster. Only one gas scrubber was operating: it could not treat such a large amount of MIC with sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), which would have brought the concentration down to a safe level. The flare tower could only handle a quarter of the gas that leaked in 1984, and moreover it was out of order {{at the time of the}} incident. To reduce energy costs, the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>system</b> was idle. The MIC was kept at 20 degrees Celsius, not the 4.5 degrees advised by the manual. Even the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes, was non-operational for unknown reasons. Slip-blind plates that would have prevented water from pipes being cleaned from leaking into the MIC tanks, had the valves been faulty, were not installed and their installation had been omitted from the cleaning checklist. As MIC is water-soluble, deluge guns were in place to contain escaping gases from the stack. The water pressure was too weak for the guns to spray high enough to reach the gas which would have reduced the concentration of escaping gas significantly. In addition to it, carbon steel valves were used at the factory, even though they were known to corrode when exposed to acid.|$|E

40|$|To {{view the}} final version of this © SAGE {{publication}} go here: [URL] and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>systems</b> are extensively adopted in homes, industry and vehicles. An important step in achieving a better performance and a higher energy efficiency for air-conditioning and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>systems</b> is a control-based model and a suitable control strategy. As a result, a dynamic model based on the moving-boundary and lumped-parameter method is developed in this paper. Unlike existing models, the proposed model lumps the effects of the fins into two equivalent parameters without adding any complexity and considers the effect produced by the superheated section of the condenser, resulting in a model that is not only simpler but also more accurate than the existing models. In addition, a model predictive controller is designed {{on the basis of the}} proposed model to enhance the energy efficiency of the air-conditioning and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>systems.</b> Simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the model. The experiments show that an energy saving of about 8 % can be achieved by using the proposed model predictive controller compared with the conventional on–off controller under the examined scenario. The better performance of the proposed controller requires electrification of the automotive air-conditioning and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>systems</b> so as to eliminate the idling caused by running the air-conditioning and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>systems</b> when a vehicle stops.

25|$|The {{measured}} {{capacity of}} refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of power. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For {{commercial and industrial}} <b>refrigeration</b> <b>systems,</b> {{most of the world}} uses the kilowatt (kW) as the basic unit of refrigeration. Typically, commercial and industrial <b>refrigeration</b> <b>systems</b> in North America are rated in tons of refrigeration (TR). Historically, one TR was defined as the energy removal rate that will freeze one short ton of water at 0°C (32°F) in one day. This was very important because many early <b>refrigeration</b> <b>systems</b> were in ice houses. The simple unit allowed owners of these early <b>refrigeration</b> <b>systems</b> to measure a day's output of ice against energy consumption, and to compare their plant to one down the street. While ice houses make up a much smaller part of the refrigeration industry than they once did, the unit TR has remained in North America.
