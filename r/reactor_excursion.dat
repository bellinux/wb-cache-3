40|$|On January 3, 1961, at the National Reactor Testing Station, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, the Stationary Low Power Reactor No. 1 (SL- 1) {{experienced}} a major nuclear excursion, killing three people, and destroying the reactor core.

40|$|Caesium is {{probably}} the most important fission product created during the irradiation of nuclear fuel. The relatively high fission yields of the stable and long-lived isotopes of Cs, the low boiling point of Cs (670 *C) and the low dissociation temperature of its oxides (< 700 *C), the high gamma reactivity of 137 -Cs with a half-life of 30. 7 years, and the high chemical reactivity of Cs dictate that its behaviour is considered in all aspects of the nuclear cycle. In the context of nuclear fuel performance Cs is second in importance only to xenon.

40|$|<b>Reactor</b> <b>Excursion</b> and Leak Analysis Program (RELAP) is {{a widely}} {{acceptable}} computer code for thermal hydraulics modeling of Nuclear Power Plants. It calculates thermal- hydraulic transients in water-cooled nuclear reactors by solving approximations to the one-dimensional, two-phase equations of hydraulics in an arbitrarily connected system of nodes. However, the preparation of input file and subsequent analysis of results in this code is a tedious task. The development of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for preparation of the input file for RELAP- 5 is done with the validation of GUI generated Input File. The GUI is developed in Microsoft Visual Studio using Visual C Sharp (C#) as programming language. The Nodalization diagram is drawn graphically and the program contains various component forms along with the starting data form, which are launched for properties assignment to generate Input File Cards serving as GUI for the user. The GUI is provided with Open / Save function to store and recall the Nodalization diagram along with Components ’ properties. The GUI generated Input File is validated for several case studies and individual component cards are compared with the originally required format. The generated Input File of RELAP is found consistent with the requirement of RELAP. The GUI provided a useful platform for simulating complex hydrodynamic problems efficiently with RELAP...|$|E
40|$|The {{main object}} of {{interest}} was a typical fuel assembly, which constitutes a core of the nuclear reactor. The aim of the paper is to describe the phenomena and calculate thermal-hydraulic characteristic parameters in the fuel assembly for a European Pressurized Reactor (EPR). To perform thermal-hydraulic calculations, the RELAP 5 code was used. This code allows to simulate steady and transient states for reactor applications. It is also an appropriate calculation tool {{in the event of}} a loss-of-coolant accident in light water reactors. The fuel assembly model with nodalization in the RELAP 5 (<b>Reactor</b> <b>Excursion</b> and Leak Analysis Program) code was presented. The calculations of two steady states for the fuel assembly were performed: the nominal steady-state conditions and the coolant flow rate decreased to 60 % of the nominal EPR flow rate. The calculation for one transient state for a linearly decreasing flow rate of coolant was simulated until a new level was stabilized and SCRAM occurred. To check the correctness of the obtained results, the authors compared them against the reactor technical documentation available in the bibliography. The obtained results concerning steady states nearly match the design data. The hypothetical transient showed the importance of the need for correct cooling in the reactor during occurrences exceeding normal operation. The performed analysis indicated consequences of the coolant flow rate limitations during the reactor operation...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{check valves}} {{in the nuclear}} {{industry}} is of great importance from a safety precaution point ofview (McElhaney, 1995). Choosing check valves for these high-pressurized systems comes with agreat challenge. The valves causes what is called check valve slams when closing, leading to a hugepressure wave traveling through the system. To prevent this from happening calculations have to bedone {{to see what kind}} of forces are generated during a check valve slam. When the forces are known itis easier designing systems that will endure these slams. A commonly used software in the nuclearindustry is RELAP 5 (<b>Reactor</b> <b>Excursion</b> and Leak Analysis Program), its main purpose is to calculatetransients in piping systems. This program can also be used when calculating a check valve slam. Buthow precise is the code compared to the real event? By doing an experiment measuring pressures created by swing check valves during slams, the codewas compared to real data and analyzed to decide what was of importance when modeling for thesetypes of simulations. The RELAP 5 code was not initially designed to calculate transients during a check valve slam. This isclearly shown when the code overestimates the pressure waves in the system when using themanufacturer data for the check valve model. Matching the data from the simulations in RELAP 5 withthe data recorded from the experiment is not easy. The parameters used for this have no connection tothe specifications for the check valve, which means that transients are hard to estimate withoutexperimental data...|$|E
40|$|Neutronics {{and thermal}} physics studies of BN-VT reactor {{installation}} with 600 -MW thermal power demonstrated the possibility {{in principle to}} achieve the required parameters of high-temperature fast reactor for production of large quantities of hydrogen on the basis, for instance, of one of thermal chemical cycles or high-temperature hydrolysis with high thermal efficiency of use of electric power. Relatively small dimensions, the type of coolant, selection of fissile material and structural materials allow developing nuclear reactor with particular inherent properties (exclusion of prompt-neutron <b>reactor</b> power <b>excursions,</b> removal of decay heat in passive mode) while ensuring enhanced nuclear and radiation safety. Composition of BN-VT reactor facility includes sodium-cooled fast reactor, three cooling loops for emergency heat removal and three sets of equipment of the secondary cooling loop for heat transfer from the reactor to chemical installations generating hydrogen or to gas-turbine plant for supplying chemical equipment with electric power. Composition {{of each of the}} cooling loops includes intermediate heat exchanger arranged inside the reactor vessel, centrifugal pump and pipeline for removal and re-introduction of sodium in the reactor core. Contemporary requirements on the safety and financial performance of future generations of nuclear reactors were taken into consideration {{in the development of the}} reactor under study. Implemented calculation studies demonstrated that penetration of hydrogen within the limits of permissible allowances produce practically no effect on the neutronics and safety parameters of the reactor. Solution of the problem of fuel pin stability was mitigated due to the selection of low thermal load on fuel pins. Application of EP- 912 -VD steel as a possible optional structural material was examined. Continued studies of heat-resistant materials and their behavior under irradiation are required...|$|R
40|$|During {{reactivity}} initiated {{accidents in}} {{a core of}} a nuclear <b>reactor,</b> a power <b>excursion</b> occurs on some fuel rods. The consequent rapid boiling {{is a matter of}} study for the nuclear power plants safety evaluation, because of the risk for rod-clad failure. In order to better understand the influence of power excursions and to characterise the phases of the rapid boiling phenomenon, an experimental set-up has been built at IMFT. The test section is a semi annulus. The inner half cylinder is made of a stainless steel foil, heated by Joule effect. Its temperature is measured by an infrared camera filming the backside of the foil, coupled with a high-speed camera for the visualisation of the phenomena. Measurements were made for two types of tests: when a square current signal is applied to the foil and when the current output follows a triangular shape. These measurements showed the influence of both shape and value of the supplied power and of the temperature increase rate on the wall temperature during boiling...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} of delayed fission-product gamma-ray transmission through low-enriched UO{sub 2 } fuel pin lattices {{in an air}} medium were conducted at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Reactor Critical Facility (RCF). The RCF core consists of excess Special Power <b>Excursion</b> <b>Reactor</b> Test (SPERT) fuel pins, enriched to 4. 81 weight percent {sup 235 }U, clad in stainless steel. An experimental apparatus was constructed to hold various arrangements of fuel pin lattices. The arrangements consisted of a single activated source pin taken from the reactor core surrounded by inactive fuel pins in an air medium. A sodium-iodide detector and gamma-ray spectroscopy system was used to generate a pulse-height spectrum of the gamma-ray radiation for detector positions outside the lattice. The change in radiation intensity as the detector is rotated about the vertical axis of the lattice, the ''channeling effect,'' was measured. Experimental {{measurements of}} the channeling effect were performed for six arrangements; 3 x 3, 5 x 5, and 7 x 7 lattices, with both the comer position and center position containing the activated pin. The results of the measurements demonstrate that the gamma-ray radiation intensity can vary widely, {{as a function of}} angle, relative to the vertical axis of the lattice...|$|R
40|$|Increases in {{computational}} {{power and}} pressure for more accurate simulations and estimations of accident scenario consequences are driving {{the need for}} Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) [1] of very complex models. While more sophisticated algorithms and computational power address {{the back end of}} this challenge, the front end is still handled by engineers that need to extract meaningful information from the large amount of data and build these complex models. Compounding this problem is the difficulty in knowledge transfer and retention, and the increasing speed of software development. The above-described issues would have negatively impacted deployment of the new high fidelity plant simulator RELAP- 7 (<b>Reactor</b> <b>Excursion</b> and Leak Analysis Program) at Idaho National Laboratory. Therefore, RAVEN that was initially focused to be the plant controller for RELAP- 7 will help mitigate future RELAP- 7 software engineering risks. In order to accomplish such a task Reactor Analysis and Virtual Control Environment (RAVEN) has been designed to provide an easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI) for building plant models and to leverage artificial intelligence algorithms to reduce computational time, improve results, and help the user to identify the behavioral pattern of the Nuclear Power Plants NPPs. In this paper we will present the GUI implementation and its current capability status. We will also introduce the support vector machine algorithms and show our evaluation of their potentiality in increasing the accuracy and reducing the computational costs of PRA analysis. In this evaluation we will refer to preliminary studies performed under the Risk Informed Safety Margins Characterization (RISMC) project of the Light Water Reactors Sustainability (LWRS) campaign [3]. RISMC simulation needs and algorithm testing are currently used as a guidance to prioritize RAVEN developments relevant to PRA...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{presentation}} is to demonstrate the functionality of the Multi Application Small Light Water Reactor (MASLWR) thermal hydraulic test facility and it’s natural circulation operating behavior as well as analyze {{the ability of a}} RELAP 5 - 3 D model to simulate this behavior. The MASLWR facility is introduced with a general overview. Test data collected from steady state operation of the natural circulation configuration of the MASLWR facility will be analyzed and compared to a similar RELAP 5 - 3 D simulation. The MASLWR Test Facility models the NuScale design of a next generation nuclear power reactor. It is used to provide test data to NuScale which is used to verify their thermal hydraulic codes modeling their own reactor. The primary loop of the MASLWR is fully contained in the RPV. The electrically heater core heats the water {{at the bottom of the}} RPV, this hot water rises through the hot leg located centrally in the RPV. At the top of the hot leg the hot water is directed outward and downward to the helical coil steam generator where it is cooled. Once the water is cooled and becomes more dense it then falls down the cold leg and is recirculated into the core. The flow through the primary loop is driven by natural circulation due to the density gradient. In the secondary loop cold water is pumped through the helical coil steam generator. The water boils and exits the coils as steam. Multiple instruments collect data from the steam and then it is vented to atmosphere. The RPV is configured to simulate being located inside a High Pressure Containment (HPC) [1]. The test facility has multiple types of instruments that collect information on pressure drops, temperatures and flow rates in both the primary and secondary loops. Testing has been performed on the MASLWR test facility to analyze the steady state natural circulation in the primary loop. Steady state was achieved at multiple power levels by varying the flow in the secondary loop. At each power level, different flow rates and temperature distributions were observed. This data will serve as a standard for comparison of our RELAP 5 - 3 D simulation. <b>Reactor</b> <b>Excursion</b> and Leak Analysis Program 5 (RELAP 5) is a thermal-hydraulic safety analysis software package specifically catered to nuclear reactor operations [2]. A RELAP model of the MASLWR test facility has already been built by Dr. Brian Woods and Jordan Bowser of Oregon State University. This model has been modified to fit the parameters of the test data collected. The flow losses built into this model are the most accurate that can be determined with presently available test data, but could be greatly improved with future testing of the MASLWR test facility. The model was run at multiple power levels to determine flow rates required to maintain steady state of the natural circulation system. The RELAP model consists of all components described in the MASLWR test facility overview with a simplified heat removal structure in place of the helical coil steam generator. Steady-state operation of the facility is defined as unchanging conditions in both the primary and secondary systems with respect to time during operation. Data from the MASLWR testing and the RELAP model were compared. The specific paremeters of the most interest are mass flow rate of the primary coolant, and temperature of the coolant at different locations throughout the natural circulation loop. The temperature data from the two sources turned out to be within the tolerances of the testing instruments. The mass flow rate data from the RELAP model underestimated the true data and was outside of the instrument tolerances. In conclusion the inaccuracy of the mass flow rates can be connected to the inaccurate flow losses built into the RELAP model. It is intended that future testing of the MASLWR test facility will be used to determine more accurate flow losses...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation of the radiological {{consequences of the}} RB <b>reactor</b> reactivity <b>excursion</b> accident, which occurred on October 15, 1958, and an estimation of the total doses received by the operators were run by the MCNP 5 computer code. The simulation was carried out under the same assumptions as those used in the 1960 IAEA-organized experimental simulation of the accident: total fission energy of 80 MJ released in the accident and the frozen positions of the operators. The time interval of exposure to high doses received by the operators has been estimated. Data on the RB 1 / 1958 reactor core relevant to the accident are given. A short summary of the accident scenario has been updated. A 3 -D model of the reactor room and the RB reactor tank, with {{all the details of}} the core, created. For dose determination, 3 -D simplified, homogenised, sexless and faceless phantoms, placed inside the reactor room, have been developed. The code was run for a number of neutron histories which have given a dose rate uncertainty of less than 2 %. For the determination of radiation spectra escaping the reactor core and radiation interaction in the tissue of the phantoms, the MCNP 5 code was run (in the KCODE option) and “mode n p e”, with a 55 -group neutron spectra, 35 -group gamma ray spectra and a 10 -group electron spectra. The doses were determined by using the conversion of flux density (obtained by the F 4 tally) in the phantoms to doses using factors taken from ICRP- 74 and from the deposited energy of neutrons and gamma rays (obtained by the F 6 tally) in the phantoms’ tissue. A rough estimation of the time moment when the odour of ozone was sensed by the operators is estimated {{for the first time and}} given in Appendix A. 1. Calculated total absorbed and equivalent doses are compared to the previously reported ones and an attempt to understand and explain the reasons for the obtained differences has been made. A Root Cause Analysis of the accident was done and, for the first time, a Cause and Effect diagram has been created in Cause Mapping methodology and shown in Appendix A. 2...|$|R
40|$|Recent program {{requirements}} of the US Department of Energy/NNSA {{have led to a}} need for a criticality accident alarm system to be installed at a newly activated facility. The Criticality Safety Group of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) was able to recover and store for possible future use approximately 200 neutron criticality detectors and 20 master alarm panels from the former Rocky Flats Plant in Golden, Colorado when the plant was closed. The Criticality Safety Group participated in a facility analysis and evaluation, the engineering design and review process, as well as the refurbishment, testing, and recalibration of the Rocky Flats criticality alarm system equipment {{to be used in the}} new facility. In order to demonstrate the functionality and survivability of the neutron detectors to the effects of an actual criticality accident, neutron detector testing was performed at the French CEA Valduc SILENE reactor from October 7 to October 19, 2010. The neutron detectors were exposed to three criticality events or pulses generated by the SILENE <b>reactor.</b> The first <b>excursion</b> was performed with a bare or unshielded reactor, and the second excursion was made with a lead shielded/reflected reactor, and the third excursion with a polyethylene reflected core. These tests of the Rocky Flats neutron detectors were performed as a part of the 2010 Criticality Accident Alarm System Benchmark Measurements at the SILENE Reactor. The principal investigators for this series of experiments were Thomas M. Miller and John C. Wagner of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with Nicolas Authier and Nathalie Baclet of CEA Valduc.

50|$|Anatoly Dyatlov, {{the deputy}} chief engineer, {{supervised}} the test. At the moment reactor power slipped to 30MW, he insisted the operators continue the test. He overrode Akimov's and Toptunov's objections, threatening to hand the shift to Tregub (the previous shift operator who had remained on-site), intimidating them into attempting to increase the reactor power. During {{this period of time}} the reactor protection system was vetoed to prevent automatic shutdown of the reactor. The power stabilized at 200MW at around 1:00 am and did not rise further, due to continued xenon poisoning of the core. Later the test was commenced, then the <b>reactor</b> showed power <b>excursion</b> and was scrammed. As the control rods dropped into the core, their design (which incorporated a graphite plug at the bottom of each rod) introduced additional moderation and hence reactivity into the reactor system. The explosion occurred as the control rods were falling, and the subsequent damage prevented insertion into the reactor. Dyatlov ordered reactor cooling with emergency speed, assuming the reactor was intact and the explosion had been caused by hydrogen accumulating in the emergency tank of the safety control system. Other employees went to the control room, reporting damage. Dyatlov went to the backup control room, pressing the AZ-5 button there and disconnecting power to the control rod servodrives; despite seeing the graphite blocks scattered on the ground outside the plant, he still believed the reactor was intact. Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov returned to report the reactor damage they had seen, but Dyatlov insisted what they had seen was the results of an explosion of the emergency tank, claiming the explosion of the 110 m³ tank at Level +71 was sufficient to destroy the central hall roof. Dyatlov reported his assumptions as reality to Bryukhanov and Fomin, the higher-level managers. In the corridor, he met Genrikh and Kurguz and sent them to the medical station. He ran to the control room of Block 3, ordered Bagdasarov to shut down Reactor 3, then returned to control room 4 and ordered Akimov to call the daytime shift and get people to the affected unit; namely Lelechenko, whose crew had to remove hydrogen from the Generator 8 electrolyzer. At 2:00, Dyatlov ordered Akimov to feed water to the reactor, and together with Gorbachenko went to survey the plant from the outside. Despite seeing the fuel and graphite scattered around, he still believed the reactor was intact. They then returned to the control room. At 5:00 am, he got sick and together with Gorbachenko went to the medical unit. Fomin replaced him at his post with Sitnikov.|$|R
