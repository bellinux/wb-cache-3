Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in new players and consequently was to blame for relegation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in <b>refusals</b> based model for validating timed systems. We propose a new <b>refusals</b> graph named timed <b>refusals</b> regions graphs (TRRGs). In this case specifications are modeled by durational actions timed automata (DATA*) based on maximality semantics which claim that actions have durations. This latter model is in one hand useful for modeling and validating reel aspects of systems. In the other hand, it is determinizable. In TRRG, <b>refusals</b> could be temporary or permanent. Permanent <b>refusals</b> are provoked by the non-determinism in the specifications. However, temporary <b>refusals</b> are the result of the fact that actions elapse in time. We propose a framework for generating timed <b>refusals</b> regions graph. This framework is implemented by a combination of Meta-modelling and Graph Grammars, to transform a DATA * structure into a TRRG. This permits the automatic generation of a visual modeling tool. Finally, we argue the use of TRRG in formal test of timed systems...|$|R

5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample <b>refusal</b> conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath <b>refusal</b> up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E

40|$|<b>Refusals</b> are a {{significant}} source of non-response in surveys. During field periods of some surveys reasons for <b>refusals</b> are collected in call record data (as part of para-data). This article presents a study employing a content analysis of open-ended comments on reasons for <b>refusals</b> collected by interviewers in a survey of the German population (ALLBUS). We analysed the reasons for <b>refusals</b> contained in these comments, as well as to what extent these comments include information about factors relevant to participation in surveys. Additionally, we analysed the impact of interviewer characteristics – gender, age, education and experience – on data collection using various multilevel multinomial models. The results show that interviewer comments provide typical reasons for <b>refusals,</b> as well as specific information about target persons, their environment and the survey process. Interviewers' age and education influenced the collection of reasons for <b>refusals.</b> At the same time interviewer variances (obtained through multinomial multilevel models) were very high, showing that interviewers prefer to report certain reasons for <b>refusals.</b> The highest interviewer level variances were obtained for providing no comments at all. To improve data quality and reduce high interviewer impact, we suggest using improved standardised instruments to collect reasons for <b>refusals.</b> Codings based on a categorisation scheme which we developed for our content analysis show high reliability (kappa =. 81). Thus, this scheme {{can be used as a}} basis for developing such standardised instruments. " (author's abstract...|$|R
5|$|In 1778, Curtis {{returned}} to Britain in Eagle, {{but refused to}} carry out an order to sail the ship to the Far East, a <b>refusal</b> which earned the enmity of Lord Sandwich.

As punishment for his disobedience Curtis was unemployed for the next two years, before he secured the new frigate HMS Brilliant for service in the Mediterranean in 1780. Ordered to Gibraltar, Brilliant was attacked by a superior Spanish squadron close to the fortress and was forced to escape to British-held Menorca. Curtis's first lieutenant Colin Campbell complained extensively about his captain's <b>refusal</b> to leave port while enemy shipping passed by the harbour, but Curtis was waiting for a 25-ship relief convoy which he met and safely convoyed into Gibraltar, bringing supplies to the defenders of the Great Siege of Gibraltar then in progress.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates <b>refusals</b> {{performed by}} the characters in Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave. The objectives of the research are to identify the types, to describe the realizations, and to analyze the functions of <b>refusals.</b> 	The research applied descriptive-qualitative method. The data were {{in the form of}} utterances spoken by all characters in 12 Years a Slave, while the contexts of the data were the dialogues among the characters. The source of data was 12 Years a Slave movie. The data analysis was conducted by watching the movie; transferring the data into data sheet; identifying the data into the types, realizations, and functions of refusals; applying trustworthiness; and drawing conclusions. To enhance trustworthiness of the data, the data was triangulated by the researcher’s supervisors and fellow linguistic students. 	The results of the research are described as follows. First, there are three types of <b>refusals</b> which are {{performed by the}} characters in 12 Years a Slave. The types of <b>refusals</b> are direct type, indirect type, and adjuncts to <b>refusals.</b> Indirect type becomes the main type of <b>refusals</b> which is performed by the characters. Second, each type of <b>refusals</b> has particular realizations. Direct type is realized in the form of non-performative statement. Meanwhile, indirect type {{is in the form of}} the statement of an alternative, avoidance, excuse/reason/explanation, the attempt to dissuade the interlocutor, and the statement of a principle/philosophy. Then, adjuncts to <b>refusals</b> are realized in the form of gratitude/appreciation. Third, there are eight functions of <b>refusals</b> found in 12 Years a Slave. The functions of <b>refusals</b> include (1) showing a determination in refusing; (2) showing unwillingness to comply with the request, offer, suggestion, or invitation; (3) negotiating the request, offer, suggestion, or invitation; (4) avoiding a conflict or ending an argument with the refusee; (5) demanding understanding from the refusee; (6) mocking the refusee or the request, offer, suggestion, or invitation; (7) implying the unfairness of the request, offer, suggestion, or invitation; and (8) showing gratitude to the refusee...|$|R
