25|$|In the 2013 Mickey Mouse {{television}} series Minnie was restored to her classic 1930s look with the flowered bowler hat and flapper girl outfit. Minnie also gained more character quirks and, like the older cartoons {{was subject to}} more slapstick and <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> cartoon gags.|$|E
25|$|Fresh air {{for both}} the crew and engine was drawn into the tank via an 18m long <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> to which a float was {{attached}} to keep one end above the waterâ€™s surface. A radio antenna was also attached to the float to provide communication between the tank crew and the transport barge. The tank's engine was converted to be cooled with seawater, and the exhaust pipes were fitted with overpressure valves. Any water seeping into the tank's hull could be expelled by an internal bilge pump. Navigation underwater was accomplished using a directional gyrocompass or by following instructions radioed from the transport barge.|$|E

25|$|The Schwimmpanzer II was a {{modified}} version of the Panzer II which, at 8.9 tons, was light enough to float with the attachment of long rectangular buoyancy boxes on each side of the tank's hull. The boxes were machined from aluminium stock and filled with Kapok sacks for added buoyancy. Motive power came from the tank's own tracks which were connected by rods to a propeller shaft running through each float. The Schwimmpanzer II could make 5.7km/h in the water. An inflatable <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> around the turret ring created a waterproof seal between the hull and turret. The tank's 2cm gun and coaxial machinegun were kept operational and could be fired while the tank was still making its way ashore. Because of the great width of the pontoons, Schwimmpanzer IIs were to be deployed from specially-modified Type C landing barges, from which they could be launched directly into open water from a large hatch cut into the stern. The Germans converted 52 of these tanks to amphibious use prior to Sea Lion's cancellation.|$|E
500|$|White {{committed}} suicide by {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} on October 21, 1985. He connected a <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> to his car's exhaust system and routed it to {{the interior of the}} vehicle, which he let fill with carbon monoxide. Mayor Feinstein said, [...] "This latest tragedy should close a very sad chapter in this city's history." [...] According to Orange County lawyer Jeff Walsworth, White had expressed remorse for the killings in February 1984. White reportedly stated that it would always cause him inner turmoil. Inspector Falzone said the contrary, however, commenting that at no time did White express remorse in any form at the deaths of Moscone and Milk.|$|E

The dredge has a suction capacity of about 10,000 cubic meters of water and gravel per hour, resulting in about 250 tons of material to be processed for diamonds. The anticipated yield is approximately 60 diamonds per hour, or roughly 240,000 carats annually.|$|E
2500|$|Minnie's early {{personality}} is cute, playful, musical and flirtatious. [...] She often portrays an entertainer like a dancer or a musician that Mickey {{is trying to}} win the affection of. [...] Part of the comedy of these early shorts is the varying degree of success Mickey has in wooing Minnie. [...] Unlike later cartoons after the redesign, Minnie often becomes a damsel in distress that Mickey tries to rescue. [...] She is also subject {{to a lot of}} slapstick and <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> animation gags. [...] Over the course of the thirties, Minnie's and Mickey's relationship solidified and they eventually became a steady couple.|$|E

2500|$|Beebe and Barton {{conducted}} {{their first}} {{test of the}} sphere on May 27, 1930, descending to the relatively shallow depth of 45 feet {{in order to ensure}} that everything worked properly. [...] For a second test, they sent the Bathysphere down unmanned to a far greater depth, and found after pulling it up that the <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> carrying the electrical and phone cables had become twisted forty-five times around the cable suspending the Bathysphere. [...] After a second unmanned test dive on June 6 in which the cord did not become tangled, Beebe and Barton performed their first deep dive in the Bathysphere, reaching a depth of 803ft (245 m).|$|E
2500|$|The casting of {{the steel}} sphere was handled by Watson Stillman Hydraulic Machinery Company in Roselle, New Jersey, and the cord to raise and lower the sphere was {{provided}} by John A. Roebling's Sons Company. [...] General Electric provided a lamp which would be mounted just {{inside one of the}} windows to illuminate animals outside the sphere, and Bell Laboratories provided a telephone system by which divers inside the sphere could communicate with the surface. [...] The cables for the telephone and to provide electricity for the lamp were sealed inside a <b>rubber</b> <b>hose,</b> which entered the body of the Bathysphere through a stuffing box.|$|E
2500|$|The bridge {{holds the}} strings above the cello and {{transfers}} their vibrations {{to the top}} of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The bridge is usually positioned by the cross point of the [...] "f-hole" [...] (i.e., where the horizontal line occurs in the [...] "f"). The f-holes, named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process. The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small length of <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier. This keeps the wood components of the cello from drying out.|$|E
50|$|Braided {{stainless}} steel brake lines (also known as braided {{stainless steel}} brake hoses) are flexible hoses fitted to a hydraulic brake system.

25|$|The term ethical {{foie gras}} or humane foie gras {{is also used}} for gavage-based foie gras {{production}} that {{is more concerned with}} the animal's welfare (using <b>rubber</b> <b>hoses</b> rather than steel pipes for feeding). Others have expressed skepticism at these claims of humane treatment, as earlier attempts to produce fattened livers without gavage have not produced satisfactory results.|$|R
2500|$|Those arrested were {{subjected}} to starvation and physical beating {{in an effort to}} gain testimony to be used against strike leaders. One such prisoner, a field worker named Alfred Nelson, was hauled from county to county where he was held incommunicado, sweated, starved, beaten, and repeatedly threatened with death unless he confessed to participation in the killings. In Martinez, Nelson was taken from jail to a room in a hotel where he was beaten by a sheriff and a private detective with pistol butts and a <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> and threatened with summary execution. Nelson refused to confess and was eventually returned to jail. The treatment of Nelson shocked Martinez District Attorney A.B. McKenzie, who declared Nelson's treatment to have been [...] "one of the biggest outrages that has ever been perpetuated in this state." [...] The Swedish consulate in San Francisco lodged a formal protest on behalf of Nelson, a Swedish national.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the renovated}} Bathysphere, Beebe and Barton began {{preparing}} for their planned descent {{of half a}} mile. [...] Their ship once again was the Ready, this time towed by a tug called the Powerful. [...] During their first test dive, they demanded to be pulled up after descending only four feet because the sphere had begun to leak; they soon discovered this was because Tee-Van had neglected to fasten all of the bolts that hold the hatch shut. [...] Another problem occurred on their second test dive, during which they discovered that {{the lower end of}} the <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> holding the power cable and phone line had begun to deteriorate, and they spent the rest of the day reversing the hose's direction so that the end which was deteriorating would be the end above the water. [...] For a third test dive, they sent down the Bathysphere unoccupied but with Barton's camera, which had not yet captured any footage of deep-sea animals, pointed at the center window. [...] Most of the footage from Barton's camera was unintelligible, but it captured one image of a deep-sea fish, and more importantly it came up dry.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1944, {{all of the}} Resistance governments {{agreed to}} accept the {{authority}} of the Free French government based in Algiers (until 1962 Algeria was considered to be part of France) and the Resistance was renamed FFI (Forces FranÃ§aises de l'IntÃ©rieur-Forces of the Interior). The Germans refused to accept the resistance as legitimate opponents and any rÃ©sistant captured faced the prospect of torture and/or execution as the Germans maintained that the Hague and Geneva conventions did not apply to the resistance. By designating the resistance as part of the French armed forces was intended to provide the Resistance with legal protection and allow the French to threaten the Germans with the possibility of prosecution for war crimes. The designation did not help. For example, the rÃ©sistante Sindermans was arrested in Paris on 24 February 1944 after she was found to be carrying forged papers. As she recalled: [...] "Immediately, they handcuffed me and took me to be interrogated. Getting no reply, they slapped in the face with such force that I fell from the chair. Then they whipped me with a <b>rubber</b> <b>hose,</b> full in the face. The interrogation began at 10 o'clock in the morning and ended at 11 o'clock that night. I must tell you I had been pregnant for three months".|$|E

2500|$|On October 31, 1983, about 2:00p.m., {{five members}} of a {{construction}} crew saw a 100-foot-long sea serpent off Stinson Beach, which is just north of San Francisco, California. A flagman named Gary saw it first swimming towards the cliffside road which the work crew was repairing. He radioed {{another member of the}} work crew, Matt Ratto, and told him to grab the binoculars. Ratto began looking at the sea serpent when it was 100 yards offshore and {{less than a quarter of}} a mile away. Ratto said, [...] "The body came out of the water first." [...] He added, [...] "It was black with three humps." [...] He continued, [...] "There were three bends. like humps and they rose straight up." [...] He further described it as a [...] "humpy, flat-backed thing". He also made a sketch of the animal which appeared to be a round headed, blunt nosed, snake-like creature followed by 3 vertical arches or coils sticking out of the water. Another eyewitness, Steve Bjora, said [...] "The sucker was going 45 to 50 miles an hour." [...] He also described the animal saying, [...] "It was clipping. It was boogying. It looked like a long eel." [...] Marlene Martin, the Caltran safety engineer who was over seeing the work crew also saw the animal. She said, [...] "It shocked the hell out of me" [...] adding, [...] "That thing's so big he deserves front page coverage." [...] She went on to say, [...] "It was hard to describe how big it was. I have no creative imagination. It was a snake-like thing that arched itself up and was so long it made humps above the water." [...] Martin first saw it near Bolinas and saw it swim the whole way to Stinson beach then watched it turn around and head towards the Farallon Islands. Martin said, [...] "It had a wake as big as a power boat's and it was going about 65 miles an hour. It looked like a great big <b>rubber</b> <b>hose</b> as it moved. If someone had gotten in its way it would have plowed right though them." [...] Before it went underwater Martin saw it lift its head and a portion of its body directly behind its head out of the water then open its mouth. Martin said, [...] "It was like it was playing." [...] She described the animal as a [...] "giant snake or a dragon, with a mouth like an alligator's." [...] She continued, [...] "It was at least 15 or 20 feet in circumference, but it was hard to tell how long it was. I mean, how long is a snake? Marlin Martin concluded by saying, [...] "He should have the whole damn ocean. It's his territory. He's the King of the Sea!" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in <b>hose</b> construction. Where <b>rubber</b> <b>hoses</b> typically consist of a <b>rubber</b> inner <b>hose</b> wrapped in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer sheath, braided stainless steel hoses typically consist of a TeflonÂ® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner hose wrapped in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as <b>rubber</b> <b>hoses</b> in terms of an inner hose wrapped in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|R
