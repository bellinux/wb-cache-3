5000|$|The Mighty Lemon Drops, feeling wrongly pigeonholed {{from their}} {{previous}} {{works as a}} [...] "doom and gloom" [...] band, decided in early 1989 to name their new album Laughter to reflect the group's shift in musical direction and {{to distance themselves from}} other bands with whom they had often been compared.

[...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists.

500|$|Rivera's cut fastball was a {{respected}} pitch among major league hitters. Jim Thome called it [...] "the single best pitch {{ever in the}} game". David Ortiz echoed his sentiment, saying, [...] "His cutter was the single best pitch I've ever seen, but the <b>really</b> <b>amazing</b> thing is how {{he was able to}} do it for so many years. Are there guys now who have stuff as nasty as Mariano? Maybe for one year, two years. But nobody could maintain it like he did." [...] In 2004, ESPN.com ranked his cutter as the best [...] "out pitch" [...] in baseball. Olney described his cut fastball as [...] "the most dominant pitch of a generation". Although switch-hitters usually bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers to better see the ball's release point, switch-hitters occasionally batted right-handed when facing the right-handed Rivera to avoid being jammed on their hands by his cutter. Similarly, some managers, such as Bruce Bochy in the 1998 World Series, sent right-handed batters to pinch hit for left-handers [...] against Rivera, thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties to hit. Opposing hitters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup or batting practice bats, rather than risk their best bats being broken by his cutter.|$|E

And in this discussion that we had, I was the only person who said, 'I totally get it', which was alarming to me.

We realized that it wasn’t necessarily the content that was bringing them together but their obsession, in the coolest way. These were girls that, even though they were subscribed to both channels, were also posting about books on Tumblr or they had their own channels; they were just super fans. So we thought “How do we have a place where these creators can come together and sort of geek out together?” We started digging in and after many brainstorming sessions and hours of work and lots of pizza, Wonderly came to be." ...|$|E

Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, your priorities shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for you maybe doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a <b>really</b> <b>amazing</b> performance. You want people to just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't do that anymore, you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna be sitting on stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk.
