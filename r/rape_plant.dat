40|$|According to an {{official}} french life cycle study, the energetic balance of biodiesel produced from {{oil seed crops}} is about 2. 99 for oil seed rape and 3. 16 for sunflower. Diesel greenhouse gas emissions are roughly four times as important as biodiesel emissions from oil seed crops. So presently, these two major performances of sustainability result very positive. For oil seed rape, development of acreage on deep soils, decrease of N fertilisation rate, decrease of energetic costs in N fertilisers industry and development of minimum tillage should continue to improve on energetic balance. On the contrary, for sunflower, the present trend is not an improvement of its energetic balance.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{designed}} to explore {{the problem of the}} rapingn crops encoded in the form of words, phrases, sentences and even discourse. This scientific study raised several issues, such as How do people manage <b>raping</b> <b>plant</b> as one of the supporting community cultural activity? How kerapingan forms of expression are seen as ideas, thoughts, and ideology of the environment in which they live? What are the meanings contained in the expression of kerapingan? What are the functions of kerapaingan expressions relating to the relationship between people and <b>raping</b> <b>plants?</b> This paper aims to describe the raping crop management, kerapingan form of expression, the meaning contained in kerapingan expression, and function of kerapingan expressions. To explain the problems of the study, eco-linguistic framework is used. The principle of eco-linguistic theory is a way of managing raping crop diversity to create a mutually dependent relationship between the public and <b>raping</b> <b>plants,</b> insects, and other plants.

40|$|Reduction of cadmium (Cd) {{accumulation}} in farm products {{has become}} more and more important in order to produce them in a safe and sustainable manner. It is necessary to elucidate mechanisms of Cd distribution in plants. However, these mechanisms are not fully understood. The purpose of our work is to clarify these mechanisms by visualizing Cd absorption, transport and accumulation non-invasively using positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS). 107 Cd (half-life: 6. 5 hr) was used as a positron-emitting tracer in the PETIS experiments. We succeeded to obtain serial images of cadmium distribution in oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> (Brassica napus L.). Strong 107 Cd signals were observed in the basal region of the shoot.

Molecular analyses of the microbial communities after each cycle showed that the obligate parasite Olpidium brassicae infected the roots of oilseed rape within 4 weeks after the first planting (irrespective of the influence of rhizodeposits alone or in the presence of fresh detached root material), and consistently dominated the rhizosphere fungal community, ranging in relative abundance from 43 to 88...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the beneficial role of selenium (Se) in protecting oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) plants from cadmium (Cd+ 2) and lead (Pb+ 2) toxicity. Exogenous Se markedly reduced Cd and Pb concentration in both roots and shoots. Supplementation of the medium with Se (5, 10 and 15 mg kg- 1) alleviated the negative effect of Cd and Pb on growth {{and led to a}} decrease in oxidative damages caused by Cd and Pb. Furthermore, Se enhanced superoxide free radicals (O 2 -), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and lipid peroxidation, as indicated by malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation, but decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. Meanwhile, the presence of Cd and Pb in the medium affected Se speciation in shoots.

40|$|The {{conditions}} were investigated {{under which the}} development cycle in winter rape could be markedly reduced by grafting. Scions from non vernalized seedlings were grafted onto stock plants beginning their generative phase. Winter <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> vernalized under natural field conditions and spring <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> in the initial generative phase were used as stock. Best results were obtained by grafting scions from plants at the stage of 4 leaves, i. e. after 3 weeks of growth, onto winter rape stock. With such scions the effectiveness of graftings was high and seed crops were obtained 170 days earlier than under natural field conditions of growth and 80 days earlier than under artificial conditions. Scions grafted onto winter rape stock produced more siliques than those on spring rape. Grafting of scions after cutting off their apical meristems allowed formation of side shoots and consequently resulted in higher yields of siliques; the formation of siliques, however, was delayed by about 10 days as compared to grafts with apical meristems...|$|R
40|$|Background: Insect pollinators play an {{important}} role in crop pollination, but the relative contribution of wild pollinators and honey bees to pollination is currently under debate. There is virtually no information available on the strength of pollination services and the identity of pollination service providers from Asian smallholder farming systems, where fields are small, and variation among fields is high. We established 18 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields along a large geographical gradient in Jiangxi province in China. In each field, oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> were grown in closed cages that excluded pollinators and open cages that allowed pollinator access. The pollinator community was sampled by pan traps for the entire oilseed rape blooming period. Results: Oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> from which insect pollinators were excluded had on average 38 % lower seed set, 17 % lower fruit set and 12 % lower yield per plant, but the seeds were 17 % heavier, and the caged plants had 28 % more flowers and 18 % higher aboveground vegetative biomass than plants with pollinator access. Oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> thus compensate for pollination deficit by producing heavier seeds and more flowers. Regression analysis indicated that local abundance and diversity of wild pollinators were positively associated with seed set and yield/straw ratio, while honey bee abundance was not related to yield parameters. Conclusions: Wild pollinator abundance and diversity contribute to oilseed rape yield by enhancing plant resource allocation to seeds rather than to above-ground biomass. This study highlights the importance of the conservation of wild pollinators to support oilseed rape production in small-holder farming systems in China. </p...|$|R

40|$|Plants of {{the genus}} Brassica {{comprise}} a remarkably diverse group of crops and encompass varieties that are grown as oilseeds, vegetables, condiment mustards and forages. One of the basic requirements for developing hybrid varieties in oilseed Brassica is the availability of proven heterosis. The development of hybrid cultivars {{has been successful in}} many Brassica spp. Midparent heterosis and high-parent heterosis (heterobeltiosis) have extensively been explored and utilized for boosting various quantity and quality traits in rapeseed. Heterosis is commercially exploited in rapeseed and its potential use has been demonstrated in turnip rape (B. rapa L.) and Indian mustard (B. juncea L.) for seed yield and most of the agronomic traits.

40|$|The oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plant,</b> Brassica napus, {{possesses}} two endogenous {{male sterile}} cytoplasms, nap and pol. Previous {{studies have shown}} that nuclear restoration of pol cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is conditioned by a gene, Rfp, that is also involved in modifying transcripts of the pol CMS-associated orf 224 /atp 6 mtDNA region. We now find that the nap nuclear restorer gene Rfn apparently is identical to Mmt, a gene that conditions the modification of transcripts from several different mtDNA regions, including one that is associated with nap CMS and contains orf 222, a chimeric gene related to orf 224. Mmt, in turn, is found to be allelic to Rfp, suggesting that restorer genes for the two cytoplasms represent different alleles or haplotypes of a single nuclear locus. This view is supported by restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping studies that indicate that Rfn and Rfp map to the same chromosomal position. Thus, in contrast to CMS in other species, different forms of Brassica CMS are restored by alleles of a single nuclear locus, and the restoration properties of these alleles reflect their involvement in the modification of transcripts of corresponding CMS-associated mtDNA regions. A survey of 51 varieties from 8 Brassica and Sinapis species failed to find evidence of Rfn(Mmt) in other than fertility-restored, nap cytoplasm B. napus. This suggests that Rfn(Mmt) arose in Brassica with nap cytoplasm and that the necessity for fertility restoration may have provided the selective pressure for its origin and maintenance...|$|E

Previous laboratory behavioural studies using volatiles from non-host plants showed that M. aeneus is repelled by the odour of lavender, Lavendula angustifolia Mill. (Lamiaceae), essential oil. This article reports on semi-field and field trials to investigate this behaviour under more realistic conditions.

40|$|We {{compared}} the seedbanks, seed rains, plant densities and biomasses of weeds under two contrasting systems of management in beet, maize and spring oilseed rape. Weed seedbank and plant density were {{measured at the}} same locations in two subsequent seasons. About 60 fields were sown with each crop. Each field was split, one half being sown with a conventional variety managed according to the farmer's normal practice, the other half being sown with a genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) variety, with weeds controlled by a broad-spectrum herbicide. In beet and <b>rape,</b> <b>plant</b> densities shortly after sowing {{were higher in the}} GMHT treatment. Following weed control in conventional beet, plant densities were approximately one-fifth of those in GMHT beet. In both beet and rape, this effect was reversed after the first application of broad-spectrum herbicide, so that late-season plant densities were lower in the GMHT treatments. Biomass and seed rain in GMHT crops were between one-third and one-sixth of those in conventional treatments. The effects of differing weed-seed returns in these two crops persisted in the seedbank: densities following the GMHT treatment were about 20 % lower than those following the conventional treatment. The effect of growing maize was quite different. Weed density was higher throughout the season in the GMHT treatment. Late-season biomass was 82 % higher and seed rain was 87 % higher than in the conventional treatment. The difference was not subsequently detectable in the seedbank because the total seed return was low after both treatments. In all three crops, weed diversity was little affected by the treatment, except for transient effects immediately following herbicide application...|$|E
30|$|Our {{observations}} {{indicate that}} GE- oilseed rape may {{be capable of}} establishing self perpetuating populations outside agricultural areas, for instance on herbicide-treated railway tracks, infrastructures for the transfer of goods from ship to train, and surrounding disturbed habitats in Switzerland. Furthermore, these populations that are persistent {{from year to year}} may be capable of hybridizing to produce novel genotypes. GE-oilseed rape has been previously found growing along transport axes [24, 26]. However, besides a single GE-oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plant</b> found in the environment in Belgium [31], our results provide the first evidence of such an event in Europe, and put into perspective the assertion that “seed import spills of oilseed rape imports possibly containing GE-material will be mostly confined to port areas” [27]. Although oilseed rape seeds can be transported by birds and mammals or even dispersed through fireworks, feral oilseed rape growing on railway tracks most probably originate from seed spills during transportation or the transfer of goods. The persistence of a population in a given location is attributed to replenishment through fresh seed spill, emergence from the soil seed bank, shedding from feral mature plants, or to dispersal of feral seeds from one location to another [27]. As regards to the seed bank, studies in the northern hemisphere have reported viable seeds of oilseed rape persisting in disturbed soils for at least 5 [*]years and possibly up to 10 [*]years or more in undisturbed soil [32 – 34]. As a consequence, we suggest that every location where GE- oilseed rape is found in Switzerland, monitoring and eradication should be carried out during a period of at least 10 [*]years, as the elimination of feral unauthorised GE-populations is a legal requirement [11].|$|E
40|$|Introgression {{of genes}} from crops into ruderal populations is a {{multi-step}} process requiring sympatry, synchronous flowering, chromosomal compatibility, successful pollination {{and development of}} the zygote, germination, establishment and reproduction of hybrid progeny. The goal of this thesis was to generate data on as many steps in this process as possible and integrate them into a predictive statistical model to estimate the likelihood of successful introgression under a range of scenarios. Rape (Brassica napus) and wild turnip (B. rapa var. oleifera) were used as a model system. A homozygous dominant mutation in the rape genome conferring herbicide resistance provided a convenient marker for the study of introgression. Potential differences between wild turnip populations {{from a wide range of}} geographic locations in New Zealand were examined. Hand pollination established the genetic compatibility of rape and wild turnip and a high potential for gene introgression from rape to wild turnip. Interspecific hybrids were easily generated using wild turnip as the maternal plant, with some minor differences between wild turnip populations. The frequency of successful hybridisation between the two species was higher on the lower raceme. However, the upper raceme produced more dormant interspecific hybrid seed. Field trials, designed to imitate rare rape crop escapes into the ruderal environment, examined the ability of rare rape plants to pollinate wild turnip plants over four summers. At a ratio of 1 <b>rape</b> <b>plant</b> for every 400 wild turnip plants, the incidence of interspecific hybridisation was consistently low ( 75 % of simulations resulted in no interspecific hybrid progeny surviving to flowering in the third generation. In all scenarios, and for all three outputs, the seed set on the interspecific hybrids of the second generation was the major factor that limited the number interspecific hybrid progeny surviving to flowering in the third generation...|$|E

30|$|Seed {{escape and}} {{proliferation}} of HR plants can create severe management problems, especially with persistent crops. Volunteers, that is, crop {{plants in the}} field emerging from the previous crop, create problems when the following crop is a different species or a different variety of the same species. Volunteer management will become more complex if both volunteer plants and crops are resistant to the same herbicide. Crops with characteristics such as shattering and seed persistence are particularly likely to emerge as volunteers. Oilseed rape readily produces volunteers and feral plants, due to its high seed production, high seed losses during harvest and transport, and its secondary dormancy [97]. HR oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> have been found up to 15  years after experimental releases, despite regular control of the fields for volunteers [98, 99]. The recently reported incidence of oilseed rape seed contamination by the non-approved OXY- 235 variety (resistant to oxynil herbicides) in the EU might {{be traced back to}} field trials in France in the nineties [100], indicating that volunteers may emerge even after almost 20  years. Seed spill can also occur outside the fields and along transport routes, potentially leading to HR feral plants that may persist over large spatial and temporal scales [101]. HR feral oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> have been found along transport routes in the US [102], in Switzerland [103] and Japan [104], in regions where they had never been grown.|$|R
40|$|Plant growth {{stimulation}} {{and antagonism}} against phytopathogens by rhizobacteria are widely recognised phenomena, but {{the variation in}} the underlying causal mechanisms between and within different bacterial taxa is still poorly understood. Some bacteria of the genus Serratia {{are known to be}} associated with plant roots, and have potential as possible biocontrol agents in agriculture. This thesis provides the detailed genomic structure of three Serratia plymuthica and one S. proteamaculans isolates with their ability to promote oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plant</b> growth and to inhibit its fungal pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani AG 2 - 1. Differences in the composition of these genomes were reflected in different phenotypes associated with antagonism and plant growth stimulation observed in different experiments. Their genomes contain the basic genetic traits required for survival in the rhizosphere, root colonisation, antibiosis, induced systemic resistance and production of phytohormones and other factors involved in plant growth promotion. Genetically S. proteamaculans is highly diverged from S. plymuthica isolates and was a better plant growth promoter. The three S. plymuthica genomes are almost identical, however significant variation was observed in plant growth promotion and antagonism by these three isolates. A possible explanation could be due to mutation in one or more putative genes. Genome-wide expression profiling of S. plymuthica and S. proteamaculans revealed that they responded to R. solani by activating genes associated with antibiosis, competition and defence mechanisms. Antibiosis seems to be a major mode of action in S. plymuthica AS 13 since genes for pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis and transporters were highly up-regulated while in S. proteamaculans S 4, combination of competition, defense mechanism and antibiosis play a role in antagonism.

In oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>plant</b> Brassica napus AACC and in the artificially synthesized Raphanus alboglabra RRCC, the root-colonizing Trichoderma harzianum TH 12 fungus triggers induced systemic resistance (ISR), and its culture filtrate (CF) triggers a systemic acquired resistance (SAR) response against infection by the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid/ethylene (JA/ET) are plant hormone signals that play important roles in the regulation of ISR and SAR. In this study, at six different time points (1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days post-infection [dpi]), six resistance genes were used as markers of signaling pathways: JA/ET signaling used AOC 3, PDF 1. 2 and ERF 2 genes, while PR- 1, TGA 5 and TGA 6 genes were used as markers of SA signaling. The results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that AOC 3, PDF 1. 2 and ERF 2 expression levels in infected leaves of AACC and RRCC increase at 1 and 2 dpi with S. sclerotiorum or inoculation with TH 12. PR- 1, TGA 5 and TGA 6 expression levels increased at 8 and 10 dpi in infected leaves. PR- 1, TGA 5 and TGA 6 expression levels increased early in plants treated with CF in both of the healthy genotypes. Furthermore, induction of SA- and JA/ET-dependent defense decreased disease symptoms in infected leaves at different times. The results suggest that the RRCC genotype exhibits resistance to disease and that the ability of TH 12 and its CF to induce systemic resistance in susceptible and resistant oilseed rape genotypes exists. In addition, the results indicate {{for the first time that}} in RRCC the SA signaling pathway is involved in resistance to necrotrophic pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{conducted over}} three seasons (2002 – 05) at the Crops Research Unit, University of Reading, investigated effects of canopy management of autumn sown oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera var. biennis (DC.) Metzg.) on competition with grass weeds. Emphasis {{was placed on}} the effect of the crop on the weeds. Rape canopy size was manipulated using sowing date, seed rate and the application of autumn fertilizer. Lolium multiflorum Lam., L. rboucheanum Kunth and Alopecurus myosuroides Huds. were sown as indicative grass weeds. The effects of sowing date, seed rate and autumn nitrogen on crop competitive ability were correlated with rape biomass and fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by the rape floral layer, to the extent that by spring there was good evidence of crop: weed replacement. An increase in seed rate up to the highest plant densities tested increased both rape biomass and competitiveness, e. g. in 2002 / 3, L. multiflorum head density was reduced from 539 to 245 heads/m 2 and spikelet density from 13 170 to 5960 spikelets/m 2 when <b>rape</b> <b>plant</b> density was increased from 16 to 81 plants/m 2. Spikelets/head of Lolium spp. was little affected by rape seed rate, but the length of heads of A. myosuroides was reduced by 9 %when plant density was increased from 29 – 51 plants/m 2. Autumn nitrogen increased rape biomass and reduced L. multiflorum head density (415 and 336 heads/m 2 without and with autumn nitrogen, respectively) and spikelet density (9990 and 8220 spikelets/m 2 without and with autumn nitrogen, respectively). The number of spikelets/head was not significantly affected by autumn nitrogen. Early sowing could increase biomass and competitiveness, but poor crop establishment sometimes overrode the effect. Where crop and weed establishment was similar for both sowing dates, a 2 -week delay (i. e. early September to mid-September) increased L. multiflorum head density from 226 to 633 heads/m 2 and spikelet density from 5780 to 15 060 spikelets/m 2...|$|E
40|$|A {{trial was}} carried out at the Horticulture Research Centre, Marondera, Zimbabwe in 2007 {{to find out the}} effect of organic {{pesticides}} derived from 2 local plants (Solanum pindiriforme and Lippia javanica), garlic (Allium sativum) and tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum) on aphid mortality on a rape (Brassica napus) crop. Rape seedlings were raised in a screen house in potting media made from pine bark and vlei soil. Seedlings were transplanted into the field at seven weeks after planting. The design of the experiment was a randomised complete block (RCBD) replicated three times. <b>Rape</b> <b>plants</b> were infested with 10 - 12 aphids per plant at three weeks after transplanting. Organic pesticides prepared from Solanum (spray and buttermilk), Lippia (spray), garlic (buttermilk, garlic and chilli spray) and tobacco (spray) were sprayed on selected plants that were highly infested with aphids at 10 weeks after aphid infestation. The control was unsprayed infested plants. Buttermilk was mixed with paraffin. The results of aphid mortality obtained at 12 days after spraying indicated that plants sprayed with Solanum (spray and buttermilk), and garlic buttermilk had 100 % mortality, Lippia spray, garlic and chilli spray and tobacco spray had 77, 70 and 10 % aphid mortality, respectively. The control plants had 0 % mortality. This shows that local wild plants (Solanum and Lippia) and garlic can be prepared into formulations that can control aphids on <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> and therefore can be used as organic pesticides...|$|R
50|$|Pheromones {{can also}} be used to bait plants that are staples for M. histrionica and trap the insects. M. histrionica are major pests of plants in the Brassicaceae family. In a study {{conducted}} by Ludwig and Kok (2001), researchers tested broccoli, mustard and <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> for attractiveness to the harlequin bug and found that these plants do not significantly delay development in the bugs. This is what leads to these economically important plants to be targeted by M. histrionica. The study showed that all plants, especially small and young plants even at lower densities of insects, experienced death after being targeted by harlequin bugs, although larger plants could bare more numbers.|$|R
40|$|Weeds can {{successfully}} {{compete with the}} cultivated plants, causing considerable reduction in crop quality and quantity. The majority of agricultural competition studies {{are based on the}} additive experiments. In the additive experiments two species are grown together, the density of the crop is maintained constant, while that of the weeds species is varied. We have investigated the effect of different weed density of Convolvulus arvensis on the early development of oilseed rape under glasshouse conditions. There were four oilseed rape in a pot and the C. arvensis densitiy varied between 0 and 10 plants/pot. Seventy days after the beginning of the experiment the biomass production (fresh and dry weight of the shoots) and nutrient uptake (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) each of oilseed rape and C. arvensis were determined. It was concluded, that the development of the <b>rape</b> <b>plants</b> was faster, as compared to that of the C. arvensis seedlings {{at the beginning of the}} vegetation period, therefore no considerable interspecific competition between the <b>rape</b> and weed <b>plants</b> was observed. Intraspecific competition between the C. arvensis seedlings was stronger, as the weed density increased...|$|R
