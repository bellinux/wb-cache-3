40|$|AbstractPhotosystem (PS) II is a multisubunit {{thylakoid}} membrane pigment–protein complex {{responsible for}} light-driven oxidation {{of water and}} reduction of plastoquinone. Currently more than 40 proteins are known to associate with PSII, either stably or transiently. The inherent feature of the PSII complex is its vulnerability in light, with the damage mainly targeted to one of its core proteins, the D 1 protein. The repair of the damaged D 1 protein, i. e. the repair cycle of PSII, initiates in the grana stacks where the damage generally takes place, but subsequently continues in non-appressed thylakoid domains, where many steps are common for both the repair and de novo assembly of PSII. The sequence of the (<b>re)</b> <b>assembly</b> steps of genuine PSII subunits is relatively well-characterized in higher plants. A number of novel findings have shed light into the regulation mechanisms of lateral migration of PSII subcomplexes and the repair {{as well as the}} (<b>re)</b> <b>assembly</b> of the complex. Besides the utmost importance of the PSII repair cycle for the maintenance of PSII functionality, recent research has pointed out that the maintenance of PSI is closely dependent on regulation of the PSII repair cycle. This review focuses on the current knowledge of regulation of the repair cycle of PSII in higher plant chloroplasts. Particular emphasis is paid on sequential assembly steps of PSII and the function of the number of PSII auxiliary proteins involved both in the biogenesis and repair of PSII.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Biogenesis {{and repair}} of the {{inorganic}} core (Mn 4 CaOxCly), in the water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II (WOC-PSII), occurs through the light-induced (<b>re)</b> <b>assembly</b> of its free elementary ions and the apo-WOC-PSII protein, a reaction known as photoactivation. Herein, we use {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) spectroscopy to characterize changes in the ligand coordination environment of the first photoactivation intermediate, the photo-oxidized Mn 3 + bound to apo-WOC-PSII. On {{the basis of the}} observed changes in electron Zeeman (geff), 55 Mn hyperfine (AZ) interaction, and the EPR transition probabilities, the photogenerated Mn 3 + is shown to exist in two pH-dependent forms, differing in terms of strength and symmetry of their ligand fields. The transition from an EPR-invisible low-pH form to an EPR-active high-pH form occurs by deprotonation of an ionizable ligand bound to Mn 3 +, implicated to be a water molecule: [Mn 3 +(OH 2) ] T [Mn 3 +(OH-) ]. In the absence of Ca 2 +, the EPR-active Mn 3 + exhibits a strong pH dependence (pH 6. 5 - 9) of its ligand-field symmetry (rhombicity ¢ä) 10 %, derived from geff) and AZ (¢AZ) 22 %), attributable to a protein conformational change. Binding of Ca 2 + to its effector site eliminates this pH dependence and locks both geff and AZ at values observed in the absence of Ca 2 + at alkaline pH. Thus, Ca 2 + directly controls the coordination environment and binds close to the high-affinity Mn 3 +, probably sharing a bridging ligand. This Ca 2 + effect and the pH-induced changes ar...|$|E
40|$|Following acetylation, newly {{synthesized}} H 3 -H 4 {{is directly}} {{transferred from the}} histone chaperone anti-silencing factor 1 (Asf 1) to chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF- 1), another histone chaperone that is critical for the deposition of H 3 -H 4 onto replicating DNA. However, it is unknown how CAF- 1 binds and delivers H 3 -H 4 to the DNA. Here, we show that CAF- 1 binds recombinant H 3 -H 4 with 10 - to 20 -fold higher affinity than H 2 A-H 2 B in vitro, and H 3 K 56 Ac increases the binding affinity of CAF- 1 toward H 3 -H 4 2 -fold. These results provide a quan-titative thermodynamic explanation for the specific H 3 -H 4 histone chaperone activity of CAF- 1. Surprisingly, H 3 -H 4 exists as a dimer {{rather than as a}} canonical tetramer at mid-to-low nanomolar concentrations. A single CAF- 1 molecule binds a cross-linked (H 3 -H 4) 2 tetramer, or two H 3 -H 4 dimers that contain mutations at the (H 3 -H 4) 2 tetramerization interface. These results suggest that CAF- 1 binds to two H 3 -H 4 dimers in a manner that promotes formation of a (H 3 -H 4) 2 tetramer. Consistent with this idea, we confirm that CAF- 1 synchronously binds two H 3 -H 4 dimers derived from two different histone genes in vivo. Together, the data illustrate a clear mechanism for CAF- 1 -associated H 3 -H 4 chaperone activity in the context of de novo nucleosome (<b>re)</b> <b>assembly</b> following DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor (ER), a 66 -kDa {{protein that}} mediates {{the actions of}} estrogens in estrogen-responsive tissues, {{is a member of}} a large superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors that function as ligand-activated transcription factors. ER shares a conserved structural and functional organization with other members of this superfamily, including two transcriptional activation functions (AFs), one located in its amino-terminal region (AF- 1) and the second located in its carboxyl-terminal, ligand-binding region (AF- 2). In most promoter contexts, synergism between AF- 1 and AF- 2 is required for full ER activity. In these studies, we demonstrate a functional interaction of the two AF-containing regions of ER, when expressed as separate polypeptides in mammalian cells, in response to 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) and antiestrogen binding. The interaction was transcriptionally productive only in response to E 2, and was eliminated by point or deletion mutations that destroy AF- 1 or AF- 2 activity or E 2 binding. Our results suggest a definitive mechanistic role for E 2 in the activity of ER [...] namely, to alter receptor conformation to promote an association of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions, leading to transcriptional synergism between AF- 1 and AF- 2. The productive <b>re</b> <b>assembly</b> of two portions of ER expressed in cells as separate polypeptides demonstrates the evolutionarily conserved modular structural and functional organization of the nuclear hormone receptors. The ligand-dependent interaction of the two AF-containing regions of ER allows for the assembly of a complete activation function from two distinct regions within the same protein, providing a mechanism for hormonally regulated transcription...|$|E

Ergonomics specialists have offered auxiliary posture diversity {{to deal with}} the lack of varieties, especially for high-risk ones. Meanwhile, Assembly Line Balancing (ALB) problem has been recognized as a prior thinking to (<b>re)</b> configure <b>assembly</b> lines via the balancing of their tasks among their workstations. Some conventional criteria, cycle time and overall workload are often considered during the balancing. This paper presents a novel model of ALB problem that incorporates assembly worker postures into the balancing. In addition to the conventional ALB criteria, a new criterion of posture diversity is defined and contributes to enhance the model. The proposed model suggests configurations of assembly lines via the balancing; so that the assigned workers encounter the opportunities of changing their body postures, regularly. To address uncertainties in the conventional criteria, a fuzzy goal programming is used, and an appropriate genetic algorithm is developed {{to deal with the}} model. Various computational tests are performed on the different models made with combinations of the three criteria mentioned above. Comparing the pay-offs among the combinations, results show that well balanced task allocation can be obtained through the proposed model...|$|R

40|$|P> 1. The {{extent to}} which {{seedling}} recruitment contributes to local functional diversity depends on the environmental filters operating in a plant community. Classical community assembly models assume that habitat constraints and competition act like hierarchical filters with habitat filtering as the dominant one. Alternative models assume a synergic interaction since responses to environmental stress and competition may impose physiological trade-offs in plants. 2. River floodplains are an ideal system to test the relationship between habitat and competition filtering in community (<b>re)</b> <b>assembly,</b> as flooding causes changes in both habitat stress (waterlogging, resulting in anoxia and toxicity) and competition (dieback of vegetation) {{on one hand and}} acts as an effective seed dispersal vector on the other hand. 3. We conducted a mesocosm experiment on early community assembly from a pool of 34 floodplain species covering a wetness gradient. Seed mixtures were sown in a full factorial design with water level, canopy and mowing as controlling factors. We measured the biomass of all species after one growing season and determined germination and seedling growth traits, both outside (response to waterlogging/no waterlogging) and in a growth-chamber (response to light/darkness). 4. Species recruitment was analysed in relation to the controlling factors and measured functional traits using co-inertia analysis. Furthermore we analysed the effects of the controlling factors on several aspects of functional diversity. 5. There was no establishment in grass sward, unless mowing was applied. Species-rich communities only developed when germination and early establishment phases occurred on waterlogged bare soil. High water level did not suppress establishment but reduced the total biomass and lowered inter-specific competition. The effect of mowing on species richness depended upon the interplay between waterlogging and canopy. 6. Establishment success under canopy required seedling strategies to tolerate shade. The elimination of typical wetland specialists from oxic mesocosms was clearly an effect of their poorer and/or slower germination and lower competitive abilities in comparison to non-wetland plants, leading to their disappearance in this low-stress environment. 7. Our results indicate that single stress factors can enhance species richness and functional diversity through limiting competition but a synergic interaction of different stresses can lead to reduced richness...|$|E
40|$|During myelin {{formation}} OLGs may utilize basic {{mechanisms of}} epithelial membrane trafficking, as described and summarized in the introductory chapter (Chapter 1). However, whether specific transport pathways, unique to myelin biogenesis are involved and how such pathways might be regulated in biogenesis {{and maintenance of}} the myelin sheath, is largely unexplored. Such insight is of major relevance for devising strategies for exogenous manipulation to stimulate and/or promote de novo biogenesis of the myelin sheath and its (<b>re)</b> <b>assembly</b> at pathological demyelinating conditions, {{as in the case}} of multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, given the special nature of OLGs, consisting of a cell body, bounded by a plasma membrane, and myelin ‘protruding’ from that cell body, yet maintaining a highly specific and quite distinct membrane composition when compared to the plasma membrane, this kind of work will also contribute to solving fundamental questions of great interest to current cell biology. Accordingly, the main purpose of the work described in this thesis was to acquire insight into the sorting and trafficking of major myelin components such as PLP and MBP, and to reveal regulatory mechanisms, instrumental in promoting myelin sheath biogenesis. It is felt that this insight is a prerequisite for a prosperous advancement of therapeutic approaches in a disease as complex as MS. The trafficking and sorting of myelin constituents was primarily studied in vitro, using isolated OLG precursor cells from newborn rats. This approach also allowed us to study myelin biogenesis as a function of cellular development. In chapter 2, molecular parameters that govern the targeting and incorporation of myelin proteins and model proteins into myelin membranes are investigated to further clarify the polarized nature of oligodendrocytes. The purpose of these studies was to reveal the nature of sorting signals in myelin-directed trafficking and whether this pathway was regulated by protein kinase activity. Chapter 3 describes the distribution and functional role of syntaxins 3 and 4 in OLGs, since both proteins usually display a specific, polarized distribution in epithelial cells. We investigated how these syntaxins regulate the trafficking of myelin specific proteins, including PLP and MBP mRNA. Apart from intracellular factors, the role of the ECM was also examined, as described in experiments presented in chapter 4. OLGs were grown on different ECM substrates and their effect on the transport of the PLP and myelin assembly was determined. In chapter 5 the role of MAL in the regulation of sorting and transport of PLP was investigated, using a GFP-MAL construct that was (over) expressed in proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The intracellular distribution of MAL was determined and its effect on myelin protein transport was studied as a function of OLG development. Finally, in chapter 6 major observations reported in this thesis are summarized and perspectives for future studies are discussed. ...|$|E
