50|$|In {{the middle}} of 1952 the cars were {{substantially}} rebuilt, including better cooling - most notably a greatly enlarged <b>radiator</b> <b>aperture</b> in the nose, better ventilation, and repositioning of the exhaust pipe stubs. The car had been deliberately designed with a low seating position, but Fangio, asked what changes he would like on the car, replied that amongst other things he would like a little higher seat, as he liked to see where he was going. The car was modified to Fangio's request and he drove the car intermittently throughout 1953. He later {{said that it was}} the most formidable car he ever drove during his career. At this stage the engines were developing more than 500 hp, touching 600 hp, albeit with a very peaky power curve. This power curve had been forecast by Rolls-Royce who had recommended that inter-stage throttling of the supercharger be incorporated to provide a curve more suited to road use. Berthon considered the addition an unnecessary complication, and this, and the alternative variable-angle stators at the supercharger's inlet - both used initially on the two-stroke Crecy - which had been developed and tested by Rolls-Royce for the engine, were not proceeded with.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this analysis, a {{standard}} 2. 286 × 1. 016 cm X-band WR- 90 open ended rectangular waveguides with infinite ground plane operating at 8 to 12 GHz {{is used as}} radiating array. The field inside the rectangular waveguide in an infinite ground plane is determined from the Maxwell’s equation using the vector potential approach. The field inside a waveguide due to an aperture in the transverse plane of the rectangular waveguide is {{expressed in terms of}} modal vectors and modal functions. The field radiated into free space by an aperture is obtained using the spectral domain approach. The <b>radiator</b> <b>aperture</b> field is described by a sum of weighted basis function in the form of sinusoidal functions, defined over the entire region of the aperture. Galerkin’s Moment method is used to solve for the coefficients of the basis functions. The reflection coefficient by the waveguide array is evaluated from amplitude coefficients determined from matrix inversion. These values are compared with the reflection coefficients of the single waveguide radiator. The computations have also been carried out to find the admittance (conductance and susceptance) of the array radiator and compared with single radiator. Because of the mutual coupling and multiple reflections between radiators, radiators reflection coefficient and near field values are changed. So that the radiation properties of the radiator array improves. Index Terms — Array radiator, Ground plane...|$|E
50|$|As {{shown in}} the article on {{isotropic}} <b>radiators,</b> the <b>aperture</b> of a lossless isotropic antenna, which by definition has unity gain, is:where λ is the wavelength of the radio waves. So the gain of any antenna is proportional to its aperture:So antennas with large effective apertures are high gain antennas, which have small angular beam widths. Most of their power is radiated in a narrow beam in one direction, and little in other directions. As receiving antennas, they are most sensitive to radio waves coming from one direction, and are much less sensitive to waves coming from other directions. Although these terms {{can be used as}} a function of direction, when no direction is specified, the gain and aperture are understood to refer to the antenna's axis of maximum gain, or boresight.|$|R
40|$|A novel slotted-patch antenna is {{proposed}} for dual-band circularly polarized radiation using an aperture coupled feed. The antenna {{consists of a}} C/U-shaped slotted-patch <b>radiator</b> with an <b>aperture</b> coupled feeding system. The C/U-shaped slot is embedded on the square patch for dual-band and dual-sense circularly polarized radiation. The measured - 10 dB S 11 bandwidths for the lower and higher bands are 15 % and 3. 5 %, respectively. The overall antenna size is 0. 458 lo´ 0. 458 lo´ 0. 095 lo at 2. 5 GHz...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new family of limited diffraction electromagnetic X-shaped waves based on the scalar X-shaped waves discovered previously. These waves are diffraction-free in theory and particle-like (wave packets), in that they maintain their shape as they propagate to an infinite distance. The “X waves” possess (theoretically) infinitely extended “arms” and —at least, the ones studied in this paper— have an infinite total energy: therefore, they are not physically realizable. However, they can be truncated in both space and time and “approximated” {{by means of a}} finite <b>aperture</b> <b>radiator</b> so to get a large enough depth of interest (depth of field). In addition to the Maxwell equations, X wave solutions to the free Schroedinger equation are also obtained. Possible applications of these new waves are discussed. Finally, we discuss the appearance of the X-shaped solutions from the purely geometric {{point of view of the}} special relativity theory...|$|R
