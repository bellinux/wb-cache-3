25|$|Elastic {{deformation}} in solids is <b>reversible</b> <b>change</b> in {{the internal}} molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force. If the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.|$|E

40|$|A {{component}} of the compressive stress that develops during deposition of polycrystalline thin films reversibly changes during interruptions of growth. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon {{has been the subject}} of much recent speculation and experimental work. In this Letter, we have varied the in-plane grain size of columnar polycrystalline gold films with a fixed thickness, by varying their thermal history. Without a vacuum break, the stress in these films was then measured in situ during growth and during interruptions in growth. Homoepitaxial gold films were similarly characterized as part of this study. The inverse of the in-plane grain size and the corresponding <b>reversible</b> stress <b>change</b> were found to be proportional, with zero <b>reversible</b> stress <b>change</b> observed for infinite grain size (homoepitaxial films).

Using purified terminal complement components we have documented a mitogenic effect of the MAC for quiescent murine 3 T 3 cells. The MAC enhances the mitogenic effects of serum and PDGF, and also stimulates cell proliferation {{in the absence of}} other exogenous growth factors.
