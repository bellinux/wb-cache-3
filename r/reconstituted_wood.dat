50|$|LP's OSB {{products}} {{protected the}} company {{from some of the}} vicissitudes of the timber market. Buoyed by this success, the company soon expanded its line of products made from <b>reconstituted</b> <b>wood</b> to include I-beams for floor joists and rafters. These structural beams used half as much lumber as their solid wood counterparts, yet were stronger and lighter. LP also introduced a concrete form of Inner-Seal, and in 1985 began to market Inner-Seal siding for the exterior of homes. Driven by these breakthroughs, a housing boom, and a thriving remodeling and repair business that increased demand for its specialty building products, LP's sales grew 50 percent between 1980 and 1988, according to the Portland Oregonian. During the same period, its profits increased 400 percent. Moreover, OSB products accounted for an escalating portion of the company's total sales. Only six percent of sales in 1980, the Inner-Seal line by 1990 amounted to almost 30 percent of total sales volume. LP's sales of lumber—once the mainstay of the building industry—decreased from 53 to 30 percent over the same period. In 1986, the company purchased Kirby Forest Industries and the California properties of Timber Realization Company. From these transactions, LP gained almost 830,000 acres of timberland, which helped balance the land taken in 1978 for Redwood National Park. (LP received a final payment of $440 million from the government for this land in 1988.) In 1990, LP bought Weather Guard Inc., a manufacturer of housing insulation made from recycled newsprint, as well as MiTek Wood Products, a North Carolina-based producer of laminated veneer lumber and engineered wood I-beams.|$|E

METHODS: All 12 plants manufacturing Oriented-strand board (OSB), Medium density fibreboard (MDF) and Particle board (PB) in Quebec were visited by a research team which took area and personal measurements. Past measurements taken by governmental occupational health teams in these plants were also collected. Log-transformed formaldehyde concentrations were analysed with extended linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: During 2001 – 2002, 275 measurements were taken by the research team, while 590 measurements dating back to 1984 were collected from governmental files. The area measure-ments had a global geometric mean (GM) of 0. 28 p. p. m. [geometric standard deviation (GSD) : 3. 1]. The GM of the personal measurements was 0. 17 p. p. m. (GSD: 2. 3).

The procedure was applied to literature regarding formaldehyde exposure in the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>wood</b> panels industry, including oriented-strand board (OSB), medium density fibre board (MDF) and particle board (PB). Methods: For each publication providing summary parameters we estimated geometric means (GM) and geometric standard deviations (GSD) by assuming lognormality of exposure levels. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to re-create datasets from the sample sizes and estimated GMs and GSDs, allowing their subsequent formatting together with the single measurements. The precision and bias of the methods used to estimate GMs and GSDs were evaluated. Results: Altogether, the 13 articles included in our study yielded a final database of 874 data, of which 732 were simulated.

Wood has several advantages that are transferable to various derivatives allowing the introduction of sustainable material into the product lifecycle.

The primary goal was to create <b>reconstituted</b> <b>wood</b> objects through a rapid manufacturing. Additive manufacturing technology is most commonly used for modeling, prototyping, tooling through an exclusive machine or 3 D printer. An overall review and an analysis of technologies show that the additive manufacturing presents some little independent solutions [9] [12].

The study developed a 3 d printing head as solution for shaping wood pulp or powder materials.

30|$|Initially, most {{fast-growing tree}} species {{were used to}} produce pulp and paper due to their low density and poor {{mechanical}} properties. However, with increasing demand for wood-based structural materials, many {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate the potential and properties of engineered wood products made from fast-growing tree species. Particleboard is a widely used <b>reconstituted</b> <b>wood</b> panel, which does not require high quality raw materials [1]. Previous researches show that density and press time are the main parameters influencing the properties of particleboards made from fast-growing wood [2 – 5]. Many fast-growing tree species have been used in the production of laminated veneer lumber (LVL), such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) [6], radiata pine (Pinus radiata) [7], eucalyptus [8], poplar [9, 10], and Gmelina arborea [11]. Previous researches prove that laminated wood possesses superior bending strength and modulus when compared to the same species of solid wood [9]. Using fast-growing tree species in the inner plies of laminated materials can also reduce the producing costs without much decrease in mechanical properties. According to the research by Moya et al. [12], I-beams fabricated from fast-growing wood can be used in roofing and flooring systems. It is also found by researchers that glulam beams made from fast-growing wood can be used as structural elements in building constructions [13].|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Forests {{provide a}} broad {{economic}} basis for rural communities throughout the Northeastern United States. Contemporary resource management and rural development planning increasingly emphasize {{the integration of}} raw material production with forward-linked processing activities. Furthermore, the tacit acceptance of joint production of both wood and amenity-based recreation often pits the forward linked sectors of wood processing and tourism against one another as development strategies. Empirical studies suggest that both wood processors and tourism businesses locate proximate to forest resources. Assessing the regional firm location decisions of wood processors has raised important and complex issues of sectoral heterogeneity and regional economic performance. This study addresses {{the question of the}} relative importance of alternative forest uses in supporting rural economic vitality. Specifically, we initiate analysis of firm location in three wood processing sub-sectors through descriptive location quotients of primary, secondary, and <b>reconstituted</b> <b>wood</b> products manufacturing sectors and compare the presence of tourism sector activity to that of the timber sector. Explanatory variables that support these sectoral specific location quotients include proxies for raw material inputs and output markets. Our work on rural resource dependency expands this into metrics associated with income, unemployment, poverty, and regional economic diversity. Results suggest that important differences exist in locational dependency attributes between wood products sub-sectors and that dependence on joint forest resource outputs is clearly associated with unique attributes of regional socioeconomic structure...|$|E

In fact, at present, the production of wet sulfite-rich scrubber cake outstrips the production of wet sulfate-rich scrubber cake by about 6 million tons per year. However, most of the utilization focus has centered on FGD gypsum. Therefore, we have recently initiated research on developing new strategies for the economical, but environmentally-sound, utilization of sulfite-rich scrubber material. In this exploratory project (Phase I), we attempted to ascertain whether it is feasible to develop <b>reconstituted</b> <b>wood</b> replacement products from sulfite-rich scrubber material. In pursuit of this goal, we characterized two different wet sulfite-rich scrubber materials, obtained from two power plants burning Midwestern coal, for their suitability for the development of value-added products. The overall strategy adopted was to fabricate composites where the largest ingredient was scrubber material with additional crop materials as additives. Our results suggested that it may be feasible to develop composites with flexural strength as high as 40 MPa (5800 psi) without the addition of external polymers. We also attempted to develop load-bearing composites from scrubber material, natural fibers, and phenolic polymer. The polymer-to-solid ratio was limited to {le} 0. 4.

40|$|Powder {{coatings}} are 100 % solid, dry powders {{that are}} used to coat a wide variety of substrates. They are considered an environmentally friendly coating option with no volatile emissions and minimal wastage. Overspray can be reused for spraying if collected without contamination, but there is a proportion (about 5 to 15 %) of powder that has to leave the coating system and is referred to as waste powder coating powder (WPCP). Fines that are not suitable for application are also generated during production, and reworking them into usable powder is a costly and cumbersome process and those materials are not reclaimed. Currently WPCP and fines are disposed of in landfills. The objective of this work is to make novel products using this waste, thereby eliminating the need for disposal of the powder. Primid powders made by crosslinking polyester with hydroxy alkyl amide (HAA) were used for this study. Composites were made by using WPCP and fines as a primary binder, along with a secondary binder and sawdust as the reinforcing material. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X ray techniques were used to characterise composite boards formed by compressive moulding of the composites.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Oregon's {{forest product}} {{industry}} {{continues to be}} the nation's number one producer of wood products. The forest products industry contributes significantly to Oregon's economy. Changes in timber supply, land use policy, technology, and product demand create significant impacts on the region. The activities of the wood products industry translate into jobs, payroll, taxes, and the purchase of services and materials from other industries. In order to trace the contribution of the wood products industry to the state of Oregon's economy, a thorough understanding of how wood is utilized at all subsequent stages of processing is necessary. This study provides an in-depth look at the forest products industry by estimating the volume of wood, number of jobs, and value added of product shipments at each stage of processing, from harvest to final product. The forest products industry as defined in this study includes six primary wood processing industries: sawmills; veneer and plywood mills; pulp and board mills; shake and shingle mills; pole, post & piling mills; and log export firms. Seven secondary and/or residue converting industries are included: structural members, which produce engineered wood products such as laminated veneer, glu-lam beams, and I-joist; millwork; furniture; materials handling, which includes pallets, dunnage and other products used in shipping; <b>reconstituted</b> <b>wood</b> products, such as particle and hard board; converted paper and board products; and miscellaneous wood products. Forestry services and regeneration, logging operations, and hauling are also included to the extent possible. The results of this study indicate the forest products industry in Oregon supported in excess of 80, 000 jobs and provided value added in manufacture of more than 5. 2 billion dollars in 1992. The estimated harvest volume in 1992 was 1, 409. 4 million cubic feet and 1, 547. 1 million cubic feet of logs were consumed in Oregon primary wood products industries. The employment numbers in this study are not directly comparable to other studies because the definition of "wood products industries" may be broader than in other reports.

30|$|Until now, [emim][CH 3 COO] {{seems to}} be the most {{suitable}} IL for the pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass, since it possesses good solvent power for these materials and hence it is also referred to in the most studies of this research field. Several studies were performed focused on the evaluation of the pre-treatment behaviour of different hardwood and softwood species with [emim][CH 3 COO] [25, 28, 29, 32, 58, 88]. Sun et al. performed a 5 % (w/w) dissolution of southern yellow pine in [emim][CH 3 COO] (110 °C, 16  hours) and approximately 59 % of the original carbohydrates was recovered in the regenerated material after adding an acetone/water mixture as the antisolvent [25]. Additionally, around 31 % of the original lignin was obtained in free form and 38 % linked to carbohydrates as part of the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>wood,</b> leading to a lignin reduction of 26.1 %. The same treatment was also performed for red oak with a 34.9 % reduction of lignin was reached. Hence, the regenerated materials contained less lignin than the original wood, with a fairly good delignification at relatively low temperature reported. However, significant losses of carbohydrates and lignin during the fractionation process were observed. In the case of pine pre-treatment, total losses of 41 % and 31 % of the original carbohydrates and lignin were calculated, respectively [25]. Lee et al. extracted approximately 63 % of the initial lignin from the wood flour, at 130 °C after 90  minutes of treatment using the same IL [28]. However, they also extracted 16 % of the cellulose and 26 % of the xylan from the initial wood flour content. Therefore, the process showed significant delignification with small losses of carbohydrates after the pre-treatment [28]. In a different study, by the temperature decrease to 90 °C and the time of pre-treatment increase to 24  hours for the same biomass loading, nearly 50 % of the lignin was extracted from the initial wood flour sample [58]. Such a result confirms a great effect of the applied conditions (temperature and time) in the pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Torr et al. evaluated the pre-treatment of compression pine wood (Pinus radiata) at 120 °C and 155 °C for 3  hours [30]. When water was used as the antisolvent, no lignin extraction was observed. These findings were the opposite to those found earlier by Sun et al. [25]. The authors justified different results {{as a consequence of the}} antisolvent used. The reported pre-treatment removed mainly hemicelluloses for both tested temperatures leading to the recovery of a pre-treated material with high cellulose and lignin contents. With an extensive study of the pre-treated biomass using HSQC NMR technique, Torr et al. verified the existence of deacetylation of hemicellulose, possible depolymerisation of polysaccharides, loss of lignin ether linkages and formation of lignin condensation products [30].|$|E
