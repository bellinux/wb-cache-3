5000|$|It is {{possible}} to design an analog-ramp delay generator, using a current source to charge a capacitor, that spans some tens of nanoseconds of delay range. One can then suspend the ramp current for some integral number of clocks, as timed by a crystal oscillator.

50|$|Reeves (1973) {{argues that}} the {{competitive}} theory of administration used by Roosevelt proved to be inefficient and produced delays. The competition over the size of expenditure, {{the selection of the}} administrator, and the appointment of staff at the state level, led to delays and to the ultimate failure of PWA as a <b>recovery</b> <b>instrument.</b> As director of the budget, Lewis Douglas overrode the views of leading senators in reducing appropriations to $3.5 billion and in transferring much of that money to other agencies in lieu of their own specific appropriations. The cautious and penurious Ickes won out over the more imaginative Hugh S. Johnson as chief of public works administration. Political competition between rival Democratic state organizations and between Democrats and Progressive Republicans led to delays in implementing PWA efforts on the local level. Ickes instituted quotas for hiring skilled and unskilled black people in construction financed through the Public Works Administration (PWA). Resistance from employers and unions was partially overcome by negotiations and implied sanctions. Although results were ambiguous, the plan helped provide African Americans with employment, especially among unskilled workers.|$|E

The Quality of Recovery- 40 (QoR- 40), Recovery Index- 10 (RI- 10), and RAAD- 36 health survey were used to measure recovery in women undergoing different types of hysterectomy in the first 12 weeks after operation. Construct validity was assessed by testing predefined hypotheses. The changes observed during the postoperative period were used as indicators for responsiveness. Results.

40|$|Background: During {{the past}} decade, {{the mental health}} {{consumer}} movement has drawn the attention of mental health providers, researchers and policy makers {{to the concept of}} recovery. Traditionally, recovery primarily refers to the remission of symptoms. Nowadays, recovery is also regarded in a sense that all individuals, even those with severe psychiatric disabilities, can improve. Accordingly, recovery for people with severe mental illness refers to hope and optimism, empowerment, regained control and increased self-esteem, illness self-management and engagement in meaningful daily activities (Corrigan, Giffort, Rashid, Leary & Okeke, 1999; Jacobson & Greenley, 2001; Leamy, Bird, le Boutillier, Williams & Slade, 2011; van Gestel-Timmermans, Brouwers, van Assen, Bongers & van Nieuwenhuizen, 2012). Little empirical research, however, has been done and instruments to measure recovery are scarce. Aims: In the current study, the psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the Mental Health Recovery Measure (MHRM) are explored. Convergent and divergent validity of the MHRM was assessed using standardized measures of hope (Hope Herth Index (HHI)), recovery-promoting professional competence (Recovery Promoting Relationships Scale (RPRS)) and general physical health and well-being (RAND Measure of Health-Related Quality of Life (RAND- 36)). Methods: A factor analysis was conducted and Cronbach’s α of the MHRM scales was assessed. The construct validity was assessed by computing the intercorrelations of the MHRM, HHI, RPRS and RAND- 36. Results: Data were available for 212 patients: 70 patients completed the MHRM, HHI and RAND 36 and 142 filled out the MHRM and RPRS. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in an interpretable three-factor solution. Cronbach’s α ranged from 0. 86 to 0. 94. The convergent validity of the instrument was satisfactory; the divergent validity was less clear. Conclusions: This study offers evidence to suggest that the Dutch version of the MHRM is a reliable measure (in terms of internal consistency) with a generally acceptable convergent and divergent validity. Further research is needed to clarify {{the extent to which the}} MHRM is sensitive enough to capture the individual recovery process of patients.

40|$|This {{research}} (a) {{examined the}} effectiveness of a transitional housing program based upon psychosocial recovery principles in breaking the cycle of homelessness and acute SMI for 42 consumers between August 2006 and February 2008, and (b) undertook initial validation of the Stage of <b>Recovery</b> <b>Instrument</b> (STORI) as a measure of recovery for 20 consumers participating in the program between September 2009 and March 2010. The results of the first study demonstrated that consumers were satisfied with the program and that 83. 2 % achieved stability in accommodation {{by the end of the}} program. Further the program was successful in significantly reducing inpatient bed days during the program as compared to the six months prior and this reduction was sustained for the six month period post program. Results also demonstrated that functioning (self-rated by the MHI and clinically rated by the HoNOS, LSP- 16 and FoC) improved pre- to post-program but that this effect was significant for clinical rated measures only (HoNOS and FoC). The findings also suggested that clinical and consumer measures overlapped in statistically meaningful ways. However, this overlap was not sufficient to predict reductions in inpatient bed days. The second study, an initial validation of the STORI for use within the program, provided support for the internal consistency and construct validity of the measure. Further, results also showed a sequential pattern of correlations between stage scores of the STORI. These findings were in keeping with those of a UK validation of the STORI (Weeks et al., 2011). In addition, results indicated that whilst recovery (as measured by the STORI) was not synonymous with clinical functioning (as measured by the HoNOS and LSP, there were domains where they interacted in statistically significant ways. Implications of the findings from the first and second studies are discussed, specifically the potential to include recovery related measures of functioning in future outcome evaluations of the program.

This study investigated the relationship of a linguistic-theory-based deep structure <b>recovery</b> <b>instrument</b> (the Sentence Meaning Inventory, or S. M. I.) and other measures of reading comprehension among urban black children. It was found that teachers' assessment of their students' reading skill was more highly correlated with the deep structure recovery scores (. 2106 <. 05 level of confidence) than with the other variables, Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (I. T. B. S.) reading comprehension subtest (. 1590 <. 05 level of confidence), I. T. B. S. vocabulary subtest (. 1076 <. 05 level of confidence), and reading mastery skill level (M. S. L.) scores, a locally developed measure of reading skill (. 1796 <. 05 level of confidence). In a multiple regression analysis, it was found that sex was the only variable which provided a statistically significant addition to the S. M. I. scores for predicting teacher assessment scores. The intercorrelations between the deep structure (S. M. I.) scores and the other independent variables, I. T. B. S. reading comprehension subtest, I. T. B. S. vocabulary subtest, and M. S. L. were very similar to those of previous studies (Haynes, 1977; Manarino, 1977; Nessel, 1975; O'Donnell & King, 1974; Reynolds, 1974; Simons, 1970). The finding that girls scored higher than boys, and that sex was a predictor of reading success also agrees with the findings of previous studies (Dwyer, 1973; Kolczynski, 1973). The S. M. I. instrument was designed to measure only the students' skill at determining the meaning of a sentence. The vocabulary level in the measure was well below the level expected for the subjects' reading levels in order to minimize the effect of vocabulary on the scores. Assuming that teachers' assessment of their students' reading skill has reasonable validity, {{the results of this study}} suggest that a deep structure recovery measure may be a more useful method of assessing students' reading comprehension than the more widely used instruments which appear to measure a mixture of vocabulary and comprehension. Certainly, the results suggest that deep structure recovery measures should, at least, be added to the instruments presently employed to assess children's reading comprehension. Since the sample (N = 599) in the study were urban black elementary school children, the foregoing conclusions may be more relevant for such children than for the population at large.

The reason to study these two psychological constructs is that experiential avoidance has pervasive effects in one’s life and is at the core of several significant clinical problems. As such, ACT suggests the use of psychological acceptance to deal with experiential avoidance, which has been proven successful at improving the quality of life. Method The research involved two studies which sought to pin point the presence of experiential avoidance and psychological acceptance in the psychological recovery process of people with mental illness. The first study was exploratory and qualitative, while the second used a quantitative approach. In Study One, 45 published narratives and 33 life stories from individuals living with long-term mental illness were content-analysed, seeking to locate textual examples of experiential avoidance and psychological acceptance. The objective of this study was to provide a preliminary examination of the role and frequency of psychological acceptance and experiential avoidance in the process of psychological recovery from enduring mental illness. Study Two examined the relationship between psychological acceptance and experiential avoidance in psychological recovery from enduring mental illness, using established measures of recovery and psychological well-being. Forty-one participants with a clinical diagnosis of chronic mental illness (at least 12 months) as reflected in the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4 th ed.) Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) Axis I were recruited from across New South Wales, Australia. The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ- 19) was used to examine the presence of psychological acceptance and experiential avoidance; the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS) and the Stages of <b>Recovery</b> <b>Instrument</b> (STORI) were used to examine the levels of psychological recovery, andthe Psychological Well-Being scales (PWB) were used to measure well-being. Results In Study One, the high prevalence of psychological acceptance in narratives of people self-reporting success in their recovery journey suggests a potential relationship to positive developments in their journey of recovery. Conversely, the role and frequency of experiential avoidance could be associated with less progress in psychological recovery from mental illness. In Study Two, a correlational analysis between level of recovery, as assessed by the RAS instrument, and acceptance, as assessed by the AAQ- 19, showed no significant relationship between the two variables. The AAQ- 19 nonetheless correlated positively with three of the five subscales of the RAS. In addition, positive correlations were found between the overall score for PWB and the high use of psychological acceptance. Conclusion While Study One indicated the presence of experiential avoidance and psychological acceptance in narratives of people with enduring mental illness, Study Two demonstrated that there was no clear correlation between the use of psychological acceptance and recovery from mental illness. This study, however, demonstrated that there is a relationship between psychological acceptance and positive levels of psychological well-being among individuals with mental illness, indicating that psychological acceptance may play a positive role in improving the psychological well-being of people with mental illness...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} view {{of schizophrenia}} {{as having a}} deteriorating long-term course and an outcome of permanent disability has been challenged both anecdotally and empirically. Therefore, the consumer movement advocates that rehabilitation services become recovery-orientated. Recovery-oriented and empirically validated services have now become policy internationally. However, the meaning of recovery in a medical or research context is different than the meaning used by consumers. The objectives of this research were, therefore to (a) formulate a consumer-oriented definition of recovery; (b) develop a conceptual model of recovery to guide research and evaluation and inform clinical practice; (c) design a measure of recovery, based on the model, and (d) to seek empirical support for the model of recovery. Study One involved {{a review of the}} consumer-oriented literature on the concept of recovery, with four aims: (a) to understand the meaning of recovery used by consumers; (b) to identify the components of recovery; (c) to formulate a definition of recovery; and (d) to define the stages of recovery. An examination of consumers’ experiential accounts produced a definition of psychological recovery from the consequences of the illness. Four key processes were identified: (i) finding hope; (ii) re-establishment of identity; (iii) finding meaning in life; and (iv) taking responsibility for wellness and life generally. Five stages were synthesized from the extant qualitative research: (i) moratorium; (ii) awareness; (iii) preparation; (iv) rebuilding and (v) growth. A model of four processes developing over five stages is discussed {{in the light of the}} wider literature surrounding recovery from loss and the positive psychology literature. It is concluded that the philosophies of the positive psychology movement have much to offer in recovery-oriented approaches to treatment and research. In Study Two, a brief measure, the Self-identified stage of recovery (SISR), was designed in order to test the model. The aims were to (a) test the validity of the stage measure against continuous recovery measures; (b) to test the notion of recovery assessment as opposed to conventional measures of outcome, and (c) to seek support for the stage model of recovery. The SISR was completed by a clinical population participating in a larger study. High correlations between the recovery measures (rs =. 262, p =. 01 to rs =. 712, p =. 01) supported the validity of the SISR, while the pattern of correlations between the recovery measure subscales supported the validity of the SISR as a measure of level of recovery. Negative to low correlations between recovery and conventional measures (rs = -. 375 to rs =. 191) supported the divergent validity of recovery as an outcome as distinct from conventional measures. In addition, an effect of stage was found on one conventional measure (F (4, 127) = 2. 9, p 3 ̆c. 05) and all recovery measures (F (4, 141) = 2. 87, p 3 ̆c. 05) to F (4, 141) = 4. 68 (p 3 ̆c. 001), lending support to the stage model of recovery. The aims of Study Three were to (a) produce a longer, more reliable measure that would better capture the richness of the experience of recovery; (b) examine the validity and reliability of this measure; and (c) seek further support for the stage model of recovery. The Stages of <b>Recovery</b> <b>Instrument</b> (STORI) consists of 50 items, each representing a psychological process at a stage of recovery. The STORI yields five stage subscale scores. A postal survey of volunteers revealed that the STORI correlated with six psychological health variables (rs= 0. 45 (p 3 ̆c. 01) to rs = 0. 62 (p 3 ̆c. 01). Correlational analysis provided support for an ordinal relationship between the stage subscales. An effect of stage was found on all recovery-related variables, (F (3, 110) = 10. 70 (p 3 ̆c. 01) to F (3, 111) = 24. 44 (p 3 ̆c. 01). However, a cluster analysis of items resulted in three subscale clusters, rather than the expected five, revealing an overlap between adjacent stages. The results provide preliminary empirical validation of the STORI as a measure of the consumer definition of recovery. Although an effect of stage was found, refinement of the measure is needed to improve its capacity to discriminate between the stages. It could then be used in comprehensively testing the stage model using longitudinal methods and the inclusion of objective measures. The concept of recovery elucidated in this research underlines the importance of taking a positive stance to recovery, focusing on values, meaning and growth rather than on illness-focused approaches to care. The five-stage model has proven useful in clinical training and as a framework for research into recovery. Validation of the model with longitudinal research is planned. Further development of the STORI is underway in separate research, and when refined, the measure should provide an outcome assessment tool that is meaningful to consumers and a useful adjunct to conventional clinical measurement...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{sought to}} assess the cash management systems in Chegutu Municipality. Chegutu Municipality has its set vision, mission, objectives, core values and goals that guide their daily operations but there were insurmountable cash flow challenges being faced leading to the council failing to meet the set objectives. The failure to meet objectives lead the research to seek to enquire on the challenges being faced in cash management and to identify the strategies that {{are being used to}} overcome these challenges and how liquidity impacts on service delivery. Chapter two reviews the cash management concept as seen by a number of scholars. The evolution, components of cash management used in business, challenges encountered in the cash management process, effective tools for cash management, the link between service delivery and cash management as well as empirical evidence. Chapter three focuses on the research methodology. The researcher used both qualitative and quantitative data gathering techniques. Questionnaires, observation, purposive and random sampling, internal reports and records and interviews were used to gather data. Chapter four presents and analyses the research findings and the cash management systems in Chegutu Municipality are evaluated. The research found out that the cash flow problems faced by Chegutu Municipality are as a result of poor cash management systems used resulting in poor financial management. Problems faced by Chegutu Municipality in cash management are mismanagement and corruption, weak internal control system, poor collection methods, lack of qualified staff and economic hardships, public resistance among others. However, the Municipality is trying to beset these challenges through employing a number of strategies such as budgeting, cash flow forecasting, auditing, financial reporting, creditor management, debtor management, internal control systems and strategic planning and management. The recommendations include maximize revenue collection, improve and strengthen internal control systems to deter fraud and other forms of corruption, practice participatory budgeting, explore new ways of revenue generation (income generating projects), human resources developing (training and capacity building), formulation of the revenue generation and expenditure monitoring committee, computerization of the finance department (e-government), lobby government to put debt <b>recovery</b> <b>instruments</b> in order to strengthen the cash management systems of local authorities...|$|R
