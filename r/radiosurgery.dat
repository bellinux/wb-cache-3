5|$|Gene {{therapy is}} being studied in {{some types of}} epilepsy. Medications that alter immune function, such as {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins, are poorly supported by evidence. Noninvasive stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> is, as of 2012, being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Surgery (by craniotomy, open brain surgery) may {{be offered}} {{based on the}} risks of {{treatment}} {{as determined by the}} Spetzlerâ€“Martin scale (grade I-V); this score is higher in larger lesions that are close to important brain structures and have deep venous drainage. High grade lesions (IV and V) have an unacceptably high risk and surgery is not typically offered in those cases. <b>Radiosurgery</b> (using targeted radiation therapy such as by a gamma knife) may be used if the lesion is small but close to vital structures. Finally, embolization may be used on small lesions that have only a single feeding vessel.|$|E

25|$|Acute {{complications}} following Gamma Knife <b>radiosurgery</b> are rare, and complications {{are related}} to the condition being treated.|$|E
25|$|Gamma Knife therapy, {{like all}} <b>radiosurgery,</b> uses doses of {{radiation}} to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors, delivered precisely to avoid damaging healthy brain tissue. Gamma Knife <b>radiosurgery</b> {{is able to}} accurately focus many beams of gamma radiation on one or more tumors. Each individual beam is of relatively low intensity, so the radiation has little effect on intervening brain tissue and is concentrated only at the tumor itself.|$|E
25|$|The New York Times {{reported}} in December 2010 that radiation overdoses had occurred with the linear accelerator method of <b>radiosurgery,</b> {{due in large}} part to inadequate safeguards in equipment retrofitted for stereotactic <b>radiosurgery.</b> In the U.S. the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates these devices, whereas the Gamma Knife is regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NYT article focused on Varian equipment and associated software, but the problem is likely not to be limited to that manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiosurgery</b> is a {{conservative}} alternative to cranial base or other intracranial surgery. With conformal radiosurgical techniques, therapeutic radiation focused on the tumour, sparing exposure to surrounding normal tissues. Although <b>radiosurgery</b> can seldom completely destroy a tumor, it can often arrest its growth or reduce its size. While radiation is less immediately damaging than conventional surgery, it incurs {{a higher risk of}} subsequent malignant change in the irradiated tissues, and this risk in higher in NF2 than in sporadic (non-NF2) lesions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{indication}} for neuroimaging is CT-, MRI- and PET-guided stereotactic {{surgery or}} <b>radiosurgery</b> {{for treatment of}} intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations and other surgically treatable conditions.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{stereotactic}} radiation. Stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> (SRS) is when doctors use a single or several stereotactic radiation treatments of the brain or spine. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.|$|E
25|$|Overlook {{is one of}} five New Jersey {{hospitals}} {{approved to}} provide emergency angioplasty in a community hospital setting. The hospital has the state's first combined PET/CT scanner and stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> cancer treatment program. Overlook won the Silver Governor's Award for Performance Excellence on two occasions.|$|E
25|$|If {{there are}} no symptoms, {{periodic}} observation may be all that is required. Most cases that result in symptoms can be cured by surgery. Following complete removal less than 20% recur. If surgery is not possible or all the tumor cannot be removed <b>radiosurgery</b> may be helpful. Chemotherapy has not {{been found to be}} useful. A small percentage grow rapidly and are associated with worse outcomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiosurgery</b> is {{performed}} by a multidisciplinary team of radiation oncologists and medical physicists to operate and maintain highly sophisticated, highly precise and complex instruments, including medical linear accelerators, the Gamma Knife unit and the Cyberknife unit. The highly precise irradiation of targets within the brain and spine is planned using information from medical images that are obtained via computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography.|$|E
25|$|In {{fulfilling}} {{its role}} as a hub for medical specialists, Dong-A University Hospital is home to various centers of expertise, including: the Robotic Surgery Center, General Health Promotion Center, Stroke Center, Cancer Center, Breast Center, Parkinson's Disease Center, Spine Center, Transfusion-free Medicine & Surgery Center, Cardiovascular Center, Gastroenterology Center, Novalis <b>Radiosurgery</b> Center, Organ Transplant Center, Emergency Medical Center, Clinical Test Research Center, Mental Health Center, and the Sunflower Children's Center.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to these developments, {{a similar approach}} was designed for a linear particle accelerator or Linac. Installation of the first 4MeV clinical linear accelerator began in June 1952 in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at the Hammersmith Hospital, London. The system was handed over for physics and other testing in February 1953 and began to treat patients on 7 September that year. Meanwhile, work by at the Stanford Microwave Laboratory {{led to the development}} of a 6-MV accelerator, which was installed at Stanford University Hospital, California, in 1956. Linac units quickly became favored devices for conventional fractionated radiotherapy but it lasted until the 1980s before dedicated Linac <b>radiosurgery</b> became a reality. In 1982, the Spanish neurosurgeon J. Barcia-Salorio began to evaluate the role of cobalt-generated and then Linac-based photon <b>radiosurgery</b> for the treatment of AVMs and epilepsy. In 1984, Betti and Derechinsky described a Linac-based radiosurgical system. Winston and Lutz further advanced Linac-based radiosurgical prototype technologies by incorporating an improved stereotactic positioning device and a method to measure the accuracy of various components. Using a modified Linac, the first patient in the United States was treated in Boston Brigham and Women's Hospital in February 1986.|$|E
25|$|If lesions are present, {{they are}} watched closely {{for changes in}} size. Prognosis is best when lesions are less than 3cm in length. Most {{complications}} occur when the lesions are greater than 6cm in size. Surgical intervention for intracranial lesions has been done successfully. Nonsurgical treatments include embolization, radiation therapy, and continued observation. Arterial vascular malformations may be treated with the cyberknife treatment. Possible treatment for cerebral arterial vascular malformations include stereotactic <b>radiosurgery,</b> endovascular embolization, and microsurgical resection.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a cancer}} has metastasized it {{may still be}} treated with <b>radiosurgery,</b> chemotherapy, {{radiation}} therapy, biological therapy, hormone therapy, surgery, {{or a combination of}} these interventions ("multimodal therapy"). The choice of treatment depends on a large number of factors, including the type of primary cancer, the size and location of the metastases, the patient's age and general health, and the types of treatments used previously. In patients diagnosed with CUP it is often still possible to treat the disease even when the primary tumor cannot be located.|$|E
25|$|MRI is {{the investigative}} tool {{of choice for}} {{neurological}} cancers, as it has better resolution than CT and offers better visualization of the posterior fossa. The contrast provided between grey and white matter makes MRI {{the best choice for}} many conditions of the central nervous system, including demyelinating diseases, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, infectious diseases, and epilepsy. Since many images are taken milliseconds apart, it shows how the brain responds to different stimuli, enabling researchers to study both the functional and structural brain abnormalities in psychological disorders. MRI also is used in mri-guided stereotactic surgery and <b>radiosurgery</b> for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the N-localizer.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} principle of <b>radiosurgery</b> {{is that of}} selective ionization of tissue, by means of high-energy beams of radiation. Ionization is the production of ions and free radicals which are usually deleterious to the cells. These ions and radicals, which may be formed from {{the water in the}} cell or biological materials, can produce irreparable damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in the cell's death. Thus, biological inactivation is carried out in a volume of tissue to be treated, with a precise destructive effect. The radiation dose is usually measured in grays (one gray (Gy) is the absorption of one joule of energy per kilogram of mass). A unit that attempts to take into account both the different organs that are irradiated and the type of radiation is the sievert, a unit that describes both the amount of energy deposited and the biological effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|Izzie's cancer storyline {{received}} a mixed {{response from the}} medical community. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, commented that Izzie's treatment options were unrealistic. Whereas in the show she was offered the drug interleukin-2, in reality the drug is never recommended to patients when melanoma has spread to the brain, as it can cause bleeding and strokes. Brawley explained that such patients would instead be offered <b>radiosurgery.</b> Conversely however, Tim Turnham, {{executive director of the}} Melanoma Research Foundation, praised Grey's Anatomy for bringing about greater public awareness of melanoma, stating: [...] "We welcome the national spotlight Grey's Anatomy has created for melanoma and its efforts to encourage viewers {{to learn more about the}} importance of prevention, early detection and research." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st {{century the}} {{original}} concept of <b>radiosurgery</b> [...] {{expanded to include}} treatments comprising up to five fractions, and stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> has been redefined as a distinct neurosurgical discipline that utilizes externally generated ionizing radiation to inactivate or eradicate defined targets, typically in the head or spine, {{without the need for}} a surgical incision. [...] Irrespective of the similarities between the concepts of stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> and fractionated radiotherapy the intent of both approaches is fundamentally different, although both treatment modalities are reported to have identical outcomes for certain indications. The aim of stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> is to destroy target tissue while preserving adjacent normal tissue, where fractionated radiotherapy relies on a different sensitivity of the target and the surrounding normal tissue to the total accumulated radiation dose. Historically, the field of fractionated radiotherapy evolved from the original concept of stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> following discovery of the principles of radiobiology: repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation. Today, both treatment techniques are complementary, as tumors that may be resistant to fractionated radiotherapy may respond well to <b>radiosurgery,</b> and tumors that are too large or too close to critical organs for safe <b>radiosurgery</b> may be suitable candidates for fractionated radiotherapy.|$|E
2500|$|Today, both Gamma Knife and Linac <b>radiosurgery</b> {{programs}} are commercially available worldwide. While the Gamma Knife {{is dedicated to}} <b>radiosurgery,</b> most Linacs are built for conventional fractionated radiotherapy and require additional technology and expertise to become dedicated <b>radiosurgery</b> tools. This is exemplified by the , designed to complement conventional Linacs with sophisticated beam-shaping technology, treatment planning, [...] and image-guidance tools to provide highest treatment accuracy. An example of a dedicated <b>radiosurgery</b> Linac is the CyberKnife, a compact Linac mounted onto a robotic arm that moves around the patient and irradiates the tumor from a large set of fixed positions, thereby mimicking the Gamma Knife concept.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Radiosurgery</b> is {{indicated}} {{primarily for the}} therapy of tumors, vascular lesions and functional disorders. [...] Significant clinical judgment must be used with this technique and considerations must include lesion type, pathology if available, size, location and age and general health of the patient. [...] General contraindications to <b>radiosurgery</b> include excessively large size of the target lesion, or lesions too numerous for practical treatment. Patients can be treated within one to five days as outpatients. By comparison, the average hospital stay for a craniotomy (conventional neurosurgery, requiring {{the opening of the}} skull) is about 15 days. The <b>radiosurgery</b> outcome may not be evident until months after the treatment. Since <b>radiosurgery</b> does not remove the tumor but inactivates it biologically, lack of growth of the lesion is normally considered to be treatment success. General indications for <b>radiosurgery</b> include many kinds of brain tumors, such as acoustic neuromas, germinomas, meningiomas, metastases, trigeminal neuralgia, arteriovenous malformations, and skull base tumors, among others. Expansion of stereotactic radiotherapy to extracranial lesions is increasing, and includes metastases, liver cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Radiosurgery</b> is surgery using radiation, that is, the {{destruction}} of precisely selected areas of tissue using ionizing radiation rather than excision with a blade. Like other forms of radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy), it is usually used to treat cancer. <b>Radiosurgery</b> was originally defined by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell as [...] "a single high dose fraction of radiation, stereotactically directed to an intracranial region of interest".|$|E
2500|$|In {{stereotactic}} <b>radiosurgery</b> (SRS), {{the word}} [...] "stereotactic" [...] {{refers to a}} three-dimensional coordinate system that enables accurate correlation of a virtual target seen in the patient's diagnostic images with the actual target position in the patient.|$|E
2500|$|In the album's liner notes, a mock {{definition}} is printed that explains that <b>Radiosurgery</b> is [...] "a medical procedure that allows non-invasive treatment used to target unwanted memories in the brain. <b>Radiosurgery</b> operates by directing highly focused waves of ionizing sound with high precision. It {{is a relatively}} recent technique (1997), which {{has been shown to}} be beneficial for the treatment of past regrets and lost love." [...] On August 2, the album's artwork and packaging details were released. It was confirmed that the album would be available in a number of formats, including a standard CD, a deluxe edition double CD featuring four exclusive b-sides, including a cover of the Ramones hit [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", a limited 12" [...] pink vinyl LP, a special slipmat, as well as various other merchandise packages. The album booklet and cover art was designed by artist and clothes designer Kyle Crawford. The brain logo was designed to symbolise the theme of the album, with Chad Gilbert explaining [...] "We talked about the brain and <b>Radiosurgery.</b> We talked about wanting an image we could put on a lot of things. We wanted to have that feeling, that look." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gamma Knife <b>radiosurgery</b> {{has proven}} {{effective}} {{for patients with}} benign or malignant brain tumors up to 4 centimeters in size, vascular malformations such as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), pain, and other functional problems. [...] For treatment of trigeminal neuralgia the procedure may be used repeatedly on patients.|$|E
2500|$|A linear {{accelerator}} (linac) produces x-rays {{from the impact}} of accelerated electrons striking a high z target (usually tungsten). [...] A Linac therefore can generate x-rays of any energy, though usually 6MV photons are used. [...] With a Linac the gantry moves in space to change the delivery angle. Linear accelerator equipment can also move the patient lying on the treatment couch to change the delivery point. [...] These treatments involve using a stereotactic frame to restrict the patient's movement. The Novalis Shaped Beam <b>Radiosurgery</b> system and Tx <b>Radiosurgery</b> platform, from Brainlab, implement a frameless, non-invasive technique with X-ray imaging that {{has proven to be}} both comfortable for the patient and accurate. The Trilogy from Varian, or CyberKnife from Accuray, can also be used with non-invasive immobilization devices coupled with real-time imaging to detect any patient motion during a treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Radiation therapy {{may include}} photon-beam or proton-beam treatment, or {{fractionated}} external beam radiation. [...] <b>Radiosurgery</b> {{may be used}} in lieu of surgery in small tumors located away from critical structures. Fractionated external-beam radiation also can be used as primary treatment for tumors that are surgically unresectable or, for patients who are inoperable for medical reasons.|$|E

[...] UK based magazine Big Cheese placed the album at number fifteen on their [...] "50 Finest of 2011" [...] feature. Jim Sharples noted how the album was [...] "the sound of summer in CD form" [...] and praised its hooks and melodies. In the [...] "K! Critics' Top 101 Albums of the Year", Kerrang! writer Nick Ruskell ranked <b>Radiosurgery</b> at number nineteen. He wrote that, [...] "packed with power chord punch and more bounce to the ounce than all the young pretenders combined, it was a defiant statement that the originals were back and better than ever." [...] Andrew Kelham of Rock Sound ranked the album as the 26th best of the year in his article. He praised Radiosurgerys [...] "timeless 90's aesthetic", which he felt made the record [...] "endlessly enjoyable." [...] Rob Watson-Lang, co-editor for music webzine Ourzone, ranked <b>Radiosurgery</b> as the tenth best record of the year and described it as some of the best material the band had written in some time.|$|E
2500|$|Anticipation for {{the album}} was {{increased}} when Alternative Press magazine issued their annual [...] "20 Must-Hear Fall Releases" [...] list, which included New Found Glory's <b>Radiosurgery,</b> while Rock Sound magazine called <b>Radiosurgery,</b> [...] "the most eagerly anticipated pop-punk album of the summer." [...] The Buffalo News noted that alongside another batch of strong releases within the genre, <b>Radiosurgery</b> is helping pop punk regain its relevance and popularity. The following week, the band announced via Twitter {{that they would be}} shooting a music video for the title track.

Aside from other promotional work in the UK leading up to their appearances at Reading and Leeds, Chad Gilbert and Jordan Pundik performed an exclusive acoustic version of [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] for music webzine Alter The Press. Kerrang! magazine announced on August 31 that the band had released a short making-of video with footage of them in the studio recording the album. It was reported on September 9 that the band would be completing a short tour in Brazil with support from Four Year Strong during January 2012. The band will play in Porto Alegre on January 10, later playing Curitiba and SÃ£o Paulo, before closing in Rio de Janeiro on January 15.

2500|$|On May 12, 2011, {{the band}} {{announced}} to fans via a live video chat that their new album would be titled <b>Radiosurgery</b> and {{they hoped to}} release it sometime in September. The band's primary composer Chad Gilbert has explained that the album title is a direct reference to the medical procedure <b>radiosurgery,</b> where a patient is treated by x rays or gamma rays to remove a tumor or growth from the brain. The band feel that the concept {{is very similar to}} the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, where a couple [...] one another from their memories. Chad Gilbert revealed that since the band last wrote new material in 2008, one member suffered a [...] "severe" [...] divorce. [...] "It's for them to talk about, not me.

Guitarists Chad Gilbert and Steve Klein maneuver speedy melodies around singer Jordan Pundik's tales of love and loss, while drummer Cyrus Bolooki and bassist Ian Grushka propel the band. New Found Glory is at its best when sounding highly caffeinated, even if breakneck tempos belie a song's blue mood." [...] Vanessa Spates of daily newspaper The Lantern awarded <b>Radiosurgery</b> an [...] "A" [...] grade in her review. She wrote that [...] "Seven studio albums is an impressive feat for a punk rock band in a post-rock era. They keep a youthful quality in the manic guitars and the fury of drums. The entire album is infectious and invokes a lot of heartbreak anthems that everyone can relate to." [...] Roz Smith, writing for New Jersey tabloid The Aquarian Weekly, felt the album was undeniably [...] "catchy", emphasizing its [...] "choruses, upbeat guitar riffs, bass grooves and slamming drums." [...] Nicole Villeneuve of Candadian magazine Exclaim! also offered a positive review and wrote how the album was full of [...] "lively hooks and crisp songs in a taut pop-punk package." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN scored the album at 8.5 out of 10 and called it a [...] "vibrant, infinitely listenable treat." [...] He {{went on to explain}} that, [...] "Channeling the brand of freewheeling, fun-loving pop-punk the quintet burst onto the scene playing years ago, the lean, in-your-face set of tracks examining a crumbled relationship hits hard." [...] Rock Sound journalist Terry Bezer explained how there [...] "isn't a wasted minute on Radiosurgey", whilst awarding a near perfect 9 out of 10 score. He noted how the album [...] "will delight pop-punk purists and NFG faithful alike", before praising the songwriting as some of the band's most infectious to-date. Steve M, staff writer for Sputnikmusic awarded <b>Radiosurgery</b> a [...] "great" [...] 3.5 out of 5 score. He felt the album contained [...] "all the little quirks of their earlier material," [...] before adding, [...] "it is difficult not {{to get caught up in}} <b>Radiosurgery</b> for what it is: a short and sweet pop-punk album designed to get you out of your chair and moving." [...] Consequence of Sound writer Kevin Barber awarded the album three stars out of five in his review. He wrote that, [...] "On <b>Radiosurgery,</b> New Found Glory have found their older, faster, and stronger sound, dishing out anthemic choruses, while still holding on to their [...] "" [...] maturity." [...] Jason Heller of The A.V. Club was less receptive, awarding the album a [...] "C" [...] grade and bemoaning the bands, [...] "same bouncy/bittersweet dynamic.
