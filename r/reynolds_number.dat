25|$|In a {{turbulent}} flow, {{there is a}} range of scales of the time-varying fluid motion. The size of the largest scales of fluid motion (sometimes called eddies) are set by the overall geometry of the flow. For instance, in an industrial smoke stack, the largest scales of fluid motion are {{as big as the}} diameter of the stack itself. The size of the smallest scales is set by the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>number.</b> As the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>number</b> increases, smaller and smaller scales of the flow are visible. In a smoke stack, the smoke may appear to have many very small velocity perturbations or eddies, in addition to large bulky eddies. In this sense, the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>number</b> is an indicator of the range of scales in the flow. The higher the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>number,</b> the greater the range of scales. The largest eddies will always be the same size; the smallest eddies are determined by the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Reynolds</b> <b>number</b> is a {{dimensionless}} quantity which characterises {{the magnitude of}} inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects.
