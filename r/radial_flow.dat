The higher longitudinal permeability of sapwood of hardwood is generally caused {{by the presence of}} vessels. The lateral permeability and transverse flow is often very low in hardwoods. The vessels in hardwoods are sometimes blocked by the presence of tyloses and/or by secreting gums and resins in some other species, as mentioned earlier. The presence of gum veins, the formation of which is often a result of natural protective response of trees to injury, is commonly observed on the surface of sawn boards of most eucalypts. Despite the generally higher volume fraction of rays in hardwoods (typically 15% of wood volume), the rays are not particularly effective in <b>radial</b> <b>flow,</b> nor are the pits on the radial surfaces of fibres effective in tangential flow (Langrish and Walker, 1993).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> (directed either inward or outward) {{suppress}} mean-field dynamo {{action in a}} thin disc.

The dynamo-generated galactic magnetic fields themselves can drive <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> at a rate of order 0. 1 M ⊙ yr − 1. These <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> can contribute to the saturation of the dynamo action together with other nonlinear effects. We also present arguments, and an illustrative computation, to support the view that in the inner regions of barred galaxies the magnetically driven mass accretion rate may be substantially larger than the above estimate due to deviations of magnetic field from axial symmetry. The magnetically driven inflow rate in barred galaxies can reach about 3 M ⊙ yr − 1.

40|$|The {{majority}} of chemical evolution models {{assume that the}} Galactic disk forms by means of infall of gas and divide the disk into several independent rings without exchange of matter between them. However, if gas infall is important, <b>radial</b> gas <b>flows</b> {{should be taken into}} account as a dynamical consequence of infall. The aim {{of this paper is to}} test the effect of <b>radial</b> gas <b>flows</b> on detailed chemical evolution models (one-infall and two-infall) for the Milky Way disk with different prescriptions for the infall law and star formation rate. We found, that with a gas radial inflow of constant speed the metallicity gradient tends to steepen. Taking into account a constant time scale for the infall rate along the Galaxy disk and <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> with a constant speed, we obtained a too flat gradient, at variance with data, implying that an inside-out formation and/or a variable gas flow speed are required. To reproduce the observed gradients the gas flow should increase in modulus with the galactocentric distance, both in the one-infall and two-infall models. However, the inside-out disk formation coupled with a threshold in the gas density (only in the two-infall model) for star formation and/or a variable efficiency of star formation with galactocentric distance can also reproduce the observed gradients without <b>radial</b> <b>flows.</b> We showed that the <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> can be the most important process in reproducing abundance gradients but only with a variable gas speed. Finally, one should consider that uncertainties in the data concerning gradients prevent us to draw firm conclusions. Future more detailed data will help to ascertain whether the <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> are a necessary ingredient in the formation and evolution of the Galactic disk and disks in general.

40|$|Context. Galactic fountains and <b>radial</b> gas <b>flows</b> {{are very}} {{important}} ingredients for modeling the chemical evolution of galactic disks. Aims: Our aim here is to {{study the effects of}} galactic fountains and <b>radial</b> gas <b>flows</b> on the chemical evolution of the disk of Andromeda (M 31) galaxy. Methods: We adopt a ballistic method to study the effects of galactic fountains on the chemical enrichment of the M 31 disk by analyzing the landing coordinate of the fountains and the time delay in the pollution of the interstellar gas. To understand the consequences of <b>radial</b> <b>flows,</b> we adopt a very detailed chemical evolution model. Our aim is to study the formation of abundance gradients along the M 31 disk and also compare our results with the Milky Way. Results: We find that the landing coordinate for the fountains in M 31 is no more than 1 kpc from the starting point, thus producing a negligible effect on the chemical evolution of the disk. We find that the delay time in the enrichment process due to fountains is no longer than 100 Myr, and this timescale also produces insignificant effects on the results. Then, we compute the chemical evolution of the M 31 disk with <b>radial</b> gas <b>flows</b> produced by the infall of extragalactic material and fountains. We find that a moderate inside-out formation of the disk, coupled with <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> of variable speed, can reproduce the observed gradient very well. We also discuss the effects of other parameters, such as a threshold in the gas density for star formation and efficiency of star formation varying with the galactic radius. Conclusions: We conclude that galactic fountains do not affect the chemical evolution of the M 31 disk. Including <b>radial</b> gas <b>flows</b> with an inside-out formation of the disk produces a very good agreement with observations. On the other hand, if <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> are not considered, one should assume a threshold in the star formation and variable star formation efficiency, besides the inside-out formation to reproduce the data. We conclude that the most important physical processes in creating disk gradients are the inside-out formation and the <b>radial</b> gas <b>flows.</b> More data on abundance gradients both locally and at high redshift are necessary to confirm this conclusion...|$|R

40|$|We {{compute the}} {{abundance}} gradients along the disc of the Milky Way {{by means of}} the two-infall model: in particular, the gradients of oxygen and iron and their temporal evolution. First, we explore the effects of several physical processes which influence the formation and evolution of abundance gradients. They are (i) the inside-out formation of the disc, (ii) a threshold in the gas density for star formation, (iii) a variable star formation efficiency along the disc, (iv) <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> and their speed and (v) different total surface mass density (gas plus stars) distributions for the halo. We are able to reproduce at best the present day gradients of oxygen and iron if we assume an inside-out formation, no threshold gas density, a constant efficiency of star formation along the disc and <b>radial</b> gas <b>flows.</b> It is particularly important the choice of the velocity pattern for <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> and the combination of this velocity pattern with the surface mass density distribution in the halo. Having selected the best model, we then explore the evolution of abundance gradients in time and find that the gradients in general steepen in time and that at redshift z ˜ 3 there is a gradient inversion in the inner regions of the disc, in the sense that at early epochs the oxygen abundance decreases towards the Galactic Centre. This effect, which has been observed, is naturally produced by our models if an inside-out formation of the disc and a constant star formation efficiency are assumed. The inversion {{is due to the fact}} that in the inside-out formation a strong infall of primordial gas, contrasting chemical enrichment, is present in the innermost disc regions at early times. The gradient inversion remains also in the presence of <b>radial</b> <b>flows,</b> either with constant or variable speed in time, and this is a new result...|$|R
