40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Detailed {{geologic}} mapping in the Mormon Mountains and new geophysical data provide significant {{insight into}} contractional and extensional tectonics in southern Nevada, southwest Utah, and northwest Arizona. The {{rocks in the}} region were complexly deformed during two distinct tectonic episodes. Numerous interrelated events occurred within each episode. The first tectonic episode, related to the Sevier orogeny, was characterized by east-west crustal shortening which culminated in thin-skinned decollement style folding and thrusting during the Cretaceous. The Virgin-Beaver Dam Mountains anticline, a Laramide-type basement-involved uplift, represents the only thick-skinned contractional structure in the region. The second tectonic episode, related to basin-range rifting, was characterized by east-west crustal extension which was accommodated by high-angle normal faults, with dips averaging 60 degrees, in the brittle upper crust. In this area, basin-range rifting initiated in the Oligocene and continued to Recent time. Relations in the North Muddy Mountains in southern Nevada suggest that the Muddy Mountain thrust sheet advanced and overrode the Weiser syncline during the Cenomanian and may have continued to advance in Turonian time. In the southern Mormon Mountains, the Cambrian Bonanza King Formation lies in the hanging wall flat position in thrust contact with the overturned Petrified Forest Member of the Triassic Chinle Formation at the footwall ramp. The thrust sheet advanced eastward more than 30 km from the place of origin. Thrust imbrication, and probably the formation of hanging wall horses, likely occurred as the Muddy Mountain thrust sheet encountered and ascended up the footwall <b>ramp</b> <b>zone</b> (composed largely of competent carbonate rocks) where slices of the thrust sheet (hanging wall horses) splayed of f and accreted to the footwall <b>ramp</b> <b>zone.</b> A detailed retrodeformable (balanced) regional structure section suggests that fold-thrust shortening at the latitude of the Mormon Mountains is a minimum of about 26...|$|E
40|$|The Casaglia Monte della Colonna (CMC) body, {{from the}} middle Miocene Marnoso-arenacea Formation of the Northern Apennines, {{covering}} more than 350 square kilometers, provides {{a rare opportunity to}} study the geometry and the internal deformation of a large, basin-wide submarine landslide. Although the head zone of the landslide has not been preserved, the body has a transitional zone, a contractional ramp cutting off more than 200 meters of the footwall stratigraphic succession, and a very wide lobe spilling over onto. the adjoining basin plain deposits. The extent of the body, the depth of the ramp cut-off and the widening of the lobe are comparable with the largest present-day submarine landslides, not often observed in fossil examples. Internal deformation structures are distributed differently in the ramp and lobe zones. The <b>ramp</b> <b>zone</b> has antiformal stacking of duplexes and steeply inclined folds. The lobe has a well-defined strain partition: {{the upper part of the}} body is affected by extensional structures such as listric normal faults and extensional duplexes; the lower part is de formed by recumbent folds, boudinage and stacking of blocks, which are compatible with flow-induced, heterogeneous simple shear. This distribution is consistent with a kinematic model of extrusion-spreading, implying rear compression in the <b>ramp</b> <b>zone</b> with thickening and shortening of the body, and spreading in the lobe with thinning and stretching. The localized buckling present in the distal part of the lobe may be related to the onset of lateral confinement,, due to local topographic features of the basin plain (synsedimentary intrabasinal high). The various degrees and styles of stratal disruption in the mass wasting body depend on the different combination of progressive simple shear, layer-parallel extension and shortening. Different structural associations occur in well-defined parts of the body due to kinematics of emplacement (spreading, flow and buckling). These associations may be diagnostic of. gravitational mass wasting processes rather than shallow-level tectonic deformation...|$|E
40|$|Marine, cool-water {{carbonate}} ramps {{considered in}} terms of their defining features. Cool-water carbonate environments are dominated by open, skeletal debris-covered sea bottoms which support biological assemblages devoid of hermatypic corals, calcified green algae and non-skeletal grains. The growing body of modern literature deals mainly with Neogene to Recent examples, particularly from the Australia, New Zealand and Mediterranean regions. Nevertheless, many ancient examples have be recognised and without doubt many more, currently described as ‘tropical carbonates’, will also be found to be cool-water examples. It is now becoming clear that a distinction must be made between those deposits associated with macrotidal regimes (i. e. World ocean sites) and those associated with land locked water bodies such as the Mediterranean Sea. The principle difference between the two {{is not so much the}} diversity of biota but, more importantly, the minimal fair-weather reworking processes which characterise microtidal seas. This commonly allows colonisation and sediment preservation in the inner <b>ramp</b> <b>zone.</b> Biozones occupy much deeper water sites on open ocean ramps, particularly where ramps are storm-dominated. The correspondingly wider inner ramps in these World ocean sites generally become dominated by mass bioclastic reworking...|$|E
40|$|Hydropeaking in {{regulated}} rivers {{is likely to}} become more frequent with increasing demands for renewable energy. Sudden fluctuations affect surface and subsurface flow regimes and change hydrological interactions occurring in the hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone plays an important role for salmon embryonic development, and groundwater influx may create refuges for egg survival during low flow in hydropeaking {{regulated rivers}}. The links between salmon embryo survival and hyporheic hydrological processes during hydropeaking have hardly been investigated. A field experiment was undertaken in a 5 [*]×[*] 20 [*]m side gravel bar subject to dewatering due to hydropeaking.

40|$|Abstract — A fault, {{designated}} the Katdoornbosch—Witpoortjie Thrust, was traced {{in the field}} continuously from the area north of Klerksdorp to the West Rand. It is shown that the Katdoornbosch Thrust and the Witpoortjie Fault form elements ofthe same structure. Evidence is presented why the Witpoortjie Fault should be designated a thrust. Thrust faults related to the VredefortEvent are recognized mainly by their 2 Ga, post-Transvaal age, their concentric arrangement around the cen-tre of the structure, and their centrifugal vergence, away from the centre. Where chert beds ofthe Malmani Subgroup were intersected, thrust faults of Vredefort Event age can be recognized by a unique type of brecciation, displaying chocolate-tablet-type boudinage, with fracturing having taken place in threedimensions. The brecciation is confined uniquely to the <b>ramp</b> <b>zones</b> and was probably formed during the release of three-dimensional, hydrostatic stress, when fault detachment took place. The recognition of this type ofbrecciation along the planes of the thrust faults associated with the stage of cen-trifugally directed movement, during {{the formation of the}} Vredefort Structure, provides an important criterion in their rec-ognition. The Katdoornbosch—Witpoortjie Thrust is one of a set of similarly orientated, time-related thrusts, formed during the Vredefort impact event...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{findings}} on the causes of Atlantic salmon embryo mortality during winter in a hydropeaking river suggest that long duration drawdowns during very cold periods {{are the most likely}} cause of mortality in the <b>ramping</b> <b>zone.</b> This paper presents a framework in which thresholds for optimal embryo survival at the microscale are linked to physical habitat requirements at the mesoscale and integrated into alternative hydropower operations at the catchment scale. The connections within this framework are derived from a one-dimensional hydraulic model at the mesoscale and a hydropower simulation programme at the catchment scale. The economic costs and feasibility of several alternative options for hydropeaking operation that would comply with ecological requirements for optimal survival of embryos were evaluated. A method to assess a wide range of alternative hydropower options that considers key factors to mitigate the conflicting requirements of ecological targets, technical feasibility and economics is presented. Targeted alternative environmental flow releases to meet specific ecological objectives are often more effective than general operational rules to comply with legislation. The development of well-informed and targeted mitigation strategies is important for future environmental hydropower management...|$|R
40|$|Hydropeaking in rivers {{is likely}} to become more {{frequent}} in a context of increasing demand for renewable energy due to the storage potential of hydropower systems. Increased peaking operation in hydropower plants will lead to more frequent and more rapid flow changes and to the dewatering and flooding of rivers. General knowledge regarding the environmental effects of hydropeaking exists, but {{further research is needed to}} fully understand the consequences of such fluctuations on an individual case basis for the development of targeted mitigation strategies. The present thesis aims to fill some knowledge gaps by focusing on the physical processes occurring during wetting and drying and their consequences for ecology. The approach is to investigate the small-scale biological and physical processes occurring during hydropeaking and to integrate the findings with alternative hydropower production opportunities at the larger scale. At the micro-scale, the hyporheic zone is altered by hydropeaking with respect to changing flow rates, water levels, durations and temperatures, with differences being captured during individual events, seasons and flooding and dewatering processes. Such physical processes play an important role on Atlantic salmon embryo survival, which was unexpectedly high in the <b>ramping</b> <b>zone</b> but was still lower in comparison to permanently wet areas of the hydropeaked Lundesokna River. With no water quality issues and very low inputs of fine sediments, exposure to dry conditions due to production stops and below-zero air temperatures were the main drivers of mortality in the <b>ramping</b> <b>zone.</b> Survival was extensively explained by the extent of subsurface influx, keeping the eggs from dry and frost conditions. Findings were supported by experiments carried out in the seasonally regulated river Suldalslågen, with a long winter drawdown. At the meso-scale, specific guidelines for accurately predicting potential stranding areas were established by analysing four different river morphologies in the Lundesokna River. The optimal geometry effort (number of cross sections) was found to not necessarily occur at the maximum but varied depending on sinuosity and channel complexity. In the permanently wet area, a cost-effective methodology to predict dynamic mesohabitats was developed by using existing HMU classification methods. Although further development is needed, this method showed promising results for the prediction of dynamic mesohabitats at the river scale. The above findings were finally integrated through a linking methodology, using the findings on ecological processes at the micro-scale and on physical habitat at the meso-scales to establish alternative hydropower management options at the catchment scale. The connections within this framework were successfully established through a one-dimensional hydraulic model and a hydropower operation program, providing a method to integrate detailed knowledge of environmental processes into alternative hydropower operational planning.

40|$|Although the calcimicrobial reefs of the basinal Little Dal Group ( 780 Ma) are well-described, {{little is}} known about related shallow-water facies to the southeast. Study of these platformal carbonates shows that they {{represent}} inner, mid- and shallow outer <b>ramp</b> <b>zones</b> of a homoclinal, storm-influenced ramp. Seven depositional sequences are recognized and correlated with reef-bearing strata in the Little Dal basin and in the Shaler Supergroup of Victoria Island. Reef distribution is distinctly depth partitioned across the Little Dal ramp. Inner and mid-ramp carbonates contain meter-scale mounds, patch reefs, and biostromes composed of fine-grained stromatolites including Tungussia, Baicalia, and Jurusania. These reefs are strikingly similar to those reported from coeval shallow-water strata in the Shaler Supergroup of Victoria Island and the Bitter Springs Formation of Australia. Multi-storey stromatolitic biostrome/bioherm complexes greater than 100 m in height, seem to be restricted to the mid-ramp zone of the Little Dal ramp and probably reflect high rates of subsidence in the Mackenzie Basin. Calcimicrobial reefs occur only in the deepest water strata of the study area, associated with outer ramp sediments. These reefs contain calcified cyanobacterial filaments in varying degrees of preservation, and are petrographically indistinguishable from the kilometre scale basinal calcimicrobial reefs to the northwest. The association of calcimicrobial reefs with deep, low-energy environments suggests initial establishment of reef-building calcimicrobes in deep-water benthic environments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: During sea-level highstand in late Mid-Devonian time, a {{carbonate}} ramp {{was established}} {{on the vast}} shelf of the Northwest African Craton, in the Ahnet and Mouydir Basins of southern Algeria. The ramp was at least 400 km wide and 700 km long and sloped, {{in front of a}} local shoal of rugose-tabulate-stromatoporoid dominated biostromes, towards the west into the Reggane Basin and towards the north into the B 6 char Basin. Mid- and inner <b>ramp</b> <b>zones</b> were presumably situated {{in the area of the}} present Hoggar Massif and have been removed by erosion. Subsidence rates during Mid-Devonian time were considerably ower than during the preceding and subsequent periods of clastic sedimen-tation in Early and Late Devonian time. Spectacular mud buildups formed in an outer amp setting and developed from small, lens-shaped, to steep, conical mounds, which eventually amalgamated into mud ridges and mud 'atolls'. Orientation of mound rows and ridges matches older NW-SE and N-S tectonic lineaments, which were probably rejuvenated during Mid-Devonian time. Stable isotope values of early marine cements, composition of the buildup fauna, and the mplacement and orientation of neptunian dykes do not indi-cate, however, that buildup growth was triggered by hydrothermal ctivity or cold seeps. Few regions in the world offer such fascinating and endless outcrops, but are nevertheless so poorly known as the central Sahara. This con-tradiction is mainly a result of the remoteness of the area, the difficulty of access and the xtreme climatic conditions. As part of an investigation of Middle Devonian and Lower Carboniferous mud mounds on the shelf of the Northwest African Craton, three expeditions were carried out into the Ahnet and Mouydir areas of south-ern Algeria in 1992 - 1994. They were focused on the study of numerous Middle Devonian carbonate mud buildups, which are exhumed in a spectacular manner in the southern Ahnet Basin. First accounts of these mounds were pro-vided by Moussine-Pouchkine (1971) and Wendt et al. (1993, 1997).

30|$|Figure  12 {{shows the}} raw data {{collected}} from 30 % watercut test. The plot {{can be divided into}} four zones. The first zone (Zone I) is pre-hydrate formation and mainly involves cooldown and pressure maintenance. The second zone (Zone II) is the hydrate formation and gas addition zone which starts from hydrate formation onset (HFO) and ends when gas is cutoff. The third zone (Zone III) is the stabilization zone during which no gas is added but hydrate formation continues until pressure stabilizes or decreases by less than 25 psi in an hour. The last zone (Zone IV) is speed <b>ramping</b> <b>zone</b> during which rheological data is collected. Data on this plot starts 0.25  h before hydrate formation onset. Data recorded includes pressure (psia), shaft speed (rpm), gas flow rates (ml/min), vessel temperature (°F) and shaft torque (N cm). Data collected from Zone I may be used to correlate the carrier fluid viscosity to parameters such as watercut, gas oil ratio (GOR), temperature and oil API. This work is ongoing at The University of Tulsa. HFO marks the start Zone II. HFO was observed at 42  °F and was accompanied by pressure decrease, temperature increase due to exothermic nature of hydrate formation, and torque increase capturing changes in viscosity. HFO leads to gas consumption from the flow mixtures which results in “dead” oil–water mixture momentarily triggering spikes in torque. This is a transient mass transfer phenomenon and should not be interpreted as viscosity change. The gas flow meter was set to provide gas to the system at a rate up to 1000 ml/min to maintain pressure at 1100 psi. So during cooling gas was added at a low flow rates to compensate for volume shrinkage due to temperature decrease. However, at HFO gas flow rate jumped to the maximum allowable flow rate of 1000 ml/min. This meant that if the gas consumption due hydrate formation was higher that gas flow rate then system pressure would decrease. And when hydrate formation slowed down, system pressure would be maintained at 1100 psi. Data collected in Zone II is useful when modeling the transient behavior or system response during hydrate formation. During zone III, the vessel temperature approached the jacket temperature, vessel pressure decreased to a new value close to 850 psi, and torque stabilized. During this zone, hydrate formation continues. Generally, torque increases due to formation of more hydrates and gas consumption both of which lead to increase in slurry viscosity. Shaft speed ramps are performed in Zone IV. It should be noted that torque responded proportionally to shaft speed changes confirming that the slurry generated in this test were mostly dispersed. Also, the torque observed at 600  rpm at the end of Zone IV was close to the value observed {{at the start of the}} zone suggesting little to no yield stress.|$|R

First-order splay faults have been previously described for strike-slip faults and examples are here shown of first-order dip-slip splay faults.

40|$|More than 5, 500 carapaces, {{valves and}} {{fragments}} of ostracods, were extracted from 48 samples {{collected in the}} stratotype of the Terres d'Haurs Formation (= Fm) and in the very base of the stratotype of the Mont d'Haurs Fm, at the Mont d'Haurs, close to Givet. Fiftytwo species belonging to several assemblages of the Eifelian MegaAssemblage have been identified. They are generally indicative of neritic marine environments below fair-weather wave base, some even below storm wave base. Ostracods indicative of semi-restricted environments are also present but the sedimentological analysis displays that these ostracods have been mainly transported from these shallow settings. Close to the boundary of the Terres d'Haurs Fm and the Mont d'Haurs Fm, thick-shelled ostracods indicate that {{the energy of the}} environment increased. The richness in ostracods and their great diversity in the two studied sections prove that the living conditions were particularly favourable for these crustaceans. Ten microfacies are recognized, the succession of which (from 1 to 10) constitutes a standard shallowing upward sequence, with environments ranging from open marine, near storm wave base, to coastal, close to subaerial exposure. The microfacies analysis points to a carbonate ramp system with oolitic shoals and algal shoals separating semi-restricted and coastal areas from the open marine environment. Storm events and those related to the wave activity redistributed many organisms, which formed diversified communities with abundant echinoderms, bryozoans, molluscs and brachiopods in the peri-shoal environments. The lithological curve reflects a progessive and transgressive evolution in two phases marked by two parasequence sets: the first set records the destabilization of the overlain carbonate platform (Trois-Fontaines Fm) leading to the establishment of a shallow "open lagoon" in the inner ramp, the second set corresponds to the development of several shoals at the inner-mid <b>ramp</b> <b>zones.</b> No important reefal episode is present and shoals are of modest relief. The salinity and energy were the key parameters controlling the zonation of the organisms and the distribution of the environments. Low-field magnetic susceptibility (XLF) values are weak and eight magnetic susceptibility evolutions are reported along the lithological column. The magnetic susceptibility and microfacies curves are more or less mimetic in {{the lower half of the}} section and opposite in the upper part of the Terres d'Haurs Fm. A significant decreasing trend of the low-field magnetic susceptibility values across the boundary between the Terres d'Haurs Fm and the Mont d'Haurs Fm is presented. Two linear regression models show a moderately positive correlation between XLF values and microfacies in the lower half of the section and a moderately strong negative correlation between these two parameters in the upper part of the Terres d'Haurs Fm. The water agitation is highest in the mid and inner ramp, associated to the oolite and algal shoal environments and corresponds to the lowest mean XLF values presented in the models. The lower half of the section corresponds more to a carbonate platform profile in opposition to the second model, which confirm the carbonate ramp morphology. The average XLF values in the upper part of the Terres d'Haurs Fm are more homogeneous compared to those reported in the lower half of the Terres d'Haurs Fm. High-resolution stratigraphie correlation for the base of the Mont d'Haurs Fm in Belgium and France is proposed due to similar XLFdata established in the "Les Monts de Baileux" section 40 km distant from the stratotype area.

40|$|Oligocene {{carbonate}} ramps and platforms are {{widespread and}} though they are important carbonate reservoirs, detailed studies on the facies organization, platform type and internal architecture are scarce. Within this context, the Chattian carbonate units cropping out in Salento (southern Italy) allow detailed study {{of the distribution of}} skeletal components and facies architecture. The lower Chattian Castro Limestone, previously considered as a fringing reef, is reinterpreted as a distally steepened ramp with a distal talus induced by a paleo-escarpment in the substrate. Epiphytic biota and sediment dweller organisms thriving in seagrass meadows dominated production in the shallow-water euphotic zone. Seawards, large rotalid foraminifers dominated a detritic mesophotic zone. Near the edge of the escarpment, also in the mesophotic zone, luxurious growth of corals built discrete mounds with no evidences of wave-resistant growth fabrics. Basinward, 25 ° to 30 ° dipping clinobeds abut against the escarpment where coral rudstone/floatstone textures resulted from downfall of corals and sediments. The upper Chattian Porto Badisco Calcarenite represents a homoclinal ramp dominated by packstone textures. In the euphotic inner ramp, autochthonous biota suggests the occurrence of extensive seagrass meadows. Basinward, large rotalid packstone and small coral mounds developed in mesophotic conditions, and rhodolithic floatstone to rudstone and large lepidocyclinid packstone characterize the sediments of the deeper oligophotic zone. Comminuted skeletal debris, depleted of light-dependent organisms, typifies deposition in the dysphotic/aphotic zone. In both examples, the middle <b>ramp</b> (meso-oligophotic <b>zones)</b> was the most prolific in terms of carbonate production, whereas shallow-water seagrass-related production (euphotic) was much less important. Corals built mounds, also in the mesophotic zone but never reached sea level. Hydrodynamic conditions in the meso-oligophotic zone are better explained by breaking of internal waves, and their induced up- and down-slope currents, instead of the surface storm waves. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|The growing {{costs of}} fuel and {{operation}} of power generating units warrant improvement of optimization methodologies for economic dispatch (ED) problems. The practical ED problems have non-convex objective functions with equality and inequality constraints that make it much harder to find the global optimum using any mathematical algorithms. Modern optimization algorithms are often meta-heuristic, {{and they are very}} promising in solving nonlinear programming problems. This paper presents a novel approach to determining the feasible optimal solution of the ED problems using the recently developed Firefly Algorithm (FA). Many nonlinear characteristics of power generators, and their operational constraints, such as generation limitations, prohibited operating <b>zones,</b> <b>ramp</b> rate limits, transmission loss, and nonlinear cost functions, were all contemplated for practical operation. To demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed method, we study four ED test systems having non-convex solution spaces and compared {{with some of the most}} recently published ED solution methods. The results of this study show that the proposed FA is able to find more economical loads than those determined by other methods. This algorithm is considered to be a promising alternative algorithm for solving the ED problems in practical power systems...|$|R

Freeway diverges represent particularly difficult work zones areas. This thesis investigates current methods of delineating diverges in freeway work zones to determine important characteristics of these methods for future research. A virtual environment was constructed with two ramp geometries: a freeway continuing straight and one curving left. Still images of work zones on these geometries were created using drums spaced 10 ft apart, drums spaced 40 ft apart, drums spaced 40 ± 2 ft apart, and portable concrete barriers. These alternatives were used to construct temporary ramps that were either open or closed. 39 {{participants were asked to}} identify whether the ramp was open or closed and their responses were recorded to evaluate the performance of each alternative. Results indicate the importance of the Gestalt principles of closure, proximity, and continuity in perception of temporary exit <b>ramps</b> in work <b>zones.</b> These results will be used to guide future research into methods of delineating diverges in freeway work zones.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{there has been}} an active program in Hong Kong to manage and protect local populations of small {{cetaceans}} from the effects of massive development in the area. This paper reviews the progress that has been made. Only two species regularly occur there: the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and the finless porpoise. Because most development has occurred in the western waters of Hong Kong, where generally only the humpback dolphin occurs, most of the work has been conducted on that species. Development of large infrastructure projects (such as airports, bridges, expressways, power plants, fuel facilities, and container ports) in Hong Kong often results in land reclamation, dredging and dumping of spoils, pipe and cable laying, percussive and bored piling work, underwater blasting, large increases in vessel traffic, and other impacts. Several mitigation measures have been used with varying levels of success, including bubble curtains/jackets, exclusion <b>zones,</b> <b>ramping</b> up of piling hammers, acoustic decoupling of noisy equipment, vessel speed limits, no-dumping policies, and silt curtains. Baseline, construction-phase, and operational-phase cetacean monitoring is often conducted to evaluate the success of conservation measures put into place. The Environmental Impact Assessment process in Hong Kong has involved cetaceans to a degree perhaps higher {{than anywhere else in the}} world, and much can be learned from studying the successes and failures of this situation.

40|$|Within {{the southeastern}} Tauern Window, the Sonnblick Dome is a large, NE-verging, antiformal {{structure}} composed of orthogneisses of the Zentralgneis Complex. This unit represents part of the European crystalline basement, or Penninic domain, over which the Adriatic microplate was thrust during Alpine continental collision. The igneous precursors to the gneisses formed as granitoids above a subduction zone during the Hercynian. During Alpine continental collision, overthrusting of the African-derived Austroalpine units toward the northwest produced a foliation that becomes more intense towards the tectonic contact of the gneiss and the overlying Peripheral Schieferhülle. This foliation was folded during {{the formation of the}} Sonnblick Dome, which is interpreted to have developed during progressive top-to-NW shearing in the hangingwall of an oblique <b>ramp.</b> Shear <b>zones</b> also developed oblique to the northwest transport direction and led to imbrication in the basement. These shear zones are commonly marked by retrogression of the primary mineralogy and the development of mica-schists. Although this alteration is associated with syn-deformational fluid infiltration, a spatial relationship between reaction site and deformation suggests that the energy associated with deformation contributed to reactions during shear zone formation. As a response to tectonic thickening, pressures and temperatures in the Pennine basement increased. Peak Alpine metamorphic conditions are estimated to be 540 ± 50 °C and 8 ±lkbar and probably represent conditions developed during uplift from initially greater depths. White mica isotopic ages suggest that the peak of metamorphism took place at 25 - 28 Ma, with older ages being observed towards the southeastern end of the Dome. Post-metamorphic cooling rates appear to be variable throughout the Dome, with faster rates being found for the southeastern end of the Dome. After 20 Ma ago, cooling rates around the Dome became more uniform (17 - 27 °C/Ma). Rapid cooling rates in the area are associated with rapid, post-metamorphic uplift rates. These were probably accomodated by gravity-driven extension of the tectonically thickened crust. Evidence for post-metamorphic extension is represented by ductile shear bands, which are associated with thinning of the more micaceous units found at higher levels in the Dome...|$|R
40|$|Traffic flow {{disturbances}} {{come from}} intersections, on/off <b>ramps,</b> work <b>zones,</b> pavement distress sections, tapering sections and ambient conditions. These cause speed drops and traffic flow rate changes and {{impact on the}} traffic carrying ability of roadway sections. These disturbances generate queues, cause long delays, increase travel times and may result in accidents. All these causes and effects must be considered if highway facilities should be operated unhindered. Thus this thesis examines the problems of rainfall disturbance to traffic flow and highway capacity. The effect of rainfall is more severe in tropical regions where it occurs in large quantities throughout the year. Thus four sites were set up in east and south Malaysian Peninsula respectively to generate data for the study. Data was collected using automatic traffic counters and rainfall data was obtained from two surface rain gauge stations that were 1174 m and 1840 m away from the data collection sites. The empirical data pointed towards speed and traffic flow reduction during rainfall spells. Further analysis using the fundamental diagram (trapezoidal flow contraction) method confirmed speed and flow reduction as the main impacts of rainfall to traffic flow in adverse weather. For the scenarios tested, such as peak period versus nonpeak, the trend remained the same. However, peak hour flow conditions are associated with instabilities {{that are difficult to}} separate from rainfall disturbances and were not analysed further. Highway capacity drops occurred between the dry condition and the three rainy regimes tested. Implications of traffic flow contraction for Passenger Car Equivalency (PCE) values of vehicles and traffic shock waves propagation were also investigated. PCE of heavy vehicles were lower than the values employed in the Arahan Teknik and the Malaysian Highway Capacity Manual, suggesting better performance of these vehicles under rainfall conditions mainly due to larger average headways and the prevailing free-flow conditions. In the case of traffic shock wave, the wave speeds were all lower than the speeds at critical density and the wave generated moved principally {{in the direction of the}} main stream flow, suggesting rarefaction waves rather than shock waves. The findings in this study could be incorporated into a wider strategy (Intelligent transportation system) to inform and assist drivers in inclement weather...|$|R
40|$|Fault tip regions, relay <b>ramps</b> and {{accommodation}} <b>zones</b> {{in between}} major segments of extensional fault systems provide zones of additional structural and stratigraphic complexities and also significantly affect their hydraulic behaviour. The great interest for both academic and industrial purposes encouraged specific studies of fault tip regions that, in some cases, produced controversial results. We approached {{the study of}} fault tip regions by integrating structural, AMS and stratigraphic analyses of the tip of an extensional growth fault system in the Tarquinia basin, on the Tyrrhenian side of the Northern Apennines. Detailed structural mapping indicates the occurrence of systematic relationships between {{the orientation of the}} main subsidiary fault zones, the orientation and position of the two main joint sets developed in the fault damage zones, and the overprinting relationships between the two main joint sets themselves. Microstructural analysis of fault core rocks indicates a progression of deformation from soft-sediment to brittle conditions. The AMS study supports the evolution of deformation under a constantly oriented stress field. By combining this multidisciplinary information we propose an evolutionary model for the tip of the extensional growth fault system that accounts for the progressively changing sediment rheological properties, and for the time dependent subsidiary deformation pattern by invoking the interplay between the regional stress field and the local, kinematically-derived one by fault activity. We also speculate on the overall implications for fluid flow of the proposed evolutionary model...|$|R

40|$|Kirkuk Group Formations (in {{addition}} to Avanah and Jaddala Formations) of southern Kurdistan were studied {{in order to}} determine biostratigraphy, chronostratigraphy and sequence stratigraphic relationships, in {{addition to}} major sediment producing environments and type of platform configuration. As well as to determine the paragenetic sequences with special attention to micrite diagenesis and its effect on microporosity. Five biozones were identified in the study area in which two of them from Middle- Late Eocene: Alveolina biozone (AL) and Discocyclina biozone (DI) with three biozones from the Oligocene-Early Miocene of Kirkuk Group: Nummulites fichteli biozone (NF); Praerhapydionina delicata biozone (PD) and Austrotrillina howchini biozone (AH). Twenty two microfacies were identified and interpreted as having been deposited in a ramp setting based on lateral variations of the microfacies; gradual deepening with no evidence of slope break or effective barrier. A depositional model has been generated from the overall palaeoenvironmental interpretations of the microfacies in which the analysed microfacies indicates palaeoenvironments ranging from terrestrial to open marine settings; nine major depositional environmental zones have been identified and correlated with the standard Cenozoic ramp model of Buxton and Pedley (1989). These zones distributed across the ramp setting dipping southwest, in which zone 1 is terrestrial deposit; zone 2, 3, 4 and 5 are belonging to inner ramp; zone 6, 7 and 8 are belong to middle <b>ramp</b> and <b>zone</b> 9 is belong to outer ramp and basinal settings. A paragenetic sequence has been derived recording eleven diagenetic processes affecting the Kirkuk Group which are subdivided into an eogenetic, mesogenetic and telogenetic stages. Furthermore, micrite matrices were studied from both shallow and deeper marine settings using SEM, trace elements and carbon/oxygen isotopes; the result shows the different sources; inner-mid ramp muds have a hemi-pelagic source and could have been mostly sourced from high-Mg calcite benthic foraminifera and red algae, and possible partial aragonite dominating; in contrast, the outer ramp matrices, were sourced from plankton, are largely composed of low-Mg calcite, as they are mineralogically stable. Although the exact origin would be difficult to ascertain after diagenesis. From the above two different rock fabrics, two distinct pore systems were identified: (1) low microporosity inner-mid ramp microfacies, it was sourced from metastable precursors and were recrystallized and replaced under meteoric waters, undergoing loss of primary porosity; (2) higher microporosity outer ramp/basinal microfacies, composed of more stable low-Mg calcite that underwent less recrystallization and retained some primary porosity. The Kirkuk Group succession comprises of two shallowing upward 4 th order cycle within one 3 rd order cycle located between two unconformable surfaces at lower and upper boundaries which can be correlated to the global regression of sea level. The first 4 th order cycle is located at Rupelian and composed of only the Sheikh Alas Formation and the second 4 th order cycle is located at Chattian-Early Aquitanian and composed of the Bajawan, Anah, Azkand and Ibrahim Formations.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from December 4, 2015 - December 4, 2016 Highway capacity has traditionally been treated as deterministic. In reality, however, capacity can vary {{from time to time}} and location to location due to inclement weather, various driving behavior, traffic incident, bottleneck and workzone. This thesis aims to characterize the stochastic variations of highway capacity, and explore its applications. The stochastic variation of highway capacity is captured through a space-time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) model. It is identified following a Seasonal STARIMA model (0, 0, 2 ₃) × (0, 1, 0) ₂, which indicates that the capacities of adjacent locations are spatially-temporally correlated. Hourly capacity patterns further verify the stochastic nature of highway capacity. The goal of this research is to study (1) how to take advantage of second order information, such as capacity variation, and (2) what benefits can be gained from stochastic capacity modeling. The implication of stochastic capacity is investigated through a ramp metering case study. A mean-standard deviation formulation of capacity is proposed to achieve the trade-off between traffic operation efficiency and robustness. Following that, a modified stochastic capacity-constraint <b>ZONE</b> <b>ramp</b> metering scheme embedded cell transmission model (CTM) algorithm is introduced. The numerical experiment suggests that considering second order information would alleviate the bottleneck effect and improve throughput. Monte Carlo simulation further supports this argument. This study helps verify and characterize the stochastic nature of capacity, validates the benefits of using second order information, and thus enhances the necessity of implementing stochastic capacity in traffic operation. In addition, this thesis presents a multiple days' highway capacity forecasting model and reveals the importance of incorporating capacity randomness separately in short term forecasting. Empirical observations of capacity with variations suggest that the existing deterministic notion of capacity (i. e., a fixed capacity value of 2400 veh/hr/ln) is inadequate to fully describe capacity fluctuations. The goal of this study is to provide insight on forecasting with inherent stochasticity. A hybrid highway capacity forecasting model based on wavelet dynamic neural time series is proposed. Based on 5 -day capacity forecasting results, a 3. 07...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{features the}} northern Tien-Shan mountain belt in Kyrgyzstan, including the Issyk-Kul basin, indicate a complex Cenozoic deformation, associated to the Indian-Eurasian collision. The collision caused deformation to propagate inside the continent, resulting in crustal thickening and mountain growth. The present-day shortening occurs {{at a rate}} of about 10 - 15 mm/yr and is oriented roughly N-S in the southern Tien-Shan and up to 2 - 6 mm/yr and variably oriented in the northern Tien-Shan. Different rate values and orientation could be related to the presence of a Precambrian microcontinent in the northern Tien-Shan. That microcontinent could affect the formation of the Neogene-Quaternary structure of the Issyk-Kul basin. In the Paleogene, more then 3 km of lacustrine sediments was deposited in the subsiding basin. The onset of uplift of the southern Tien-Shan started in the Neogene, when clastic and proluvial sediments, transported from the rising southern ranges were deposited in the basin. In this stage, the basin was much larger and more elongated than at present. It was probably controlled by ENE trending faults. Starting in the late Neogene, clastic material was deposited in a moderately subsiding basin. This indicates the onset of uplift in the Northern Tien-Shan, reaching a peak at the end of the Pliocene-early Pleistocene. In this period, strong N-S oriented contractions caused rigorous deformations inside the Issyk-Kul Cenozoic deposits. The southern and northern edges of the basin were intensely deformed. They are presently exposed and exhibit two major trends of tectonic lineaments, that correspond to transpressive zones, oriented ENE and NW. Pop-up and transpressive flower structures indicate oblique convergence in these <b>zones.</b> <b>Ramp</b> structures developed at the latitudinal edges of the basin and the thrusting of the basement over the basin is accompanied by late Neogene molasse deposition. E-W striking faults controlled the late Neogene structure of the basin. The deformed Neogene sediments are often unconformably overlain by undeformed Quaternary terraces. The Quaternary tectonics in the uplifted parts of the basin is expressed by reverse reactivation of preexisting faults. The border faults shifted toward the internal parts of the basin which was further narrowing in north-south direction, and the borders of the basin were further uplifted. Within the lake, active deformation has been recorded in its southern part, expressed by upright folding with NE trending axis. A major stage of convergence is consequently evidenced, dating from the end of the Neogene, mainly expressed by transpressive movements along a conjugate set of strikeslip zones. This stage of strong deformation is contrasting with the Quaternary tectonic stage of moderate basin inversion. We investigate the relations between the tectonic history of the Himalaya and of the Tibet plateau, and the deformation stages observed for the Issyk-Kul basin...|$|R
