50|$|Article 105a(1) EPC 2000 {{introduces}} a procedure for centrally limiting or <b>revoking</b> a European <b>patent.</b> A {{request for limitation}} or revocation may be filed at any time throughout the term of the European patent.|$|R

50|$|His {{opportunity}} arose when {{questions over}} {{the legitimacy of}} Brian and Aedh were raised as their mother Mary was twice divorced before her marriage to Tadhg. If these divorces were not recognised by English Law {{it was possible to}} <b>revoke</b> the <b>patent</b> of the O’Rourke children. Lord Deputy Arthur Chichester was anxious to pacify the wilderness of O’Rourke’s country which was a “den of outlaws and malefactors” where “no Englishmen dwell”.

50|$|As {{early as}} the year 1665, Thomas Mullinax, then a {{resident}} of the Town of Westchester, in utter disregard of the purchase that Thomas Pell had made from the Indians in 1654 covering all the later Manor of Pelham, applied to Governor Richard Nicolls for a patent for this neck, which was duly granted to him. Due to the remonstrances of Pell, the Governor subsequently <b>revoked</b> the <b>patent</b> because it was obtained by misinformation. Pell got his patent from Governor Nicolls in October, 1666.|$|R
25|$|A {{decision}} of the EPO to <b>revoke</b> a European <b>patent</b> is final (when the opportunity to appeal before the EPO is exhausted), which makes the opposition proceedings at the EPO especially attractive for opponents. In contrast, a {{decision of}} the EPO not to <b>revoke</b> a European <b>patent</b> (the decision instead maintaining the patent as granted or in an amended form) leaves the way open for revocation by the national court. The EPO decision does not create an estoppel precluding a subsequent challenge by an unsuccessful opponent {{at the national level}} (at least before the English courts). The validity of a European patent can be scrutinised both at the national level, before a national court, and at the international level, before the European Patent Office during opposition. The same is not true for infringement proceedings, upon which national courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|Sol Sheinbein {{was charged}} with {{obstruction}} of justice in the United States. He is wanted on an arrest warrant for hindering or obstructing a police investigation, but because his crime was a misdemeanor, he was not extraditable. In 2002, he was disbarred as a lawyer in Maryland by the Maryland Court of Appeals, and in 2004, he was disbarred as a lawyer in Washington, D.C., by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

5000|$|The {{effects of}} a {{corporation}} were similar to a monopoly. On the one hand, the ability to have sole access to markets meant that the business was encouraged (e.g., {{the ability to be}} an exclusive trader provided an incentive to the East India Company to accept financial risks in exploration) and the negative effects of competition were avoided (to take the same example, exclusive patents cut down on merchants sponsoring piracy). Innovation was stifled, however, and prices were unregulated. (In the case of patent corporations, the town or monarch was ostensibly able to regulate prices by <b>revoking</b> the <b>patent,</b> but this rarely occurred.) ...|$|R

The article asserts that the effect of the decision <b>revoking</b> the <b>patent</b> was correct, but that the reasoning points to a need to reconsider the "public interest" limits on patentability.

40|$|It is {{now officially}} {{impossible}} to {{claim to have}} invented something {{which has been in}} public use for centuries. On 10 May 2000, the European <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) <b>revoked</b> a <b>patent</b> which had been granted to the United States of America and multinational corporation W. R. Grace for a fungicide derived from seeds of the neem tree. Since time immemorial, neem has been a tree popular for its versatile leaves, for reforestation and for its seeds, which contain a natural pesticide and insecticide. A coalition of environmental NGOs (including IFOAM) and politicians lodged an official objection to the patent five years ago. The EPO accepted the objection with the argumentation that the invention lacked an inventive step and novelty. A wiser approach was taken by Moctar Sacandé of the Centre National de Semences Forestières in Burkina Faso. He discovered a method to keep dried neem seeds and shared this with the public. Neem seeds are notoriously difficult to store; once dried, the seeds no longer germinate upon soaking, in contrast to seeds such as wheat and maize. Sacandé discovered that when dried to a moisture content below 10 % the seeds keep {{for more than two years}} with a germination rate of 50 %. However, soaking can damage the seed membranes. Soaking the dry seeds in water at a temperature of 35 °C prevents this imbibitional damage.

The end result was a loss to Dargon, who went on to quickly issue an appeal. The court held up on the lower court decision <b>revoking</b> Dargon’s original <b>patent</b> and thus taking away the monopoly Dargon sought. Dargon sought to corner the market yet again, this time in a different manner, buying the Martinache for the price of $6,000, a substantial amount for the time.|$|R
50|$|On 21 December of {{the same}} year {{proceedings}} were commenced in the House of Commons to impeach the lord keeper Finch, Bramston, and five other of the judges who had subscribed the opinion on Ship money. Next day it was resolved that the message usual in such cases should be sent to the House of Lords. The message was communicated to the peers the same day, and the judges being present (except the lord keeper) were forthwith severally bound in recognisances of £10,000 to attend parliament from day to day until such time as trial might be had. The lord keeper was bound to the same effect the following day. Bramston was thus unable to attend the king when required without rendering himself liable to immediate committal, and as no progress was made towards his trial, the king terminated so anomalous a condition of affairs by <b>revoking</b> his <b>patent</b> (10 October 1642), sending him shortly afterwards (10 February 1642-3) a patent constituting him serjeant-at-law by way of assurance of his unbroken regard. Meanwhile, so far was the parliament from desiring to proceed to extremities with Bramston that in the terms of peace offered the king at Oxford (1 Feb 1642-3) his reappointment as lord chief justice of the king's bench, not as formerly during the king's pleasure, but during good behaviour (quamdiu se bene gesserit), was included.|$|R

40|$|India {{has pledged}} full {{compliance}} with the TRIPS Uruguay round by the year 2004. This article documents the actions taken so far, principally through the Patent Amendment Act of 1999. In particular, the "mailbox" facility and Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMR) in respect of pharmaceutical type products are described. EMR provides "temporary protection", until such patents are examined (from the beginning of 2005). The differences in the scope to oppose or <b>revoke</b> a granted <b>patent</b> compared to the very limited scope to take such action on an EMR are discussed. Other issues touched on are compulsory licensing, widening {{of the definition of}} working a patent in India, and infringement. In December 1999 several Bills related to Trade Marks, Designs, Copyright (amendment), Geographical indications (Protection & Registration), Protection of Plant Varieties & Farmers were passed in both the houses of Parliament. A Second Patents (amendment) Bill was introduced in December 1999 to comply with other requirements of TRIPS which is presently under review. The article concludes with a detailed review of recent patenting activity in India in the key technical areas of the Drugs, Pharmaceutical and Agrochemical Sector, the Electronics, Telecommunications and IT Sector, and the Foods Sector. ...|$|R
