25|$|Riders {{take a seat}} {{in one of the}} 15 {{carriages}} which hold 2 riders each (for a {{total of}} 30 riders). There is no seat belt or <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> on the ride, only a cage to hold on to during the ride as when the ride is in operation, gravity will keep the rider in place. Once the ride operators give the all clear, the ride begins to spin in a circle constantly picking up speed. It can take about 20 to 25 seconds for the ride to reach its top speed and lift off of the ground. After the ride lifts off the ground, the ride keeps rising eventually coming to an almost-vertical position. A few seconds later, the ride begins to descend back to the ground. The rides braking system is activated and the ride comes to a complete stop by the time it reaches the ground. One ride cycle is about 1 minute and 53 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Children in {{the three-year}} old age group {{are more likely}} to have a {{fatality}} because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained. The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions. A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child <b>Restraint</b> <b>System</b> instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.|$|E

Development commenced with the largest virtual crash modelling program Holden has ever undertaken. Emphasis was placed on considering the range of impact scenarios that occur in real world accident situations and differing occupant criteria. Safety technologies were benchmarked along with the world’s leading luxury brands and major engineering programs delivered a stiffer body structure and vastly increased usage of advanced strength steels. Multiple load corridor strategies for frontal, side and rear impacts improve passenger compartment integrity. They are complemented by an improved multi-point airbag sensing system and an adaptive <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> which includes dual stage front airbags, thorax side impact airbags, curtain airbags and front seat active head restraints as standard equipment.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel control strategy for real-time controlled <b>restraint</b> <b>systems.</b> Today’s <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> typically include {{a number of}} airbags, and a three-point seat belt with load limiter and pretensioner. In the class of realtime controlled <b>restraint</b> <b>systems,</b> the <b>restraint</b> actuator settings are continuously manipulated during the crash. The control strategy developed here is based on reference management, in which a nonlinear device- a reference governor- is added to a primal closed loop controlled system. This governor determines an optimal setpoint in terms of injury reduction and constraint satisfaction by solving a constrained optimization problem. Prediction of the vehicle motion, required to predict future constraint violation, {{is included in the}} design and is based on linear regression of past crash data. Simulation results with a MADYMO model show that a significant injury reduction is possible, without prior knowledge of the crash. Furthermore, it is shown that the algorithms are sufficiently fast to be implemented on-line. I...|$|R
