40|$|Abstract Background Modern {{cochlear}} implants have integrated <b>recording</b> <b>systems</b> {{for measuring}} electrically evoked compound action potentials of the auditory nerve. The characterization of such <b>recording</b> <b>systems</b> {{is important for}} establishing a reliable basis for the interpretation of signals acquired in vivo. In this study we investigated {{the characteristics of the}} <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> integrated into the MED-EL PULSARCI 100 cochlear implant, especially its linearity and resolution, in order to develop a mathematical model describing the <b>recording</b> <b>system.</b> Methods In-vitro setup: The cochlear implant, including all attached electrodes, was fixed in a tank of physiologic saline solution. Sinusoidal signals of the same frequency but with different amplitudes were delivered via a signal generator for measuring and recording on a single electrode. Computer simulations: A basic mathematical model including the main elements of the <b>recording</b> <b>system,</b> i. e. amplification and digitalization stage, was developed. For this, digital output for sinusoidal input signals of different amplitudes were calculated using in-vitro recordings as reference. Results Using an averaging of 100 measurements the <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> behaved linearly down to approximately - 60 dB of the input signal range. Using the same method, a system resolution of 10 μV was determined for sinusoidal signals. The simulation results were in very good agreement with the results obtained from in-vitro experiments. Conclusions The <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> implemented in the MED-EL PULSARCI 100 cochlear implant for measuring the evoked compound action potential of the auditory nerve operates reliably. The developed mathematical model provides a good approximation of the <b>recording</b> <b>system.</b> </p...|$|R

2500|$|Prescriptions may {{be entered}} into an {{electronic}} medical <b>record</b> <b>system</b> and transmitted electronically to a pharmacy. Alternatively, a prescription may be handwritten on preprinted prescription forms {{that have been}} assembled into pads, or printed onto similar forms using a computer printer or even on plain paper according to the circumstance. In some cases, a prescription may be transmitted from the physician to the pharmacist orally by telephone; this practice may {{increase the risk of}} medical error. The content of a prescription includes the name and address of the prescribing provider and any other legal requirement such as a registration number (e.g. DEA Number in the United States). [...] Unique for each prescription {{is the name of the}} patient. [...] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the patient's name and address must also be recorded. Each prescription is dated and some jurisdictions may place a time limit on the prescription. In the past, prescriptions contained instructions for the pharmacist to use for compounding the pharmaceutical product but most prescriptions now specify pharmaceutical products that were manufactured and require little or no preparation by the pharmacist. Prescriptions also contain directions for the patient to follow when taking the drug. These directions are printed on the label of the pharmaceutical product.|$|E

2500|$|The University of Manchester {{built the}} world's first {{programmable}} computer, the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, on 21 June 1948; the Williams–Kilburn tube {{on the machine}} was the world's first computer memory, {{and the beginning of}} random-access memory (RAM); the baby computer was made from 550 Mullard valves. [...] The first commercially available computer, the Ferranti Mark 1, was made in Manchester and sold in February 1951 to the University of Manchester. The world's first transitorised computer was the Manchester Transistor Computer in November 1953. Atlas was another important computer developed at the University of Manchester, largely developed by Tom Kilburn; at the time in 1962 it was most powerful computer in the world. The government had dropped its financial support of this computer, and was only funded by Ferranti—the total development cost was around £1m. Britain was leading the world at this time in computing, with the only main competitor being IBM; after the mid-1950s America took over the industry. The spreadsheet was invented in 1974, known as the Works <b>Record</b> <b>System,</b> and used an ADABAS database on a IBM 3270 at ICI in Northwich; it was developed by Dr Robert Mais and it was around four years before (the more well-known) VisiCalc in 1978.
