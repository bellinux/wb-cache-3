To begin, Bakker imagines an explanatory vehicle he refers to as a <b>Recursive</b> <b>System,</b> the brain architecture which has evolved to track even more the basic architecture of itself, possibly akin to the relationship between the frontal cortex {{to the rest of the}} brain. Bakker suggests two parts to a <b>Recursive</b> <b>System,</b> the system [...] "open," [...] all the information processed by the brain, and the system [...] "closed," [...] referring to the information accessible to consciousness. The basic assumption regarding the existence of a <b>Recursive</b> <b>System</b> implies a limit on the information available to the RS-closed, conscious awareness, which Bakker dubs Informatic Asymmetry and its the Asymptotic Limit. As specific examples Bakker refers to the cognitive psychology literature citing change blindness and inattentional bias (cognitive bias), wherein there are clear divergences between the information processed by the brain and information from the self-reports of perception.|$|E
