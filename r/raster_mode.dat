5000|$|Jaggies occur {{due to the}} [...] "staircase effect". This {{is because}} a line {{represented}} in <b>raster</b> <b>mode</b> is approximated by a sequence of pixels. Jaggies can occur {{for a variety of}} reasons, the most common being that the output device (display monitor or printer) does not have enough resolution to portray a smooth line. In addition, jaggies often occur when a bit-mapped image is converted to a different resolution. This is one of the advantages that vector graphics has over bit-mapped graphics - the output looks the same regardless of the resolution of the output device.|$|E
5000|$|Raster {{engraving}} {{traces the}} laser {{across the surface}} in a back-and-forth slowly advancing linear pattern that will remind one of the printhead on an inkjet or similar printer. The pattern is usually optimized by the controller/computer so that areas {{to either side of}} the pattern which aren't to be engraved are ignored and the trace across the material is thus shortened for better efficiency. The amount of advance of each line is normally less than the actual dot-size of the laser; the engraved lines overlap just slightly to create a continuity of engravure. As is true of all rasterized devices, curves and diagonals can sometimes suffer if the length or position of the raster lines varies even slightly in relation to the adjacent raster scan; therefore exact positioning and repeatability are critically important to the design of the machine. The advantage of rasterizing is the near effortless [...] "fill" [...] it produces. Most images to be engraved are bold letters or have large continuously engraved areas, and these are well-rasterized. Photos are rasterized (as in printing), with dots larger than that of the laser's spot, and these also are best engraved as a raster image. Almost any page-layout software can be used to feed a raster driver for an X-Y or drum laser engraver. While traditional sign and plaque engraving tended to favor the solid strokes of vectors out of necessity, modern shops tend to run their laser engravers mostly in <b>raster</b> <b>mode,</b> reserving vector for a traditional outline [...] "look" [...] or for speedily marking out lines or [...] "hatches" [...] where a plate is to be cut.|$|E

Nanostructures with 3 D features were successfully fabricated on PMMA film with the feature height manipulated through controlling the absolute heights of z-scanner in AFM. Two methods {{were used to}} move the AFM tip to create desire features, vector <b>mode</b> and <b>raster</b> scan <b>mode.</b> Relatively simple features, such as stair-like nanostructure with five steps was successfully fabricated in vector mode. Complex nanostructure with discrete height levels and continuous changes were successfully fabricated in <b>raster</b> scan <b>mode.</b> By carefully selecting the machining parameters, the feature dimension and height can be precisely controlled with only small variation from the designed value. Moreover, this paper explores the capability of transferring 3 D nanostructures from PMMA film onto silicon substrate. After calibrating the recipe of Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) process, 3 D nanostructures are successfully transferred to silicon wafer with controllable selectivity between PMMA and silicon. The results of fabricating 3 D structures on silicon substrates show promising potential of many applications, such as mold preparation in nanoimprint lithography...|$|R

Lateral resolution of the isotope image was achieved to be 0. 4 μm for static ion beam mode and to be 0. 6 μm for <b>rastered</b> ion beam <b>mode.</b> As a result, the abundances of presolar grains are 150 to 200 % larger under the static ion beam mode than under the <b>rastered</b> ion beam <b>mode.</b> Development of image processing introducing isotopography of 32 S-, 24 Mg 16 O- and 56 Fe- succeeded to increase efficiency of presolar grain characterization.

Acquisitions were performed in <b>rastering</b> <b>mode,</b> at a speed of 1 mm/s and in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode on a MALDI triple quadrupole linear ion trap fitted with a high repetition rate laser (1 kHz). Compared to traditional methods based on LC-MS/MS or GC-MS(/MS) which require to segment the hair to obtain spatial resolution, MALDI-MSI, with a straightforward sample preparation beforehand, allowed obtaining a spatial resolution of 1 mm and thus the chronological information about cocaine consumption contained in a single intact hair over several months could be monitored. The analysis time of an intact single hair sample of 6 cm is approximately of 6 min. Cocaine and its metabolites benzoylecgonine, ethylcocaine, and norcocaine were investigated in nine sets of hair samples for forensic purposes. The analyses were accomplished by spraying α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), 4 -chloro-α-cyano-cinnamic acid (Cl-CCA), or (E) - 2 -cyano- 3 -(naphthalen- 2 -yl) acrylic acid (NpCCA) as MALDI matrices.

Three temperature-based snow models are integrated into the NewAge-JGrass modeling system and use many of its components such as those for radiation balance (short wave radiation balance, SWRB), kriging (KRIGING), automatic calibration algorithms (particle swarm optimization) and tests of goodness of fit (NewAge-V), to build suitable modeling solutions (MS). Similarly to all the NewAge-JGrass components, the models can be executed both in raster and in vector mode. The simulation time step can be daily, hourly or sub-hourly, depending on user needs and availability of input data. The MS are applied on the Cache la Poudre River basin (CO, USA) using three test applications.

40|$|In {{the region}} of Charleroi (Belgium), a series of {{criminal}} acts were committed by the same group, using the same vehicle. The events were located in space and time. The car used during these criminal activities was stolen (first event) and was later retrieved (last event) {{after a period of}} 4 days of offences. Police recorded a crucial clue: the total mileage covered by the vehicle between the first and the last event was estimated with an admissible approximation. Thanks to this information, we were able to choose the most probable journey-to-crime among several scenarios. These depended on the combination of cost surfaces built with distance propagation algorithms starting from each criminal event in <b>raster</b> <b>mode.</b> The distance propagations were limited to the road network and the combinations of the cost surfaces had to respect the chronology of the facts. The most plausible scenario suggested that the criminals hided the car into a withdrawal site between their activities. In order to improve the precision of the location of this withdrawal site, we used a multi-criteria analysis taking account of the journey of the vehicle and other environment variables.

40|$|Grain size {{separate}} CG {{from the}} Murray CM 2 carbonaceous chondrite contains mostly spinel grains of average diameter 0. 5 m. Zinner et al. found that approximately 1 % of these spinel grains are of presolar origin {{as determined by}} their large O isotopic anomalies. These O isotopic measurements were made with the NanoSIMS on individual grains that were well separated from one another on a gold foil. The grains were selected for analysis from secondary electron and secondary O- 16 (-) images. The primary beam was then successively deflected onto these single grains for O isotopic analysis. While single grain analysis on dispersed samples is effective for finding relatively abundant anomalous grains, ion imaging in a <b>raster</b> <b>mode</b> on tightly packed grains might be more efficient for locating few anomalous grains among predominantly isotopically normal grains. In fact, this was the analysis mode used by Messenger et al. to discover presolar silicates in interplanetary dust particles.

40|$|Abstract-The {{compositions}} ofindividual {{synthetic fluid}} inclusions in the systems NaCl-KCl, NaCl-CaCl * and NaCl-KCl-CaCl * have been semi-quantitatively determined by energy dispersive analysis of precipitates produced uring thermal decrepitation. I clusions containing known mixtures of 20 wt. % total salinity were synthesized by healing fractures in natural quartz at 600 - 700 °C and 5 - 7 kbars for 7 - 10 days. The two-phase, daughter-free inclusions ho-mogenized at 170 - 25 O”C, began to decrepitate after about 100 ” of overheating and by 360 - 420 °C asignificant number of decrepitates had formed on the polished surface. Peak heights generated byEDA (<b>raster</b> <b>mode)</b> of these deempitates were standardized using both single and mixed salt standards evaporated to dryness in a vacuum. Although the mixed salt standards better approximated the decrepitate compositions, difficulties were encountered in producing micron-scale homogeneity {{and the single}} salts yielded more reliable results. Eight different solutions of 20 - 23 wt. % total salinity were run and in all the samples the average compositions of lo- 20 discrete, single inclusion decrepitates fell with 6 wt. % (0. 2 to 5. 2) of the actual composition, suggesting that the decrepitates were chemically representative of their precursor inclusions. However, not all decrepitates analyzed provided similarly accurate results. Electron mapping revealed that fracture-aligned decrepitates were often chemically inhomo-geneous and thus had to be avoided. A sample decrepitated at 500 °C yielded spurious results suggesting that chloride volatility may become a significant problem when temperatures in excess of 450 °C are required for decrepitation. Decrepitates with diameters between 10 and 30 grn yielded more consistent and accurate results than smaller or larger decrepitates on the same samples...|$|E

The first component, NewAGE-SwRB, accounts for elevation slope, aspect, shadow of the sites, and uses suitable parameterization for obtaining the cloudless irradiance. A second component, NewAGE-DEC-MOD's is implemented to estimate the irradiance reduction due {{to the presence of}} clouds according to three parameterizations. To obtain a working modeling composition that is comparable with ground data at measurement stations the two components are connected to a kriging component. With the help of an additional component, NewAGE-V (verification package), the performance of modeled (R sw ↓) is quantitatively evaluated. The two components (and the various parameterizations they contain) are tested using the data from three basins, and some simple verification tests were carried out to assess the goodness of the methods used.

40|$|Rationale: Laser Ablation {{coupled to}} Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-MC-ICPMS) is a {{powerful}} tool for the high-precision measurement of the isotopic ratios of many elements in geological samples, with the isotope ratio (11 B/ 10 B) of boron being used as an indicator of the pH of oceanic waters. Most geological samples or standards are polished and ablation occurs on flat surfaces. However, the shape and the irregularities of marine biocarbonates (e. g., corals, foraminifera) can make precise isotopic measurements of boron difficult. Even after polishing, the porosity properties and the presence of holes or micro-fractures affect the signal and the isotopic ratio when ablating the material, especially in <b>raster</b> <b>mode.</b> Methods: The effect of porosity and of the crater itself on the 11 B signal and the isotopic ratio acquired by LA-MC-ICPMS in both raster and spot mode was studied. Characterization of the craters was then performed with an optical profilometer to determine their shapes and depths. Surface state effects were examined by analyzing the isotopic fractionation of boron in silicate (NIST-SRM 612 and 610 standards) and in carbonate (corals). Results: Surface irregularities led to a considerable loss of signal when the crater depth exceeded 20 µm. The stability and precision were degraded when ablation occurred in a deep cavity. The effect of laser focusing and of blank correction was also highlighted and our observations indicate that the accuracy of the boron isotopic ratio does not depend on the shape of the surface. After validation of the analytical protocol for boron isotopes, a raster application on a Porites coral, which grew for 18 months in an aquarium after field sampling, was carried out. Conclusions: This original LA-MC-ICPMS study revealed a well-marked boron isotope ratio temporal variability, probably related to growth rate and density changes, irrespective of the pH of the surrounding seawater...|$|E

40|$|An {{infrared}} thermographic {{experimental set-up}} {{has been proposed}} and evaluated towards the capability to measure thermoelastic-effect-induced temperature changes. A standard infrared thermocamera with a nominal noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD) resolution of 0. 12 K has been employed to measure the temperature from unidirectional glass-reinforced plastic tensile coupons under cyclic sinusoidal loads. The <b>raster</b> scanning <b>mode</b> of the camera single detector produces a time delay in acquiring the signal from two succeeding pixels on the same row, and from consecutive scanned rows. By exploiting the acquired dwell times, {{it was possible to}} produce a periodic pattern on the thermal maps, caused by and correlated with the thermoelastic-effect-induced temperature changes. The acquired raw data have then been post-processed with a lock-in algorithm implemented in MATLAB® and based on a two-dimensional fast Fourier transform analysis. The filtered thermoelastic component from the lock-in analysis showed good linearity with the load applied, up to values of the temperature change one order of magnitude lower than the NETD resolution limits of the thermocamera. In the light of this the present experimental setup and processing methodology can be proposed as a potential low-cost tool for thermoelastic stress analysis investigations...|$|R
40|$|Compressed Sensing based Terahertz imaging (CS-THz) is a {{computational}} imaging technique. It uses only one THz receiver to accumulate the random modulated image measurements where the original THz image is reconstruct from these measurements using compressed sensing solvers. The {{advantage of the}} CS-THz is its reduced acquisition time compared with the <b>raster</b> scan <b>mode.</b> However, when it applied to large-scale two-dimensional (2 D) imaging, the increased dimension resulted in both high computational complexity and excessive memory usage.

Therefore, the CS-THz system could be simplified with a much smaller sized modulator and reduced dimension. In order to utilize the block structure and the correlation of adjacent columns of the THz image, a complex-valued block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm was proposed. We conducted systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art CS algorithms under the scan based CS-THz architecture. The compression ratios and the choices of the sensing matrices were analyzed in detail using both synthetic and real-life THz images.
