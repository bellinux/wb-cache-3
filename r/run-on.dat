40|$|SummaryWhereas {{chromosomal}} translocations {{are common}} pathogenetic events in cancer, mechanisms that promote them are poorly understood. To elucidate translocation mechanisms in mammalian cells, we developed high-throughput, genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS). We employed HTGTS to identify {{tens of thousands}} of independent translocation junctions involving fixed I-SceI meganuclease-generated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the c-myc oncogene or IgH locus of B lymphocytes induced for activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) -dependent IgH class switching. DSBs translocated widely across the genome but were preferentially targeted to transcribed chromosomal regions. Additionally, numerous AID-dependent and AID-independent hot spots were targeted, with the latter comprising mainly cryptic I-SceI targets. Comparison of translocation junctions with genome-wide nuclear <b>run-ons</b> revealed a marked association between transcription start sites and translocation targeting. The majority of translocation junctions were formed via end-joining with short microhomologies. Our findings have implications for diverse fields, including gene therapy and cancer genomics...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the ability of the}} wt 1 tumor {{suppressor}} gene product to repress different classes of activation domains previously shown to stimulate the initiation and elongation steps of RNA polymerase II transcription in vivo. Repression assays revealed that WT 1 represses all three classes of activation domains: Sp 1 and CTF, which stimulate initiation (type I), human immunodeficiency virus type I Tat fused to a DNA-binding domain, which stimulates predominantly elongation (type IIA), and VP 16, p 53 and E 2 F 1, which stimulate both initiation and elongation (type IIB). WT 1 is capable of exerting its repression effect over a significant distance when positioned approximately 1700 bp from the core promoter. Deletion analysis of WT 1 indicates that the responsible domain resides within the first 180 N-terminal amino acids of the protein. Nuclear <b>run-ons</b> analyzing the effects of WT 1 on initiation of transcription demonstrate inhibition of this process. Our observations imply that WT 1 can repress activators that stimulate initiation and/or elongation...|$|R
25|$|Reichart {{utilizes}} {{techniques in}} her novel {{that are similar}} to other Austrian authors from both the early 20th century and the early 1980s. Similar to Franz Kafka, Reichart employs alternating <b>run-on</b> and fragmented sentences to display the emotions of her character, and also creates a poignant plot by using ambiguous words which could potentially possess multiple meanings in the text. Like Ödön von Horváth, Reichart has the ability to uproot and publicly display difficult events through dramatized means. In the novels authored by Peter Handke, the use of extreme psychological activity drives the plot, which is also congruent with Reichart's novel. Her use of key themes and phrases which represent innate emotional processes can also be seen in the writings of one of her famous contemporaries, Thomas Bernhard.|$|E

500|$|After Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, {{particularly}} in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as [...] "more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical". In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included <b>run-on</b> lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length. In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: [...] "was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?" [...] (1.7.35–38); [...] "...pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air..." [...] (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense. The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.|$|E

Inhibition of cellular transcription with actinomycin D added at 2 hours after LPS resulted in the substantial decrease of both IL- 8 and TNF-alpha mRNAs, demonstrating half-lives of 4. 6 and 2. 3 hours, respectively. In contrast, inhibition of transcription at 23 hours after LPS revealed extremely stable IL- 8 mRNA with a half-life of > 10 hours. The half-life of beta-actin in the same actinomycin-D-treated samples did not vary significantly from the half-life calculated at the 2 -hour time point (5. 5 hours versus 5. 6 hours), indicating that the observed IL- 8 mRNA stability was not an artifact of the system. Both IL- 8 and TNF-alpha protein levels decreased when actinomycin D was added 2 hours after LPS stimulation. However, no effect in IL- 8 protein levels was evident when actinomycin D was added at 23 hours after LPS.

40|$|Quinones {{represent}} an important class of endogenous compounds such as neurotransmitters and coenzyme Q 10, electrophilic xenobiotics, and environmental toxicants that have known reactivity {{based on their}} ability to redox cycle and generate oxidative stress, as well as to alkylate target proteins. It is likely that topological, chemical, and physical features combine to determine which proteins become targets for chemical adduction. Chemical-induced post-translational modification of certain critical proteins causes a change in structure/function that contributes to the toxicological response to chemical exposure. In this study, we have identified a number of proteins that are modified by quinone-thioethers after administration of 2 -(glutathion-S-yl) HQ. Parallel one-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed, and the Coomassie-stained gel was aligned with the corresponding Western blot, which was probed for adductions. Immunopositive bands were then subjected to trypsin digestion and analyzed via liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The proteins that were subsequently identified contained a higher than average (9. 7 versus 5. 5 %) lysine content and numerous stretches of lysine <b>run-ons,</b> which is a presumed electrophile binding motif. Approximately 50 % of these proteins have also been identified as targets for electrophilic adduction by a diverse group of chemicals by other investigators, implying overlapping electrophile adductomes. By identifying a motif targeted by electrophiles it becomes possible to make predictions of proteins that may be targeted for adduction and possible sites on these proteins that are adducted. An understanding of proteins targeted for adduction is essential to unraveling the toxicity produced by these electrophiles...|$|R
40|$|Phosphate {{is central}} to bone {{metabolism}} and we have therefore studied whether parathyroid hormone (PTH) is regulated by dietary phosphate in vivo.

The low phosphate diet led to hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and increased serum 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 together with decreased PTH mRNA levels (25 +/- 8 % of controls, P < 0. 01) and serum immunoreactive PTH (4. 7 +/- 0. 8 : 22. 1 +/- 3. 7 pg/ml; low phosphate: control, P < 0. 05). A high phosphate diet led to increased PTH mRNA levels. In situ hybridization showed that hypophosphatemia decreased PTH mRNA in all the parathyroid cells. To separate the effect of low phosphate from changes in calcium and vitamin D rats were fed diets to maintain them as vitamin D-deficient and normocalcemic despite the hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemic, normocalemic rats with normal serum 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 levels still had decreased PTH mRNAs. Nuclear transcript <b>run-ons</b> showed {{that the effect of}} low phosphate was posttranscriptional.

The research aims at finding out the developments in the inclusion of structural features in these dictionaries. The study examines and analyzes four types of dictionaries of Urdu based on four different check lists. The approach of documentary analysis is employed to carry out this descriptive type of research. To draw a checklist about the information in a dictionary, the studies of Bergenholtz & Tarp (1995), Hausmann and Wiegand (1989),Hartmann (1983, 2001), Bowker (2003), Jackson (2002), Landau (2001), Bejoint (2000) and Ahmad (2009) were taken into consideration. Different features of megastructure including contents, preface/introduction, userâ€™s guide, list of abbreviations, pronunciation symbols, encyclopedic note, list of headwords (macrostructure), index, appendices, information label; and the features of microstructure including head word, spellings, pronunciation, inflections, word class, senses, definition/s, example/s, usage, cross reference, illustrations, <b>run-ons,</b> and etymology are used for analysisThe analysis reveals that general purpose, pedagogical and LSP dictionaries demonstrate no or least developments. They use limited outside matter, as they are deficient in providing the userâ€™s guide, encyclopedic information and notes on language. In the back matter of pedagogical dictionaries, the list of defining vocabulary is not included. The information provided in microstructure of these dictionaries is also very limited. The technique of defining the headwords has not developed properly.

40|$|Should {{we teach}} grammar, orshouldn’t we? ” Often pre-sented with this {{apparent}} all-or-nothing choice, even the teachers {{asking the question}} may not have clear instructional goals for teaching grammar; they may simply think they should teach it. Sometimes they have other reasons, though, for thinking they ought to teach grammar: they find parents, the public, and even the politicians clamoring for grammar instruction {{in the hope that}} teaching traditional grammar from hand-books or CDs will somehow improve students writing, or at least their ability to avoid “errors. ” Most often it doesn’t. Yes, some students learn the conventions of gram-mar, usage, and punctuation from a handbook. Or at least they appear to have learned these conven-tions when doing and drill exercises on one con-cept at a time, followed by related tests. But do students remember and apply these conventions in their own writing? Here, the payoff severely declines. The problems with this common view of “why teach grammar ” lie deeper than most people real-ize. First, we must contend with an underlying, implicit, and largely erroneous learning theory: if teachers teach something well, students will learn it and, what’s more, will apply it well. What we now know from cognitive psychology is that stu-dents need guidance in developing concepts, such as the concepts of “sentence ” and “not sentence. ” In addition, no matter how motivated the students may be to apply such concepts—for example, to avoid or eliminate <b>run-ons</b> and fragments in their writing—they still often need help applying these concepts in practical situations. Such help may be needed even by the students who enjoy and take pride in their schoolwork and who love analyzing data. Much of what we teach in the name of gram-mar amounts to labeling parts of speech and their functions or identifying kinds of sentences, yet stu-dents need very little of this to learn the conven-tions of written edited English. For most students, teaching grammar as sentence analysis is another reason why the grammar doesn’t transfer to stu-dent writing. It is convenient for {{us to be able to}} refer t...|$|R
