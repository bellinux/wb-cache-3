Environment assessment is one very important issues related to protection <b>of</b> environment from <b>radionuclide’s.</b> The amount to be released which may have typical concentrations <b>of</b> <b>radionuclide’s</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>origin,</b> or artificial origin may generate products or wastes that have higher concentrations <b>of</b> <b>radionuclide’s</b> or give rise to exposures that should not be excluded from regulatory control. Uranium (U) and thorium (Th) and their decay chain daughter radionuclide are the <b>radionuclide</b> <b>of</b> primary interest released from nuclear installations as well as several other radionuclide’s as Cs for different radioisotopes. For an appropriate assessment of dose to public and workers (occupational staff) it is necessary that following elements shall be taken into account for release of the bulk amount of contaminated water into the sea. These element will help the process of calculation the effective dose to populations.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of an environmental radioactivity monitoring program, a research activity concerning an optimization of techniques for sampling and measurement of environmental radioactivity was performed at the Nuclear Engineering Department (DIN) of Palermo University. Al-though initially aimed {{to the analysis of}} monitoring data of the local network installed at the nuclear research reactor AGN- 201 "COSTANZA" of Palermo University, in the following years the studies were oriented to improve the sampling facilities and measurement systems with the aim to achieve also detection limits as low as possible. The activity has allowed to collect numerous data of nuclide activity concentration for different environmental matrices, with respect to <b>radionuclides</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>origin,</b> e. g. 7 Be and 210 Pb in air particulates or 238 U and 232 Th chain products in soil or sea sediments, and <b>radionuclides</b> <b>of</b> artificial origin, such as 137 Cs and fission products re-leased into the air during the nuclear tests in atmosphere {{and in the course of}} events following the Chernobyl acci-dent. Some measurement results from DIN and other cen-tres and laboratories operating in the Mediterranean area are presented as an outline of activities that may be of reference for monitoring environmental radioactivity in other research or institutional organizations...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{minerals}} {{may contain}} <b>radionuclides</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> Uranium- 238 (238 U) and Thorium- 232 (232 Th) decay series. Similarly, coal {{like any other}} minerals found in nature contains trace amount of such naturally occurring radionuclides including Potassium- 40 (40 K). The generation of electricity by coal fired power plant (CFPP) releases particulates emission to the atmosphere and deposited on the surrounding area that may increase the natural background radiation level within the facility. This paper presents an evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>natural</b> radioactivity concentration found in the particulates emission from a typical CFPP in Malaysia. Standard Gaussian dispersion model approach was used to predict the potential radiological hazards arising from the particulates released from the stack. The predicted maximum ground level particulate (Cmax) concentration and downwind distance (X) was 52 µg m– 3 and 1, 600 m of away from the CFPP, respectively. The air dispersion modelling results recorded that the calculated Cmax released from the CFPP was found lower than the national and international ambient air quality limits, which means that radiological hazards due to inhalation <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in particulate released to the environment is insignificant. The findings revealed that, this activity does not impose any significant radiological risk to the human population at large and the operation is {{in compliance with the}} national legislation and international practice...|$|R
40|$|Materials {{containing}} <b>radionuclides</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>origin</b> {{and being}} subject to regulation {{because of their}} radioactivity are known as Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM). By following International Atomic Energy Agency, we include in NORM those materials with an activity concentration, which is modiﬁed by human made processes. We present {{a brief review of}} the main categories of non-nuclear industries together with the levels of activity concentration in feed raw materials, products and waste, including mechanisms of radioisotope enrichments. The global management of NORM shows a high level of complexity, mainly due to different degrees of radioactivity enhancement and the huge amount of worldwide waste production. The future tendency of guidelines concerning environmental protection will require both a systematic monitoring based on the ever-increasing sampling and high performance of gamma-ray spectroscopy. On the ground of these requirements a new low-background fully automated high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer MCA_Rad has been developed. The design of lead and cooper shielding allowed to reach a background reduction of two order of magnitude with respect to laboratory radioactivity. A severe lowering of manpower cost is obtained through a fully automation system, which enables up to 24 samples to be measured without any human attendance. Two coupled HPGe detectors increase the detection efﬁciency, performing accurate measurements on small sample volume (180 cm 3) with a reduction of sample transport cost of material. Details of the instrument calibration method are presented. MCA_Rad system can measure in less than one hour a typical NORM sample enriched in U and Th with some hundreds of Bq kg, with an overall uncertainty less than 5...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{understand}} {{the past is}} instrumental for predicting the future. Therefore, dating of objects – be they from human activities or from nature – is of prime interest in science. Radionuclides are themost useful tool to tackle this problem. Their half-lives {{may be used as}} a clock to measure elapsed time. However, a number of conditions have to be met for proper application of such datingmethods. Our environment is rich in <b>radionuclides,</b> mostly <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>origin</b> but partly also from anthropogenic sources such as nuclear weapons testing or from nuclear accidents. This chapter summarizes applications <b>of</b> such <b>radionuclides</b> for dating purpose. Special emphasis is given to radiocarbon, 14 C. Formany applications this radioisotope of carbon is the most important dating radionuclide that enables to cover time horizons from the present until about 60 000 years ago. The use of parent/daughter systems is described as well. Two other short sections address dating via stored signals in the samples from radioactive transformation. These are fission track and thermoluminescence dating...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{historical}} {{review is}} given {{on the development}} and milestones of the moss biomonitoring technique used to study atmospheric deposition of trace elements, nitrogen, organic persistent pollutants (POPs) and <b>radionuclides</b> <b>of</b> technogenic and <b>natural</b> <b>origin</b> in Europe. The relevance of these studies to the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) is discussed. Examples of the long-term activity of the ICP Vegetation (International Cooperative Programme on Effects of Air Pollution on Natural Vegetation and Crops) established in 1987 are given to illustrate the tendencies in behavior {{on a large scale}} of air pollutants such as heavy metals, nitrogen and persistent organic pollutants. In agreement with the long-term strategy of the LRTAP Convention to enhance participation and improve air quality in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and South Eastern Europe, efforts to extend the moss survey to former republics of the USSR such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan were successfully undertaken. Around 15 teams were formed in Russia to cover moss sampling in Northern and Central Russia, Western Siberia, and the Far East of Russia (Kamchatka and Sakhalin). To date, 36 countries expressed their desire to participate in the 2015 - 2016 moss survey. Analytical methods and approaches to data interpretation are reviewed...|$|R
