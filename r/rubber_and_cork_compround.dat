50|$|Capitol's {{recording}} studios {{were designed}} by guitarist and sound expert Les Paul to minimize noise and vibration, then newly important goals in the high-fidelity sound era. An inner wall floating on layers of <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>cork</b> was erected inside the building's 10 in concrete exterior walls, leaving a one-inch air gap to provide complete sound isolation. The facility also features subterranean echo chambers that allow engineers to add reverberation during the recording process. Eight trapezoidal chambers are located 30 ft underground, with 10-inch concrete walls and 12 in concrete ceilings. Speakers {{on one side and}} microphones on the other permit an echo effect of up to five seconds. Studios A and B can be combined for the recording of orchestral music and symphonic film soundtracks. The first album recorded in the tower was Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color.|$|R

40|$|By {{intensive}} stratification of our society, {{designers and}} contractors {{are faced with}} a variety of requirements and problems which they have never had encountered in their practice before. The complexity of the problem, but primarily inexperience, results with omissions and errors in designing and construction works. When those errors occur in residential buildings, not only that they reduce building's service life, but also, to a considerable extent, reduce living comfort and quality of life of its residents. This paper presents a solution to the problem, due to failure during installation of mechanical equipment in residential-office building, in Sremska Street in Novi Sad. The failure occurred on the pool water pump located {{on the top of the}} building. The pool is an integral part of an apartment. The omission is reflected in rigid connection between the pump and the reinforced-concrete slab of the floor structure, but also in rigid pipes passage through reinforced-concrete elements, which led to the noise level that was significantly above the allowed values at a given building. The problem was repaired by implementing appropriate elastic connection between the water pump and the concrete bedding, which is achieved by using shims, that are a mixture of neoprene <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>cork.</b> The mechanical room is sound insulated by mounting panels of expanded <b>cork</b> <b>and</b> profiled sponge on the walls and doors of the room. Implementing these procedures reduced noise caused by the work of water pump and related equipment to the acceptable level...|$|R

But the Ritz-Carlton soon became a haunt for the well-off, the hotel exuding wealth and status. Many features were state-of-the-art or unique among hotels at the time. They included fresh- and salt-water faucets for both hot and cold water in each room, an on-site artesian well for spring water, pantries on each landing to speed room service, and elevators with walls of <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> floors of <b>cork</b> so that bathers' could bypass the lobby.|$|R

Top players may carry up to twenty different squidgers, but will not typically use {{all of them in}} one game. The rules governing squidgers are liberal; a range of dimensions are permitted, and the material is not specified, except for the condition that squidgers must not damage winks or the mat. Typically squidgers are made from different types of plastic, though glass, <b>rubber,</b> <b>cork</b> <b>and</b> onyx are occasionally seen. The squidgers are usually filed or sanded to give a sharp edge and then polished.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{insulation}} test methods approach their lower limits as thermal resistance falls below 0. 1 m 2 ⋅K/W. This is {{the minimum value}} specified in ASTM C 518 (ASTM International, 2010 b) while ASTM C 177 (ASTM International, 2010 a) proposes about 0. 06 m 2 ⋅K/W. Nevertheless these are the test methods, along with their ISO equivalents, required by Australasian building codes and directed at many products and materials with thermal resistance on the low side of 0. 1 m 2 ⋅K/W. Alternatives, such as ASTM E 1530 (ASTM International, 2011), cover much lower resistances but require carefully prepared small specimens and very-high contact pressures and are therefore largely unsuitable for both technical and compliance reasons. For these low resistances, the {{insulation test}} methods face large errors because of interface resistance between specimen and the apparatus hot and cold plates. Staying with C 518, the problem can be avoided by using direct measurement of the test specimen surface temperatures, but this is difficult, has its own accuracy issues, and is often impractical for commercial laboratories. This technique is generally {{used in conjunction with}} interface materials such as flexible foam between the specimen and the hot and cold plates, to enhance contact and also provide an access path for temperature sensors. The alternative prospect of using these interface materials to ensure good specimen contact has been studied, in conjunction with a simple two-step thermal resistance determination based on the difference between presence and absence of the test specimen. This article presents results of a study using this difference approach for the measurement of 12 highly conducting materials, including sheets of aluminum, phenolic, HDPE, MgO, bonded <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> <b>cork</b> granules, PMMA, <b>and</b> compressed wood fiber. For each material, repeated measurements have been performed with four different interface or “buffer” materials: PVC, silicone, EVA, and nitrile. Silicone sponge provides the most uniform results, consistent with a measurably lower hysteresis. The difference technique yielded a lower indicated thermal resistance than direct measurement by between 0. 003 and 0. 01 m 2 ⋅K/W, with some variation depending on the specimen surface characteristics {{and to a lesser extent}} on the choice of buffer. Larger differences were associated with bowed, uneven or roughly surfaced specimens. The difference-technique results have greater variability, but they may be seen as better estimates of the actual specimen resistance, as contact resistance is much lower for soft-surface interfaces. An interface resistance of up to 0. 01 m 2 ⋅K/W is large enough to be of significance in many thermal measurements...|$|R

40|$|The Center for NDE, Iowa State University, has {{developed}} an ultrasonic pulse compression system using Golay codes, and demonstrated the enhanced signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in highly energy absorbent materials such as <b>rubber,</b> plastics, <b>corks,</b> <b>and</b> some composites. Recently, an attempt {{has been made to}} theoretically predict ultrasonic pulse compression (correlated) flaw signals (e. g., voids) using the ultrasonic measurement model developed earlier at the same university. Predictions were made by the use of long coded waveforms (Golay codes) as inputs to the measurement model instead of the spike pulse in conventional ultrasonics. The results were then compared with experimentally measured conventional ultrasonic flaw signals. The results indicated that the ultrasonic pulse compression flaw signals can be predicted as accurate as conventional ultrasonic signals. In addition, the equivalent pulse of the Golay codes (delta-like pulse) was also used as an input to the measurement model to predict the same flaw signal, and it was demonstrated that the Golay codes and the equivalent pulse produce effectively the same results although the signal processing methods are significantly different...|$|R

At the urging of fellow sculptor Jose de Creeft, he submitted them to the Salon des Humoristes. Calder began to create his Cirque Calder, a miniature circus fashioned from wire, cloth, string, <b>rubber,</b> <b>cork,</b> <b>and</b> other found objects. Designed to be transportable (it eventually grew to fill five large suitcases), the circus was presented {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. Soon, his Cirque Calder (on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art at present) became popular with the Parisian avant-garde. He also invented wire sculpture, or [...] "drawing in space," [...] and in 1929 he had his first solo show of these sculptures in Paris at Galerie Billiet. Hi! (Two Acrobats) in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an early example of the artist's wire sculpture. The painter Jules Pascin, a friend of Calder's from the cafes of Montparnasse, wrote the preface to the catalog. A visit to Piet Mondrian's studio in 1930, where he was impressed by the environment-as-installation, [...] "shocked" [...] him into fully embracing abstract art, toward which he had already been tending.|$|R
