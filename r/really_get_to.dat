500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rob LeDonne, Philip Lawrence from The Smeezingtons explained {{the inspiration for the}} song: [...] "Well, the thing we learned after touring with Doo Wops was how it is we like to feel on stage when performing. We’re fun, like to dance and party, and we didn't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do a lot of that on the first album. Even going to festivals and seeing big bands live, like Coldplay or Bruce Springsteen, we knew the second time around we wanted something fun. It’s the kind of song where the whole band can get up and jam and have this Earth, Wind and Fire kind of moment".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for {{focusing}} more on its action scenes than on characterization. In {{his review}} for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, [...] "This {{is the sort}} of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, and it would work here, if Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know any of them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, [...] "The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were." ...|$|E
500|$|Weinberg {{once again}} {{hit the road}} with Springsteen and the E Street Band for The River Tour 2016 in January 2016, which in its various phases lasted until February 2017. He {{appreciated}} the shows on {{the first leg of}} the tour, where they played the entire 20-song The River album in sequence, because [...] "when you play something night after night you <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> dig into the material, just as an instrumentalist." [...] He attributed his ability to keep playing during some of the longest shows in E Street Band history to his keeping in top physical condition, including exercise by swimming, and to his love of playing with Springsteen.|$|E

500|$|The episode, and {{the season}} itself has {{introduced}} Amanda Tapping as Samantha Carter {{for her first}} of 14 episode appearance, after finishing her appearances on all ten seasons of the sister series, Stargate SG-1. Carter would replace Elizabeth Weir {{as the leader of}} the Atlantis Expedition after the episode. However, Carter would only have a supporting role as opposed to a lead role on SG-1. The episode would also give the audience [...] "an opportunity to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know Dr. Jennifer Keller" [...] (Staite). Gero was reluctant to accept an updated opening title sequence, which mentioned the departure of Weir and the introduction of Carter, which would give the casual viewers a tip.|$|E
500|$|Season two {{also showed}} Lana's {{transition}} from the [...] "girl next door" [...] to a more [...] "self-reliant young woman". At {{the beginning of the}} season Lana is forced to come to terms with her diminished feelings for Whitney, as well as her growing feelings for Clark. It takes time before Lana is strong enough to finally tell Whitney the truth, in a video message, about the way she feels. The Talon, a local coffee shop co-owned by Lana, becomes her new grounding force as Whitney and her aunt have left Smallville. Kreuk thinks that it can be hard to believe that a sixteen-year-old girl could become co-owner of a coffee shop, but she believes that it helps to provide more independence for the character and establish her more within the show. Eventually, in order to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know herself, and find her role in life, Lana leaves Smallville for Paris. In season four, Kristin Kreuk felt like Lana is [...] "going a little crazy and is uncertain about her direction, and feels people aren't validating her beliefs".|$|E
500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now you <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives us, just when you think you know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you get real human redemption." ...|$|E
5000|$|In another interview, Stanne said [...] "I {{want people}} to be sceptical and be able to think for themselves.

In the recent Amphitryon, a Dulaang UP {{production}} directed by José Estrella, he displayed his comic side.

500|$|Burton {{revealed}} that Dylan is [...] "a lot more" [...] like himself. [...] "Jason was so stoic and didn't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> show {{a lot of}} personality, unless it was with Spinelli or Sam," [...] he said. Dylan {{has a sense of}} humor, and the actor felt that it would bring out a [...] "lighter side" [...] of his acting. In addition to his [...] "entire makeover" [...] which included a new hairstyle, Burton lost weight to play Dylan, as the costume department wanted him to look younger. Burton admitted during an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was worried about how Dylan would be received, considering the [...] "persona" [...] of Jason is out there; he hoped [...] "people will buy" [...] Dylan, although some people would say [...] "You are Jason and that's it." [...] Burton told Yahoo! that: [...] " [...] extremely different. That's the biggest thing for me, that after playing a character, which I loved, for 21 years, coming here and trying to do something different - 'cause I know fans are always gonna see me as that character if they watch the show and if they watch both shows... So, it's definitely a challenge because I was so used to playing that character." [...] Jason's [...] "confined" [...] ways allowed Dylan to have a [...] "little more" [...] of Burton's own personality.|$|E

He was a great person, {{one of the few}} that I find was really true to himself. He {{was one of the few}} riders who I really admired for his honesty and his frankness. We talked about a lot of {{different}} things outside of cycling and I was fortunate to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know him when my career stopped. I believe he was also one of the generation that was cut short in the early nineties because he was not able to fulfill the rest of his career. But he was a great rider." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Galway City Museum {{features}} two parts, [...] "Fragments of a City" [...] and [...] "On Reflection." [...] "Fragments of a City"'s {{collection is}} mainly about {{the heritage of}} Galway, while [...] "On Reflection" [...] {{is a collection of}} the most important Irish artists from {{the second half of the}} 20th century. This museum was designed to allow tourists and local visitors to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> understand and know the city of Galway. This museum also houses the statue of the poet, Pádraic Ó Conaire which was originally located in the Kennedy Park section of Eyre Square, prior to the Square's renovation.

2500|$|The actors {{lived in}} Crema {{and were able}} to absorb the rhythm of small town life. Guadagnino engaged deeply with the cast and filmmakers, often cooked and showed films for them in his house. Hammer and Chalamet, who did not have to do a screen test together, {{met for the first time}} during the {{production}} in Crema. They spent a month before shooting together to build character development. [...] "We’d hang out with each other all the time, because we were pretty much the only Americans there, and we were able to defend one another and <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know one another," [...] Chalamet recalled. The actors rehearsed their scenes every night before shooting, and spent several days shooting completely nude. [...] "I’ve never been so intimately involved with a director before. Luca was able to look at me and completely undress me," [...] Hammer said. At the end of the film, Chalamet wears a distinctive New Romantic-looking shirt, picked by the costume designer Giulia Piersanti.|$|E
2500|$|Lexa is {{the first}} Grounder leader to seek peace, which Debnam-Carey {{described}} as [...] "somewhat difficult" [...] for the other Grounders to understand because of their [...] "rough and aggressive" [...] culture; she is also [...] "the first person to unite the 12 clans and to actually {{have the option of}} an alliance." [...] Throughout, she is extremely loyal, but more so to her own people; she puts them first regardless of the cost. Debnam-Carey said [...] "it's in [...] blood" [...] to put her people first because they [...] "are so close to her, that's what she's been groomed to be. She comes from a really harsh culture and she has huge responsibilities." [...] Lexa is [...] "brutal and she's a pragmatist, but not out of unkindness. It's all she's ever known." [...] Debnam-Carey did not view Lexa as a teenager, and did not assign her an age, stating, [...] "It's almost like she skipped that period. She was placed in a position where suddenly she was forced {{to make a lot of}} hard choices that most people never have to make, no matter what their age is. The 100 is a world where you don't ever <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> be a kid." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginning}} of Indian Larry becoming {{known to the}} general public was his appearance in the Discovery Channel program, Motorcycle Mania II in 2001. [...] The program's primary focus was on customizer Jesse James, but it also featured different scenes profiling Indian Larry as he and the group (which included Jesse James, Chopper Dave, and Giuseppe Ronsin) set out to ride 1400 miles from Long Beach, California to the Sturgis 2001 Black Hills Classic in [...] Sturgis, South Dakota. [...] When one of the choppers breaks down in Southern Utah, Larry is shown performing his mechanical skills on the bike in a supermarket parking lot (when his own bike has magneto problems, Larry explains to the camera, [...] "If the bike is not running; if it's leaking oil; and if it's dirty. [...] That's about the only three things that will <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> me.") [...] The program also shows Larry displaying his famous neck tattoo, sharing snippets of his personal philosophy, and doing riding stunts – [...] this included him reclining back on his bike, Grease Monkey, [...] with his legs outstretched over the handlebars, and standing up on the saddle with his arms outstretched to the side as he speeds down the highway. [...] The group also visits Denver's Choppers in Las Vegas, Nevada (now in Reno) where Larry is shown meeting chopper builder, Mondo Porras for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|Whatever Gerry was due {{to drive}} in 1967, you could be sure that he'd be {{thoroughly}} enjoying himself. As reported in Sporting Motorist [...] "Gerry Marshall <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> grips with his motor cars and flings them about with such gay abandon that people expect him to fly off the road - he has been named the Jochen Rindt of club racing, also the Mr. Dunlop Benefit (by commentator Barry Simons) but he rarely does {{and more often than}} not wins".|$|R

500|$|Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music {{commented that}} Blige and Beyoncé {{combined}} their [...] "superpowers" [...] {{in the studio}} to make the [...] "forceful ballad". She further commented, [...] "The breakdown is where the listener <b>really</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> hear the symmetry of these two powerhouse vocals. Neither diva overpowers the other. Right where [...] leaves off, Mary J. picks up. And vice versa... Although either of these R divas could carry 'Love a Woman' with no problem, some might say that the song makes more of an impact with their deliveries combined.|$|R
2500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert held a dissenting view, {{calling the}} film [...] "strangely shapeless" [...] and {{awarding}} it 2.5 stars out of 4. Ebert called it [...] "one of the best-looking war movies ever made on sets and stage" [...] but felt {{this was not}} enough to compete with the [...] "awesome reality of Platoon, Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter." [...] Ebert also criticized the film's second act set in Vietnam, saying the [...] "movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces, none of them quite satisfying" [...] and concluded that the film's message was [...] "too little and too late", having been done by other Vietnam War films. However, Ebert also gave praise to Ermey and D'Onofrio, saying [...] "these are the two best performances in the movie, which never recovers after they leave the scene." [...] This certain review angered Gene Siskel on their television show At The Movies; he accused Ebert for liking Benji the Hunted (which came out the same week) more than Full Metal Jacket. Their difference in opinion was parodied on the television show The Critic, where Siskel taunts Ebert with [...] "coming from the guy who liked Benji the Hunted!" [...] Time Out London also disliked the film saying [...] "Kubrick's direction is as steely cold and manipulative as the régime it depicts", and felt that the characters were underdeveloped, adding [...] "we never <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know, let alone care about, the hapless recruits on view." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Leonard Maltin's annual [...] "TV Movies" [...] ratings book, {{the film}} {{receives}} only two-and-a-half {{out of four}} stars, with the critique, [...] "Expensive remake of The Wages of Fear never really catches hold despite a few astounding scenes." [...] In Leslie Halliwell's Halliwell's Film Guide, the evaluation is even more harsh, and the author found the film [...] "truly insulting", going {{as far as to}} say: [...] "Why anyone would want to spend 20 million dollars on a remake of The Wages of Fear, do it badly, and give it a misleading title is anybody's guess. The result is dire." [...] Andrew Sarris in his July 18, 1977, review for The Village Voice summarized the film as [...] "a visual and aural textbook on everything that is wrong with current movies," [...] as well as stating that the movie reset Friedkin's status to the beginning of his career, and compared him unfavourably to Clouzot, John Huston and David Lean, declaring that [...] "he has not come close to matching their craftsmanship." [...] Robert C. Cumbow in the September 1977 issue of Movietone News also panned the film, criticizing camera placement as [...] "faulty", which in his opinion led to substandard exposition. Moreover, he also deemed the film's editing [...] "ridiculous" [...] and thought Sorcerer lacked character involvement. John Marlowe of The Miami News assessed the movie's dialogues unfavourably, stating that [...] "Sorcerer's dialog is kept to such a minimum that not only you don't feel for these four losers, but you never <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know them." [...] He also considered the film's mixture of realist and surrealist moments as [...] "pain in the mind". Peter Biskind described the film as [...] "self-consciously arty and pretentious [...] fatally trapped between America and Europe, commerce and art," [...] claiming the end result represented [...] "the worst of both worlds", as well as noting that the audience of the time was strikingly different from the one that adored The French Connection. Films Illustrated summarized Sorcerer as an inferior sequel, [...] "below the usual par", in spite of the involvement of reputable lead actor Scheider and a [...] "topnotch director", Friedkin. In the August 1997 issue of The Progressive, Kenneth Turan praised the movie's narrative set-up; however, he thought that in spite of it, it was impossible to attach oneself to the characters. He concluded the review by saying that with [...] "films like this, feeling is everything." [...] Gene Siskel claimed that the characters [...] "seem to be a little cold", as well as expressing an opinion that the special effects overpowered the protagonists.|$|E
