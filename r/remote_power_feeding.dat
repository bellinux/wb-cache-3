Study on the {{deterioration}} of the constant current remote feeding system throughout the life of the structure is always {{one of the most important}} issues in seafloor observatory network reliability engineering. Relationship between current-to-current convertor subsystem and amount of loads in branch line is described by introducing failure rate factor. Multistate reliability model of <b>remote</b> <b>power</b> <b>feeding</b> system has been set up and solved by genetic algorithms. Simulation results show that as the load configuration in trunk line and branch line changing, there exists best combination maximizes the system reliability, besides, appropriate increasing amount of loads in branch line can optimize the preventive strategy...|$|E

40|$|In RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag sys-tems, <b>remote</b> <b>power</b> <b>feeding</b> systems using RF elec-tromagnetic {{induction}} are used. To convert an AC voltage {{provided by}} power receiving coils, AC-DC converters which supply the electric power to signal processing circuits are needed. In conventional AC-DC converters, however, {{the decrease in}} the power efficiency caused by the threshold voltage of diode-switches is a serious problem. In this paper, a charge-pump type AC-DC converter for RFID tags is pro-posed. By using novel bootstrap circuits, the pro-posed converter can avoid the threshold voltage drop caused by diode-switches. Hence the power efficiency of the converter is improved effectively. The valid-ity of the proposed converter is confirmed through SPICE simulations. The SPICE simulations showed that the power efficiency of the proposed converter is more than 85 % and the electric power is about 2 mW when an output load is 500 Ω. Furthermore, the properties concerning power efficiency and ripple voltage are analyzed theoretically...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{universal}} <b>remote</b> <b>powering</b> {{and communication}} system is presented for the implantable medical devices. The system be interfaced with different sensors or actuators. A mobile external unit controls {{the operation of}} the implantable chip and reads the sensor's data. A locator system is proposed to align the mobile unit with the implant unit for the efficient magnetic power transfer. The location of the implant is detected with 6 mm resolution from the rectified voltage level at the implanted side. The rectified voltage level is fedback to the mobile unit to adjust the magnetic field strength and maximize the efficiency of the <b>remote</b> <b>powering</b> system. The sensor's data are transmitted by using a free running oscillator modulated with on-off key scheme. To tolerate large data carrier drifts, a custom designed receiver is implemented for the mobile unit. The circuits have been fabricated in 0. 18 um CMOS technology. The <b>remote</b> <b>powering</b> link is optimized to deliver power at 13. 56 MHz. On chip voltage regulator creates 1. 8 V from a 0. 9 V reference voltage to supply the sensor/actuator blocks.

40|$|The Electrical Power Control Unit {{currently}} under development by Sundstrand Aerospace {{for use on}} the Fluids Combustion Facility of the International Space Station is the precursor of modular power distribution and conversion concepts for future spacecraft and aircraft applications. This unit combines modular current-limiting flexible <b>remote</b> <b>power</b> controllers and paralleled power converters into one package. Each unit includes three 1 -kW, current-limiting power converter modules designed for a variable-ratio load sharing capability. The flexible <b>remote</b> <b>power</b> controllers {{can be used in}} parallel to match load requirements and can be programmed for an initial ON or OFF state on powerup. The unit contains an integral cold plate. The modularity and hybridization of the Electrical Power Control Unit sets the course for future spacecraft electrical power systems, both large and small. In such systems, the basic hybridized converter and flexible <b>remote</b> <b>power</b> controller building blocks could be configured to match power distribution and conversion capabilities to load requirements. In addition, the flexible <b>remote</b> <b>power</b> controllers could be configured in assemblies to feed multiple individual loads and could be used in parallel to meet the specific current requirements of each of those loads. Ultimately, the Electrical Power Control Unit design concept could evolve to a common switch module hybrid, or family of hybrids, for both converter and switchgear applications. By assembling hybrids of a common current rating and voltage class in parallel, researchers could readily adapt these units for multiple applications. The Electrical Power Control Unit concept {{has the potential to be}} scaled to larger and smaller ratings for both small and large spacecraft and for aircraft where high-power density, <b>remote</b> <b>power</b> controllers or power converters are required and a common replacement part is desired for multiples of a base current rating...|$|R

In this work wavelength dependent <b>remote</b> <b>power</b> supply for SMA is presented to avoid electrical cables from the working area of the structure and to demonstrate the selective addressing of a high number of micro-actuators placed in a small space.

A thermal numerical model is presented to visualize the temperature evolution in a Nitinol sample (3 mm 1 mm 100 mm) irradiated by 785 nm laser source. A series of experiments are performed to validate the modelling results, to estimate the response time under different loadings (15 g and 20 g) and to demonstrate the wavelength dependent deformation in SMA samples for selective addressing which is realized by depositing thin layers having specific optical filtering properties directly over the SMA sample and using laser diode sources with different wavelengths (785 nm and 658 nm).
