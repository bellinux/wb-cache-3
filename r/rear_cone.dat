5000|$|In England, the 422d NFS finally {{received}} their first P-61s in late June, and began flying operational missions over England in mid-July. These aircraft arrived without the dorsal turrets so the squadron's gunners were reassigned to another NFS {{that was to}} continue flying the P-70. The first P-61 engagement in the European Theater occurred on July 15 when a P-61 piloted by Lt. Herman Ernst was directed to intercept a V-1 [...] "Buzz Bomb." [...] Diving from above and behind to match the V-1's 350 mph speed, the P-61's plastic <b>rear</b> <b>cone</b> imploded under the pressure and the attack was aborted. The tail cones failed on several early P-61A models before this problem was corrected. On 16 July, Lt. Ernst was again directed to attack a V-1 and, this time, was successful, giving the 422nd NFS and the European Theater its first P-61 kill.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparison}} between two CFD methods for the axisymmetric case: the hydrocode named OTi-HULL and the two-phase flow model presented in the Cocchi's thesis. These methods are applied to the calculation of a test case: a biconical body (nose cone with a cylindrical part and <b>rear</b> <b>cone)</b> at a velocity of 3000 m/s in water. Cocchi's results are comparable to the HULL ones outside the cavity, but inside the cavity the HULL results are wrong in temperature (too high) and in density (too low) compared to Cocchi's. For the cavity width, the results show an acceptable agreement between the twm methods for the cones with the half-angles of 45 ° and 30 °. But for the 15 ° cone there are some discrepancies: the cavity is 10 % larger for Cocchi's results in which the phase change of water in taken into account. These results have to be confirmed by experiments...|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} measurements {{of a high}} emissivity fluid bath variable temperature blackbody source against our reference ammonia heat pipe blackbody from - 45 °C to 25 °C. Although the two blackbodies are of very different designs, the spectral radiance {{results are consistent with}} calculations based on reference thermometer measurements and effective emissivity data. Both blackbodies employ liquid coolant (ethanol) and two stage refrigeration: internal to the fluid bath LTBB and via an external recirculating bath for the AHPBB. In the case of the AHPBB, the coolant cools the ammonia heat pipe, which provides uniform temperature to the cavity, which it surrounds. The cavity of the LTBB is directly immersed in a bath, which also contains cooling coils for the refrigerant. Temperature uniformity is achieved by stirring the coolant. The radiating cavities are also of different designs. The AHPBB has a typical deep cylinder cavity with a shallow <b>rear</b> <b>cone</b> and is coated with a diffuse black paint, while the LTBB cavity is a trap design with a shorter cylinder section and a longer steeper cone, coated with a specular black paint. In each case, using coating data and cavity modeling, the effective emissivity was calculated to be ≥ 0. 9999 from 3. 5 µm to 14 µm. We used the Infrared Spectral Emittance Facility (ISEF) to perform a comparison of the two blackbodies across the spectral and temperature ranges previously described. The radiance temperature and effective emissivity results were found to be within the expanded uncertainty of the measurement process, providing validation of the scale...|$|E

25|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{losses to}} man-portable air-defense systems, MiG-21s were instrumental during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale; Cuban pilots became accustomed to flying {{up to three}} sorties a day. Both the MiG-21MF and the MiG-21bis were deployed almost exclusively in the fighter/bomber role. As interceptors they were somewhat unsuccessful due to their inability to detect low-flying South African aircraft. On November 6, 1981, a Mirage F1CZ achieved South Africa's first confirmed air-to-air kill since the Korean War when it destroyed Cuban Lieutenant Danacio Valdez's MiG-21MF with 30mm cannon fire. On 5 October 1982, Mirages escorting an English Electric Canberra on routine reconnaissance over Cahama were engaged by at least two MiG-21bis. A South African radar operator picked up the attacking MiGs {{and was able to}} alert the Mirage pilots in advance, instructing them to change course immediately. As they jettisoned their auxiliary tanks, however, they were pinpointed by the Cubans, who opened pursuit. In a vicious dogfight, SAAF Major Johann Rankin closed range and maneuvered into the MiGs' <b>rear</b> <b>cones.</b> From there, one of his two R.550 Magic missiles impacted directly behind the lead MiG and forced it down. The second aircraft, piloted by a Lieutenant Raciel Marrero Rodriguez, could not detect the Mirage's proximity until it had entered his turn radius and was perforated by Rankin's autocannon. This damaged MiG-21 landed safely at Lubango.|$|R
25|$|The {{simplest}} driver mount is a {{flat panel}} (i.e., baffle) with the drivers mounted in holes in it. However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength {{longer than the}} baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the antiphase radiation from the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cone</b> interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior.|$|R

40|$|The laminar {{boundary}} layer on a cooled 20 cone was investigated at Mach numbers of 1. 5 and 2. 0 to determine the variation {{of the position of}} transition with surface temperature for both constant surface temperatures and surface temperatures that increased toward the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cone.</b> Small circumferential grooves at the tip were necessary to cause transition {{near the center of the}} cone at the condition of zero heat transfer. The results obtained at all test conditions indicate that removing heat from the bound-ary layer delays transition from laminar to turbulent flow. The theory of laminar—boundary—layer stability developed by Lees in NACA TN 1360, 19 ^ 7 > is in qualitative agreement with this result. At the test conditions of the present investigation, the increase in the extent of the laminar bound-ary layer was found to be a linear function of the rate of heat transfer...|$|R
40|$|The venomous {{gastropods}} in {{the genus}} Conus evolved {{to more than}} 500 species in a time span of 50 million years. During this time, cone snails radiated into three generalized groups: fish-hunters, worm-hunters, and mollusc hunters. This rapid rate of diversification is most likely linked {{to the development of}} a unique prey capture mechanism. There is some evidence to support that fish hunting cones feed on worms in a juvenile stage then convert to a piscivorous diet. This suggests that venom profiles would be post-metamorphically modified from one diet preference to another. Current research investigates this ontogenic change in venom sets by the <b>rearing</b> of <b>Cones</b> in the laboratory. A specialized circular flow aquarium (Kreisel) was utilized along with algal cultures of Isochrysis and Phaedactylum to simulate natural oceanic environment for larvae. As adults, it has been shown that in at least one species, Conus catus, the snails balistically propel a hollow spear through a proboscis into their prey, which then acts like a hypodermic needle to inject specialized venom peptides. Using specimens of C. catus, current research attempts to investigate the cellular components contributing to prey-capture. To gain better understanding of the biomechanics involved in this mechanism, Conus pennacues is recorded during prey-capture using high speed video. A juvenile C. pennaceus makes for an ideal model to study this process because of its translucent proboscis and venom granules facilitating easier observation of venom dynamics. Observations suggest pressurization behind a medial sphincter, followed by rapid expulsion into its prey...|$|R
40|$|Tests at M = 8. 2 {{show that}} a {{simulated}} rocket plume {{at the base of}} a blunted cone can cause large areas of separated flow, with dramatic effects on the heat transfer rate distribution. The plume was simulated by solid discs of varying sizes or by an annular jet of gas. Flow over the cone without a plume is fully laminar and attached. Using a large disc, the boundary layer is laminar at separation at the test Reynolds number. Transition occurs along the separated shear layer and the boundary layer quickly becomes turbulent. The reduction in heat transfer associated with a laminar separated region is followed by rising values as transition occurs and the heat transfer rates towards the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cone</b> substantially exceed the values obtained without a plume. With the annular jet or a small disc, separation occurs much further aft, so that heat transfer rates at the front of the cone are comparable with those found without a plume. Downstream of separation the shear layer now remains laminar and the heat transfer rates to the surface are significantly lower than the attached flow values...|$|R
60|$|Our first {{stopping}} {{place was}} Coupang, {{at the west}} end of the large island of Timor. We then coasted along that island for several hundred miles, having always a view of hilly ranges covered with scanty vegetation, rising ridge behind ridge to the height of six or seven thousand feet. Turning off towards Banda we passed Pulo-Cambing, Wetter, and Roma, all of which are desolate and barren volcanic islands, almost as uninviting as Aden, and offering a strange contrast to the usual verdure and luxuriance of the Archipelago. In two days more we reached the volcanic group of Banda, covered with an unusually dense and brilliant green vegetation, indicating that we had passed beyond the range of the hot dry winds from the plains of Central Australia. Banda is a lovely little spot, its three islands enclosing a secure harbour from whence no outlet is visible, and with water so transparent, that living corals and even the minutest objects are plainly seen on the volcanic sand at a depth of seven or eight fathoms. The ever smoking volcano <b>rears</b> its bare <b>cone</b> on one side, while the two larger islands are clothed with vegetation to the summit of the hills.|$|R
40|$|Growth cone {{responses}} to guidance cues {{provide the basis}} for neuronal pathfinding. Although many cues have been identified, less is known about how signals are translated into the cytoskeletal rearrangements that steer directional changes during pathfinding. Here we show that the response of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to Semaphorin 3 A gradients can be divided into two steps: growth cone collapse and retraction. Collapse is inhibited by overexpression of myosin IIA or growth on high substrate-bound laminin- 1. Inhibition of collapse also prevents retractions; however collapse can occur without retraction. Inhibition of myosin II activity with blebbistatin or by using neurons from myosin IIB knockouts inhibits retraction. Collapse is associated with movement of myosin IIA from the growth cone to the neurite. Myosin IIB redistributes from a broad distribution {{to the rear of the}} growth cone and neck of the connecting neurite. High substrate-bound laminin- 1 prevents or reverses these changes. This suggests a model for the Sema 3 A response that involves loss of growth cone myosin IIA to facilitate actin meshwork instability and collapse, followed by myosin IIB concentration at the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cone</b> and neck region where it associates with actin bundles to drive retraction...|$|R
