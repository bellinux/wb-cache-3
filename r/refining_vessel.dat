40|$|Based on the {{difference}} of Gauss (DoG) filter, a new retinal vessel segmentation method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is used to improve the contrast of the image and then anisotropic diffusion equation is applied to smooth the image for the central reflex of the vessel. Secondly, adaptive DoG (ADoG) with different scale factor ¿ is used to give the initial vessel segmentation result. Then, the <b>refined</b> <b>vessel</b> enhancement result is computed by the superposition of ADoG in twelve directions. At last, the non-vessel is removed based on the bimodality of histogram of the image after enhancement and smoothing. We evaluate experimental results on the public DRIVE and STARE datasets qualitatively and quantitatively, and demonstrate {{the performance of the}} proposed method...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{automated}} algorithm {{for the detection}} of blood vessels in 2 -D choroidal scan images followed by a measurement of the area of the vessels. The objective is to identify vessel parameters in the choroidal stroma that are affected by various abnormalities. The algorithm is divided into five stages. In the first stage, the image is denoised to remove sensor noise and facilitate further processing. In the second stage, the image is segmented in order to find the region of interest. In the third stage, three different contour detection methods are applied to address different challenges in vessel contour. In the fourth stage, the outputs of the three contour detection methods are combined to achieve <b>refined</b> <b>vessel</b> contour detection. In the fifth and final stage, the area of these contours are measured. The results have been evaluated by a practicing opthalmologist and performance of the algorithm relative to expert detection is reporte...|$|R
50|$|In 1873 the Bernese {{government}} banned private excavations at {{the site}} and commissioned Edward Jenner and Edmund Fellberg to lead an expedition to carefully excavate the site. They found {{the remains of a}} settlement which was elliptical in shape and about 190 x 120 m in size. The remains of some of the buildings and bridges were discovered. Willow wickerwork, straw, grain and plants provide an insight into how they lived and what they ate. Today there are about 1,400 bronze artifacts from Mörigen in Swiss museums along with a number in foreign countries. <b>Refining</b> <b>vessels</b> along with sandstone and clay molds provide evidence of bronze refining at Mörigen. The artifacts include 13 swords or fragments of weapons, tools, jewelry, horse bridles and crescent shaped razors based on a northern Italian style. In addition to bronze, some of the bracelets contain pieces of iron, one of the first traces of iron working in Switzerland. Ceramics and opaque glass beads have also been discovered {{at the site}}.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm for <b>refining</b> the <b>vessel</b> contours obtained from retinal binary vessel maps. The re-finement improves vessel width estimation. Our approach {{is based on}} fitting the two contours of each vessel in the binary map with a cubic spline curve, introducing a parallelism con-straint between the two splines. The algorithm, evaluated on the REVIEW database, has a comparable accuracy to that of specialized, sophisticated width estimation algorithms.

40|$|Many quality {{problems}} that originate during continuous casting {{can be directly}} attributed to poor control of fluid flow conditions. This chapter summarizes {{some of these problems}} and discusses the effect of continuous casting parameters on controlling the flow. The flow system and its ter-minology are illustrated in Fig. 14. 1 a and b. The task of the flow system is to transport molten steel at a desired flow rate from the ladle into the mold cavity and to deliver steel to the meniscus area that is neither too cold nor too turbulent. In addition, the flow conditions should minimize exposure to air, avoid the entrainment of slag or other foreign material, aid in the removal of inclusions into the slag layer and encourage uniform solidification. Achieving these somewhat contradictory tasks requires careful optimization. 14. 1 Ladle and Tundish Flow The importance of fluid flow starts in steelmaking and <b>refining</b> <b>vessels</b> including the ladle. The flow objective in these vessels is to encourage uniform mixing of the alloys, to agglomerate inclu-sions and to encourage their removal into the slag layer at the top surface. Flow is driven by the injection of gas bubbles or by natural thermal convection. In the absence of gas injection, the dif-ferences in density of liquid at different temperatures creates significant flow. This tends to strat...|$|R
40|$|Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG) used Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data {{to create}} a {{state-of-the-art}} inventory of 2007 commercial marine vessel emissions in Texas State waters. AIS is a unique program that provides a means for ships to electronically broadcast ship data at regular intervals including: vessel identification, position, course, and speed. These and other data are transmitted continuously, providing a comprehensive and detailed data set for individual vessels {{which can be used}} to estimate and allocate emissions based on improve traffic pattern data. ERG used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to map and analyze both individual vessel movements and general traffic patterns on inland waterways and within 9 miles of the Texas coastline. ERG then linked the vessel tracking data to individual vessel characteristics from Lloyd’s Register of Ships, American Bureau of Shipping, and Bureau Veritas to match vessels to fuel and engine data, which were then applied to the latest emission factors to quantify criteria and hazardous air pollutant emissions from these vessels. The use of AIS data provides the opportunity for highly <b>refined</b> <b>vessel</b> movement and improved emissions estimation, however, such a novel and detailed data set also provides singular challenges in data management, analysis, and gap filling, which are examined in depth in this paper along with potential methods for addressing limitations...|$|R
40|$|A {{distinctive}} type of dark grey limestone {{with white}} fossil inclusions identified as Waagenophyllum corals (a late Permian Rugosa tetracorallum or “horn coral”) was {{used on the}} Iranian plateau since the neolithic period. In the 3 rd millennium BCE, this peculiar stone was used for making vessels, mace heads, miniature columns and beads. At Lagash, in Mesopotamia, around 2100 BCE the same stone was used by local sculptors for making highly <b>refined</b> figurated <b>vessels</b> with dedicatory inscriptions. We discuss the possible source areas of this stone, the typology and general distribution of artefacts made with it, and present the recent discovery, {{on the surface of}} Shahdad, of two important workshop areas with abundant craft debitage of the same material...|$|R
50|$|The process {{includes}} melting the charge, {{refining the}} melt, adjusting the melt chemistry and tapping into a transport <b>vessel.</b> <b>Refining</b> {{is done to}} remove deleterious gases and elements from the molten metal to avoid casting defects. Material is added during the melting process to bring the final chemistry within a specific range specified by industry and/or internal standards. Certain fluxes {{may be used to}} separate the metal from slag and/or dross and degassers are used to remove dissolved gas from metals that readily dissolve certain gasses. During the tap, final chemistry adjustments are made.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Moulthrop studied the general arts, {{including}} drawing and watercolor painting. He developed an early love {{for working with}} wood, which would eventually lead to his most notable successes as an artist. He bought his first lathe when he was sixteen {{and over the years}} was able to get his hands on larger ones to turn larger pieces. As he began to <b>refine</b> his turned <b>vessels</b> he began to attract a good size audience, an audience that included well-known people in the art community and even a United States President.|$|R
