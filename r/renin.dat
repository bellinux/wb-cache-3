5|$|Mineralocorticoid {{secretion}} {{is regulated}} mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), {{the concentration of}} potassium, {{and to a lesser}} extent the concentration of ACTH. Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme <b>renin</b> into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.|$|E
5|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} contains orexinergic neurons {{that control}} appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system. The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through {{the release of}} peptides such as oxytocin, and vasopressin, as well as dopamine into the median eminence. Through the autonomic projections, the hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, sweating, and other homeostatic mechanisms. The hypothalamus also {{plays a role in}} thermal regulation, and when stimulated by the immune system, is capable of generating a fever. The hypothalamus is influenced by the kidneys – when blood pressure falls, the <b>renin</b> released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink. The hypothalamus also regulates food intake through autonomic signals, and hormone release by the digestive system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renin</b> {{can bind to}} ATP6AP2, {{which results}} in a {{fourfold}} increase in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I over that shown by soluble <b>renin.</b> In addition, <b>renin</b> binding results in phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues of ATP6AP2.|$|E
25|$|Plasma <b>renin</b> {{activity}} (PRA), {{also known}} as the <b>renin</b> (active) assay or random plasma <b>renin,</b> {{is a measure of the}} activity of the plasma enzyme <b>renin,</b> which plays a major role in the body's regulation of blood pressure, thirst, and urine output. PRA is sometimes measured, specially in case of certain diseases which present with hypertension or hypotension. PRA is also raised in certain tumors. A PRA measurement may be compared to a plasma aldosterone concentration as an aldosterone-to-renin ratio.|$|E
25|$|Human <b>renin</b> is {{secreted}} by {{at least}} 2 cellular pathways: a constitutive pathway for the secretion of the precursor prorenin and a regulated pathway for the secretion of mature <b>renin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The primary {{structure}} of <b>renin</b> precursor consists of 406 amino acids with a pre- and a pro-segment carrying 20 and 46 amino acids, respectively. Mature <b>renin</b> contains 340 amino acids {{and has a}} mass of 37 kDa.|$|E
25|$|An over-active renin-angiotension system {{leads to}} {{vasoconstriction}} {{and retention of}} sodium and water. These effects lead to hypertension. Therefore, <b>renin</b> inhibitors {{can be used for}} the treatment of hypertension. This is measured by the plasma <b>renin</b> activity (PRA).|$|E
25|$|<b>Renin</b> is {{secreted}} from juxtaglomerular kidney cells, which sense {{changes in}} renal perfusion pressure, via stretch receptors in the vascular walls. The juxtaglomerular cells are also stimulated to release <b>renin</b> by signaling from the macula densa. The macula densa senses changes in sodium delivery to the distal tubule, and responds to {{a drop in}} tubular sodium load by stimulating <b>renin</b> release in the juxtaglomerular cells. Together, the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells comprise the juxtaglomerular complex.|$|E
25|$|Mineralocorticoids are {{replaced}} in all infants with salt-wasting {{and in most}} patients with elevated <b>renin</b> levels. Fludrocortisone is the only pharmaceutically available mineralocorticoid and is usually used in doses of 0.05 to 2mg daily. Electrolytes, <b>renin,</b> and blood pressure levels are followed to optimize the dose.|$|E
25|$|Increase <b>renin</b> {{secretion}} from juxtaglomerular {{cells of}} the kidney.|$|E
25|$|Inhibits <b>renin</b> secretion, thereby {{inhibiting}} the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renin</b> {{is usually}} {{measured}} as the plasma <b>renin</b> activity (PRA). PRA is measured specially {{in case of}} certain diseases that present with hypertension or hypotension. PRA is also raised in certain tumors. A PRA measurement may be compared to a plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) as a PAC/PRA ratio.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renin</b> {{converts}} angiotensinogen (inactive form) to angiotensin I (active form).|$|E
25|$|Although {{the kidney}} cannot {{directly}} sense blood, long-term regulation of blood pressure predominantly {{depends upon the}} kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the extracellular fluid compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration. <b>Renin</b> {{is the first in}} a series of important chemical messengers that make up the renin-angiotensin system. Changes in <b>renin</b> ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment and raising blood pressure. When <b>renin</b> levels are elevated, the concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when <b>renin</b> levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{concentration}} of <b>renin</b> in adult human plasma is 1.98–24.6ng/L in the upright position.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renin</b> {{secretion}} is also {{stimulated by}} sympathetic nervous stimulation, mainly through beta-1 adrenoceptor activation.|$|E
25|$|Please {{go through}} the {{physiology}} of <b>renin</b> and of the renin-angiotensin system {{to understand why the}} following occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{gene for}} <b>renin,</b> REN, spans 12 kb of DNA and {{contains}} 8 introns. It produces several mRNA that encode different REN isoforms.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys secrete {{a variety}} of hormones, {{including}} erythropoietin, and the enzyme <b>renin.</b> Erythropoietin is released in response to hypoxia (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. Calcitriol, the activated form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption of phosphate. Part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, <b>renin</b> is an enzyme involved in the regulation of aldosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>renin</b> enzyme circulates in {{the blood}} stream and hydrolyzes (breaks down) {{angiotensinogen}} secreted from the liver into the peptide angiotensin I.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} <b>renin</b> mRNA {{appears to be}} {{modulated}} by the binding of HADHB, HuR and CP1 to a regulatory region in the 3' UTR.|$|E
25|$|A {{measurement}} of aldosterone in blood may be termed a plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), {{which may be}} compared to plasma <b>renin</b> activity (PRA) as an aldosterone-to-renin ratio.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of kidney cancer {{in a young}} patient with hypertension includes juxtaglomerular cell tumor (reninoma), Wilms' tumor, and renal cell carcinoma, all of which may produce <b>renin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is suppression of adrenal testosterone production by a glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone. Mineralocorticoid is only added {{in cases where}} the plasma <b>renin</b> activity is high.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renin</b> can be {{referred}} to as a hormone even though it has no peripheral receptors and rather has an enzymatic activity with which it hydrolyzes angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, the {{physiologist}} Robert Tigerstedt and his student, Per Bergman, {{experimented with}} rabbits by injecting them with kidney extracts. Their results suggested the kidneys produced a protein, which they named <b>renin,</b> {{that caused a}} rise in blood pressure. In the 1930s, Goldblatt conducted experiments where he constricted the renal blood flow in dogs; he found the ischaemic kidneys did in fact secrete a chemical that caused vasoconstriction. In 1939, <b>renin</b> was found not to cause the rise in blood pressure, but was an enzyme which catalyzed {{the formation of the}} substances that were responsible, namely, angiotensin I (Ang I) and Ang II.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{scientists}} first observed Ang II to {{harm the}} heart and kidneys, and individuals {{with high levels of}} <b>renin</b> activity in plasma were at increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renin</b> {{increases}} in {{concentration in the}} blood {{as a result of}} negative feedback of conversion of AI to AII. AI increases for the same reason; AII and aldosterone decrease. Bradykinin increases because of less inactivation by ACE.|$|E
25|$|A {{decrease}} in arterial blood pressure (that could {{be related to}} a {{decrease in}} blood volume) as detected by baroreceptors (pressure-sensitive cells). This is the most direct causal link between blood pressure and <b>renin</b> secretion (the other two methods operate via longer pathways).|$|E
25|$|Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone {{system is}} a major blood {{pressure}} regulating mechanism. Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as hypotension, low distal tubule sodium concentration, decreased blood volume and high sympathetic tone trigger {{the release of the}} enzyme <b>renin</b> from the cells of juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney. <b>Renin</b> activates a circulating liver derived prohormone angiotensinogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten amino acid residues known as angiotensin I. ACE (Angiotensin converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II. ACE is found in the pulmonary circulation and in the endothelium of many blood vessels. The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent vasoconstrictor).|$|E
25|$|The kidney {{participates in}} whole-body homeostasis, {{regulating}} acid-base balance, electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and {{in concert with}} other organs, particularly those of the endocrine system. Various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions; these include <b>renin,</b> angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide, among others.|$|E
25|$|In current medical practice, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system's overactivity (and {{resultant}} hypertension) is {{more commonly}} reduced using either ACE inhibitors (such as ramipril and perindopril) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs, such as losartan, irbesartan or candesartan) {{rather than a}} direct oral <b>renin</b> inhibitor. ACE inhibitors or ARBs {{are also part of}} the standard treatment after a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Baroreceptors in low {{pressure}} receptor zones (mainly in the venae cavae and the pulmonary veins, {{and in the}} atria) result in feedback by regulating the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH/Vasopressin), <b>renin</b> and aldosterone. The resultant increase in blood volume results in an increased cardiac output by the Frank–Starling law of the heart, in turn increasing arterial blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Primary aldosteronism, {{also known}} as primary hyperaldosteronism, is {{characterized}} by the overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, when not a result of excessive <b>renin</b> secretion. It leads to arterial hypertension (high blood pressure) associated with hypokalemia, usually a diagnostic clue. Secondary hyperaldosteronism, on the other hand, is due to overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Renin</b> (etymology and pronunciation), {{also known}} as an angiotensinogenase, is a serine {{protease}} protein and enzyme secreted by the kidneys that participates in the body's renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)—{{also known as}} the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis—that mediates the volume of extracellular fluid (blood plasma, lymph and interstitial fluid), and arterial vasoconstriction. Thus, it regulates the body's mean arterial blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of captopril {{was among the}} earliest successes of the revolutionary concept of ligand-based drug design. The renin-angiontensin-aldosterone system had been extensively studied in the mid-20th century, and this system presented several opportune targets in the {{development of}} novel treatments for hypertension. The first two targets that were attempted were <b>renin</b> and ACE. Captopril was the culmination of efforts by Squibb's laboratories to develop an ACE inhibitor.|$|E
