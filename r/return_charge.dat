When the original charge had been sustained for fifteen or twenty minutes at about 500°, the <b>return</b> <b>charge</b> was equal to 95° or 100°, and was about fourteen minutes arriving at the maximum effect. A charge continued for not {{more than two or three}} seconds was here succeeded by a <b>return</b> <b>charge</b> of 50° or 60°. The observations formerly made (1234.) held good with this substance. Spermaceti, though it will insulate a low charge for some time, is a better conductor than shell-lac, glass, and sulphur; and this conducting power is connected with the readiness with which it exhibits the particular effect under consideration.|$|E

I {{sought to}} produce {{something}} like this state with one electric power and without induction; for upon the theory of an electric fluid or fluids, that did not seem impossible, and then I should have obtained an absolute charge (1169. 1177.), or something equivalent to it. In this I could not succeed. I excited the outside of a cylinder of shell-lac very highly for some time, and then quickly discharging it (1203.), waited and watched whether any <b>return</b> <b>charge</b> would appear, but such was not the case. This is another fact in favour of the inseparability of the two electric forces (1177.), and another argument for the view that induction and its concomitant phenomena depend upon a polarity of the particles of matter.|$|E

40|$|Mass {{customization}} (MC) {{service is}} a pertinent industrial practice in the fashion industry. To foster trust and enhance demand, some brands now allow dissatisfied customers to return the MC fashion product for a full refund minus a service charge. The service charge is a measure to avoid the abuse of the return right and to subsidize the operations cost (e. g., shipping) and loss from the return. Motivated by this observed industrial practice, this paper analytically examines the optimal <b>return</b> service <b>charge</b> policy. We separate the study into two cases?those of risk-neutral and those of risk-averse MC companies, respectively. For each case, we derive the closed-form expression of the optimal <b>return</b> service <b>charge,</b> and we conduct analytical sensitivity analysis to illustrate how different important parameters in the model affect the optimal <b>return</b> service <b>charge.</b> In addition, by comparing the two cases, we reveal how the MC service provider's level of risk aversion affects the optimal <b>return</b> service <b>charge</b> policy. Finally, we derive {{the conditions under which}} it is optimal to offer a zero <b>return</b> service <b>charge</b> (i. e., free return with a full refund). These conditions provide insight on the real-world practice in which some fashion companies offer free return service to their registered members but not to every customer.

Thus {{it would}} appear that the best solid insulators, such as shell-lac, glass, and sulphur, have {{conductive}} properties to such an extent, that electricity can penetrate them bodily, though always subject to the overruling condition of induction (1178.). As to the depth to which the forces penetrate in this form of charge of the particles, theoretically, it should be throughout the mass, for what the charge of the metal does for the portion of dielectric next to it, should be close by the charged dielectric for the portion next beyond it again; but probably in the best insulators the sensible charge is to a very small depth only in the dielectric, for otherwise more would disappear in the first instance whilst the original charge is sustained, less time would be required for the assumption of the particular state, and more electricity would re-appear as <b>return</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of permeant ions can modulate {{the rate of}} gating <b>charge</b> <b>return</b> in wild-type human heart K+ (hKv 1. 5) channels. Here we employ gating current measurements in a non-conducting mutant, W 472 F, of the hKv 1. 5 channel to investigate how different cations can modulate <b>charge</b> <b>return</b> and whether the actions can be specifically localized at the internal {{as well as the}} external mouth of the channel pore. Intracellular cations were effective at accelerating <b>charge</b> <b>return</b> in the sequence Cs+ > Rb+ > K+ > Na+ > NMG+. Extracellular cations accelerated <b>charge</b> <b>return</b> with the selectivity sequence Cs+ > Rb+ > Na+ = NMG+. Intracellular and extracellular cation actions were of relatively low affinity. The Kd for preventing slowing of the time constant of the off-gating current decay (τoff) was 20. 2 mM for intracellular Cs+ (Csi+) and 358 mM for extracellular Cs+ (Cso+). Both intracellular and extracellular cations can regulate the rate of <b>charge</b> <b>return</b> during deactivation of hKv 1. 5, but intracellular cations are more effective. We suggest that ion crystal radius is an important determinant of this action, with larger ions preventing slowing more effectively. Important parallels exist with cation-dependent modulation of slow inactivation of ionic currents in this channel. However, further experiments are required to understand the exact relationship between acceleration of <b>charge</b> <b>return</b> and the slowing of inactivation of ionic currents by cations...|$|R

40|$|The {{cosmetics}} {{industry is}} an intensely competitive, fashion-driven industry. As such, new product launch processes are viewed to be {{a competitive advantage}} in promoting continued brand awareness in the market place. However, very few resources are in place to encourage manufacturer and retailer collaboration and to monitor new product launches during launch and after the initial 3 - 6 month promotion period. As a result, large trade inventories and product <b>return</b> <b>charges</b> negatively impact both the profitability of the manufacturer, Procter & Gamble (P&G), {{as well as their}} retail customers. This thesis concentrates on supply chain management methods to enhance the profitability of launching new products in the cosmetics industry to both P&G and one retail customer, Retailer A. Of the retailers that P&G sells cosmetics through, Retailer A represents one of the largest opportunities to reducing trade inventory and product <b>return</b> <b>charges.</b> An analysis presented in this thesis revealed that Retailer A ordered an average of 18 months of a new product during the first 2 - 3 months of launch for products released in the January 2000 - May 2001 period. Research was conducted during a six and a half month internship within P&G's Product Supply group at the Cosmetics Division in Hunt Valley, MD. The internship was affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Leaders for Manufacturing Program. Outputs of this work include a high-level strategy for launching new products within this division, as well as logistics tactics developed via a dynamic supply chain model. Through theoretical and simulation analysis, the project revealed that implementing unique stocking and reordering strategies for launching new products based on item type and retail store sales volume results in significant savings to P&G and Retailer A. For Retailer A alone, the impact of implementing the project recommendations is estimated to be approximately a one million dollar reduction in final retail inventory, which translates into between a half a million and a one million dollar reduction in P&G's product <b>return</b> <b>charges.</b> In addition, an in-stock improvement opportunity is estimated to be one hundred and thirty thousand dollars, translating directly to improved service for the final consumer. by Leslie E.

According to the indictment of American Cyanamid, Bristol Myers, Pfizer, and Cyanamid knew that tetracycline represented a threat to the continuation of their dominant positions and unreasonably high profits. To keep that threat in check, the indictment alleges, Cyanamid bought out Heyden's rights to the development and agreed to help Pfizer get the tetracycline patent.

40|$|AbstractKV 11. 1 {{voltage-gated}} K+ {{channels are}} noted for unusually slow activation, fast inactivation, and slow deactivation kinetics, which tune channel activity to provide vital repolarizing current during later {{stages of the}} cardiac action potential. The bulk of charge movement in human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) is slow, as is <b>return</b> of <b>charge</b> upon repolarization, suggesting that the rates of hERG channel opening and, critically, that of deactivation might be determined by slow voltage sensor movement, and also by a mode-shift after activation. To test these ideas, we compared the kinetics and voltage dependence of ionic activation and deactivation with gating charge movement. At 0  mV, gating charge moved ∼threefold faster than ionic current, which suggests the presence of additional slow transitions downstream of charge movement in the physiological activation pathway. A significant voltage sensor mode-shift was apparent by 24  ms at + 60  mV in gating currents, and <b>return</b> of <b>charge</b> closely tracked pore closure after pulses of 100 and 300  ms duration. A deletion of the N-terminus PAS domain, mutation R 4 AR 5 A or the LQT 2 -causing mutation R 56 Q gave faster-deactivating channels that displayed an attenuated mode-shift of charge. This indicates that charge movement is perturbed by N- and C-terminus interactions, and that these domain interactions stabilize the open state and limit the rate of <b>charge</b> <b>return.</b> We conclude that slow on-gating charge movement can only partly account for slow hERG ionic activation, and {{that the rate of}} pore closure has a limiting role in the slow <b>return</b> of gating <b>charges...</b>|$|R
