40|$|This paper {{shows the}} initial {{research}} about {{the design of}} optimal investment policy of the public company in <b>resource</b> <b>conservation,</b> by using optimal control model. The mathematical bioeconomics model in using of mathematical modeling for <b>resource</b> <b>conservation</b> is a dynamics problem. The successfull of <b>resource</b> <b>conservation</b> management must fully {{take account of the}} time dimension for sustained equilibrium bioeconomics.  The design of a dynamic optimization model is solved  by optimal control strategy via maximum principle Pontryagin of Hamiltonian expressi. We have the conclusion that the optimization of present value for <b>resource</b> <b>conservation</b> very dependent of time domain, how long stock optimal can be sustained  for is given initial stock. </p...|$|R
