40|$|Objective: To reduce metal-induced streak {{artifact}} on {{oral and}} maxillofacial X-ray CT (computed tomography) images by developing the fast statistical image reconstruction system using iterative reconstruction algorithms. Study design: Adjacent CT images often depict similar anatomical structures in thin slices. So firstly images were reconstructed {{using the same}} projection data of an artifact-free image. Secondly images were processed by the successive iterative restoration method where projection data was generated from reconstructed image in sequence. Besides the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization algorithm, the ordered subset-expectation maximization algorithm (OS-EM) was examined. Also small ROI setting and <b>reverse</b> <b>processing</b> were applied for improving performance. Results: Both algorithms reduced artifacts instead of slightly decreasing gray levels. The OS-EM and small ROI reduced the processing duration without apparent detriments. Sequential and <b>reverse</b> <b>processing</b> didn’t show apparent effects. Conclusions: Two alternatives in iterative reconstruction methods were effective for artifacts reduction. The OS-EM algorithm and small ROI setting improved the performance.

40|$|AbstractA generic {{method for}} the <b>reverse</b> <b>processing</b> of dry {{photoresist}} is proposed. The technique {{is based on}} the lamination of prepatterned polymeric structures on the pre-existing devices. The concept is illustrated with the encapsulation at the foil level of gas sensors made on plastic foil. This polymeric-based technique can be either applied on plastic foils but also on conventional substrates such as silicon or glass. It can be used when standard packaging techniques might not be suitable or when they can represent a significant cost. Using the lamination of a foil, the low-temperature and dry process presented here is compatible with large scale fabrication techniques, such as roll-to-roll processing, and aims at reducing the global fabrication cost of sensing devices made on plastic foil...|$|E

A two-step approach combines a Kalman filter to process kinematic carrier phase, phase rate, and pseudorange data, while a batch least-squares adjust-ment processes static carrier phase data. A semikinematic test performed over a well-controlled traverse in a mountainous region near Calgary is used to assess the performance of the algorithm. Several runs of the traverse were made with the station occupation time at 2 - 3 min.

40|$|Traditional supply chains {{consist of}} manufacturers, who process, {{assemble}} and sell products to customers. Once the product has been sold, {{the ownership of}} the product is transferred on to the customer. Typically after a possible warranty period, the repair, maintenance and eventual disposal of the product is then {{the responsibility of the}} customer. The <b>reverse</b> <b>processing</b> activities of inspection, parts remanufacturing, and materials recycling can substantially reduce the material and energy consumed by producing goods. Although these activities have a beneficial environmental impact, customers fail to participate in the remanufacturing efforts by producers or third parties because they often lack incentives. To overcome this drawback, several environmental and economic thinkers have proposed a concept called 2 ̆ 2 servicizing 2 ̆ 2. In this paradigm, producers become service providers who provide the use and maintenance of products while retaining ownership; customers become clients who pay fees to receive the benefits the products provide. Instead of extensive buying and disposing of products, servicizing includes the obligation to dispose of used products responsibly, while reusing them and their constituent parts and materials as much as possible. However, because the provider retains responsibility for the product while it is in use by different client firms, the service paradigm also creates the need for better information and communication technology to increase the provider 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of the product condition. Monitoring the condition of the equipment enhances the ability of the service provider to make better replacement decisions (when to replace the product in the fleet to avoid failures) and better inventory management decisions (how much remanufactured stock to maintain so the customer is ensured a working product at all times). This thesis aims at optimizing the replacement and inventory decisions of the service provider in order to minimize the long-run overall cost per unit time...|$|E

Assuming a stored data set of user preferences, reverse top-k queries have been introduced for retriev-ing the users that deem a given database object {{as one of their}} top-k results. Reverse top-k queries have already attracted significant in-terest in research, due to numerous real-life applications such as market analysis and product placement. Currently, the most effi-cient algorithm for computing the reverse top-k set is RTA.

The study utilized the dichotic listening paradigm and {{examined the effects of}} directed attention on the processing of consonant-vowel (CV) and tonal stimuli by the four groups. The sixty subjects included fifteen right-handed good readers (eleven females and four males, mean age 10 - 3), fifteen left-handed good readers (eight females and seven males, mean age 10 - 5), fifteen right-handed reading-disabled children (six females and nine males, mean age 10 - 5), and fifteen left-handed reading-disabled children (four females and eleven males, mean age 10 - 8). All left-handed subjects had sinistral relatives. A three-factorial analysis of variance resulted in a significant left ear advantage (LEA) for tonal stimuli across all directed attention conditions for all groups. When presented with CV stimuli, the right-handed good readers produced a significant right ear advantage (REA) across all attentional conditions. The left-handed good readers and left-handed reading-disabled children were left ear (LE) dominant in the free recall and directed left conditions but produced a shift toward the right ear (RE) during the directed right condition. Right-handed reading-disabled children demonstrated a REA during free recall and directed right but were able to direct attention to the LE in the directed left condition. The study provided initial findings on the auditory processing of simple tonal stimuli among anomalous groups of children and documented the strong LEA found in previous studies of adult subjects.

The algorithm is able to correctly generate tests for combinational and sequential circuits. Both nMOS and CMOS circuits can be modeled. In addition to the classical line stuck-at faults, the algorithm is able to handle stuck-open and stuck-closed faults on the transistors of the circuit. ^ The time-frame based algorithm uses asynchronous processing within each clock phase to achieve stability in the circuit, and synchronous processing between clock phases to model the passage of time. The <b>reverse</b> time <b>processing</b> approach is applied to generate a test for a specified fault.

40|$|In this paper, for {{the first}} time, we {{introduce}} the concept of Reverse Skyline Queries. At first, we consider for a multidimensional data set P the problem of dynamic skyline queries according to a query point q. This kind of dynamic skyline corresponds to the skyline of a transformed data space where point q becomes the origin and all points of P are represented by their distance vector to q. The reverse skyline query returns the objects whose dynamic skyline contains the query object q. In order to compute the reverse skyline of an arbitrary query point, we first propose a Branch and Bound algorithm (called BBRS), which is an improved customization of the original BBS algorithm. Furthermore, we identify a super set of the reverse skyline {{that is used to}} bound the search space while computing the reverse skyline. To further reduce the computational cost of determining if a point belongs to the reverse skyline, we propose an enhanced algorithm (called RSSA) that is based on accurate pre-computed approximations of the skylines.

Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets, we show that our algorithms can efficiently support reverse skyline queries.
