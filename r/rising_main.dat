50|$|In 1884 the Queensland Water Supply Department (established in 1881 with JB Henderson as the {{government}} Hydraulic Engineer) revived and modified the 1878 scheme. A new report was prepared but considered too expensive. Only following the 1886 speculative boom in Charters Towers did {{the government}} instruct Henderson to prepare a cheaper scheme. This was done by {{reducing the number of}} pumping stations from two to one and installing only one pumping engine initially. Water was to be pumped through a 12 inch cast-iron <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> to a circular reservoir on Tower Hill, from where it would be reticulated by gravity.|$|E
50|$|More {{reliable}} pumps {{have been}} developed to be maintained at the local level: village level operations and maintenance (VLOM). The India Mark III, Afridev, and Bluepump are the most common VLOM pumps. The pumps incorporate the use of larger PVC riser mains to allow for the pump cylinder to be removed without lifting the <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> out of the borehole. This makes maintenance on the pumps easier but the initial cost for the pipes can be twice as much. Routine maintenance is still required and maintaining funds for replacement parts is still necessary. Without the need for a specialized pump mechanic these newer pump designs can provide longer lasting sustainable access to drinking water. Unfortunately, some countries have restricted importation and installation of these pumps citing the need to standardize pumps to reduce cost and ensure an adequate supply of replacement parts. The government of Uganda, for example, enforces the standardization by placing high tariffs on pumps other than a variant of the India Mark II, known as U2.|$|E
50|$|Early {{immigrants}} to the New World brought with them the technology of windmills from Europe. On US farms, particularly on the Great Plains, wind pumps were used to pump water from farm wells for cattle. In California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system, including a hand-dug well and a redwood water tower supporting a redwood tank and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouse). The self-regulating farm wind pump was invented by Daniel Halladay in 1854. Eventually, steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction, and at their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use, with capacity equivalent to 150 megawatts. Very large lighter wind pumps in Australia directly crank the pump with the rotor of the windmill. Extra back gearing between small rotors for high wind areas and the pump crank prevents trying to push the pump rods down on the downstroke faster than they can fall by gravity. Otherwise pumping too fast leads to the pump rods buckling, making the seal of the stuffing box leak and wearing through the wall of the <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> (UK) or the drop-pipe (US) so all output is lost.|$|E

50|$|The {{water flowing}} from {{upstream}} sump 1 flows along {{a very fine}} round railway tunnel sized passage to a bend, where a significant additional stream enters on the left. This is from Frog Pot and is the New Stream water from New Stream sump in Goyden pot. The combined waters flow along the huge tunnel to a short low flooded section, Middle Sump. At {{the far side of}} this sump the water flows for a short distance and then enters downstream sump 1. Divers have explored beyond sump 1 through another seven sumps. The water from this farthest point of exploration travels just over a kilometre to the furthest explored point of Nidd Head Resurgence. The Nidd actually resurges from three locations, the North West <b>Rising,</b> <b>Main</b> Rising and South East Rising. As the name suggests most of the water rises from the Main Rising and this has been explored by divers for over 850m. The North West Rising is presumed to flow from a point 119m into the Main Rising. The water from South East Rising has been explored for over 120m and is also thought to connect with the Main Rising.|$|E
30|$|Most of {{methanogen}} {{was strictly}} anaerobic {{and a small}} amount of methanogen was anoxic and aerobic. According to the laying of gravity sewer, there are manholes among the sewers. Usually, there is oxygen in gravity sewers. In this study, the methane production was less than which obtained in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers in previous research (Guisasola et al. 2008, 2009). An important reason may be that anaerobic environment in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers is more beneficial to methane production. In addition, <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers were full of sewage so that biofilm could develop on the entire surface of sewers. There is an obvious difference between gravity sewer and <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer. Gravity sewers are not full of sewage. The biofilm could not grow on the places which are not covered with sewage. This would lead to difference in microorganism amount and that affects the methane production.|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of ferrous salts is a commonly used strategy for sulfide control in sewer networks. The Fe(2 +) dosing requirement in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers which {{takes into account}} {{of the effect of}} anaerobic sewer biofilms on the dosing demand is investigated. A laboratory-scale <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer, consisting of four biofilm reactors in series and fed with real sewage, was operated for over 12 months, during which FeCl(2) was dosed at several locations and at various dosing rates. The experimental results consistently revealed that approximately 0. 7 mol of Fe(2 +) was required to precipitate sulfide formed from the reduction of 1 mol of sulfate by anaerobic sewer biofilms. This ratio is significantly lower than the ratio expected from reaction stoichiometry (molar ratio of 1 : 1), and also the Fe(2 +) to sulfide ratio (1. 07 - 1. 10 mol: 1 mol) observed in batch tests conducted with real wastewater in the absence of sewer biofilms. Biofilms adapted to Fe(2 +) addition were found to contain a substantially higher amount of elemental sulfur than biofilms not receiving Fe(2 +) dosage. This suggests Fe(2 +) addition might have altered the final product of sulfate reduction by anaerobic sewer biofilms. The study also showed that the {{addition of}} ferrous salts at the inlet of a <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer can effectively control sulfide throughout the whole system despite of the presence of competing anions in wastewater. Phosphate precipitation with ferrous iron in anaerobic <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers is negligible...|$|E

40|$|The anoxic and {{anaerobic}} sulfur transformation pathways in a laboratory-scale sewer receiving nitrate were investigated. Four reactors {{in series}} {{were employed to}} imitate a <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer. The nitrate-dosing strategy was effective in controlling sulfide, as confirmed by the long-term sulfide measurements. Anoxic sulfide oxidation occurred in two sequential steps, namely the oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur (S(0)) and the oxidation of S(0) to sulfate (SO(4) (2 -)). The second oxidation step, which primarily occurred when {{the first step was}} completed, had a rate that is approximately 15 % of the first step. When nitrate was depleted, sulfate and elemental sulfur were reduced simultaneously to sulfide. Sulfate reduction had a substantially higher rate (5 times) than S(0) reduction. The relatively slower S(0) oxidation and reduction rates implied that S(0) was an important intermediate during anoxic and anaerobic sulfur transformation. Electron microscopic studies indicated the presence of elemental sulfur, which was at a significant level of 9. 9 and 16. 7 mg-S/g-biomass in nitrate-free and nitrate-exposed sewer biofilms, respectively. A conceptual sulfur transformation model was established to characterize predominant sulfur transformations in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers receiving nitrate dosage. The findings are pertinent for optimizing nitrate dosing to control sulfide in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers...|$|E
40|$|Sewers {{systems are}} dynamic in nature, with {{periodic}} variation of hydraulic flow and wastewater substrate concentrations. While various models are currently available for predicting hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) production in rising mains, they assume constant biofilm activities {{along the length}} and ignore the effect of substrate availability on biofilm development. To investigate variation in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> biofilm structure and activity, detailed {{studies were carried out}} on a Robbins device setup, which was established in parallel to a real <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> that it simulated. The changes in wastewater characteristics, as wastewater traveled through both the experimental setup and the real sewer system, were monitored. The study revealed that the biofilm activities varied significantly with locations, with biofilm corresponding {{to the start of the}} <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> capable of greater sulfide and volatile fatty acid production than biofilm downstream. Analysis of microbial community composition of these biofilms showed a difference in diversity and abundance, both with regard to general bacterial populations and sulfate reducers. These differences were hypothesized to be a consequence of varying substrate types and availability along the sewer line. The results suggest that the biofilm structure and activity may vary considerably along the length of rising mains and should be taken into consideration for improved sewer modeling and when considering the overall effect of different hydrogen sulfide management options...|$|E
