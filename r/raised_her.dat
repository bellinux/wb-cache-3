5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example. In 1843, a deacon {{was expelled}} from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> hand in his defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member}} of the church, she was not a voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> hand for each of the remaining five votes.|$|E

5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E
5|$|Eduard Anatolyevich Streltsov {{was born}} in Perovo, an eastern {{district}} of Moscow, on 21 July 1937, the son of Anatoly Streltsov, a front-line soldier and intelligence officer, and Sofia Frolovna. Anatoly {{did not return to}} the family following the Second World War, instead choosing to settle alone in Kiev; Sofia therefore <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> son on her own, working at the Fraser Cutting Instruments Factory to support Eduard and herself. As a result, Streltsov had a modest upbringing, the highlights of which were playing football and following his favoured team, Spartak Moscow.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found the remains of Royal Savages hull, which he {{successfully}} raised in 1935. Hagglund followed up his discovery of Royal Savage {{with the discovery of}} Philadelphias remains in 1935, sitting upright on the lake bottom. He <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> that year; in addition to the guns and hull, hundreds of other items were recovered from the vessel. These relics included shot, cooking utensils, tools, buttons, buckles and human bones.|$|E

5|$|After her parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and {{her brother}} lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. Her mother <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> Catholic, but did not require {{her to go to}} church. As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Cooper was loaned out to MGM for the Civil War drama film Operator 13 with Marion Davies, about a {{beautiful}} Union spy who {{falls in love}} with a Confederate soldier. Despite Richard Boleslawski's imaginative direction and George J. Folsey's lavish cinematography, the film did poorly at the box office. Back at Paramount, Cooper appeared in his first of seven films by director Henry Hathaway, Now and Forever, with Carole Lombard and Shirley Temple. In the film, he plays a confidence man who tries to sell his daughter to the relatives who <b>raised</b> <b>her,</b> but is eventually won over by the adorable girl. Impressed by Temple's intelligence and charm, Cooper developed a close rapport with her, both on and off screen. The film was a box-office success.|$|E

Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E

5|$|Macnamara {{they spent}} 15 days in September 1795 blockading a French grain convoy {{in the port}} of Genoa. The convoy was {{protected}} by two frigates, the Vestale and the Brun. The French finally {{came out on the}} evening of the fifteenth day, and were engaged by Southampton, despite the French possessing considerably more firepower. After a sustained engagement Southampton forced Vestale to strike her colours while the Brun escaped with the convoy, leaving Vestale to her fate. But as Southampton prepared to lower her boats to take possession of the French ship, her fore-mast, which had been damaged during the engagement, went by the board. Taking advantage of this, Vestale <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> colours and escaped from the scene.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Los Angeles, Cameron befriended the socialite Samson De Brier and {{established}} herself within the city's avant-garde artistic community. Among {{her friends were}} the filmmakers Curtis Harrington and Kenneth Anger. She appeared in two of Harrington's films, The Wormwood Star and Night Tide, {{as well as in}} Anger's film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. In later years, she made appearances in art-house films created by John Chamberlain and Chick Strand. Rarely remaining in one place for long, during the 1950s and 1960s she lived in Joshua Tree, San Francisco, and Santa Fe. In 1955, she gave birth to a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel. Although intermittent health problems prevented her from working, her art and poetry resulted in several exhibitions. From the late 1970s until her death from cancer in 1995, Cameron lived in a bungalow in West Hollywood, where she <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> daughter and grandchildren, pursued her interests in esotericism, and produced artwork and poetry.|$|E
5|$|Sevastopol saw {{service in}} the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. Slightly damaged during a {{surprise}} attack on Port Arthur in early February, the ship later participated in several attempts to break out from the besieged port. The most notable of these was the Battle of the Yellow Sea, where she was damaged by several shells but managed {{to make it back}} to port with the remnants of the Russian Fleet, leaving one crewman dead and 62 wounded. Immediately after the surrender of Port Arthur, Sevastopol was scuttled to prevent her capture by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Japanese never <b>raised</b> <b>her.</b> The remains of the ship still lie outside the entrance to the port.|$|E

5|$|The Sea Urchin is a 1913 American silent short romantic drama film {{directed}} by Edwin August and starring Jeanie MacPherson and Lon Chaney. The film was {{the earliest known}} character role by Lon Chaney and the first screenplay by MacPherson.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Oliver Carter, Iaukea became the private {{secretary}} and business agent of Liliʻuokalani. From 1909 to 1917, he served in this role and became a trustee of The Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust, a charitable trust established by the queen to manage her landholdings and estate after her death. Iaukea and his wife Charlotte were at Liliuokalani's side when she died in 1917. He {{was the one who}} <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> royal standard (flag) over Washington Place to signal her death, and was in charge of planning Liliuokalani's state funeral. He served as an honorary pallbearer during the funeral procession while his son Frederick Hank Iaukea served as an active pallbearer carrying the catafalque bearing the casket of the queen to her final resting place for entombment with her family members in the Kalākaua Crypt of the Royal Mausoleum of Mauna ʻAla. As a former chamberlain, and one of the last surviving representatives of the former dynasty, he had planned the royal funerals of Princess Kaʻiulani in 1899, Prince David Kawānanakoa in 1908, and Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole in 1922.
