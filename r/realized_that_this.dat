5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years after}} {{studying}} experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life, at an animation festival. Murray offered Hillenburg {{a job as}} a director of the series. Martin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko's Modern Life, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not considered creating his own series, but soon <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was his chance. Shortly after production on Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.|$|E
5|$|While Stepanov had {{originally}} intended allocators to completely encapsulate the memory model, the standards committee <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> approach {{would lead to}} unacceptable efficiency degradations. To remedy this, additional wording {{was added to the}} allocator requirements. In particular, container implementations may assume that the allocator's type definitions for pointers and related integral types are equivalent to those provided by the default allocator, and that all instances of a given allocator type always compare equal, effectively contradicting the original design goals for allocators and limiting the usefulness of allocators that carry state.|$|E

5|$|Dean's other {{dream is}} a major {{turning point in the}} character's storyline, after which he starts gaining self-respect and realizes that he truly wants to live. He begins the season with little self-worth, and the writers <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> outlook stems from his father, John Winchester. Initially, they planned to have Jeffrey Dean Morgan reprise his role as John, who would browbeat Dean within the dreamscape. When they learned that Morgan was busy filming Watchmen, the writers instead found {{inspiration}} in the junkyard scene from the film Superman III, in which good and evil versions of Superman confront one another. Kripke noted, however, that the conversation between the two Deans still focuses on John.|$|E
5|$|Development of Dark Forces {{was led by}} Daron Stinnett. The {{programming}} was led by Ray Gresko, and {{the graphics}} and storyline by Justin Chin. Production began in September 1993, {{at a time when}} the first-person shooter genre was very popular. The idea of creating a first-person shooter in the Star Wars universe was inspired by fan mods of Doom which had levels set on the Death Star. The developers of Dark Forces wanted to adapt the FPS format into an adventure game. To do this they introduced puzzles and strategy, along with a Star Wars plot. Originally Luke Skywalker was intended to be the main character in the game, however the developers <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would add constraints to gameplay and storyline. Instead a new character, Kyle Katarn, was created.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E

5|$|Anwar Sadat was {{convinced}} that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo, including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and {{had no sense of}} loyalty or nationhood. He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment be sent to the Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the game}} started at the {{beginning}} of 2001 with a team of only four programmers. Since Resident Evil was one of Capcom's first titles developed for the GameCube, the development team had to study the system's performance during the first stages of development. Initially, the team considered the possibility of creating the game's environments with computer graphic animation, but then <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics. As a result, the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds like the Resident Evil games for the PlayStation. Despite this, the camera is more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles. The backgrounds also make use of particle effects and full motion video layers to simulate effects such as rushing water or swaying tree branches. Causing fear to the player was a high priority, and many of the game's backgrounds were designed to have a high contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly.|$|E
25|$|Leopold Löwenheim (1915) and Thoralf Skolem (1920) {{obtained}} the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, {{which says that}} first-order logic cannot control the cardinalities of infinite structures. Skolem <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> theorem would apply to first-order formalizations of set theory, and that it implies any such formalization has a countable model. This counterintuitive fact became known as Skolem's paradox.|$|E

25|$|Veruca Salt {{was formed}} in Chicago, Illinois in 1992 by Nina Gordon and Louise Post. Introduced by Gordon's good friend, actress Lili Taylor, Gordon and Post quickly bonded and began playing music together. Originally, the band was an Indigo Girls-inspired {{acoustic}} act, but the women soon <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> wasn't their sound. They enlisted bass player Steve Lack and Gordon's brother Jim Shapiro, a guitarist who joined as the band's drummer {{as a favor to}} his sister.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{began their}} attack with an amphibious {{assault on the}} bastion of Santa Cruz using {{launches}} and shallops to land troops. The captain of the fort, Lourenço Ferreira, <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was just a diversionary attack and without committing additional troops he ordered the units defending that area to assist each other. As the amphibious attack was in progress, the Dutch vanguard and center mounted the main attack marking {{the beginning of the}} battle at the ramparts.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{way of doing business}} was to make the product as and when it was ordered. This style was very slow, As Deere <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{was not going to be}} a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.|$|E

25|$|Around 1809, Sequoyah began {{creating}} {{a system of}} writing for the Cherokee language. At first he sought to create a character for each word in the language. He spent a year on this effort, leaving his fields unplanted, so that his friends and neighbors thought {{he had lost his}} mind. His wife is said to have burned his initial work, believing it to be witchcraft. He <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> approach was impractical because it would require too many pictures to be remembered. He tried making a symbol for every idea, but this also caused too many problems to be practical.|$|E
25|$|After {{ordering}} his {{engineers to}} begin rebuilding the bridge, Jackson directed Col. Thomas T. Munford's 2nd Virginia Cavalry {{to cross the}} swamp and capture some of the Union guns abandoned during the bombardment. As the men and horses waded through water that was belly deep and fouled with debris, Jackson and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill crossed the river to perform a personal reconnaissance. A Union artillery shell exploded {{only a few feet}} away from the generals mounted on horseback, although neither was injured. Jackson saw that Union artillery and infantry was reinforcing the position, and that Federal sharpshooters would play havoc with his engineers on the bridge. He <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was not a place that he could make an opposed crossing.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{the company}} began to develop network {{encryption}} technologies, again {{in response to a}} growing number of similar requests from its customers. Early products in this sphere included PowerTelnet which is comparable to today's ssh, and PowerFTP, which provided encrypted file transfer. In February 1996, Freedman <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> technology could be generalized, resulting in a general-purpose network encryption solution that would encrypt the traffic of any application, without requiring much, if any, modification to that application. Chmilar, Huxley, and Lowe worked hard to prepare a demonstrable version of this new CipherLink product in time for the Networld+Interop trade show in April, 1996. The product was well received, and became a finalist for the Best Product of Show award at the trade show that year.|$|E

25|$|Already in Autumn 1948, {{criticism}} {{came out}} in a joint statement by AB Atomenergi and Atom Commission. The FOA reports predicted a military monopoly over Swedish uranium resources to the detriment of civilian research, and that much larger resources were being assigned to plutonium production. The feasibility of the plutonium project was under question. That was the first sign of antagonism of interests between military and civilian nuclear proponents. The plans had been predicated on the idea that each nuclear device required 50kg rather than 6kg of plutonium. None of those involved in the project <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was, in fact, an overestimation. Although the program was scaled to produce 5-10 weapons per year, given the estimated production of 1kg of Pu-239 per day, it was actually scaled to produce sixty.|$|E
25|$|The Mishna and Talmud (Avodah Zara 8a) {{describe}} a pagan festival called Saturna which occurs {{for eight days}} before the winter solstice. It is followed for eight days after the solstice with a festival called Kalenda culminating with the Kalends of January. The Talmud ascribes the origins of this festival to Adam, who saw that the days were getting shorter {{and thought it was}} punishment for his sin. He was afraid that the world was returning to the chaos and emptiness that existed before creation. He sat and fasted for eight days. Once he saw that the days were getting longer again he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the natural cycle of the world, so made eight days of celebration. The Talmud states that this festival was later turned into a pagan festival.|$|E
25|$|While {{in junior}} high, Law broke {{his right hand}} during {{basketball}} practice. In order to continue to compete, the naturally right-handed Law taught himself to shoot the basketball with his left hand. After recovering from his injury, Law was able to shoot with either hand, but as of 2007 still primarily relied on his left hand to shoot from a long distance. His left-handed jump shots are unusual, however, because the ball has hardly any spin, instead flying straight into the basket. After much examination, Texas A coach Billy Gillispie <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is because Law uses his right thumb when he shoots, negating the spin. To help improve his form, Gillispie ordered Law to tape his right thumb against his hand in practice and try shooting without it. Law was unable to make the shots, and Gillispie quickly decided not to intervene further.|$|E
