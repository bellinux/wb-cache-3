5|$|Around 729/28 BC, {{soon after}} his accession, Osorkon IV faced the crusade led by the Kushite pharaoh Piye of the Nubian 25th Dynasty.

However, Piye's advance was unstoppable and the opposing <b>rulers</b> surrendered one after another: Osorkon IV found it wise to reach the Temple of Ra at Heliopolis and pay homage to his new overlord Piye personally— an action which was soon imitated by the other <b>rulers.</b> As reported on his Victory Stela, Piye accepted their submission, but Osorkon {{and most of the}} <b>rulers</b> were not allowed to enter the royal enclosure because they were not circumcised and had eaten fish, both abominations {{in the eyes of the}} Nubian.

As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan <b>rulers,</b> reuniting the Two Lands.
