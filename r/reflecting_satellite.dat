40|$|Nowadays, we {{can observe}} an {{increase}} in research {{on the use of}} small unmanned autonomous vessel (SUAV) to patrol and guiding critical areas including harbours. The proposal to “snapshot” RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) method for GNSS receivers mounted on SUAV operating in poor space segment geometry is presented in the paper. Existing “snapshot” RAIM methods and algorithms which are used in practical applications have been developed for airborne receivers, thus two main assumptions have been made. The first one is that the geometry of visible satellites is strong. It means that the exclusion of any satellite from the positioning solution don’t cause significant deterioration of Dilution of Precision (DOP) coefficients. The second one is that only one outlier could appear in pseudorange measurements. In case of SUAV operating in harbour these two assumptions cannot be accepted. Because of their small dimensions, GNSS antenna is only a few decimetres above sea level and regular ships, buildings and harbour facilities block and <b>reflect</b> <b>satellite</b> signals. Thus, different approach to “snapshot” RAIM is necessary.

Based on University of Surrey experience in small satellite building and operation, these features are listed and explained. Available volume is often identified as the most severe constraint for a small satellite with power and cost being the other two major constraints. Mass is often only of secondary importance for small satellites. Propulsion dry mass fraction for a spacecraft grows upon the system scaling-down. For small spacecraft propulsion fraction can easily exceed 85 %. In such a case, a combination of independent systems for multifunctional propulsion mission scenarios would aggravate the situation. Moreover, specific impulse is not a factor <b>reflecting</b> small <b>satellite</b> propulsion system performance since spacecraft velocity change is also a function of propulsion dry mass fraction.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} use of a simulation tool, called QualiSIM. This tool simulates GNSS-based position accuracy under various operational and environmental conditions, in particular in environments with large amounts of signal reflections. The signal reflections are implemented using the geometric path length the signal travels when it gets reflected from the surrounding buildings. Environmental influences on GNSS-based positioning are obstacles, such as buildings along streets which can lead to blocking and reflection of satellite signals. Examples of operational conditions are atmospheric effects and changes in the satellite geometry. The tool has been developed to work either with Galileo or GPS or with both satellite constellations. Since Galileo is only preoperational, the simulator is based on the nominal 27 satellite Galileo constellation. Further, the simulator uses: atmospheric models to simulate the effect on satellite signals through Earth’s atmosphere, designs of representative environments e. g. urban and rural scenarios, and a method to simulate reflection of satellite signals within the close environment of the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) antenna. The simulator thus models: the signal path from satellite to receiver, satellite availability, the extended pseudoranges caused by signal reflection, and the position accuracy based on a least squares adjustment of the extended pseudoranges. In order to handle temporal and spatial variations of the different errors sources in GNSSbased positioning, the simulator has been developed for observing variations in position accuracy over time, along a given test trajectory, at different latitudes, and with different azimuths of the environment around the receiver. The environments used by the simulator could be typical representative scenarios such as, a narrow city street, a t-cross or mountain landscape. The choice of not using specific streets or cities has been made {{in order to keep the}} simulator open for every kind of environment. In this paper a simulation example is illustrated and shows the possibilities for visualisation of a narrow street with buildings on each side over a simulation time period of 24 hours.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{economic}} {{consequences of the}} partitioning of Africa among European powers in the late 19 th century; a process historically known as the scramble for Africa. First, using information on the spatial distribution of African ethnicities before colonization we establish that border drawing was largely arbitrary. Apart from the land mass and water area of an ethnicity’s historical homeland, no other geographic, ecological, historical, and ethnic-specific trait predicts which ethnic groups have been partitioned by the national borders. Second, employing data on the location of civil conflicts after independence we show that compared to ethnicities {{that have not been}} impacted by the border design, partitioned ethnic groups have suffered significantly more, longer, and more devastating civil wars. Third, we find that economic development —as <b>reflected</b> by <b>satellite</b> data on light density at night- is systematically lower in the historical homeland of partitioned ethnicities. These results are robust to a rich set of controls at a fine level and the inclusion of country and ethnic-family fixed-effects. Our regressions thus identify a sizable causal negative effect of the scramble for Africa on comparative regional development...|$|R

One limit is set by the maximum mass that can collapse into a given region by the hierarchical growth of structure in the standard cold dark matter cosmology.

40|$|Abstract. Mines have {{a finite}} life {{and as such}} they are not {{permanent}} features of land use on the physical environment. However, they leave scars of environmental damage resulting from the exploration, extraction and processing of minerals. These environmental impacts tend to exacerbate during the post-closure period of the abandoned, derelict mines. Like most developing countries, South Africa has {{over the past decade}} been enforcing legislation that require mining companies to undertake environmental remediation when mines are decommissioned. This is informed by policies aiming at sustainable use and management of the environment. In most cases it is difficult to monitor enforcement and implementation of this legislation because of the limited capacity of the relevent authorities.

The use of satellite imagery makes it possible to monitor the possibility of changes in the previously mined-out areas brought about by environmental rehabilitation.

By this time, Yancy started to curve towards the northwest. Later that day, the tropical storm began developing a banding eye feature. This was <b>reflected</b> in <b>satellite</b> intensity estimates, prompting the JTWC to upgrade Yancy to typhoon status. The JMA maintained the storm's severe tropical storm status through this period, though on September 1 the agency initiated 3-hour position fixes in contrast to their usual 6-hour fix procedure; at 0300 UTC that day the JMA upgraded Yancy to typhoon intensity. Upon upgrade, Yancy was estimated to have a minimum barometric pressure of 965 mbar (hPa; 28.50 inHg). At the time the typhoon was positioned approximately 500 km south-southwest of Okinawa. Rapid intensification ensued, and just nine hours later the JTWC estimated Yancy's winds to have equated to that of a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The JTWC upgraded the typhoon to super typhoon status at 0600 UTC on September 3 as one-minute sustained winds were estimated to have reached the threshold of 130 kt (240 km/h, 150 mph). Three hours later the JMA estimated Yancy to have peaked in strength with ten-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925 mbar (hPa; 27.32 inHg); this intensity would be held for the following 18 hours.|$|R
