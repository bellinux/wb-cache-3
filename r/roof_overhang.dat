50|$|The City of Vancouver, {{the largest}} city in British Columbia, had also changed its Zoning By-Law to include <b>roof</b> <b>overhangs</b> {{in the amount of}} {{permitted}} (buildable and salable) floor area, known as floor space ratio or FSR. <b>Roof</b> <b>overhangs</b> were included in the calculation of FSR, and as this reduced the amount of permitted floor space, they were often removed from designs. The calculation of FSR from the outside of the building envelope, instead of from the centre or interior side of the wall, also tended to promote thinner walls and rainscreen systems. Open, uncovered walkways were excluded from the FSR, thus encouraging their inclusion in the design.|$|R
50|$|The Red Butte {{tower is}} {{listed on the}} National Historic Lookout Register. Its design {{is based on the}} USFS CL 100 plan with modifications.

40|$|Architectural {{modifications}} to an existing tropical obstetric ward involved {{extension of the}} <b>roof</b> <b>overhangs</b> to a width of several metres. These extensions excluded most of the daylight from the ward. An alarming increase {{in the incidence of}} jaundice (bilirubin concentration {{greater than or equal to}} 240 mumol/l (greater than or equal to 14 mg/ 100 ml] from 0. 5 % to 17 % in newborn infants occurred after the modifications. Tropical obstetric wards and nurseries should continue to be built with windows facing north-south for coolness. They should, however, have as many windows as possible and the <b>roof</b> <b>overhangs</b> should be limited to about 1 m to allow adequate indirect sunlight to enter, giving a high intensity of illumination, and help prevent neonatal jaundice...|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the Toluca Lake Bob's {{represents}} a distinct period in the region's architectural history, a style {{often referred to as}} Googie architecture.

The large front window, the street awning, and ventilation {{at the top of}} the walls also reflect the design of butcher shops of the period. The large <b>roof</b> <b>overhang</b> above the front section also appears to be an attempt to reduce the temperature within the shop.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{both the}} {{northern}} and southern facades of the buildings are three similar window openings. The porch, which is reached on three open tread timber steps on the southern facade comprises a gabled awning projecting from the extended <b>roof</b> <b>overhang.</b> This is supported on timber columns with a timber lintel spanning the distance between the columns, carved with [...] "VICTORIA 1901 CHAPEL". A bell hangs within the gable of the porch.|$|E
50|$|Most {{commonly}} seen on historic folk houses, {{the rain}} porch {{also came to}} be adapted to the monumental porticoes of some Greek Revival mansions, such as Rosemount and Kirkwood. The overhang became especially exaggerated in some areas with copious amounts of rainfall, such as the Eastern Shore of Mobile Bay in Alabama. Here the <b>roof</b> <b>overhang</b> ranged between 3 and 6 ft beyond the porch deck, in effect creating a lower and upper porch.|$|E
50|$|The building, a one-story {{rectangular}} {{brick building}} with a gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles, was constructed in 1875. It is pierced at the east (front) end by a square frame bell tower with paired arched louvered vents on all four sides.

2500|$|The West Building {{is a low}} {{structure}} that flanks 10th Street to the west. Due to the raised esplanade, {{it appears to be}} a single-story building on the east.

At {{the north and south}} ends of the building, the canopy terminates as a hip <b>roof.</b> The <b>roof</b> <b>overhangs</b> the east and west ends of the building, which provided passengers with shade from the sun and shelter from the rain.|$|R
5000|$|The {{foundations}} and exterior walls are {{of three and}} four course brick. The large, open porch is on the front. The deck is supported by brick piers with a centrally located concrete stoop and steps with wrought iron railings. The porch has a flat roof supported by six square, beveledged wood columns. Carved wooden, scrolled knee braces support a <b>roof</b> <b>overhang</b> [...] Spaces between the porch's supporting piers below are closed with wood lattice work.|$|E
50|$|The {{walls of}} a cob house are {{generally}} about 24 in thick, and windows were correspondingly deep-set, giving the homes a characteristic internal appearance. The thick walls provided excellent thermal mass which was easy to keep warm in winter and cool in summer. Walls with a high thermal mass value act as a thermal buffer inside the home.The material has a long life-span even in rainy and/or humid climates, provided a tall foundation and large <b>roof</b> <b>overhang</b> are present.|$|E
