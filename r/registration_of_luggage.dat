50|$|His {{research}} on theft <b>of</b> <b>luggage</b> covered all three aspects of general deterrence: a) probability of sanctions, i.e. perceived certainty of arrest (due to extra police vigilance) b) celerity of sanctions and c) severity of sanctions (the potentially lethal effects of stealing a piece <b>of</b> <b>luggage</b> containing explosives). The analysis of his {{data showed that}} in the periods immediately following a terrorist incident there was a sharp, if short lived, {{decline in the number}} <b>of</b> cases <b>of</b> <b>luggage</b> theft. This indicates that either police vigilance or the fear that the items may contain explosives have had a deterrent effect.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{transport}} <b>of</b> <b>luggage</b> units {{between the}} check-in terminal and airplanes is realized {{by the use}} of very simple transport solutions and manual reloading <b>of</b> the <b>luggage.</b> The luggage trolleys are used for the transport purposes, which are hitched to the mover and moved directly to the surroundings of the airplane. The loading and unloading <b>of</b> <b>luggage</b> is performed manually. Regarding actual safety requirements there was a need to create a new transport system, working in a closed cycle and based on the device for automatic loading and unloading <b>of</b> <b>luggage</b> units. 	Methods: Various potential variants of the device were generated based on results of analytical researches {{by the use of}} the morphological schema. The detail evaluation and the optimization of individual variants allow to prepare the concept of the complex method to solve problems of the reliable transport <b>of</b> <b>luggage</b> units within an airport. 	Results: The closed transport system was created {{as a result of the}} innovative project. The main element of this system is a container trolley, which is equipped in five storage layers. By the use of the special mover and gravitational forces, luggage units can be transported and placed inside this trolley as well as being loaded and unloaded. This solution enables to move 200 pieces <b>of</b> <b>luggage</b> in one transport cycle from the check-in terminal to the hatchway of the airplane...|$|R

30|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is as follows. First, this paper proposes the foreground-mask sampling to localize the candidates <b>of</b> abandoned <b>luggage</b> items by calculating the intersection of a number of background-subtracted frames which are sampled over a period <b>of</b> time. Abandoned <b>luggage</b> items are assumed to be static foreground objects, and thus appear in this intersection. Since this approach requires no prior learning <b>of</b> <b>luggage</b> appearance in any form, <b>luggage</b> <b>of</b> all shapes, sizes, orientations, viewing angles and colors can be successfully localized without the need for training data and associated constraints.|$|R
