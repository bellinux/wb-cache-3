40|$|My thesis "The Parents' view on {{the current}} {{problems}} of pre-school care", focuses {{on the problem of}} raising number of unsatisfied applications of placing children in the kindergartens. It deals also with the problems with joint of parents' careers and family life, which are caused by refused applications of placing. Year by year there is raising excess demand. The pre-school care established by state is a tool which helps parents to harmonize their work and family role. It has been done a research using a method of semi-structured interviews with parents of children at the pre-school age and with headmasters of public kindergartens. It has been recognized two main reasons why parents prefer the placement in the public kindergartens to other alternatives of pre-school care. The main reasons were child's socialization in a group and financial accessibility for parents. The alternatives of pre-school care were not preferred among parents, because they are expensive and parents mostly don't trust them. Because of <b>refused</b> <b>application</b> they stayed at home with child, they did not return to their work. It has been identified problematic areas which are connected with (un) placing a child in the kindergarten, those are criteria of admission and overfull classes. The overfull classes don't enable the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Division S- 6 — NotesOrganic <b>refuse</b> <b>application</b> to soil {{may improve}} soil {{structure}} and thus soil quality and productivity. Two semiarid, structureless soils with < 10 g kg- 1 organic C (OC), differing in clay mineralogy, were amended annually at rates of 30 g kg- 1 fresh or composted refuse {{to a total}} of 60 g kg- 1 in a greenhouse experiment lasting 2 yr. Fresh refuse additions significantly increased the soil aggregate stability in water by 17 %. Composted <b>refuse</b> <b>application</b> only increased aggregate stability in the beidellitic clay-dominated soil (13 %). In both soils, the greatest increase in OC and humin following refuse additions occurred in the fine silt fraction, which contained less decomposed organic matter than the clay fraction. In the beidellitic clay soil, this increase in OC was larger than in the illitic clay soil. The aggregate stability of the beidellitic clay soil was significantly correlated with OC and humin of fine silt fraction. F.

5000|$|Texas is {{an unusual}} {{exception}} to the rule that denial of certiorari by the state supreme court normally does not imply approval or disapproval of the merits of the lower court's decision. In March 1927, the Texas Legislature enacted a law directing the Texas Supreme Court to summarily <b>refuse</b> to hear <b>applications</b> for writs of error when it believed the Court of Appeals opinion correctly stated the law. Thus, since June 1927, over 4,100 decisions of the Texas Courts of Appeals have become valid binding precedent of the Texas Supreme Court itself because the high court <b>refused</b> <b>applications</b> for writ of error rather than denying them and thereby signaled that it approved of their holdings as the law of the state.|$|R
