40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> on the frequency behavior of the two oscillators in the SOA- 3 micromechanical accelerometer. It also investigates the possible effect of the input acceleration on the degree of this <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling.</b> A sensitivity study is also done to assess the dependence of the degree of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> on the geometry of the beams that form the proof mass support system. By doing a modal analysis using both a Finite Element and a mass-spring model of the accelerometer, it is shown that <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> does exist between the two oscillators, and {{is a function of the}} input acceleration on the device. It is also shown that the effects of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> on the frequencies of the oscillators are the greatest at the input acceleration where the oscillator's frequencies, if completely uncoupled, would approach the same value. Finally, several design changes are suggested that reduce the amount of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> between the oscillators. by Kara Susanne Meredith. Thesis (S. M. and S. B.)

The method has been utilized {{to analyze the}} metal cylindrical transducer and the axially polarized piezoelectric cylindrical transducer. In this method, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> coefficient is introduced and defined as the stress ratio in different directions.

Moreover, we have shown that this entanglement dynamics is strongly related to the stability of the normal modes. Taking mechanical damping effects into account, an analytical expression corresponding to the critical <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> strength, where the transition from stationary to dynamical entanglement occurs is also reported. The proposed scheme is analysed with experimentally realistic parameters, making it a promising mean to realize macroscopic quantum entanglement within current state-of-the-art experimental setups...|$|R

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{response of}} a piezoelectric thick axisymmetric hollow cylinder in plane strain under boundary stochastic excitations is analyzed and calculated. The stochastic stress and electric-potential boundary {{conditions of the}} piezoelectric hollow cylinder are converted into homogeneous boundary conditions by transformations that yields the electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> partial differential equations of motion with damping and stochastic excitations. The equation for electric potential is integrated radially to obtain the electric potential {{as a function of}} displacement, and the displacement is expanded as a series in terms of the Legendre polynomials. The partial differential equation for displacement is further converted into ordinary differential equations by using the Galerkin method, which represent a stochastic multi-degree-of-freedom system with asymmetric stiffness matrix due to the asymmetric electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> and the transformed boundary conditions. The frequency-response function matrix and correlation function matrix of the system response are derived from these equations based on the theory of random vibration. The expressions of mean-square displacement and electric potential of the piezoelectric hollow cylinder are finally obtained and illustrated by numerical results for non-white stochastic excitations.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we discuss}} the low-frequency range of the Raman {{spectrum}} of individual suspended index-identified single-walled (SWCNTs) and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). In SWCNTs, the role of environment on the radial breathing mode (RBM) frequency is discussed. We show that {{the interaction between the}} surrounding air and the nanotube does not induce a RBM upshift. In several DWCNTs, we evidence that the low-frequency modes cannot be connected to the RBM of each related layer. We discuss this result in terms of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> between the layers which results in collective radial breathing-like modes.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{technique for}} {{the prediction of}} fan blade flutter was evaluated by utilizing first stage fan flutter data from tests on an advanced high performance engine. The formulation includes both aerodynamic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> among all the blades of the assembly. Mistuning is accounted for in the analysis so that individual blade inertias, frequencies, or damping can be considered. Airfoil stability was predicted by calculating a flutter determinant, the eigenvalues of which indicate the extent of susceptibility to flutter. When blade to blade differences in frequencies are considered, a stable system is predicted for the test points examined. For a tuned system, {{it was found that}} torsional flutter can be predicted at a limited number of interblade phase angles. Examination of these phase angles indicated that they were "close" to the condition of acoustic resonance. For the range of Mach numbers and reduced frequencies considered, the so called subcritical flutter cannot be predicted. The essential influence of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> among the blades is to change the frequencies of the system with little or no change in damping; however, aerodynamic <b>coupling</b> together with <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> could change not only frequencies, but also damping in the system, with a trend toward instability...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{functions}} and <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> of cells must be integrated throughout development. A striking {{example of this}} coupling is the interactions of body wall muscle and hypodermal cells in Caenorhabditis elegans. These tissues are intimately associated in development and their interactions generate structures that provide a continuous mechanical link to transmit muscle forces across the hypodermis to the cuticle. Previously, we established that mup- 4 is essential in embryonic epithelial (hypodermal) morphogenesis and maintenance of muscle position. Here, we report that mup- 4 encodes a novel transmembrane protein that is required for attachments between the apical epithelial surface and the cuticular matrix. Its extracellular domain includes epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a von Willebrand factor A domain, and two sea urchin enterokinase modules. Its intracellular domain is homologous to filaggrin, an intermediate filament (IF) -associated protein that regulates IF compaction and that has not previously been reported {{as part of a}} junctional complex. MUP- 4 colocalizes with epithelial hemidesmosomes overlying body wall muscles, beginning at the time of embryonic cuticle maturation, as well as with other sites of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling.</b> These findings support that MUP- 4 is a junctional protein that functions in IF tethering, cell–matrix adherence, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> of tissues...|$|R

40|$|Subduction {{zones are}} complex 3 -D {{features}} {{in which one}} tectonic plate sinks underneath another into the deep mantle. During subduction the overriding plate (OP) remains in physical contact with the subducting plate and stresses generated at the subduction zone interface and by mantle flowforce the OP to deform. We present results of 3 -D dynamic laboratory models of subduction that include an OP. We introduce newinterplate materials comprising homogeneous mixtures of petrolatum and paraffin oil to achieve progressive subduction. The rheology of these mixtures is characterized by measurements using a strain rate controlled rheometer. The {{results show that the}} strength of the mixture increases with petrolatum content, which {{can be used as a}} proxy for the degree of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> along the subduction interface. Results of subduction experiments are presented with different degrees of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> and the influence this has on the dynamics and kinematics of subduction. The modelling results show that variations in the degree of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> between the plates have a major impact on subduction velocities, slab geometry and the rate of OP deformation. In all experiments the OP is displaced following trench migration and experiences overall extension localized in the plate interior. This suggests that OP deformation is driven primarily by the toroidal component of subduction-related mantle return flow. The subduction rate is always very slow in experiments with medium <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling,</b> and subduction stops prematurely in experiments with very high coupling. This implies that the shear forces along the plate interface in natural subduction zone systems must be relatively low and do not vary significantly. Otherwise a higher variability in natural subduction velocities should be observed for mature, nonperturbed subduction zones. The required low shear force is likely controlled by the rheology of highly hydrated sedimentary and basaltic rocks...|$|R

The improved micro-gyroscope structure decreases the moment arm of the drive decoupled torque, which benefits the suppression of the non-ideal decoupled error. Quadrature correction electrodes are added to eliminate the residual quadrature error. The structure principle and the quadrature error suppression means of the DDMG are described in detail. ANSYS software is used to simulate the micro-gyroscope structure to verify the <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> error suppression effect.
