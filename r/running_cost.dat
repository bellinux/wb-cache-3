5|$|Howe cabled Anderson {{expressing the}} Canadian government's {{agreement}} in principle, but requesting {{a more detailed}} appraisal {{of the cost of}} the proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed that it would be run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through the NRC, with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.|$|E
5|$|The house {{remained}} in the Portman family until 1944 when it was accepted in lieu of death duties by the Crown Estate, however Mrs Portman remained at the house until her death in 1951. It was leased to the fire service in 1953. A visitor centre opened in the Victorian stables in 2005. Most {{of the cost of}} the conversion was funded by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The house was used as the Emergency Call Centre for the Somerset Area of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service with a <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> in 2011 of £675,000 per year. The fire service moved out in 2012 and restoration work was then undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} no records as to the designs of the early steam engines {{produced}} by the Mars Works, Evans's most famous engine design appeared around 1812. Called the Columbian Engine as a patriotic gesture, it {{would prove to be}} the most advanced and successful steam engine design created by Evans—he brought to bear his now extensive experience in designing and building high-pressure steam engines. This horizontally oriented engine allowed the crankshaft and piston rod to work closely together {{at one end of the}} machine, thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines. The piston rod itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar. This linkage is still known as the Evans straight-line linkage, though it was superseded within a few years by more precise straight line mechanisms. The Columbian was also the culmination of the grasshopper-style of steam engine. Perfected designs like the Columbian saw a popularization of the grasshopper-style and its wide use in a range of applications. In 1813 he made the decision to introduce a condenser to the Columbian design. This significantly cut the <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> to the engine, and at this point his engines were as efficient and powerful as low-pressure Watt-Boulton designs, yet far cheaper to build and smaller in size. Within a year 27 Columbian engines were operating or under construction in applications ranging from sawmilling and grain milling to the manufacturing of paper, wire and wool.|$|E

Using the model to estimate the <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> for each grid.

25|$|Because of {{the power}} that would be lost, {{resistors}} are not used as ballasts for lamps of more than about two watts. Instead, a reactance is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its magnetic core may be significant, {{on the order of}} 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations must allow for ballast loss in estimating the <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> of a lighting installation.|$|E
25|$|Simple-cycle or {{open cycle}} gas turbine plants, without a steam cycle, are {{sometimes}} installed as emergency or peaking capacity; their thermal efficiency is much lower. The high <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> per hour is {{offset by the}} low capital cost and the intention to run such units {{only a few hundred}} hours per year. Other gas turbine plants are installed in stages, with an open cycle gas turbine the first stage and additional turbines or conversion to a closed cycle part of future project plans.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid (or twin source) heat pumps: when {{outdoor air}} is above 4 to 8 Celsius, (40-50 Fahrenheit, {{depending}} on ground water temperature) they use air; when air is colder, {{they use the}} ground source. These twin source systems can also store summer heat, by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger, even when the heat pump itself is not running. This has dual advantage: it functions as a low <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> for air cooling, and (if ground water is relatively stagnant) it cranks up {{the temperature of the}} ground source, which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4% for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source.|$|E

40|$|The Building Maintenance Cost Information Service (BMCIS) {{offers a}} {{comprehensive}} and rigorous framework {{for collecting data}} about the <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> of buildings. Nevertheless, it is pitched at such a level of detail {{that the amount of}} data collected and analysed may be constrained. This paper describes the deveopment and testing of a novel technique which reduces the amount of data to be collected without any unacceptable reduction in utility. It draws on the principle of cost-significance to create a simple model of maintenance and operating <b>costs</b> (together called <b>running</b> <b>costs)</b> from a rare and consistent set of data for 20 buildings at York University. The model contains only 11 elements, yet can predict the total <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> of each of four categories of building to an accuracy of about 21 2 %. It can also predict annual costs to about 7 %, despite variations in the periodicity of costs such as painting and insurance. The model was tested using the jacknife method and on virgin data. It proved to be extremely robust, predicting the <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> of 12 new buildings to within 5 %. The model offers a simple framework for collecting and analysing reliable and consistent data on <b>running</b> <b>costs.</b> Life Cycle Costs, Maintenance Costs, Operating Costs, Cost-significance,...|$|R
