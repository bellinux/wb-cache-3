5|$|White roofs: Painting rooftops {{white has}} become a common {{strategy}} to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> island effect. In cities, there are many dark colored surfaces that absorb {{the heat of the}} sun in turn lowering the albedo of the city. White rooftops allow high solar reflectance and high solar emittance, increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring.|$|E

25|$|Victoria's southernmost {{position}} on the Australian mainland means it is cooler and wetter than other mainland states and territories. The coastal plain south of the Great Dividing Range has Victoria's mildest climate. Air from the Southern Ocean helps <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of summer and the cold of winter. Melbourne and other large cities are located in this temperate region.|$|E
25|$|One {{simple way}} to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of {{decanting}} is to open valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops {{are present in the}} pipe-work to reduce vibration.|$|E

5|$|One drive uses a default {{switching}} frequency setting of 4kHz. <b>Reducing</b> <b>the</b> drive’s {{switching frequency}} (<b>the</b> carrier-frequency) <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> generated by <b>the</b> IGBTs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> {{output of}} <b>the</b> {{computer}} helps <b>reduce</b> noise, since fans {{do not have}} to spin as fast to cool <b>the</b> computer. <b>Reduced</b> <b>heat</b> and resulting lower cooling demands may increase computer reliability.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{control is}} <b>the</b> {{practice}} of <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> output of a fire, <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> area {{over which the}} fire exists, or suppressing or extinguishing the fire by depriving it of fuel, oxygen, or heat (see fire triangle).|$|R
25|$|Besides {{treating}} the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and fouling, the water should be filtered to remove particulates, and also be dosed with biocides and algaecides to prevent growths that could {{interfere with the}} continuous flow of the water. Under certain conditions, a biofilm of micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water, and can <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transfer efficiency of the cooling tower. Biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using chlorine or other chemicals. A normal industrial practice is to use two biocides, such as oxidizing and non-oxidizing types to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack. In most cases, a continual low level oxidizing biocide is used, then alternating to a periodic shock dose of non-oxidizing biocides.|$|E
25|$|The thermal {{properties}} of cryospheric elements also have important climatic consequences. Snow and ice have much lower thermal diffusivities than air. Thermal diffusivity {{is a measure}} of the speed at which temperature waves can penetrate a substance. Snow and ice are many orders of magnitude less efficient at diffusing heat than air. Snow cover insulates the ground surface, and sea ice insulates the underlying ocean, decoupling the surface-atmosphere interface with respect to both heat and moisture fluxes. The flux of moisture from a water surface is eliminated by even a thin skin of ice, whereas the flux of heat through thin ice continues to be substantial until it attains a thickness in excess of 30 to 40cm. However, even a small amount of snow on top of the ice will dramatically <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> flux and slow down the rate of ice growth. The insulating effect of snow also has major implications for the hydrological cycle. In non-permafrost regions, the insulating effect of snow is such that only near-surface ground freezes and deep-water drainage is uninterrupted.|$|E
500|$|Voluntary green {{building}} {{programs have been}} promoting the mitigation of the heat island effect for years. For example, {{one of the ways}} for a site to earn points under the US Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System is to take action that reduces heat islands, minimizing impacts on microclimates and human and wildlife habitats. Credits associated with reflective roofing or planted roofs can help a building achieve LEED certification. Buildings also receive credits by providing shade. Similarly, The [...] (GBI)'s Green Globes program awards points to sites that take measures to decrease a building's energy consumption and <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> island effect. As many as 10 points may be awarded to sites with roof coverage from vegetation, highly reflective materials, or a combination of the two.|$|E
5000|$|Isothermalize {{a natural}} {{convection}} heat sink, increasing its efficiency and reducing its size. In one case, adding five <b>heat</b> pipes <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink mass by 34%, from 4.4 kg to 2.9 kg.|$|R
50|$|Storm windows {{can be very}} cost-effective, in cold climates. They are inexpensive, and {{can reduce}} heat loss by up to 50% or so, {{increasing}} the building’s comfort and <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> costs, which is difficult to achieve with inexpensive replacement windows.|$|R
30|$|Compared with <b>the</b> {{traditional}} <b>heating</b> method, <b>the</b> {{method of}} <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> surface {{temperature of the}} roll with <b>the</b> fluid <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> time, and <b>the</b> temperature distribution of the roll surface was more uniform. However, the temperature difference between import and export was bigger. The lager the velocity, <b>the</b> faster <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transfer, but <b>the</b> rate of increase decreased.|$|R
2500|$|An HVLS fan ("HVLS" [...] {{stands for}} [...] "High-Volume-Low-Speed") {{is a type}} of {{rotational}} mechanical fan that moves large amounts of circulating air. In addition, HVLS fans {{have been found to be}} more beneficial than traditional HVAC fans as they are more cost effective as well as having a stronger cooling effect while helping to maintain a constant temperature and humidity. Using 10 overhead airfoil blades in a barn, the HVLS fan was invented in 1998 by Walter Boyd who was challenged to find a better means to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> stress of dairy cattle which in turn, would increase milk production.|$|E

30|$|The {{increase}} in the breathability and reduction of overall weight of the FFPPC without compromising the protection can help to overcome heat stress. Regular breaks from work (away from heat source) and adequate hydration can also help in <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> stress.|$|R
50|$|Another {{practice}} is {{to mount a}} thermal feedback sensing transistor or other device on <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink, to control the crossover bias voltage. As <b>the</b> output transistors <b>heat</b> up, so does the thermal feedback transistor. This in turn causes the thermal feedback transistor to turn on at a slightly lower voltage, <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> crossover bias voltage, and so <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> dissipated by <b>the</b> output transistors.|$|R
