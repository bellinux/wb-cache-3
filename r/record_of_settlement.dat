50|$|The next <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in Scilly Cove (Winterton) {{is found}} in the 1697 journal of Jean Baudoin, a priest who {{accompanied}} d'Iberville on his expedition around the coast of Newfoundland.

50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in the Bellshill area is {{a village}} called Belmill, recorded on a map by Timothy Pont published in 1654. The village consisted of a row of quarry workers' houses owned by Mr. Bell, who owned a stone quarry {{to the south of}} Belmill. After the quarry closed, the village disappeared and a settlement developed nearby called Crossgates. About 1810, this new settlement took on the name Bellshill and continued to grow absorbing nearby villages such as Black Moss, Sykehead and Nesnas.|$|E

The early inhabitants included the Waccamaw people, who {{took advantage of the}} natural resources provided by the creeks and rivers. Wachesaw is loosely translated as [...] "Place of Great Weeping", in reference to the burial grounds. Indian burial mounds have been found along the high bluffs at Wachesaw that contained European beads, urns and other artifacts.|$|E
50|$|The area {{encompassing}} Logy Bay-Middle Cove-Outer Cove {{was within}} the boundaries of lands granted to the London and Bristol Company in 1610. In 1627, the company experienced financial difficulties and evidently made lands available to private groups. The name Logy Bay itself first appears on Southwood's map of = 1675, however, permanent settlement did not begin until the early 19th century. The earliest <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in Logy Bay is from 1818 when Luke Ryan, a fisherman, sought permission to build a fishing room. The earliest records of settlement in Outer Cove and Middle Cove appear around 1827, but occupation here most likely predated this year.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> at Virgin Arm is from Lovell's Newfoundland Directory (1871), which {{identifies}} fisherman John Smith as {{a resident}} and notes {{a population of}} 10 people. However, Smith appeared in the subsequent records, while Virgin Arm was not enumerated separately in the Census until 1901 (pop. 70). Locally, the first settler {{is said to have}} been a Curtis, of Snellings Cove, Twillingate. William Curtis was resident by 1876, and by 1882 had been joined by John Hicks and a family named Nicholas, also of Twillingate. At about the turn of the 20th century several other families settled: Burt's (from Tizzard's Harbour),Gleason's, Hann's, Ings' and Price's.|$|E
50|$|The {{town had}} a {{population}} of 518 in the Canada 2006 Census. The first <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> is found in Captain John Berry's Report to the British Admiralty in which he indicates that, in 1675, there were three fishing enterprises. These fishing crews departed from the West Country of England, probably {{from the city of}} Poole in Dorset, in the early spring of each year to fish in waters near the coast; the fish would be salted and dried in structures along the shore known as stages and flakes and shipped to England in the Fall. The three fishing Captains were Hopkins, Wicksell and Peyton who, along with their crews, comprised {{a population of}} less than 100.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in the Riversdale {{area was}} in the 1890s, when the area was homesteaded. It was dubbed [...] "Richville" [...] {{after one of the}} {{original}} settlers. In April 1903, over 1500 Barr Colonists arrived and made camp just west of the railway tracks beside Saskatoon. While most of the colonists moved on to the Lloydminster area, some remained behind as permanent residents of a new settlement. The village of Riversdale was incorporated on January 16, 1905. The village plan (originally called [...] "Riverdale") had narrower streets, smaller lots, and no public reserve land. Faced with a heavy influx of settlers, Riversdale joined with the towns of Saskatoon and Nutana to become the City of Saskatoon on July 1, 1906.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to January 1, 1898 Avondale {{was known}} as Salmon Cove but was renamed to avoid {{confusion}} with two other nearby communities {{of the same name}} in the Port de Grave and Brigus Districts. The name Avondale was suggested by the parish priest Rev John Roe because of the resemblance to his native area in Ireland, taking the name from Thomas Moore's poem, [...] "The Meeting of the Waters". Earliest <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> per Fishing Room Grants is for John Mahaney in 1773, a census of 1812 reports 12 inhabitants. Settlers to the area were primarily Irish Roman Catholic with a smaller number of Jersey French and English.

40|$|Archaeological data {{tend to be}} {{gathered}} at the local level: human agency also operates at this scale. By combining data from multiple surveys conducted within a larger area, {{it is possible to}} use local datasets to obtain a perspective on regional trends in settlement, population, and human activity. Here we employ data derived from nine archaeological surveys in the northern and western regions of the Fertile Crescent (west and north Syria, SE Turkey, and northern Iraq) to show how local trends aggregate to create a general proxy <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> and regional population. In addition, we use geoarchaeological data from a region extending from Homs in the west to northern Iraq in the east to outline historical trends in alluvial fill development. Both settlement and alluviation trends are then related to palaeoclimate proxy data from Soreq Cave and Lake Van. Settlement, geoarchaeological signatures and climate are then examined side by side in order to assess long-term human interactions...|$|E
40|$|This Paper {{contains}} {{a review of}} the burgeoning research that has been designed to shed light on how the art auction system actually works and what it indicates about price formation. First, we find that in recent years returns on art assets appear to be little different from returns on other assets. In addition, some researchers have found that because of the weak correlation between art asset returns with other returns, there may be a case for the inclusion of art assets in a diversified portfolio. Second, we find evidence of several anomalies in art market pricing. The evidence clearly suggests that, contrary to the view of the art trade, ‘masterpieces’ underperform the market. In addition, there is considerable evidence that there are fairly long periods in which art prices may diverge across geographic areas and even auction houses. Third, we review the public record of the criminal trial of Sotheby’s former Chairman, who was accused of price fixing, to show how the collusion with Christie’s, the other great public auction house, was actually engineered. Contrary to the way the proceeds from the settlement of the civil suit in this case were distributed, we show that buyers were almost certainly not injured by the collusion, but that sellers were. In addition, based on the public <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement,</b> it appears that the plaintiffs in the civil suit were very handsomely repaid for their injury. Finally, we review the extensive research on the effects of the auction institution on price formation. There is now considerable theoretical research on strategic behavior in auctions, much of it in response to empirical findings, and we review three key findings. First, the evidence suggests that art experts provide extremely accurate predictions of market prices, but that these predictions do not optimally process the publicly available information. Second, high reserve prices, and the resulting high unsold (‘buy- in’) rates are best explained as optimal search in the face of stochastic demand. Third, extensive research has documented that the prices of identical objects are more likely to decline than to increase when multiple units are sold, and this has led to considerable theoretical research. Subsequent empirical research has tended to document declining demand prices even when the objects are imperfect substitutes. art; asset returns; auctions; price anomalies; price-fixing...|$|E
