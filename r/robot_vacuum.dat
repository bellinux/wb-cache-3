5000|$|The comic {{centers around}} an unnamed police officer whose partner is a {{specially}} trained police dog named Greg. The duo are professionals at catching criminals. One day, the cop and Greg spot a bomb, but they arrive {{too late to}} defuse it. The duo is critically injured by the bomb's explosion and are taken to the hospital. The doctor announces that Greg's body is dying and the Cop's head is dying. Fortunately, the nurse has a great idea: the surgical crew will cut off Greg's head and sew it on the Cop's body. The doctor accepts the idea and the hospital crew hold a big operation. The operation is successful and everyone calls the new dog/man hybrid [...] "Dog Man." [...] Dog Man catches criminals with his sensitive nose, hears crimes with his ears, and punches criminals with his fists. But Dog Man has one mortal fear: vacuum cleaners. Petey (of The Adventures of Super Diaper Baby 2), Rip Van Tinkle's former feline minion, sees Dog Man's weakness so he invents an evil <b>vacuum</b> <b>robot.</b> The <b>vacuum</b> <b>robot</b> steals all {{the money from the}} bank and Dog Man comes to stop it but the vacuum chases him.

Dog Man then destroys the robot and follows the robot's cord, which leads to Petey's hideout and Dog Man arrests him. Dog Man celebrates his victory by drinking some alcohol-free wine with his fellow cops. This comic was then made into a book in 2016 with lots of other Dog Man comics, with a sequel planned to come out either that same year or in 2017.|$|R

The goal of the research was to find a method of generating guidelines for the design of a technology to improve the diffusion of that technology in society. Aesthetic theories were generated by comparison of factors with historic precedents (the automobile, the television and the personal computer) The theories were then tested for the design of a social companion <b>robot</b> and a <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>robot.</b> From these two design cases it became apparent that the acceptance of both devices can be improved by, respectively, improving their conformity to contemporary design (the social companion robot), or improving their conformity to contemporary philosophy of technology (the <b>vacuum</b> <b>robot)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|This {{fresh start}} will be exactly that… on January 3rd 2011, Skip will meet Bleeker {{for the first}} time.

40|$|The duct of a <b>robot</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner is {{the length}} of the flow channel between the inlet of the rolling brush blower and the outlet of the vacuum blower. To cope with the {{pressure}} drop problem of the duct flow field in a <b>robot</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner, a method based on Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators (PRISO) algorithm is introduced and the optimisation design of the duct flow field is implemented. Firstly, the duct structure in a <b>robot</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner is taken as a research object, with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) theories adopted; a three&# 8208;dimensional fluid model of the duct is established by means of the FLUENT solver of the CFD software. Secondly, with the k&# 8208;&# 949; turbulence model of three&# 8208; dimensional incompressible fluid considered and the PRISO pressure modification algorithm employed, the flow field numerical simulations inside the duct of the <b>robot</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner are carried out. Then, the velocity vector plots on the arbitrary plane of the duct flow field are obtained. Finally, an investigation of the dynamic characteristics of the duct flow field is done and defects of the original duct flow field are analysed, the optimisation of the original flow field has then been conducted. Experimental results show that the duct flow field after optimisation can effectively reduce pressure drop, the feasibility as well as the correctness of the theoretical modelling and optimisation approaches are validated...|$|E

From agent software that collects news for us or bids for us in online auctions to <b>robots</b> that <b>vacuum</b> our floors and may help care for us when we grow old, autonomous agents promise to play {{a greater role in}} our lives in the future. Yet, there is ample evidence that many people do not trust autonomous systems – especially in environments where human lives may be put at risk. Examples include search-and-rescue operations at disaster sites, military operations in a combat zone, and caregiving scenarios where a human’s life depends on the care given by an autonomous system. This paper uses previous work on trust in multi-agent systems as a basis for examining the factors that influence the trust humans have in autonomous systems. Some of the technical and ethical implications of relying on autonomous systems (especially in combat areas) are considered. Some preliminary results from a simulation of a firefighting scenario where humans may need to rely upon robots are used to explore the effects of the different factors of human trust.

In the previous prototype to the ELIXYS [21], the cassettes each had multiple inputs on their bottom surface for inert gas and vacuum that mated with corresponding ports on the synthesizer.

With a single, movable gas supplying robot in ELIXYS, a large number of valves and seals are eliminated, increasing the reliability of the system.
