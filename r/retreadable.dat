40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} a new type of terminating Markov renewal process D(α, β, κ) in view of application to replacement problems. The dynamical sojourn probability and the renewal function of each Markov state, the time τ till termination, the distribution and moments of τ are calculated for this type terminating process in order to apply it to a lifetime model of replacement parts, such as <b>retreadable</b> tires fitted to trucks...|$|E
