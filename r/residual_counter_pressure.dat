In the proposed process, the interlock was increased by the increment of metal flow with the <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> of rubber disk in the die cavity.

40|$|DE 102008004139 B 3 UPAB: 20090619 NOVELTY - The device (100) has a {{pressure}} difference forming device i. e. valveless pump, which forms {{a pressure}} difference (8) in a channel (6), to move liquid (2) {{in a direction}} (1 a) over a pre-determined surface (4) of a channel wall until a pre-determined time, for reducing the developed pressure difference at the pre-determined time. The channel is designed {{in such a manner}} that a <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> difference opposite to the pressure difference is produced, where the <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> difference moves the liquid in a direction (1 b) over the pre-determined surface.

40|$|A {{membrane}} can {{be represented}} by an energy landscape that solutes or colloids must cross. A model accounting for the momentum and the mass balances on the membrane energy landscape establishes {{a new way of}} writing for the Darcy law. The <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> in the Darcy law is no longer written as the result of an osmotic pressure difference but rather as a function of colloid-membrane interactions. Physically, the colloid-membrane interactions are slowing down the colloid velocity thus inducing a relative fluid-colloid motion that in turn leads to the <b>counter</b> <b>pressure.</b> The ability of the model to describe the physics of the filtration is discussed in detail. This model is solved on a simplified energy landscape to derive analytical relationships that describe the selectivity and the <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> from ab-initio operating conditions. The model shows that the stiffness of the energy landscape has an impact on the process efficiency: a gradual increase in interactions (like with hourglass pore shape) can reduce the separation energetic cost. It allows the introduction of a new paradigm to increase membrane efficiency: the accumulation that is inherent to the separation must be distributed across the membrane...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Owing to fluid pressure, the {{unsupported}} blank {{between the}} punch and the drawing ring is bulged {{in the direction}} opposite to the punch movement. The blank is thus drawn over a fluid cushion and does not contact the drawing ring profile radius. The bulge is hence advanta-geous for ensuring class A surface quality of the workpiece. The blank is stretched bi-axially in the bulged region owing to the acting fluid pressure. This can result in blank fracture at high-fluid <b>counter</b> <b>pressures.</b> High-fluid <b>counter</b> <b>pressures</b> are, however, necessary to achieve higher geometrical accuracies and lower springback. High pressure {{can also be used}} to transfer small contours from the punch to the drawn cup. A high-pressure die set for hydraulic bulging has been designed in order to emulate the bulge formation in hydromechanical deep drawing. A series of experiments have been carried out in order to determine the limiting bulge height for different sheet materials. Different punch diameters have been used to determine the influ-ence of drawing clearance on the limiting bulge height. The effect of fluid pressure on the smallest transferable radius has also been investigated. Results thus obtained can be used in determining the dedicated optimal <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> curve for a given workpiece geometry, material, and die set combination in order to design a robust computer-aided engineering (CAE) chain for the hydromechanical deep drawing process. Selected representative experi-mental results for hydromechanical deep drawing of complex part geometries have been shown. The <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> curve for hydromechanical deep drawing of the shown cups was selected in conformance to the allowable bulge height for the considered instantaneous sheet material, part shape, and process parameter combination...|$|R

5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|R
