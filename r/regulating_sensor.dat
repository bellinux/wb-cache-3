For example, Wang et al. proposed using a linguistic model to infer which word a user types on a standard keyboard according to the accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from the user’s smartwatch (Wang et al. 2015). A limitation of this solution is that it cannot deal with non-contextual inputs such as passwords and PINs, which are not covered by a linguistic model. Liu et al. proposed another solution that makes use of the sensors in smartwatches, including accelerometer and microphone, to infer users’ inputs on keyboards or POS terminals (Liu et al. 2015). Their solution is based on a machine-learning classifier which should be trained from smartwatch sensor data measuring hand movements between keystrokes. Maiti et al. also proposed a solution that makes use of smartwatch sensors to infer users’ input; in addition, they proposed a protection framework that <b>regulates</b> <b>sensor</b> data access (Maiti et al. 2016).

We have previously described data logging transceiver nodes capable of 2 K samples/second/channel data rates. However, only one node may stream data at a time, since all nodes on the network share the communications channel. To overcome these limitations, 2 nd generation data logging transceivers were developed with software programmable radio frequency (RF) communications. Each node contains on-board memory (2 Mbytes), <b>regulated</b> <b>sensor</b> excitation, instrumentation amplifiers with programmable gains & offsets, multiplexer, 12 bit A/D converter, microcontroller, and frequency agile, bi-directional, frequency shift keyed (FSK) RF serial data link. The nodes are capable of continuous RF transmission from over 26 nodes, over frequency bands of 402 - 470 MHz & 804 - 940 MHz bands, at data rates of 76. 8 kbaud. An aluminum beam with half bridge, 1000 ohm bonded foil strain gauges {{was used to determine}} sensitivity (through shunt calibration) and to assess gain stability over temperature.

However, the spatial and temporal control of these modifications remains poorly understood in multicellular organisms.

Insulin signaling <b>regulates</b> the <b>sensor's</b> oxidation at both of these levels. Unexpectedly, we found that isogenic individuals exhibit large differences in the sensor's thiol-disulfide balance. This variation contrasts with the general view that glutathione acts as the main cellular redox buffer.

We therefore propose that glutathione facilitates the sensitive control of the thioldisulfide balance of target proteins in response to cellular redox events...|$|R

Their sorption ability toward heavy metal ions was also proved as for individual biopolymers [25] as well as in composites [26]. Therefore, the alginate modification of nanosized TiO 2 -SiO 2 composite is a very simple and cheap method preventing aggregation of their particles and improving sorption properties. Sodium alginate (ALG) consists of sequences of M (M-blocks) and G (G-blocks) residues to form MG sequences (MG-blocks) [24]. Chelation of metal cations, such as Ca(II), by carboxylate groups of MG-blocks causes the cross-linking of alginates. This type of sorbents is not well-known and some basic rules of kinetics and adsorption of heavy metal ions especially when accompanied by the photoreduction from aqueous solutions have not been fully understood.

40|$|International audienceGlucose {{homeostasis}} {{corresponds to}} the overall physiological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms which tightly maintain the glycaemia between ∼ 4. 5 and ∼ 6 mM. The resulting blood glucose concentration is the consequence of {{a balance between the}} mechanisms that ensure the entry and the output of glucose in the blood. A dynamic balance needs hence to be perfectly achieved in order to maintain a physiological glycaemic concentration. Specialized cells from the intestine continuously detect changes in glucose concentration and send signals to peripheral tissues and the brain through the vagus nerve. The molecular mechanisms involved in glucose detection have not been perfectly defined but could resemble those from the insulin-secreting beta cells. The brain then integrates the enteric and circulating endocrine signals to generate a new signal towards peripheral tissues such as the pancreas, liver, muscles, and blood vessels. This metabolic reflex is called anticipatory since it allows the peripheral tissues to prepare for the adequate handling of nutrients. Diabetes is associated with an impaired anticipatory reflex, which hampers the proper detection of nutrients and leads to hyperglycaemic episodes. Recently, GLP- 1 -based therapies have demonstrated the improvement of glucose detection and their efficacy on glycaemic control.

However, the current sensors and their processing circuits significantly contribute extra hardware cost, delay and noise to the system. They can also harm the system reliability. Therefore, current sensorless control techniques can bring cost effective and reliable solutions for various boost converter applications. According to the derived accurate model, which contains a number of parasitics, the boost converter is a nonlinear system. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is proposed for inductor current estimation and output voltage filtering. With this approach, the system can have the same advantages as sensored current control mode. To implement EKF, the load value is necessary. However, the load may vary from time to time. This can lead to errors of current estimation and filtered output voltage. To solve this issue, a load variation elimination effect elimination (LVEE) module is added. In addition, a predictive average current controller is used to regulate the current. Compared with conventional voltage controlled system, the transient response is greatly improved since it only takes two switching cycles for the current to reach its reference. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the stable operation and output tracking capability for large-signal transients of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

The presence of such a diverse set of on-board sensors, however, also expose an additional attack surface which, if not adequately protected, could be potentially exploited to leak private user information. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the feasibility of a new vulnerability that attempts {{to take advantage of a}} wrist-wearable's seemingly innocuous and poorly <b>regulated</b> motion <b>sensors</b> to infer a user's input on mechanical devices typically used to secure physical access, for example, combination locks.

Further, we conduct a thorough empirical evaluation of the proposed frameworks by employing unlocking-related motion data collected from human subject participants in a variety of controlled and realistic settings. Evaluation results from these experiments demonstrate that motion data from wrist-wearables can be effectively employed as an information side-channel to significantly reduce the unlock combination search-space of commonly-found combination locks, thus compromising the physical security provided by these locks...|$|R

In kidney glomerular epithelial cells (GEC), high glucose (30 mM), but not equimolar mannitol, stimulated de novo protein synthesis and induced hypertrophy in association with increase in phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E binding protein 1 (4 E-BP 1) and decreased phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF 2), regulatory events in mRNA translation. These high glucose-induced changes in protein synthesis were PI 3 kinase-, Akt- and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) dependent and TGF-independent. High glucose reduced AMPK subunit theronine (Thr) 172 phosphorylation that required Akt activation.

An important mediator in this process is the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) complex, which is activated in hypoxic cells and increases transcription of a broad range of genes including angiogenic growth factors such as VEGF. HIF is primarily regulated through oxygen-dependent proteasomal destruction of the regulatory subunit, HIF- 1 alpha or HIF- 2 alpha. Regulation is through the modification of specific prolines in HIF- alpha chains which are hydroxylated by a recently identified family of enzymes which require molecular oxygen and 2 -oxoglutarate as cosubstrates, and iron as a cofactor. Following modification HIF- alpha chains are captured by a ubiquitin ligase E 3 complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein.

Whereas the whisker region in rat motor (M 1) cortex sends dense projections to the contralateral claustrum, the M 1 forelimb representation does not. The claustrum sends strong ipsilateral projections to the whisker regions in M 1 and somatosensory (S 1) cortex, but its projections to the forelimb cortical areas are weak. These distinctions suggest that one function of the M 1 projections to the contralateral claustrum is to coordinate the cortical areas that <b>regulate</b> peripheral <b>sensor</b> movements during behaviors that depend on bilateral sensory acquisition. If this hypothesis is true, then similar interhemispheric circuits should interconnect the frontal eye fields (FEF) with the contralateral claustrum and its network of projections to vision-related cortical areas. To test this hypothesis, anterograde and retrograde tracers were placed in physiologically-defined parts of the FEF and primary visual cortex (V 1) in rats. We observed dense FEF projections to the contralateral claustrum that terminated in the midst of claustral neurons that project to both FEF and V 1. While the FEF inputs to the claustrum come predominantly from the contralateral hemisphere, the claustral projections to FEF and V 1 are primarily ipsilateral. Detailed comparison of the present results with our previous studies on somatomotor claustral circuitry revealed a well-defined functional topography in which the ventral claustrum is connected with visuomotor cortical areas and the dorsal regions are connected with somatomotor areas.

When they hatch without food, C. elegans arrests development at the first larval stage (L 1) and survives more than two weeks.

A high rate of metabolism shortens the L 1 survival span, whereas a low rate of metabolism lengthens it. The longer worms are starved, the slower they grow once they are fed, suggesting that L 1 arrest has metabolic costs. Furthermore, mutants of genes that regulate metabolism show altered L 1 longevity. Among them, we found that AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), as a key energy <b>sensor,</b> <b>regulates</b> L 1 longevity by regulating this metabolic arrest.

Also specific silencing of IRE or inhibition of its endoribonuclease activity by 48 c hampered the upregulation of BiP, but not of CHOP, and induced apoptosis. These results suggest that drugs affecting the Hsp 70 -IRE axis, like quercetin, or affecting directly IRE may represent an effective adjuvant antileukemia therapy...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are composed of}} distributed sen-sors {{that can be used}} for signal detection or classification. The likelihood functions of the hypotheses are often not kno-wn in advance, and decision rules have to be learned via supervised learning. A specific learning algorithm is Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), the classification accuracy of which has been previously studied in the context of wireless sensor networks. Previous work, however, does not take into account the communication protocol or battery lifetime; in this paper we extend existing studies by proposing a model that captures the relationship between battery lifetime and classification accuracy. To do so, we combine the FDA with a model that captures the dynamics of the carrier-sense multiple-access (CSMA) algorithm, the random-access algo-rithm used to <b>regulate</b> communications in <b>sensor</b> networks. This allows us to study the interaction between the clas-sification accuracy, battery lifetime and effort put towards learning, as well as the impact of the back-off rates of CSMA on the accuracy. We characterize the tradeoff between the length of the training stage and accuracy, and show that ac-curacy is non-monotone in the back-off rate due to changes in the training sample size and overfitting...|$|R
40|$|Lonicera confusa was {{a medical}} plant which could {{adapt to the}} Ca-rich {{environment}} in the karst area of China. The photosynthesis, relative chlorophyll content,differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of L. confusa that cultivated in calcareous and sandstone soils were investigated. The {{results showed that the}} relative chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis rate of L. confusa in calcareous soil are much higher than that planted in sandstone soil, the higher content of calcium might play a role in keeping the chloroplast from harm and showed higher photosynthesis rate. The transpiration and stomata conductance were decreased in calcareous soil, which might result from the closure of stomata. The GeneFishing and proteomic results showed that the expression of DEGs and DEPs were critical for photosynthesis and stomata closure, such as RuBisCO, photosynthetic electron transfer c and malate dehydrogenase varied in the leaves of L. confusa that cultivated in different soils. These DEGs or DEPs were further found to be directly or indirectly <b>regulated</b> by calcium <b>sensor</b> proteins. This study enriched our knowledge of the molecular mechanism of high net photosynthesis rate and lower transpiration of L. confusa that cultivated in the calcareous soil in some degree...|$|R
