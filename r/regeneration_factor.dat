40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy logic model of regenerative braking (FLmRB) for modeling EVs ’ regenerative braking systems (RBS). The model has the vehicle’s acceleration and jerk, {{and the road}} inclination as input variables, and {{the output of the}} FLmRB is the <b>regeneration</b> <b>factor,</b> i. e. the ratio of regenerative braking force to total braking force. The <b>regeneration</b> <b>factor</b> expresses the percentage of energy recovered to the battery from braking. The purpose of the FLmRB development is to create realistic EV models using as least as possible manufacturers intellectual property data, and avoiding the use of EV on-board sensors. To tune the model, real data was gathered from short and long-distance field tests with a Nissan LEAF and compared with two types of simulations, one using the proposed FLmRB, and the other considering that all the braking force/energy is converted to electric current and returned back to charge the battery (100 % regeneration). The results show that the FLmRB can successfully infer the regenerative braking factor from the measured EV acceleration and jerk, and road inclination, without any knowledge about the EV brake control strategy.

40|$|Aims: Mammalian {{myocardium}} has {{a finite}} but limited capacity to regenerate. Experimentally stimulating proliferation of cardiomyocytes with extracellular <b>regeneration</b> <b>factors</b> like periostin enhances cardiac repair in rodents. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop a safe method for delivering <b>regeneration</b> <b>factors</b> to the heart and to test the functional and structural effects of periostin peptide treatment in a large animal model of myocardial infarction (MI). Methods and Results: We developed a controlled release system to deliver recombinant periostin peptide into the pericardial space. A single application of this method was performed two days after experimental MI in swine. Animals were randomly assigned to receive either saline or periostin peptide. Experimental groups were compared at baseline, day 2, 1 month and 3 months. Treatment with periostin peptide increased the EF from 31 % to 41 % and decreased by 22 % the infarct size within 12 weeks. Periostin peptide-treated animals had newly formed myocardium strips within the infarct scar, leading to locally improved myocardial function. In addition the capillary density was increased in animals receiving periostin. However, periostin peptide treatment increased myocardial fibrosis in the remote region at one week and 12 weeks post-treatment.

In this study, we aimed at identifying if the transplantation of adipose tissue-mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) may exert therapeutic effects on acetaminophen-induced liver injury. MethodsASCs were isolated from human subcutaneous tissue and were transfected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Sprague–Dawley rats were administrated 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen intraperitoneally and were transplanted with ASCs or vehicle. After 24 h from acetaminophen administration, rats were sacrificed. Hepatic levels of isoprostanes, 8 -hydroxyguanosine (8 -OHG), nitrites/nitrates and reduced glutathione (GSH) were determined as markers of oxidative stress; JNK phosphorylation and hepatic levels of inflammatory cytokines and <b>regeneration</b> <b>factors</b> were also assessed. ResultsTransplantation of ASCs decreased AST, ALT and prothrombin time to the levels observed in control rats. Transplanted animals had normal plasma ammonia and did not display clinical encephalopathy. Liver sections of intoxicated rats treated with vehicle showed lobular necrosis and diffuse vacuolar degeneration; in rats transplanted with ASCs liver injury was almost absent. Transplantation of ASCs decreased liver isoprostanes, 8 -OHG and nitrite–nitrates to the levels of control rats, while preserving GSH. Consistently, hepatic levels of TNF-α, MCP- 1, IL- 1 β, ICAM- 1 and phospho-JNK were markedly increased in rats treated with vehicle and were restored to the levels of controls in animals transplanted with ASCs. Furthermore, ASC transplantation increased liver expression of cyclin D 1 and PCNA, two established hepatocyte <b>regeneration</b> <b>factors,</b> whereas ASCs were not able to metabolize acetaminophen in vitro.

40|$|We {{obtain the}} latitude-time {{distribution}} of the averaged tilt angle of solar bipoles. For large bipoles, which are mainly bipolar sunspot groups, the spatially averaged tilt angle is positive in the Northern solar hemisphere and negative in the Southern, with modest variations during course of the solar cycle. We consider the averaged tilt angle to be a tracer for a crucial element of the solar dynamo, i. e. the regeneration rate of poloidal large-scale magnetic field from toroidal. The value of the tilt obtained crudely corresponds to a <b>regeneration</b> <b>factor</b> corresponding to about 10 % of r. m. s. velocity of solar convection. These results develop findings of Kosovichev and Stenflo (2012) concerning Joy's law, and agree with the usual expectations of solar dynamo theory.

40|$|Liver {{regeneration}} provides {{one of the}} few {{systems for}} analysis of mitogenesis in the fully developed, intact animal. Several proteins have been identified as part of the primary growth response in regenerating liver and in mitogen-stimulated cells. Some of these proteins, such as the Jun and Fos families of transcription factors, are thought to have a role in activating transcription of genes expressed subsequently in the growth response. Through differential screening of a regenerating-liver cDNA library, we have identified a rapidly and highly induced gene encoding a 21 -kDa leucine-zipper-containing protein that we have designated liver <b>regeneration</b> <b>factor</b> 1 (LRF- 1). LRF- 1 has no homology with other leucine-zipper proteins outside the basic and leucine-zipper domains. LRF- 1 alone can bind DNA, but it preferentially forms heteromeric complexes with c-Jun and Jun-B and does not interact with c-Fos. In solution, it binds with highest affinity to cAMP response elements but also has affinity for related sites. In cotransfection studies, LRF- 1 in combination with c-Jun strongly activates a c-Jun-responsive promoter. The induction of the LRF- 1 gene in regenerating liver greatly increases the potential variety of heterodimeric combinations of leucine-zipper transcription factors. While LRF- 1 mRNA is rapidly induced in the absence of protein synthesis, its peak induction is later than c-fos mRNA, suggesting that LRF- 1 may regulate responsive genes at a later point in the cell cycle. As such, LRF- 1 may have a unique and critical role in growth regulation of regenerating liver and mitogen-stimulated cells...|$|E

40|$|Skeletal muscle {{regeneration}} is {{a complex}} interplay between various cell types including invading macrophages. Their recruitment to damaged tissues upon acute sterile injuries is necessary for necrotic debris clearance and for coordination of tissue regeneration. This highly dynamic process is characterized by an in situ transition of infiltrating monocytes from an inflammatory (Ly 6 Chigh) to a repair (Ly 6 Clow) macrophage phenotype. System-level gene expression analysis revealed that {{the time course of}} muscle regeneration, much more than Ly 6 C status, was correlated with the largest differential gene expression. This indicated that the time course of inflammation was the predominant driving force of macrophage gene expression. These findings validate the dynamic nature of the macrophage response and associate a specific gene signature to predictive specialized functions of macrophages at each step of muscle regeneration. However, the gene regulatory events supporting the sensory and effector functions of macrophages involved in tissue repair are not well understood. Here, we show that the lipid activated transcription factor (TF), PPARg is required for proper skeletal muscle regeneration acting in repair MFs. PPARg controls the expression of the TGFβ family member, GDF 3, which in turn regulates the restoration of skeletal muscle integrity by stimulating myoblast cell fusion. In addition, to delineate the order of transcriptional events during monocyte infiltration and in situ macrophage differentiation we generated chromatin accessibility maps using ATAC-seq. We found that a large class of genomic regulatory elements is becoming de novo accessible during monocyte infiltration in the muscle, and motif analysis showed that these sites are highly enriched to the MARE motif, compared to other common macrophage specific motifs. We also identified BACH 1, a heme-regulated MARE-binding TF, as a novel regulatory molecule. The contribution of this molecule and downstream targets such as Hmox 1, have been evaluated using full body and macrophage-specific knock-outs. Surprisingly, the inactivation of either Bach 1 or Hmox 1 in macrophages impairs muscle regeneration by altering the dynamics of the macrophage phenotypic transition. In addition, Bach 1 deletion leads to transcriptional deregulation of critical inflammatory genes in macrophages upon injury. By using bone marrow-derived macrophages, we found BACH 1 to bind extensively to enhancers of these genes, suggesting that fine-tuning of transient inflammatory transcriptional programs in macrophages during tissue injury, largely depend on MARE-binding TFs. Overall, this work establishes PPARg and BACH 1 as required environment sensors and transcriptional regulators of muscle infiltrating MFs. Moreover, this work also establishes GDF 3 as a secreted extrinsic effector protein acting on myoblasts and serving as a <b>regeneration</b> <b>factor</b> in tissue repair. 	 The importance of the macrophage phenotypic shift and the cell cross-talk of the local muscle tissue with the infiltrating macrophages during tissue regeneration upon injury are also not fully understood and their study lacks adequate methodology. Here, by using an acute sterile skeletal muscle injury model combined with irradiation, bone marrow transplantation and in vivo imaging we show that preserved muscle integrity and cell composition prior to the injury is necessary for repair macrophage phenotypic transition and subsequently for proper and complete tissue regeneration. Importantly, by using a model of in vivo ablation of PAX 7 positive cells, we show that this radiosensitive skeletal muscle progenitor pool contributes to macrophage phenotypic transition following acute sterile muscle injury. Taken together, our data suggest the existence of a more extensive and reciprocal cross-talk between muscle tissue compartments, including satellite cells, and infiltrating myeloid cells upon tissue damage. These interactions are shaping the macrophages in-situ phenotypic shift, which is indispensable for normal muscle tissue repair dynamics...|$|E

Methods: The responses of serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (free and total), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and the acute phase proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were examined in patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with partial hepatectomy (n = 14) or cryosurgery (n = 10). Results: In both groups, IL- 6 peak levels at the end of the operation were followed by peak levels at day 1 for HGF and CRP. SAA peak levels occurred on day 1 (hepatectomy group) and on day 4 (cryo group). The total HGF, IGF-I, and IL- 6 responses were comparable in both groups. CRP and SAA responses were higher in the patients treated with cryosurgery than in patients after hepatectomy. Free IGF-I trough levels were lower in partial hepatectomy patients than in cryosurgery patients. Conclusions: In patients with colorectal liver metastases the responses of the regenerating factors HGF, IGF-I, and IL- 6 are comparable to those in patients treated with partial hepatectomy.

More than 10 percent of the seedlings in one site were more than 25 years old. A 2 -year study evaluating acorn quality showed that acorns from Madera County had a faster and higher emergence rate than acorns from Kern County. The Southern Sierra Hardwood Range region, consisting of Madera, Fresno, Tulare, and Kern Counties contains almost 1. 5 million acres of hardwood rangeland. Eighty percent of this land is privately owned, and blue oak (Quercus douglassii) is the most abundant oak species. Obtaining adequate natural regeneration to maintain current stands of blue oak is of concern for some landowners, government agencies, and conservationists. Studies were conducted to evaluate <b>regeneration</b> <b>factors</b> such as blue oak size classes, acorn quality, and natural seedling survival. These studies have been carried out over the past 9 years to better understand the biology of blue oaks growing under natural conditions. Data were analyzed using an analysis of variance and differences between means were determined using Duncan Multiple range. Significance is expressed as P ≤ 0. 05...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{periodontal}} therapy is {{to halt the}} de-structive process while the ideal objective of periodontal surgery is to regenerate the lost tissues. Regeneration in Periodontics seeks reproduction or reconstitution of a lost or injured part [1], namely formation of new cemen-tum, new alveolar bone, and a functional periodontal ligament. Different approaches have been proposed to obtain re-generation of periodontal tissues, such as bone grafts, alloplastic materials, guided tissue <b>regeneration,</b> growth <b>factors</b> and enamel matrix derivative (EMD). EMD is known {{to play a role}} in the tooth formation, particularly in the formation of acellular cementum [2]. Lately, the use of EMD has been proposed as an alternative in peri-odontal regeneration. Various studies were performed t...|$|R
30|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cell}} (MSC)-based {{approaches}} can be broadly {{divided into two}} categories: cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Cell therapy {{is focused on the}} anti-inflammatory, immune-regulatory, and homeostasis-regulatory actions of MSCs to treat disorders like malignant lymphoma, angina pectoris, and atopic dermatitis. Conversely, regenerative medicine is focused on MSCs playing a tissue engineering role, to enhance tissue <b>regeneration</b> using growth <b>factors</b> and scaffolds; for example, to generate tissue-engineered skin or cartilage, which have been assessed in clinical trials.|$|R
40|$|AbstractActivated carbon {{filters are}} widely used to {{eliminate}} the contaminants in water, especially in power plant water treatment. Once exhausted, its adsorption capacity is normally recovered by thermal regeneration, and then activated carbon is reused. This paper summarizes the process of thermal GAC (Granular Activated Carbon) <b>regeneration</b> and the <b>factors</b> in this process. Inorganic salts adsorbed in GAC could play a negative role during catalyzed oxidation reactions when GAC is regenerated and lead to deterioration of its adsorbent properties...|$|R

40|$|<b>Regeneration</b> and {{tolerance}} <b>factor</b> (RTF) is a protein with immunosuppressive activity and is normally {{present in the}} thymus and placenta. RTF was measured in the livers of patients with regenerating nodules due to alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatitis C. RTF was expressed in the regenerating nodules of 26 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. All patients with chronic hepatitis C without cirrhosis failed to express RTF. Flow cytometry revealed upregulation of RTF on the lymphocytes from alcoholic cirrhosis and downregulation in hepatitis C disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of electronic and steric {{effects on the}} stabilities of carbamates formed from the reaction of CO 2 {{with a wide range}} of alkanolamines was investigated by quantum chemical methods. For the calculations, B 3 LYP, M 11 -L, MP 2, and spin-component-scaled MP 2 (SCS-MP 2) methods were used, coupled with SMD and SM 8 solvation models. A reduction in carbamate stability leads to an increased CO 2 absorption capacity of the amine and a reduction of the energy required for solvent <b>regeneration.</b> Important <b>factors</b> for the reduction of the carbamate stability were an increase in steric hindrance around the nitrogen atom, charge on the N atom and intramolecular hydrogen bond strength. The present study indicates that secondary ethanolamines with sterically hindering groups near the N atom show significant potential as candidates for industrial CO 2 -capture solvents...|$|R
