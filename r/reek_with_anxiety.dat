6000|$|He {{played for}} half an hour before he spoke again. His head was <b>reeking</b> <b>with</b> the smoke of pipes and cheap cigars, and he was weary of pairs and four-flushes, resentful {{of the way in which}} they ignored him. He flung at Joe: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{seen the}} savage in his wildest mood, [...] And marked him <b>reeked</b> <b>with</b> human blood, [...] But never so repulsive made. [...] Something incongruous strikes the mind [...] Whene'er a barbarous race we find [...] With shreds of civil life displayed.|$|R
6000|$|As he entered, {{the actress}} reeled {{to her feet}} and came to meet him. He stood and gazed at her stupidly. This could not be Vivienne, this {{creature}} <b>reeking</b> <b>with</b> brandy, uttering such foolish words! What fiend was this in her likeness? ...|$|R

6000|$|Clarke, who had {{appeared}} at the doorway, a worn, and troubled spectre of dismay, now put in a confirmatory word. [...] "You are quite right, Simeon.

6000|$|... "Come on, all o' ye!" [...] he snarled {{through his}} set teeth, facing them all. As he stood thus {{the absurdity of}} his own {{attitude}} came upon him.

60|$|The sport led us at some {{distance}} from the Hall, in a soft meadow, <b>reeking</b> <b>with</b> the moist verdure of spring.

60|$|The {{manager of}} the hotel came to the room with his bill and pressed for payment.

6000|$|The {{editor of}} the Memphis Avalanche swoops thus mildly down upon [...] a {{correspondent}} who posted him as a Radical: [...] "While he was writing [...] the first word, the middle, dotting his i's, crossing his t's, and [...] punching his period, {{he knew he was}} concocting a sentence that was [...] saturated <b>with</b> infamy and <b>reeking</b> <b>with</b> falsehood."--Exchange.|$|R
