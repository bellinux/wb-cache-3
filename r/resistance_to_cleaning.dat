40|$|Microbiological {{contamination}} {{in the food}} industry is often attributed {{to the presence of}} biofilms in processing plants. Bacterial biofilms are complex communities of bacteria attached to a surface and surrounded by an extracellular polymeric material. Their extreme <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cleaning</b> and disinfecting processes is related to a unique organization, which implies a differential bacterial growth and gene expression inside the biofilm. The impact of biofilms on health, and the economic consequences, has promoted the development of different approaches to control or remove biofilm formation. Recently, successful results in phage therapy have boosted new research in bacteriophages and phage lytic proteins for biofilm eradication. In this regard, this review examines the environmental factors that determine biofilm development in food-processing equipment. In addition, future perspectives for the use of bacteriophage-derived tools as disinfectants are discussed. This research study was supported by grants AGL 2012 - 40194 -C 02 - 01 (Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain), GRUPIN 14 - 139 (Program of Science, Technology and Innovation 2013 – 2017 and FEDER EU funds, Principado de Asturias, Spain) and bacteriophage network FAGOMA.

These stacks were used to fabricate broadband pulse compression gratings. Influences of annealing temperature on the surface root-mean-square roughness, reflectivity and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> chemical <b>cleaning</b> damage were investigated. The experimental results indicated that surface root-mean-square roughness of these multilayers changed only slightly after annealing Their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> chemical <b>cleaning</b> damage improved with the annealing temperature increase, whereas their reflectivity decreased. The metal/dielectric multilayers annealed at 250 degrees C for 10 h could not only endure the process of chemical cleaning, but also slightly decrease the reflectivity, suggesting {{that it is an}} optimal annealing process for metal/dielectric multilayers...|$|R

40|$|Failure of food {{preservation}} is frequently caused by thermostable spores {{of members of}} the Bacillaceae family, which show a wide spectrum of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cleaning</b> and preservation treatments. We constructed and validated a mixed-species genotyping array for 6 Bacillus species, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus sporothermodurans, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus coagulans, and 4 Geobacillus species, including Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Geobacillus thermocatenulatus, Geobacillus toebii and Geobacillus sp., in order to track food spoilage isolates from ingredient to product. The discriminating power of the array was evaluated with sets of 42 reference and 20 test strains. Bacterial isolates contain a within-species-conserved core genome comprising 68 - 88 % of the entire genome and a non-conserved accessory genome comprising 7 - 22 %. The majority of the core genome markers do not hybridise between species, thus they allow for efficient discrimination at the species level. The accessory genome array markers provide high-resolution discrimination at the level of individual isolates from a single species. In conclusion, the reported mixed-species microarray contains discriminating markers that allow rapid and cost-effective typing of Bacillus food spoilage bacteria {{in a wide variety of}} food products. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms have {{a natural}} {{capacity}} to attach to surfaces, to multiply and to embed themselves in a slimy matrix, forming biofilms. These allow complex interactions among different species and surfaces. There is significant evidence that bacterial growth in attached communities constituted the first form {{of life on the}} planet, and it is estimated that the majority of microbial activity on earth is resultant from biofilms, rather than microbes growing isolated in the form of planktonic cells. Industrial units, particularly food processing plants, provide good environmental conditions for biofilm proliferation, such as an abundant source of nutrients, which can create a significant problem mainly because most of these microorganisms can be pathogens. Therefore, cleaning and disinfection in food processing plants are important issues that deserve full consideration. However, the phenotype of biofilms provides intrinsic <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cleaning</b> and disinfection. Nowadays, there are no biofilm control strategies that inactivate, remove or prevent their regrowth after antimicrobial treatment. This study provides information on the problems of biofilm formation and on the main strategies used for their control. Information on the antimicrobial mode of action of biocides and biofilm resistance mechanisms is also provided...|$|E

Their strength, texture, flexibility, hardness, ease of preparation, pigment receptivity and retention, and their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cleaning</b> were compared and the data consulted when an elastomer was chosen to restore defects, improve aesthetics and reestablish the confidence of a selection of patients. Detailed case reports are provided, together with information on the adhesives or mechanical methods available for retaining the facial prosetheses. Cyanoacrylate adhesives for use on skin surfaces and as tissue adhesives have been studied in detail. A novel n-butyl 413 cyanoacrylate has been developed with a viscosity, haemostatic property and stability to make it particularly suitable for use in skin grafting and tissue repair. It has already been used with good results on patients with severe burns. An improved formulation, containing a fluorescent dye, can be precisely applied through a specially constructed foot-controlled dispenser illuminated by a fibre-optic supplying UV-light. Cyanoacrylates are already being used as tissue adhesives in place of the conventional but potentially disfiguring suture. The availability of improved, imperceptible adhesives and a precision applicator, which {{can be used in a}} modern operating theatre, will extend their effectiveness and satisfy some of the needs of Plastic, and Oral and Maxillo-Facial Surgeons. Portable applicators have potential use in battlefield and in veterinary surgery and overcome the imprecision characteristic of earlier methods. Loctite U...|$|E
40|$|Biofilms are a {{challenging}} {{source of contamination}} due <b>to</b> their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> conventional <b>cleaning</b> and hygiene procedures. In this work, we assessed the antimicrobial properties at room temperature of surfactants of industrial interest in detergent formulation. The adhesion abilities of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica and the mould Aspergillus niger to polyurethane foam and glass surfaces {{and their ability to}} develop as biofilm was firstly studied under different culture conditions. The most stable biofilms were then treated at room temperature with a mixture of an alkylpolyglucoside and an ethoxylated fatty alcohol, and with an ether carboxylate. Experimental results illustrated that surface-attached cells were more resistant to disinfectant treatment than cells of the same microorganism grown in suspension. Although the assayed surfactant solutionshardly removed attached biofilms, they showed a greatinhibitory effect on free-living cells. What is more, biofilmsdid not grow during treatments. Therefore, the good antimicrobial effects of these ecological surfactants at roomtemperature could provide them a potential interest inlow-temperature cleaning in place procedures...|$|R
5000|$|A biofilm is a {{community}} of microorganisms adsorbed to a surface. Microorganisms in biofilms are enclosed in a polymeric matrix consisting of exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA and proteins. Seconds after a surface (usually metal) is placed in a solution, inorganic and organic molecules adsorb onto the surface. These molecules are attracted mainly by Coulombic forces (see above section), and can adhere very strongly to the surface. This first layer is called the conditioning layer, and {{is necessary for the}} microorganisms to bind to the surface. These microorganisms then attach reversibly by Van der Waals forces, followed by irreversible adhesion through self-produced attachment structures such as pili or flagella. [...] Biofilms form on solid substrates such as stainless steel. A biofilm's enclosing polymeric matrix offers protection to its microbes, increasing their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> detergents and <b>cleaning</b> agents. Biofilms on food processing surfaces can be a biological hazard to food safety. Increased chemical resistance in biofilms can lead to a persistent contamination condition.|$|R
40|$|Biofouling can {{be defined}} as the attachment, {{adhesion}} and proliferation of organisms on materials that causes a netnegative effect. Typically, the biofilm proliferation process is divided into two classes – micro- and macro-fouling. For thelatter, barnacles, oysters and some other relatively ‘large’ organisms play important roles in marine environments, waterpipes, heat exchangers, etc., causing series problems to the user faced with addressing the issue. Microfouling refers to theinitial layer of adhered cells whose adhesion is not reversible, which will in time develop into macrofouling. A criticalelement of these processes is the formation of a biofilm on the material’s surface. Bacteria sheathed in a biofilm have ahigher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> antibiotics and <b>cleaning</b> agents, thus increasing their overall survival probability – representing anevolutionary survival strategy. The mechanisms of bacterial adhesion are slightly different from those of macrofoulingcolonising organisms. The knowledge gained from these two basic principles has evolved since the 1990 s; however, thereis still an obvious void in fundamental knowledge. The aim of this special issue is to review some recent advances inmaterials design and surface functionalisation that have been developed, {{on the basis of these}} foundation principles, tomitigate biofouling...|$|R
40|$|Biofilms, {{containing}} pathogenic bacteria, {{represent a}} recurrent economic and safety problem in food industries, {{due to their}} high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cleaning</b> and sanitizing procedures. The development of photoactive surfaces with bactericidal property could facilitate the elimination of such microbial biofilms. One solution may be to deposit a photocatalyst top-layer (TiO 2) on conventional materials used in food plants. Our aim is to study the photocatalytic activity of such layers on the adhesion and viability of different bacteria present on food plants, especially in pork meat factory: Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica and Pseudomonas fragi. Glass substrates were coated with TiO 2 thin films by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering under various deposition conditions (deposition temperature T, oxygen partial pressure PO 2). The characterization of the TiO 2 thin layers was performed using spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. And photocatalytic activity under UVA illumination (365 nm) has been checked for all samples. Bactericidal activity has been demonstrated on the bacteria tested by enumeration of the adherent cells and in situ fluorescent labeling after three hours of contact with the thin film and a subsequent UVA illumination. Adherent bacteria with damaged bacterial cell wall were observed using a scanning electron microscopy; this {{can be associated with}} presence of oxidative stress due to the photocatalytic activity of the TiO 2 thin layer. The selected TiO 2 coating presents a photocatalytic activity leading to an oxidative stress. This activity provides bactericidal properties against different strains from the meat industry. This thin layer could be optimized by modifying anionic composition (band-gap reduction) during coating in order to be active under solar light so it could be used to fight against biofilms...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the range of cleaning practices and processes in 11 Australian hospitals and to discuss the challenges this variation poses to the implementation of clinical trials or changes <b>to</b> hospital <b>cleaning</b> practices. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used <b>to</b> determine <b>cleaning</b> practices and processes in hospitals participating in the ‘Researching Effective Approaches <b>to</b> <b>Cleaning</b> in Hospitals’ (REACH) study. A standardised template and approach was used to collect information. Data collection activities included structured on-site discussions, a review of hospital practices and a document review of policy and procedural documents related <b>to</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Results Variations in the auditing process used to evaluate environmental cleanliness, cleaning practices, product use, training and communication pathways available <b>to</b> <b>cleaning</b> staff were identified. There was also variation in workforce structure and responsibilities for cleaning. Conclusion This paper is the first to describe the differences in cleaning practices between Australian hospitals. The variations identified present a number of challenges for the conduct of research and have important implications for both monitoring of and standards for cleanliness. These challenges include implementing a practice change or cleaning study where hospitals have different processes, practices and structures...|$|R
