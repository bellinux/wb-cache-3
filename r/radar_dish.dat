25|$|Interceptions {{using the}} system started {{just like the}} normal AIS, with the {{operator}} seeking targets as the system moved in its spiral scan. When a target was selected, the radar operator turned another knob to adjust the strobe, a time-base circuit that produced a ring on the display. When the strobe lay over a target's return a button was pushed, causing the signals before or after that range to be filtered out (gating), leaving only the selected target visible on the screen. The tracking circuits would then ensure the <b>radar</b> <b>dish</b> remained pointing at the target as it moved.|$|E
25|$|The spiral and helical scan systems {{produced}} {{very different}} displays {{from the same}} basic data. With the helical-scan system, the <b>radar</b> <b>dish</b> was moving horizontally, producing a series of stripes across the screen while scanning up and down so subsequent lines were above or below the last pass. This created a raster scan display, not unlike a television. Echoes caused the signal to brighten, producing a spot, or blip on the display. The blip's location indicated the direction to the target relative {{the nose of the}} fighter, represented by the centre point of the display. The further the blip was from the centre of the screen, the further away the target was from the centreline. The range was not directly indicated in this sort of display.|$|E
25|$|The team first {{considered}} {{spinning the}} <b>radar</b> <b>dish</b> around a vertical axis and then angling the dish {{up and down}} a few degrees with each complete circuit. The vertical motion could be smoothed out by moving continually rather than in steps, producing a helix pattern. However, this helical-scan solution had two disadvantages; one was that the dish spent half of its time pointed backwards, limiting the amount of energy broadcast forward, and the other was that it required the microwave energy to somehow be sent to the antenna through a rotating feed. At a 25 October all-hands meeting attended by Dee, Hodgkin and members of the GEC group at GEC's labs, {{the decision was made to}} proceed with the helical-scan solution in spite of these issues. GEC solved the problem of having the signal turned off half the time by using two dishes mounted back-to-back and switching the output of the magnetron to the one facing forward at that instant. They initially suggested that the system would be available by December 1940, but as work progressed it became clear that it would take much longer.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, {{a cluster}} of <b>radar</b> <b>dishes</b> existed near Point Lay.

50|$|For use in Northern Africa {{the company}} {{developed}} a ‘’Sahara“ version, featuring a strengthened chassis, firmer springing at the back, a supplementary tool box under the front grille {{and a second}} fuel tank beneath the passenger seat.

50|$|To {{set up for}} operation, {{the trailer}} was parked on {{suitably}} flat land and the brakes were locked. Three levelling jacks were then swung out from the trailer, one on either side at the front where the step in the chassis met the cabin, and another {{from the rear of}} the cabin. The jacks were then used to level the cabin using spirit levels. The <b>radar</b> <b>dishes</b> were then raised, the generator started, and operations could begin. The entire setup took about 20 minutes, with 3 minutes required to warm up the electronics.|$|R

40|$|Large radar {{installations}} {{around the}} globe continuously watch the skies, unobtrusively providing security to the United States; these systems have been in active use for the past 50 years.

Air-inflated domes (over 100 ft in diameter) are one structure of choice for providing this essential protection. The radomes are constructed from highstrength fabric that {{is strong enough to}} withstand the inflation pressure, high winds, and other environmental loads, yet transparent to the microwave signal to allow precise radar mapping.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, both the US and USSR {{were in the}} midst of {{introducing}} their first truly mass-produced ICBMs, and their numbers were clearly going to grow dramatically during the early 1960s. Zeus, like Hercules and Ajax before it, used mechanically directed <b>radar</b> <b>dishes</b> that could track only one target and one interceptor at a time. It was planned that Zeus bases would actually consist of several launcher sites connected to a central control, but, even in this case, the site might be able to guide four to six missiles simultaneously. As the ICBM fleet numbered hundreds even before Zeus could become operational, it would be simple to overcome the defense by directing sufficient warheads over it to overwhelm its ability to guide interceptions rapidly enough.|$|R

50|$|A radome {{is often}} used to prevent ice and {{freezing}} rain from accumulating directly onto the metal surface of antennas.

50|$|Another cm-wavelength {{experiment}} was built at Werneuchen, east of Berlin, known as Jagdschloss Z. This system operated on a 9 cm wavelength, {{which was very}} short for the era.

5000|$|Some rifles, {{such as the}} Denel NTW-20 and Vidhwansak, are {{designed}} for a purely anti-materiel (AM) role, e.g. shooting turbine disks of parked aircraft, missile guidance packages, expensive optics, and the bearings, tubes or wave guides of radar sets. A sniper equipped with the correct rifle can target <b>radar</b> <b>dishes,</b> water containers, the engines of vehicles, {{and any number of}} other targets. Other rifles, such as the [...]50 caliber rifles produced by Barrett and McMillan, are not designed exclusively as AM rifles, but are often employed in such a way, providing the range and power needed for AM applications in a lightweight package compared to most traditional AM rifles. Other calibers, such as the [...]408 Cheyenne Tactical and the [...]338 Lapua Magnum, {{are designed}} to be capable of limited AM application, but are ideally suited as long range anti-personnel rounds.|$|R
50|$|The peacock {{flounder}} is {{also called}} flowery flounder {{because it is}} covered in superficially flower-like bluish spots. As suggested by the family name, lefteye flounders have both eyes {{on top of the}} left hand side of their heads. The eyes are raised up on short stumps like <b>radar</b> <b>dishes,</b> and can move in any direction independent of each other. That feature provides flounders {{with a wide range of}} view. One eye can look forward while the other looks backward at the same time. The baby flounders have one eye on each side of their bodies like ordinary fish, and swim like other fishes do, but later on, as they are becoming adult, the right eye moves to the left side, and flounders start to swim sideways, which gives them the ability to settle down flat on the bottom. The maximum length of this flounder is about 45 cm.|$|R
