50|$|In 1947, {{secretary}} of the Queensland branch of the Pedal Cyclists' Association, Les Cecil proposed a dual purpose venue as a solution which would see cycling in the summer season on a <b>removable</b> <b>floor</b> so that ice skating could be enjoyed when the floor was removed for the winter season.|$|E
50|$|Although the tilting cab gives {{comparatively}} unobstructed {{access to}} the engine, its deployment causes unsecured items in the cab and sleeper (if equipped) to fall onto the windshield or under the instrument panel. Vehicles without a tilting cab will usually be equipped with <b>removable</b> <b>floor</b> panels through which mechanics can access and service the engine. Unfortunately, some components might require servicing or replacement that either will not fit through the hatch or remain inaccessible. This necessitates removal of the engine by lowering it {{out from under the}} vehicle, a time-consuming and expensive procedure.|$|E

50|$|The Vacuette Electric, {{introduced}} in 1925 with its <b>removable</b> <b>floor</b> nozzle and handle, became {{the forerunner of}} today's multi-attachment Kirby vacuum models. In 1935, the company introduced the Kirby Model C, the first product to carry Jim Kirby's name. The Vacuette was also briefly offered as a manual vacuum cleaner, utilizing a spring-loaded worm gear driven by pulling the vacuum cleaner backwards, then when pushing the machine forward, the worm gear would power a turbine that provided the suction needed. As long as the cleaner was consistently pulled backwards, tension in the spring would remain constant and the turbine would continue spinning. It was designed for rural areas that didn't have electricity, and was {{very similar to the}} carpet sweeper.|$|E
5000|$|Brighton and Hove City Council {{stated in}} October 2011 that AMG had met {{officers}} from the licensing and planning departments {{in an attempt to}} move the situation forward. [...] Four months later, Live Nation announced its intention to seek planning permission for to convert the building into [...] "one of the city’s main live music venues", at an estimated cost of £9 million. By this time the company had spent at least £100,000 on structural and other surveys. [...] Nothing came of these plans, though, and in February 2013 another group—Alaska Development Consultants—unveiled an £18 million plan to turn the Hippodrome into an eight-screen cinema. Five new shops and a public square would be part of the plans, and the building would be connected to an adjacent shopping arcade. Local firm Russ Drage Architects drew up the plans. [...] A local and national campaign, preferring the building to be used for live theatre or similar events, protested against the plans; but by January 2014 Alaska Development Consultants' proposals had evolved into a £35 million scheme including a restaurant on a <b>removable</b> <b>floor</b> above the auditorium. [...] English Heritage announced their support for these plans in April 2014, and in November 2014 the city council's planning department gave final approval. The site, together with the contiguous Dukes Lane shopping street, was immediately put on the market AMG acquired the freehold and offered campaigners a six-month moratorium to develop plans for restoration. Work to achieve restoration continues.|$|E

While the intent was to provide a space large enough to hold the entire student body of Northwestern University at once during convocations and other such campus occasions, the auditorium was also used by the North Shore Music Festival and, soon after its opening, by the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches. This event, held August 15-30, 1954, featured a convocation address by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|R

40|$|With {{the demands}} of {{telecommunications}} and computer equipment, building owners and designers are facing an increasingly difficult problem for wire management in today's electronic workplace. This thesis is to investigate and design the accessible sunken floor systems for multi-story steel buildings with proliferating data cables and mechanical equipment. The terminology of an accessible sunken floor system or a dropped floor system is not new. Sunken floor {{has been used in}} reinforced concrete buildings with flat slabs and multi-story steel-framed construction with solid wide-flange beams. However, the design of an accessible sunken floor system with open-web steel joists and joist girders is an innovation, by leading steel design and construction industry into a new era. Sunken floors are sirniliar to raised floors, which are composed of removable square floor panels on metal pedestals to provide space for electrical or mechanical equipment or both. The removable panels provide easy access to the equipment below. These floors are commonly used in computer rooms, clean rooms and new office buildings which require extensive mechanical and electrical service. A clean room environment with air return through accessible plenums is essential in microelectronics and pharmaceutical facilities, in hospital operating rooms, in bio-genetic research laboratories and production areas, and in assembly plants for items such as computer disk drives and compact disks. Accessible sunken floor systems are used to avoid ramps or stairs as opposite to raised floor systems. Also, the finished floor-to-floor height in multi-story construction is less than the acceptable height for a raised floor, with subsequent savings on other more expensive building materials. Moreover, the construction cycle for steel buildings with open-web steel joists and joist girders is faster if the finished floor is composed of <b>removable</b> <b>floor</b> panels. One of the proposed systems is to substitute conventional concrete metal decks for fire-rated acoustical ceilings and horizontal bracings to cut down the construction cycle and costs. A second variation of the proposed systems permits economies in concrete slab finish by using lightweight concrete poured on corrugated metal decks, or by using pour- in -place or precast slabs below the finished floor panels, and the floor system is suspended 4 inches below the top chord of the steel joists as a horizontal diaphragm and fire barrier. This thesis will explore the building system integration and forecast the construction cycle and costs. An evaluation of the proposed systems will be presented with matrix diagrams to summarize the conclusion of this paper. by Henry K. Kwan. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Howlett and Bailey Architects. Jeffrey Howlett and Don Bailey had won a design competition for a Town Hall and auditorium in 1961. Their design consisted of two buildings, one containing administrative offices and the other, oval in shape, comprising the 'town hall' or auditorium. The administration offices, called Council House, were built, however financial constraints and doubts regarding the auditorium's acoustic properties meant that construction of the auditorium {{building was}} delayed. Its design was subsequently re-considered {{and it was not}} until the late-1960s that a different plan was approved. This plan was...to accommodate not more than 2,000 people and to cost no more than $2,000,000 and with the highest priority to be given to its musical uses, i.e. Symphony concerts, choral concerts, organ recitals, etc., and, in addition, performances of minimum staged ballet, fold dances or musical drama, and also be suitable for other functions such as large Civic receptions, conferences, conventions, public meetings, pageants, school speech days, pop concerts and folk singers.Through 1969, the architectural plans were amended several times. These amendments included beautification and landscaping of the main pedestrian approach from St Georges Terrace and construction of a subway under the Terrace, a pit for a 60-piece orchestra with <b>removable</b> <b>flooring</b> and seating to cover the pit when not in use, and improved access and facilities for disabled people. The original plans included a restaurant with a seating capacity for 400, but following inspection of similar halls in the eastern states of Australia, it was decided that this was not warranted. It was, therefore, decided to make the restaurant smaller and include a tavern and cocktail bar, allowing patrons a wider choice. The bar area was named The Wardle Room, after Sir Thomas Wardle.|$|R
50|$|In {{tribute to}} his father, Francis A. Mcgaw, Foster G. McGaw donated to the {{construction}} of McGaw Memorial Hall in 1953. It was built with the intent to hold the entire Northwestern student body, and had partitions, portable bleachers, and a <b>removable</b> basketball <b>floor</b> to allow for many different uses. At the time of construction, {{it was one of the}} largest auditoriums in the Chicago area. It lent its space to the North Shore Music Festival, and the Second Assembly of World Council of Churches, which showcased a convocation address by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1983 the hall underwent renovations to suit the growing university’s needs, and the interior spaces of the building are now named Welsh-Ryan Arena and the Ronald J. Chinnock Lobby to recognize large contributors to the remodel.|$|R

50|$|Insane Speed is a steel {{roller coaster}} at Janfusun Fancyworld in Taiwan. Sometimes known as Crazy Coaster on the park's website, or Floorless Coaster, as the sign {{in front of}} the ride's queue announces, the ride in Chinese is known as 衝瘋飛車. Insane Speed has two trains {{numbered}} 1 and 2, but the park usually only uses one on off-peak days due to the extremely low amount of riders in the queue. Insane Speed has a <b>removable</b> metal <b>floor</b> in the station which collapses after the train has loaded and the restraints have been checked, allowing the air gates to open and the trains to depart. The floor rises again to let the next train unload once it has come to a complete stop. For restraints, riders have a simple over-the-shoulder restraint with grab bars mounted on them, and a seat belt which must be inserted into a catch mounted on the restraint.|$|R

5000|$|As {{prisoner}} No. 710 Langford {{was involved}} in the planning and excavation of the tunnel code-named [...] "Harry" [...] which was located under the barrack's stove in Room 23 of Block 104. He was also the [...] "trapfuehrer" [...] responsible to ensure that the red hot stove on its tiled piece of <b>removable</b> <b>flooring</b> was back in place over the tunnel whenever the guards were nearby. He mastered his technique to a point that he could close the trap door above the tunnellers cushioned with blankets to kill any hollow sound, and get the stove in place with carefully replaced dust and dirt within 20 seconds of a guard approaching. Langford saved the tunnel from discovery on several occasions. The tunnel was completed in early March 1944 measuring 106.07 m (348 ft) in length and the date for the break-out was set for 24 March. Approximately 600 airmen had worked on various aspects of the tunnel's construction. A list of 220 people was compiled for the actual escape but only 80 managed to get through the tunnel and of these, four were apprehended at the tunnel's exit.He was one of the 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24-25 March 1944 in the escape now famous as [...] "the Great Escape". Having got clear of the camp Langford was in a party of officers who fought their way through the snow and bitter cold walking as fast as they could, they kept pushing onwards despite the weather and survived freezing nights outdoors only to be recaptured on 28 March 1944. He was in the party with Ian Cross, Jack Grisman, Sandy Gunn and Tom Leigh held at Gorlitz Civil Prison, where on the morning of 31 March 1944 Keith Ogilvie saw Edgar Humphreys, Dutchy Swain, Chaz Hall, Brian Evans, Wally Valenta, George McGill, Pat Langford, [...] "Adam" [...] Wlodzimierz Kolanowski, Bob Stewart and [...] "Hank" [...] Henry Birkland being led away to a covered truck, They were all shot in a clearing off the Gorlitz to Sagan road just outside Gorlitz and cremated at Liegnitz by the Gestapo.Langford was one of the 50 escapers executed and murdered by the Gestapo. Originally his remains were buried at Sagan, he is now buried in part of the Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery. he is also commemorated by the Royal Canadian Air Force.|$|R
