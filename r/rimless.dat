2500|$|Japan {{produced}} {{a number of}} machine guns that were direct copies of the British Lewis (Japanese Type 92 machine gun) and Vickers machine guns including the ammunition.

2500|$|Sales of [...]38 ACP {{ammunition}} {{enjoyed a}} modest spike during the surplus gun {{boom of the}} 1950s and 1960s, since the cartridges would usually cycle in Spanish surplus pistols like the Astra 400 that were chambered for the 9×23mm Largo, {{despite the fact that}} the [...]38 ACP was semi-rimmed and slightly shorter than the <b>rimless</b> 9 mm Largo.

The [...]30 Carbine uses a lighter bullet and more modern powder. As a result, it is approximately 600 feet per second faster and 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. The [...]30 Carbine's relatively straight case and the rounded nose of its bullet led some {{to believe it was}} designed for use in pistols.|$|E
2500|$|Dies for {{bottle neck}} cases usually are {{supplied}} in sets {{of at least}} two dies, though sometimes a third is added for crimping. This is an extra operation and is not needed unless a gun's magazine or action design requires crimped ammunition for safe operation, such as autoloading firearms, where the cycling of the action may push the bullet back in the case, resulting in poor accuracy and increased pressures. [...] Crimping is also sometimes recommended to achieve full velocity for bullets, through increasing pressures so as to make powders burn more efficiently, and for heavy recoiling loads, to prevent bullets from moving under recoil. [...] For FMJ bullets mounted in bottle neck cases, roll crimping is generally not ever used unless a cannelure is present on the bullet, to prevent causing bullet deformation when crimping. [...] <b>Rimless,</b> straight wall cases, on the other hand, require a taper crimp, because they headspace on the case mouth; roll crimping causes headspacing problems on these cartridges. Rimmed, belted, or bottleneck cartridges, however, generally can safely be roll crimped when needed. Three dies are normally supplied for straight walled cases, with an optional fourth die for crimping. Crimps for straight wall cases may be taper crimps, suitable for <b>rimless</b> cartridges used in autoloaders, or roll crimps, which are best for rimmed cartridges such as are used in revolvers.|$|E
2500|$|During the Second World War Macmillan's toothy grin, baggy {{trousers}} and <b>rimless</b> glasses had given him, as his biographer puts it, [...] "an air {{of an early}} Bolshevik leader".

2500|$|The German Army's use of submachine guns {{during the}} French Campaign of 1940 had {{demonstrated}} {{the potential of}} such weapons, and consequently some elements of the Australian Army were now more receptive {{to the value of}} Owen's gun.

2500|$|However, {{the service}} {{life of the}} M1895 as a {{first-line}} infantry weapon was soon to end. In December 1898, a board of officers from the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officers recommended that all services adopt the [...]30 Army cartridge and the small arms and machine guns chambered for it. The board did acknowledge that the rimmed [...]30 Army round was less than ideal when used in modern machine guns, and {{that the decision to}} adopt the [...]30 Army for the Navy and Marine Corps might be postponed until a <b>rimless</b> version of the [...]30 Army had been developed.

2500|$|The [...]380 ACP (9x17mm) (Automatic Colt Pistol) is a <b>rimless,</b> straight-walled pistol {{cartridge}} {{developed by}} firearms designer John Moses Browning.

Other names for [...]380 ACP include [...]380 Auto, [...] 9mm Browning, 9mm Corto, 9mm Kurz, 9mm Short, 9×17mm and 9mm Browning Court (which is the C.I.P. designation).

2500|$|When FFV Norma AB (now Norma Precision AB) {{designed}} the cartridge {{at the behest}} of Dornaus & Dixon Enterprises, Inc. for their Bren Ten pistol (a newly developed handgun with design inspired by the CZ 75), the company decided to increase the power over Cooper's original concept. The resulting cartridge—which was introduced in 1983 and produced since—is very powerful, containing the flat trajectory and high energy of a magnum revolver cartridge into a relatively short, versatile <b>rimless</b> cartridge for a semi-automatic pistol. The case was derived from the [...]30 Remington rifle round, cut down and the walls straightened to accept the same diameter bullet as the much older [...]38-40 Winchester.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor in}} {{the demise of the}} 6mm Lee was its bullet; the 6mm Lee was adopted prior to the {{invention}} of the spitzer-shape bullet. As a result, the light, roundnosed 6mm bullet lost much of its effectiveness at 600–700 yards, while the [...] roundnosed bullet of the [...]30 Army service cartridge was still considered effective at ranges of 1,000 yards or more, an important consideration in the days when rifle and indirect machine gun fire at distant targets such as massed enemy infantry was considered necessary. [...] While by no means a universal opinion, the lack of shocking power of the 6mm Lee reported by some Marine units in combat may also have weighed against the idea of delaying a change to the [...]30 Army for all services. A further complication was that issues of barrel wear from the Riflelite smokeless powder and corrosive primer used in the 6mm cartridge continued to plague Navy ordnance authorities. Finally, due in part to its long, thick-gauged semi-rimless rim case and beveled rim, the 6mm Lee {{was one of the most}} expensive service cartridges to produce in terms of cost per round, yet it was already becoming obsolescent in comparison to ammunition that used more efficient powders and true <b>rimless</b> cases. [...] Rapid developments in military small arms ammunition would soon demonstrate the advantages of a magazine-fed rifle and machine gun cartridge with a <b>rimless</b> case and spitzer bullet, features not found in either the [...]30 Army or the 6mm Lee.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015 Ruger {{announced}} a production Redhawk version that supports both the rimmed [...]45 Colt round and the <b>rimless</b> [...]45 ACP round., Ruger achieves this multi-cartridge functionality by partially machining the cylinder {{for use of}} moon clips for the [...]45 ACP while still retaining enough ledge on the cylinder to allow proper [...]45 Colt headspacing., For several years gunsmiths have been customizing DA/SA revolver cylinders (manufactured using modern metallurgy) of [...]45 Colt, [...]454 Casull or [...]460 S Magnum chamberings to accept [...]45 ACP (and possibly other rounds) with moon clips {{in addition to the}} revolver's original round(s).

2500|$|Ishapore 2A and Ishapore 2A1 {{receivers}} {{are made}} with improved (EN) steel (to handle the increased pressures of the 7.62×51mm round) and the extractor is redesigned to suit the <b>rimless</b> cartridge. From 1965–1975 (when production {{is believed to have}} been discontinued), the sight ranging graduations were changed from 2000 to 800, and the rifle re-designated Rifle 7.62mm 2A1. The original [...] rear sight arm was found to be suitable for the ballistics of the 7.62×51mm, which is around 10% more powerful and equates to a flatter trajectory than that of the [...]303 British MkVII ammunition, so it was a simple matter to think of the '2000' as representing metres rather than yards. It was then decided that the limit of the effective range was a more realistic proposition at 800m.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]22-250 {{is similar}} to, but was {{outperformed}} {{by the larger}} [...]220 Swift cartridge. However, it is in much wider use and has a larger variety of commercially available factory ammunition than the Swift. This makes it generally cheaper to shoot. The smaller powder load also contributes to more economical shooting for users who load their own ammunition. Despite common myths regarding longer barrel life on a 22-250 vs the Swift or other calibers, that {{is directly related to}} shooter habits, allowing the barrel to cool between volleys and the speed of the bullet, an important factor for high-volume shooters. Both the Swift and the 22-250 shoot at very similar velocities and bullet weights so barrel wear when used and cooled equally is identical between the two calibers. Due to its <b>rimless</b> case the 22-250 also feeds from a box magazine with ease.|$|E
2500|$|Testing {{was planned}} to occur with a lipped chimney, and on receipt {{of the first}} full livery, Tornado would be fitted with an {{authentic}} <b>rimless</b> chimney, described as the original non-capped version.

2500|$|Improved {{military}} rifle propellants are tubular nitrocellulose propellants {{evolved from}} World War I through World War II for loading military and commercial ammunition {{and sold to}} civilians for reloading rifle ammunition for hunting and target shooting. [...] These propellants were DuPont modifications of United States artillery propellants. DuPont miniaturized the large artillery grains to form military rifle propellants suitable for use in small arms. These were improved {{during the first world}} war to be more efficient in <b>rimless</b> military cartridges replacing earlier rimmed rifle cartridges. Four-digit numbers identified experimental propellants, and a few successful varieties warranted extensive production by several manufacturers. Some were used almost exclusively for military contracts, or commercial ammunition production, but a few have been distributed for civilian use in handloading. Improved military rifle propellants are coated with dinitrotoluene (DNT) to slow initial burning and graphite to minimize static electricity during blending and loading.

2500|$|Some impact craters on Mercury have non-circular, irregularly shaped {{depressions}} or pits {{on their}} floors. Such craters have been termed pit-floor craters, and MESSENGER team members {{have suggested that}} such pits formed {{by the collapse of}} subsurface magma chambers. If this suggestion is correct, the pits are evidence of volcanic processes at work on Mercury. Pit craters are <b>rimless,</b> often irregularly shaped, and steep-sided, and they display no associated ejecta or lava flows but are typically distinctive in color. For example, the pits of Praxiteles have an orange hue. Thought to be evidence of shallow magmatic activity, pit craters may have formed when subsurface magma drained elsewhere and left a roof area unsupported, leading to collapse and the formation of the pit. [...] Major craters exhibiting these features include Beckett, Gibran and Lermontov, among others. It was suggested that these pits with associated brighter and redder deposits may be pyroclastic deposits caused by explosive volcanism.|$|E
2500|$|Ridges {{may have}} been formed by several processes, {{including}} tectonism and extrusion, {{or they may be}} buried crater-rim segments. Several large ridges may represent uplift of plains materials by normal faulting. Other ridges are arcuate to circular, which suggests that they are segments of old, subdued crater and basin rims. Near Boccaccio (centered at lat 81° S., long 30°), ridges are domical in cross section and have smooth tops with small irregular or <b>rimless</b> craters along their crests; they appear to overlap both a c3 and a c1 crater (FDS l66751). In turn, these ridges are superposed by c3 craters and c4 ejecta. The ridges may be volcanotectonic features, composed of extrusives along fissures. However, they are mapped only as ridges because we cannot determine if they are volcanic material that should be mapped as a separate unit or uplifted intercrater plains. These same structures {{may have been}} the source of older plains units.|$|E
2500|$|Several factors {{led to the}} {{discontinuance}} of the 6mm Lee as {{an official}} U.S. military cartridge. The most important was {{the decision of the}} War Department, based upon a recommendation by a board composed of Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officers, to standardize on the [...]30 Army cartridge for all services. Additionally, the 6mm's special—and expensive—semi-rimless beveled-rim case was designed to work optimally in the charger clips of the M1895 rifle. This proved an unnecessary complication when adapting the cartridge to other, more modern machine guns and small arms. Aside from the benefits of interchangeability between the services, the board noted the government had its greatest investment in the [...]30 Army cartridge and rifles chambered for it. Nevertheless, the board acknowledged the rimmed [...]30 Army round was less than ideal when used in modern machine guns, and the decision to adopt it for the Navy and Marine Corps might be postponed until a <b>rimless</b> version was developed (which would eventually take place in 1903 {{in the form of the}} [...]30-03).|$|E
2500|$|In December 1894, after {{a series}} of test {{evaluations}} with both rimmed and <b>rimless</b> 6mm cartridges, the U.S. Navy adopted the 6mm U.S.N. or 6mm Lee Navy cartridge. [...] It was the first U.S. military round to use a metric caliber in its official designation, the first cartridge designed for use in both rifles and machine guns, and the smallest-caliber cartridge to be adopted by any military power until the advent of the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge in 1964. [...] The original 6mm ball loading was supplied by Winchester, and used a roundnosed, cupro-nickeled steel-jacketed lead-core bullet with a total weight of 135 grains. [...] In March 1897 a new military loading was adopted using a 112-grain (7.3 g) round-nose, copper-jacketed (FMJ) military loading developing [...] and [...] of energy at the muzzle. [...] Besides providing increased velocity and a flatter trajectory, the primary reason for the change in cartridge and bullet design was to reduce chamber pressures and extend the life of the rifle barrel: the new 112-grain loading [...] with its copper-jacketed bullet gave an average barrel life of 10,000 rounds as opposed to only 3,000 for the 135-grain steel-jacketed load. [...] Ordnance authorities specified a slightly slower rifling twist for the new loading– one turn in 7.5inches (18cm). [...] At some point during later production, this rifling was again changed to one turn in 10inches RH (25cm).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} set of service trials, the naval small arms board tested several submissions, {{including}} the Van Patten, Daudeteau, Briggs-Kneeland, Miles, the Russell-Livermore Magazine Rifle, five Remington turnbolt designs (all with side-mounted magazines), and the Lee straight-pull. [...] In a second set of trials the Model 1893/94 Luger 6-mm Rifle and the Durst rifle were also considered, along with a Lee turning-bolt design. [...] The Durst prototype fractured the receiver in firing and was withdrawn from the test, while the Luger Rifle performed excellently. [...] Luger's submission had only one major disadvantage: it failed to meet government specifications, having been chambered in a non-standard <b>rimless</b> 6mm cartridge. [...] The Lee turning bolt design was considered to be a good one, but marred by its magazine system, which the Small Arms Board found to be problematic. [...] The Board thought so highly of the Luger Rifle that it recommended purchase of either a prototype or an option to purchase the rights to manufacture. [...] Apparently this never came to pass, as Luger not only declined to submit its design in the Navy's government 6mm chambering, but withdrew from the third round of the service trials. [...] The Lee straight-pull rifle with its charger-loaded magazine was chosen as the winner in repeated small arms trials, and was selected for adoption by the U.S. Navy in 1895 as the Lee Rifle, Model of 1895, caliber 6-mm, a.k.a. the M1895 Lee Navy.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]380 ACP {{cartridge}} {{was derived}} from Browning's earlier [...]38 ACP design, which was only marginally more powerful. The [...]380 ACP {{was designed to be}} truly <b>rimless,</b> with headspace on the case mouth instead of the rim for better accuracy. These relatively low-powered designs were intended for blowback pistols which lacked a barrel locking mechanism, which is often required for any handgun firing a round more powerful than a [...]380. Using blowback operation, the design can be simplified, and lowered in cost; a locking mechanism is unnecessary, since the mass of the slide and strength of the recoil spring are enough to absorb the recoil energy of the round, due to the round's relatively low bolt thrust. Blowback operation also permits the barrel to be permanently fixed to the frame, which promotes accuracy, unlike a traditional short recoil-operation pistol, which requires a [...] "tilting" [...] barrel to unlock the slide and barrel assembly when cycling. A drawback of the blowback system is that it requires a certain amount of slide mass (weight) to counter the recoil of the round used. The higher the power the round, the heavier the slide assembly has to be in order for its inertia to safely absorb the recoil, meaning that a typical blowback pistol in a given caliber will be heavier than an equivalent recoil-operated weapon (alternatively, a very stiff spring will work, but will make operating the slide very difficult). Blowback weapons can be made in calibers larger than [...]380 ACP, but the required weight of slide and strength of spring makes this an unattractive option. Although the low power of the [...]380 ACP does not require a locking mechanism, there have also been a number of locked-breech pistols chambered in [...]380 ACP, such as the Remington Model 51, Kel-Tec P3AT and Glock 42; all three being designed to be lighter than blowback operated [...]380 ACP weapons. There have also been some relatively diminutive (blowback-operated) submachine guns, such as the Ingram MAC-11 and the Czech vz. 83.|$|E
