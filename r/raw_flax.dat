It has been in operation since {{the first half of the}} 17th century, first as a paper mill, then as a flour mill. It is now part of Historical and cultural complex Radomysl Castle. Radomysl paper mill was built in 1612 (according to other sources - in 1606) to produce paper for the Kyiv-Pecherska Lavra’s publishing house. It was initiated by Yelisey Pletenecki (1550-1624), the Lavra’s archimandrite (abbot). Since then and up till the Khmelnitsky uprising, the Radomysl paper mill was the monopoly manufacturer of paper in the central part of Ukraine. Most of the religious and secular books available at that time in Central and Eastern Ukraine were printed on the paper produced in Radomysl. The paper was made of old flax clothes, <b>raw</b> <b>flax,</b> nettle and hemp. It had a light gray colour and was very strong and hard. The Radomysl paper is easily identified by the four types of watermarks. The first two are the coats-of-arms of archimandrites Yelisey Pletenecki and Zakharia Kopystenski. The two others are, respectively, the stylized image of one of the Lavra’s founders - Anthony Pecherski and three domes with crosses.|$|E

The first important step, and in some respects the decisive step, towards modifying it was taken in 1824, under the policy of Huskisson. In that year, and again in 1825, great reductions were made in the duties on raw materials, especially on wool, <b>raw</b> silk, <b>flax</b> and iron, while considerable reductions were also made in the duties on manufactured goods. The most sharply contested of the changes was in regard to silks, which had been completely prohibited, and were now admitted at a duty of 30 per cent.

40|$|The {{authors of}} this paper {{presented}} the key moments {{in the development of}} proctology, a medical discipline which {{is an integral part of}} surgery, whose development path was inseparable from the historical development of operational medicine. Even in the ancient Egypt, proctology was an important branch of medicine. Out of eight of so far known medical papyri in the history of proctology, the most important one is the Beatty`s (Chester Beatty) papyrus from the 13 th century BC, which is actually a short monograph on diseases of the anus and their treatment. In the ancient period, operative proctology reached the highest level in the time of Hippocrates. In detail, and with special care, the operative procedures of the large intestine, primarily perianal fistula and hemorrhoids were described in the Hippocratic writings. One of the most famous Roman medical writers, Celsus (Cornelius Celsus Asullus) described the surgery of hemorrhoids by their ligature and the surgery of anorectal fistula in two ways: ligation of the fistula channel by string of <b>raw</b> <b>flax</b> and fistula incision through the probe placed through the fistula channel. Doctors of the 18 th and the 19 th century introduced into practice some more complicated surgical procedures in the treatment of anorectal diseases. The French surgeons were the leaders. In 1710, Littré performed, for the first time, anus praeter naturalis and Jacques Lisfranc (1790 - 1847) pioneered the method of perineal resection of the rectum for cancer. The first rectoscope was constructed in 1895 and in 1903 it was introduced into practice by Kelly (Kelly Howard Atwood). A sudden progress in the diagnosis and treatment of anorectal diseases occurred after the Second World War and the trend has continued to this day...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{mechanical}} properties of natural fibre reinforced biocomposites are largely {{governed by the}} intrinsic strength of reinforcement fibres {{as well as by}} the level of adhesion between the fibres and the matrix polymer. The research work reported in this manuscript presents a model investigation of the adhesion properties of the major polysaccharides in flax and a polylactic acid polymer matrix, and a correlation between these interactions and the final {{mechanical properties}} of the fibre and the composite. The main objective of this multi-length scale analysis is to better understand the complex role of the different polysaccharides present in flax fibres at the biocomposite interface. We first submit a <b>raw</b> <b>flax</b> fibre to two separate treatments, an enzymatic and an alkali one, which are known to indirectly promote the adherence between the reinforcement fibre and a PLA matrix. The detailed investigation of the morphology, mechanical and adherence properties of the treated fibres allows to observe the removal of the middle and primary layers down to the cellulose microfibrils networks of the secondary layers, and underlines the importance of limiting the attack of encrusting amorphous hemicellulose matrix within the secondary layer that is essential both in order to maintain interesting material properties and to promote adhesion with PLA. In a second time, we adapt the colloidal force microscopy to directly probe interaction forces between PLA and the different polymers in flax fibre. The system was first tested on cellulose and PLA to estimate the Hamaker constant and the work of adhesion. From the Nardin and Schultz equation, the experimental data obtained by local techniques such as AFM were found to be more realistic, in contrast, with those obtained from averaging techniques that are known to be not suited for heterogeneous samples such as flax fibres. The colloidal force microscopy was thus used to selectively measure all the possible. interaction between the different polysaccharides of the fibres and the PLA matrix to qualitatively identity the weakest interaction system in a biocomposite. The results underline the important interactions of PLA matrix with both hemicellulose and pectin materials, even at low humidity rate. We postulated that the high water content of these two polysaccharides may be responsible for several mechanisms of interaction with PLA, such as hydrogen bonds, capillary forces or inter-diffusion processes. In parallel, adhesion force mapping of real raw and treated flax fibre s surface by AFM force-volume technique give complementary results that underline an important adhesion with these two polysaccharidesLORIENT-BU (561212106) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|E

We report here the first genome-wide physical map of flax and the generation and analysis of BAC-end sequences (BES) from 43, 776 clones, providing initial insights into the genome. Results The physical map consists of 416 contigs spanning ~ 368 Mb, assembled from 32, 025 fingerprints, representing roughly 54. 5 % to 99. 4 % of the estimated haploid genome (370 - 675 Mb). The N 50 size of the contigs was estimated to be ~ 1, 494 kb. The longest contig was ~ 5, 562 kb comprising 437 clones. There were 96 contigs containing more than 100 clones. Approximately 54. 6 Mb representing 8 - 14. 8 % of the genome was obtained from 80, 337 BES. Annotation revealed that {{a large part of the}} genome consists of ribosomal DNA (~ 13. 8 %), followed by known transposable elements at 6. 1 %. Furthermore, ~ 7. 4 % of sequence was identified to harbour novel repeat elements. Homology searches against flax-ESTs and NCBI-ESTs suggested that ~ 5. 6 % of the transcriptome is unique to flax. A total of 4064 putative genomic SSRs were identified and are being developed as novel markers for their use in molecular breeding. Conclusion The first genome-wide physical map of flax constructed with BAC clones provides a framework for accessing target loci with economic importance for marker development and positional cloning. Analysis of the BES has provided insights into the uniqueness of the flax genome. Compared to other plant genomes, the proportion of rDNA was found to be very high whereas the proportion of known transposable elements was low. The SSRs identified from BES will be valuable in saturating existing linkage maps and for anchoring physical and genetic maps. The physical map and paired-end reads from BAC clones will also serve as scaffolds to build and validate the whole genome shotgun assembly. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sebald Beham from Nuremberg {{designed}} his Spinning Bee woodcut around 1524 (Figure 1) as {{a medium-sized}} work of approximately 1 ft by 1. 5 ft, printed on two {{sheets of paper}} glued side by side. A large number of individuals are included and most are women, significantly so because spinning bees served as meeting places for rural girls and women where they would spin and amuse themselves during {{the fall and winter}} evenings. Beham’s print is the first surviving example of a spinning bee in visual art {{and one of the first}} substantive examples of the theme in any form. The print thus began a tradition in the visual arts and followed one in literature that continued through the eighteenth century with German poems and prints, including an engraved copy of Beham’s Spinning Bee with text. In Beham’s print only two of the women spin: the woman whose distaff stands out prominently at center, and an older woman at lower left, who is probably married, judging from her matron’s bonnet. Each of these women holds yarn she has spun from the <b>raw</b> wool or <b>flax</b> on a long distaff. The older woman also holds a spindle, a long bobbin-like weight that helps turn the distaff in its base. The remaining women and men eat and drink, dance, and are engaged in a variety of sexual antics in which the men embrace or lie on the women (at upper right), look under their skirts (at lower right), and reach aggressively under their clothing (lower left). Sebald Beham seems to offer the viewer a tantalizingly exaggerated picture of the kind of Early Modern German spinning bee Hans Medick broadly describes as a “youth-sexual culture” showing “rural customs of courtship. ” My purpose in this essay is to examine the sexualized view of women Beham presents in this print. Most of the women are depicted as sexually involved and, I argue, therefore misbehaving, while only two women attend to their distaffs and are thereby shown to be virtuous. I intend to discuss these contradictory attitudes about women, as virtuous and sexual, by placing them within the broader context of attitudes in Nuremberg. The results show that Beham’s microscopic view of one group of Nuremberg women telescopes into more general attitudes toward women during Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe...|$|R
40|$|What did {{sheep shears}} in the 1 st {{millennium}} BC Babylonia look like? We are not sure. Many cuneiform texts were written about textile work in Babylonia, {{but it was}} largely about administration or accounting. There were hardly any descriptions of the actual tools and processes. In this article we go back over the words, the iconography, and the archaeology {{in an attempt to}} find these missing descriptions. This study is limited to Babylonia during the 1 st millennium BC, and this period correspond to a state of the Akkadian language, called Neo-Babylonian. At these times, major evolution took place. Mesopotamia entered in the Iron Age {{at the end of the}} 2 nd millennium BC. Empires were built (Neo-Assyrian 911 - 610 BC, Neo-Babylonian 610 - 539 BC BC, Achaemenid 539 - 330 and Hellenistic 330 - 64 BC). Most of the cuneiform documentation of that period discovered by the archaeological excavations is dated from the “long 6 th century BC”. 2 At these times, Babylonia enjoyed an economic growth, longdistance trade developed, and the temples has an important economic weight. 3 All these factors induce changes in the textile craft that are visible through an analysis of the vocabulary. Textile tools were objects of everyday life, they were handled manually to transform the raw materials into finished woven products. They included all the implements used at different stages of fibre preparation, spinning, and weaving, as well as dyeing, washing, decorating and the repair of fabrics. An approach that combines the study of vocabulary of tools with the study of action verbs related to textile manufacturing can bring information about the techniques known in 1 st millennium BC. In Babylonia, during the 1 st millennium BC, the textile craft was well-developed. Textiles were widely used in transportation, in home furnishing as well as for clothing. Common domestic production and luxury production both existed with the former being much less documented than the latter. Luxury production was organized by the temples, and probably also by the palaces. 4 Wool was the most commonly used <b>raw</b> material. 5 <b>Flax</b> was rare but present, and cotton appeared at these times in Babylonia. 6 Special products like Egyptian flax, purple wool or special dyes, especially destined for luxury production, were imported through long distance trade. 7 Manufacturing techniques were complex: the luxury textiles were adorned with metal appliqué, tassels, and embroidery. 8 The vocabulary of tools and action verbs dealing with textile production gives some information about the different tasks accomplished by the textile craftsmen, and about the techniques they mastered. Important works about textile tools in Mesopotamia include the book by Catherine Breniquet Essai sur le tissage en Mesopotamie and the articles by Eva Andersson Strand, Agnete Wisti Lassen, and Caroline Sauvage. 9 Using the context of these previous works supported by the Neo-Babylonian documentation, the question is how studying tool terminology and action verbs can improve our understanding of the function of the textile production in 1 st-millennium BC Mesopotamia. Does textile terminology reveal evolutions at this late period of Mesopotamian history...|$|R
