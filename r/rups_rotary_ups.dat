40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of different irrigation solutions and ultrasonic activation of the irrigation solutions on the removal of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) from the simulated immature root canals after apexification. Materials and methods: One-hundred and one single-rooted teeth were used. The root canals were shaped with ProTaper <b>rotary</b> files <b>up</b> to F 5. Simulation of roots with immature apices was carried out using size 4 Unicore drills. An injectable Ca(OH) 2 was injected into each root canal, and packed to the working length. Then, cotton pellets were placed over canal orifices, and apical and coronal parts of the roots were sealed with resin-modified glass ionomer cement, and light cured. Specimens were stored in distilled water for 3 months at 37 °C. After 3 months, the temporary coronal seal was removed and the samples were randomly divided into: (a) saline (n[*]=[*] 20), (b) ultrasonic activation of saline (n[*]=[*] 20), (c) sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (n[*]=[*] 20), (d) ultrasonic activation of NaOCl (n[*]=[*] 15), (e) chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) (n[*]=[*] 20) and one positive control group (n[*]=[*] 3) and one negative control group (n[*]=[*] 3).

The {{aim of the}} present study was to compare the push-out bond strength of gutta-percha to root canal dentin with the single-cone and cold lateral compaction canal obturation techniques. Materials and methods. The root canals of 58 human mandibular premolars were prepared using modified crown-down technique with ProTaper <b>rotary</b> files <b>up</b> to #F 3 as a master apical file (MAF) and divided randomly into groups A and B based on canal obturation technique. In group A (n = 29) the root canals were obturated with single-cone technique with #F 3 (30 /. 09) ProTaper gutta-percha, which was matched with MAF in relation to diameter, taper and manufacturer; in group B (n = 29) the canals were obturated with gutta-percha using cold lateral compaction technique. In both groups AH plus sealer were used. After two weeks of incubation, three 2 -mm slices were prepared at a distance of 2 mm from the coronal surface and push-out test was carried out. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics using independent samples t-test. Results. There were statistically significant differences between two groups. The mean push-out bond strength was higher in group B (lateral compaction technique) compared to group A (single-cone technique; P < 0. 05). Conclusion.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} {{the ability of a}} silicon-based root canal sealer, compared to zinc oxide and eugenol and an epoxy resin-based sealers, for filling of simulated lateral canals. Thirty extracted single-rooted human teeth were selected, conventional access was made and the working length was established 1 mm from the apical foramen. Three simulated lateral canals, one in each root third (coronal, middle and apical) were prepared in both the mesial and distal surfaces of each tooth using a size 15 reamer adapted to a low-speed handpiece. Each root canal was instrumented using ProTaper <b>rotary</b> files <b>up</b> to file F 3 at the working length, and then irrigated with 2. 5 % NaOCl followed by EDTA. The teeth were assigned to 3 groups (n= 10), according to the root canal sealer: Roeko Seal (Group 1), Sealer 26 (group 2) and Grossman's sealer (Group 3). Gutta-percha cold lateral condensation technique was performed in all groups. Postoperative radiographs were taken and the images were projected for evaluation of the quality of lateral canal filling. Data were submitted to statistical analysis by Kruskal Wallis test at 5 % significance level. The results showed that Grossman's sealer filled a larger number of lateral canals than Roeko Seal (p< 0. 05) and Sealer 26 (p< 0. 01). It may be concluded that Roeko Seal silicone-based root canal sealer was not as effective as the Grossman's sealer for filling of simulated lateral canals.

Material and Methods The root canals of one hundred and five extracted single-rooted teeth were instrumented using Reciproc <b>rotary</b> files <b>up</b> to size R 40. The teeth were split longitudinally. Two of the three standard grooves were created in the coronal and apical section of one segment, and another in the middle part of the second segment. The standardized grooves were filled with CH and the root halves were reassembled. After 14 days, the specimens were randomly divided into 7 experimental groups (n= 15 /group). CH was removed as follows: Group 1 : beveled needle irrigation; Group 2 : double side-vented needle irrigation; Group 3 : CanalBrush; Group 4 : XP-endo Finisher; Group 5 : Vibringe; Group 6 : PUI; Group 7 : LAI. The amount of remaining CH in the grooves was scored under a stereomicroscope at 20 × magnification. Statistical evaluation was performed using Kruskal–Wallis and Bonferroni-Correction Mann–Whitney U tests. Results Groups 1 and 2 were the least efficient in eliminating CH from the grooves. Groups 6 and 7 eliminated more CH than the other protocols; however, no significant differences were found between these two groups (P>. 05). Conclusions Nevertheless, none of the investigated protocols were able to completely remove all CH from all three root regions. LAI and PUI showed less residual CH than the other protocols from artificial grooves...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{in vitro}} the fracture resistance {{of two different}} post systems, a conventional one with post space preparation using a drill and an alternative one adapted to the canal shape. Methodology: After sample size calculation, the crowns of 26 single-rooted freshly-extracted teeth were removed with a disc 1 mm coronal to the cemento-enamel junction. The canals were shaped with Mtwo <b>rotary</b> files <b>up</b> to size 40, 0. 06 tpaer and filled with the continuous wave of condensation technique leaving the coronal 9 mm of the canal unfilled. After the post space preparation by a dedicated drill, double-tapered fibre posts (DT Light-Post) were cemented in half of the roots (G 1, n = 13). 0. 06 tapered fibre posts (Tech S Endoshape) were trimmed to fit the canal of the remaining roots (G 2, n = 13) and then cemented without post space preparation. A self- adhesive cement (RelyX Unicem) was used in both groups. The posts were cut 5 mm from the root coronal surface. The specimens were embedded in acrylic resin {{and the top of}} the post was loaded under continuous compressive force (45 °, 0. 75 mm/min) to measure the maximum breaking load (N). Data were statistically analyzed by using a Student’s t-test (α = 0. 05). Results: The mean maximum breaking loads ±SD were G 1 = 164. 07 ± 21. 54 and G 2 = 151. 22 ± 14. 69. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 093). Only post fractures were detected, with all the roots remaining intact. Conclusions: Within the limitation of the study, conservative posts without post space preparation performed similarly to conventional ones.

On December 3, 1936, she bought a tract that gave the camp an unbroken shoreline of 7250 ft and a total of 137½ acres of land for the camp. In 1934 Mrs. Eastman began construction on a stone lodge in memory of her husband. She spread the mortar herself and laid the cornerstone in 1935. In 1942 construction took place for a home for the camp ranger. And In 1943 she provided a concrete block building; half to be used for recreation and a canteen and the other half for storage, nicknamed the Bee Hive. The Order of Eagles contributed $800.00 to build four sleeping cabins and later on in 1943, they gave an additional sum to re-roof and refit these buildings. The group of buildings was known as the [...] "Eagles' Nest". The V.F.W. of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa gave funds for a Troop cabin, which was used to house the summer Camp Staff.|$|R
40|$|AIM To {{investigate}} {{the adaptation of}} new generation fiber post compared with prefabricated glass fiber postsMATERIAL AND METHODS The experiment was performed by two experienced clinicians, the former performed endodontic therapies and the latter post restorations. The clinical crowns of twenty human extracted teeth were sectioned at the cemento-enamel junction. The canals were shaped with MTwo NiTi <b>rotary</b> files <b>up</b> to 25. 07. Root canals were filled with guttapercha points with vertical condensation technique up to 5 mm to the apex. The middle and coronal part of the canal were cleaned with GG burs 1 - 4, used with very light touch. Adhesion technique, using 4 th generation adhesives was performed. With a random number generator, {{at this point the}} roots were divided into two groups, 10 teeth each, A and B; group A was restored with a prefabricated fiber post, group B with a new generation Ever-stick post, made of preimpregnated fibers that can be packed into the canal. Both types of posts were cemented with flowable auto-photo composite, which was allowed to set for 15 minutes. The roots were then sectioned 3 mm from the coronal end with a rotating disk, polished and photographed with a camera on a fixed mount. The images were processed with software that allowed to measure the cement thickness from fibers to dentin, with 8 measures for each specimen. The numeric data were processed with a statistical program in order to evaluate differences between groups and its significance (quantitative analysis). Qualitative analysis was performed by two experienced independent observers, the accordance of whom was evaluated with Cohen K test, that gave to each specimen a score 0 - 3, accordingly to {{the presence or absence of}} defects, such as voids in the material or lack of adherence to dentinal walls. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used to identify differences in the groups. RESULTS New generation fiber posts are a valuable alternative to preformed fiber posts...|$|R
40|$|Trabalho final do 5 º ano com vista à atribuição do grau de mestre no âmbito do ciclo de estudos de Mestrado Integrado em Medicina Dentária apresentado à Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra. This study {{evaluated}} by {{scanning electron microscopy}} the interface between calcium silicate-based endodontic materials (MTA and Biodentine™) and root canal dentine using three different irrigation protocols. Root canals of 66 human teeth were subjected to biomechanical preparation with ProTaper <b>rotary</b> instruments <b>up</b> to a finish file F 4. The teeth were assigned into six groups according to the irrigation protocol and obturation material employed: 1 A. NaOCl + MTA; 1 B. NaOCl + Biodentine ™; 2 A. NaOCl/NaCl/EDTA + MTA; 2 B. NaOCl/NaCl/EDTA + Biodentine™; 3 A. NaOCl/NaCl/CHX + MTA; 3 B. NaOCl/NaCl/CHX + Biodentine™. After obturation teeth were stored for 5 days at 37 ⁰C in a moist environment to allow the set of sealers. One section of 3 mm thick {{was obtained from the}} apical third. The specimens were immersed in PBS for 5 days. After this period of time, one specimen of each group was sectioned longitudinally into two symmetrical pieces. One of the two halves - the one with the material - was processed for morphological observation, element mapping and chemical analysis along the dentine-material interface using SEM and EDS. Along the material-dentine interface, both materials formed a tag-like structure that was more evident in groups where EDTA was used for final irrigation protocol. Apatite crystal formation was visible along the interface and within the interfacial dentine in all groups. The Ca depth was constantly larger than the Si depth but the uptake of Si was more prominent in all groups for Biodentine™. Both Biodentine™ and MTA caused the uptake of Ca and Si in the adjacent root canal dentine in the presence of PBS. The dentine element uptake for Si was more prominent in Biodentine™ than in MTA...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{assumption}} that changes to earthworm communities subsequently affect macroporosity and then soil water infiltration, we carried out a 3 year study of the earthworm communities in a experimental site having six experimental treatments: 2 tillage management systems and 3 cropping systems. The tillage management was either conventional (CT; annual mouldboard ploughing up to − 30 cm depth) or reduced (RT; <b>rotary</b> harrow <b>up</b> to − 7 cm depth). The 3 cropping systems were established to obtain {{a wide range of}} soil compaction intensities depending on the crop rotations and the rules of decision making. In the spring of 2005, the impact of these different treatments on earthworm induced macroporosity and water infiltration was studied. During the 3 years of observation, tillage management had a significant effect on bulk density (1. 27 in CT and 1. 49 mg m− 3 in RT) whereas cropping system had a significant effect on bulk density in RT plots only. Tillage management did not significantly affect earthworm abundance but significantly influenced the ecological type of earthworms found in each plot (anecic were more abundant in RT). On the contrary cropping system did have a significant negative effect on earthworm abundance (104 and 129 ind. m− 2 in the less and most compacted plots, respectively). Significantly higher numbers of Aporrectodea giardi and lower numbers of Aporrectodea caliginosa were found in the most compacted plots. CT affected all classes of porosity leading to a significant {{decrease in the number of}} pores and their continuity. Only larger pores, with a diameter superior to 6 mm, however, were adversely affected by soil compaction. Tillage management did not change water infiltration, probably because the increase in macroporosity in RT plots was offset by a significant increase in soil bulk density. However, cropping system had a significant effect on water infiltration (119 vs 79 mm h− 1 in the less and most compacted plots, respectively). In RT plots, a significant correlation was observed between larger macropores (diameter > 6 mm) and water infiltration illustrating the potential positive effect of earthworms in these plot...|$|R
