5000|$|The {{choice of}} solvent {{can play a}} vital role in the {{formation}} of the carbene species. One example of such interactions was reported by Basset, et al. regarding <b>RuCl3</b> and the effects of various alcohols on its catalytic activity. Depending upon the alcohol used, the mechanistic pathway resulted in either a reactive ruthenium-hydride species or the formation of a ruthenium-carbene. Experimental results demonstrated that by altering the solvent, the molecular weight of the polymer produced was either increased or decreased. This observation could result in increased diversity of the catalytic system enabling the production of polymers of various strengths, as polymers with higher molecular weights are typically stronger than polymers of low molecular weights. [...] Drastic differences in the rate of the reaction were also observed, thereby supporting the conclusion that the solvent plays a role in the formation of the ruthenium-carbene.|$|E

It was observed that the intensities of the Ru(III) signals in the ESR spectra decrease on the time scale of the induction period so that the ROMP can take place. The intensity of the Ru(III) signal almost disappeared 50 min after reacting with K(2) [RuCl(5) H(2) O] and after 100 mm {{in the case of}} <b>RuCl(3).</b> Reactions of the cis-[Ru(NH(3)) (4) (H(2) O) (2) ](tfms) (3) and [Ru(NH(3)) (5) H(2) O](tfms) (3) complexes with the monomer and different organic compounds representing the organic functions in the monomer (furan, norbornene, but- 2 -ene- 1, 4 -diol and formic, acetic, oxalic and maleic acids) were also monitored by ESR and UV/vis spectra.

The addition of PVP appears not to be necessary for the in situ preparation of the supported systems. The synthesized nanocatalysts were characterized by UV-Vis, TEM and XPS measurements: colloidal and supported nanoparticles with an average diameter about 2 nm and a narrow distribution of sizes were obtained.

The activities of methanol and CO electrocatalytic oxidation were analysed, and the reaction mechanism of methanol electro-oxidation on Pt/RuO(2) MnO(2) /CNTs catalyst was discussed. The MnO(2) in the catalysts improves the proton conductivity and electrochemical active surface area (EAS) for the catalysts. RuO(2) improves the CO oxidation activity and Pt dispersion.
