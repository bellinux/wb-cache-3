5|$|As Naiad, Triton and Alcmene {{streamed}} past {{in pursuit}} of Santa Brigida, Young focused his attention on Thetis, coming within range at 11:30. Mendoza, seeing that battle was inevitable, bore up across Ethalions bows {{in an effort to}} rake Young's ship. Young turned in order to thwart the manoeuvre and fired two rapid broadsides into Thetis, which responded in kind. For an hour the frigates exchanged <b>running</b> <b>fire</b> until Mendoza, realising escape was impossible, surrendered. Thetis had lost one man killed and nine wounded in the exchange while Ethalion had suffered no casualties.|$|E

They proceeded {{to keep up}} a <b>running</b> <b>fire</b> on these vessels for about two hours, while enduring fire from shore batteries. Eventually, the two British vessels hauled off, fearful of running aground on the Stroom sand, having succeeded in driving only one Dutch vessel aground, but having sustained no casualties themselves.|$|E
2500|$|His successor, George Hollis, {{enjoyed a}} {{fortunate}} visit to Bootle in the Alliance. The Liverpool Mercury reported the referee {{was not in}} a position to spot that Hollis had caught Jamieson's low shot [...] "apparently... a foot over the line", and Caesar Jenkyns' first-half goal decided the contest. A [...] "storm of wind and rain" [...] reduced the attendance for the visit to local rivals Birmingham St George's to around 500, but those few present accompanied the play with [...] "a <b>running</b> <b>fire</b> of vigorously-expressed comments", and on each occasion that Jenkyns ended up on the ground, [...] "his downfall appeared to give unspeakable pleasure to the home supporters, who rejoiced greatly as he gradually became plastered in mud from head to foot." [...] After two goals were disallowed for offside, St George's won an understandably poor game with a single legitimate goal, scored late on.|$|E
50|$|A {{new feature}} in the series is {{adaptive}} camouflage, which allows the Ghosts to become partially invisible. In the game, it is explained that the processing power doesn't exist yet for the camouflage {{to keep up with}} quick movements, so it is only active when the player moves slowly. It's enabled automatically when the player crouches, and disengages when <b>running,</b> <b>firing</b> or taking damage.|$|R

2500|$|When {{it became}} more clear what was {{happening}} to the Aztecs outside the Temple, the alarm was sounded.

6000|$|... "It {{was in this}} way," [...] said Phipps, and {{explained}} rather sheepishly.

60|$|For over an {{hour the}} <b>running</b> <b>fire</b> kept up. Neither ship dared to put on full speed, for fear of running into a mine.

But the ship's carpenter and his crew got at the leak immediately, driving in a wedge which quickly stopped the flow of water.|$|E

50|$|Left {{without a}} visionary governor, budgets were {{cut for the}} colony. The new {{regulations}} of 1 November 1819 reduced the budget to the minimum necessary to keep the colony <b>running,</b> <b>fired</b> all unnecessary colonial officers, and pensioned {{of most of the}} slaves of the state. Most notably, the offices of bookkeeper, fiscal, secretary, cashier, and bailiff were combined into one office, the summation of functions actually being the office-holder's title (Dutch: boekhouder, fiscaal, secretaris, kassier en deurwaarder). Also, the office of Governor-General was demoted to Commander. When the Dutch decided to recruit soldiers for the Dutch East Indies Army in 1836, the government was strengthened again, something which was reinforced {{in the wake of the}} destastrous Ahanta War of 1838. By virtue of a royal decree dated 23 March 1838, the office of Commander was raised to Governor and extra officers were installed to make the government more effective. The government itself was reformed in 1847, which among its most notable inventions included the establishment of a Court of Justice, legally separate from the Council, although memberships often overlapped. The office of fiscal, responsible for public prosecution, was renamed Officer of Justice.|$|R
