50|$|Males {{tend to have}} larger, longer, {{and wider}} noses than females, and {{the tip of the}} female nose will often visibly point {{slightly}} upwards when compared to a male, so the procedure involves <b>removing</b> <b>bone,</b> <b>cartilage</b> <b>and</b> remodelling what remains. In most cases this is performed in an open procedure, but endonasal procedures have been used; in all cases when reducing the nose there is a risk of interfering with nasal valve function. Standard rhinoplasty procedures are generally used. There is limited data on outcomes.|$|R

40|$|Patients with foot deformation, {{cartilage}} wear or a badly healed calcaneus fracture often {{suffer from}} severe {{pain in the}} foot. After fixation of the subtalar joint, which stabilizes motion, most patients can walk without pain again. Because the curtent operation is an open approach, {{it is difficult to}} reach the entire joint space <b>and</b> to <b>remove</b> all <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage.</b> To improve the operation technique, a minimally invasive technique was developed. Because the joint is curved and the current shavers are straight, the instrument has to allow for this. To this end, a new instrument was developed: The Tuijthof flexible instrument. The Tuijthof flexible instrument has anisotropic stiffness. It is flexible in the bending direction and is stiff in lateral direction, so the surgeon can stir the instrument. Tissue is removed by a drill. The instrument is promising, but still too flexible. In bending direction the stiffness is 10 N/m, a value between 83 N/m and 167 N/m is desirable. In lateral direction the stiffness is 1. 90 - 10 ^ N/m, it should be larger than 2. 5 - 103 N/m. Also during tests, glued connections between the wires and rings broke loose. The goal of this master's thesis is to design a single-piece compliant mechanism and to optimize the dimensions of the shaft.

A total of 20 patients of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> were assessed: 10 abatacept with methotrexate (MTX) -treated RA patients were compared with 10 MTX-treated RA patients (control). The histology of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> was observed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed immunohistochemically for the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 6, CD 4 (T cell), CD 68 (macrophage), receptor activator of nuclear kappa-B ligand, osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, CD 29 (β- 1 integrin), phospho-p 38 MAPK (Tyr 180 /Tyr 182), phospho-p 44 / 42 MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, ERK 1 /ERK 2), and phosphor-c-Jun N-terminal kinase. The expressions of CD 29 known as mechanoreceptor and ERK known as mechanotransduction signal protein in MAP kinases in the <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> of patients treated with abatacept were significantly different from those of control.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between structural changes of trabecular <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage,</b> in patients with varying degrees of osteoarthritis (OA) over 2 years, using magnetic resonance imaging. MethodsHigh-resolution, axial images were acquired for assessing trabecular bone structure, using a 3 -D fast gradient-echo sequence. High-resolution, fat-suppressed, sagittal images were acquired for assessing cartilage structure, using a 3 -D spoiled gradient-echo sequence. In a subset of the patients, sagittal images were acquired for measuring T 2 relaxation time, using a 2 -D dual-echo spin echo sequence. ResultsA large variation in <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> parameters is evident among individual subjects in each group, however, group-specific means demonstrate decreasing trends (in <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> parameters) in osteoarthritic subjects (especially in mild OA subjects). The mean T 2 increased significantly (P< 0. 05) between the baseline and follow-up exams for all cartilage compartments except the lateral tibia. A positive relationship was established between <b>cartilage</b> changes <b>and</b> localized <b>bone</b> changes closest to the joint line, while a negative relationship was established between <b>cartilage</b> changes <b>and</b> global <b>bone</b> changes farthest from the joint line. ConclusionThis study quantifies the changes in <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> structural parameters over time, and demonstrates a longitudinal relationship between the morphological changes in <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> structure in patients with varying degrees of OA.

40|$|Summary: Reasons for {{performing}} the study: Lateral condylar (LC) fractures {{of the third}} metacarpus (McIII) are a common reason for euthanasia in racehorses, and {{may be the result}} of repetitive overloading or cumulative pathological change. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows monitoring of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> to detect pathological and adaptive changes that may be precursors of fracture. Objectives: To describe <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> MRI features in the distal condyles of McIII of Thoroughbred racehorses, with and without condylar fracture. Hypotheses: 1) A greater degree of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> adaptation or pathology will be seen in fractured McIIIs compared with their respective contralateral McIIIs. 2) Contralateral McIIIs will have a greater degree of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> adaptation or pathology than McIIIs from control horses that did not sustain a LC fracture. Methods: The McIIIs from 96 horses subjected to euthanasia at racecourses were divided into 3 groups: Group 1 : nonfractured bones from horses without LC fracture; Group 2 : nonfractured bones from horses with unilateral LC fracture; and Group 3 : fractured bones from horses with unilateral LC fracture.

Arthroscopic findings <b>and</b> histopathology of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> <b>cartilage</b> <b>removed</b> from elbow joints with CD were compared.
