40|$|Abstract: Production of organic, biologically {{valuable}} {{food is a}} {{trend in}} the World today, and in our country it can be successfully realized in production of meat and milk from small ruminants, sheep and goats in hilly-mountainous region. Namely, grasslands in these <b>regions</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>preserved</b> from the utilization of mineral fertilizers and chemical preparations for plant protection, therefore production of healthy food is still possible with minimum investments. The quality of plant mass is very important, i. e. presence of high quality plant species in the grassland, as well as possibility for increase of their percentage in the grassland. For this purpose, research was carried out and plant associations most present on Stara Planina Mountain on altitude of 650 to 1200 m were analyzed from the aspect of phytocenology. On these locations recordings were made and samples wer...|$|R

Absence of a massive fibrotic scar on the LV posterior wall and positioning of the pacing lead in the optimal coronary vein (a posterolateral vein) might have been positive factors determining this patient's response to CRT...|$|R
40|$|A 450 year spring-summer flood layer {{time series}} at {{seasonal}} resolution {{has been established}} from the varved sediment record of Lake Ammersee (southern Germany), applying a novel methodological approach. The main results are (1) the attainment of a precise chronology by microscopic varve counting, (2) the identification of detrital layers representing flood-triggered fluxes of catchment material into the lake, and (3) {{the recognition of the}} seasonality of these flood layers from their microstratigraphic position within a varve. Tracing flood layers in a proximal and a distal core and correlating them by application of the precise chronology provided information on the depositional processes. Comparing the seasonal flood layer record with daily runoff data of the inflowing River Ammer for the period from 1926 to 1999 allowed the definition of an approximate threshold in flood magnitude above which the formation of flood layers becomes very likely. Moreover, it was possible {{for the first time to}} estimate the "completeness" of the flood layer time series and to recognize that mainly floods in spring and summer, representing the main flood seasons in this <b>region,</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>preserved</b> in the sediment archive. Their frequency distribution over the entire 450 year time series is not stationary but reveals maxima for colder periods of the Little Ice Age when solar activity was reduced. The observed spring-summer flood layer frequency further shows trends similar to those of the occurrence of flood-prone weather regimes since A. D. 1881, probably suggesting a causal link between solar variability and changes in midlatitude atmospheric circulation patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Aim: Chlorophyll-a may be {{directly}} influenced by local variables and/or indirectly by {{land use and}} cover, once landscape modifications change limnological variables, which in turn affect the primary productivity of aquatic environments, e. g., streams. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to determine the relative importance of the local and landscape environmental components and assess the direct and indirect effects of these variables on sestonic chlorophyll-a concentration in 30 Cerrado streams (Santa Teresa River basin). Results All aquatic environments were oligotrophic during the study period. Only the local variables were important to explain chlorophyll-a variation (R 2 = 0. 27; P = 0. 04). In addition, the path analysis showed that all variables used in the analysis influenced chlorophyll-a concentration more directly than indirectly. Conductivity was the most important variable to directly influence chlorophyll-a, followed by turbidity. Conclusion The large amount of remnant native vegetation in the basin indicates that the <b>region</b> studied <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>preserved,</b> which may explain the greater importance of local variables and the low effect of the landscape in explaining chlorophyll-a variation...|$|R
40|$|The {{output of}} {{sequence}} data from worldwide sequencing centers {{has been rising}} at an exponential rate {{for the past decade}} or two. The first two publications of microbial whole genome sequencing projects appeared in 1995. To date (April 2004), there are 186 published complete genomes as well as 490 prokaryotic and 415 eukaryotic ongoing genome sequencing projects. Comparative genomics is concerned with comparing genomic sequences to each other. If the organisms under consideration are closely related (that is, if no or only a few genome rearrangements have occurred) or one compares regions of conserved synteny (regions in which orthologous genes occur in the same order), then global alignments can be used for the prediction of genes and regulatory elements. This <b>is</b> because coding <b>regions</b> <b>are</b> relatively <b>well</b> <b>preserved,</b> while non-coding regions tend to show varying degree of conservation. Non-coding regions that do show conservation are thought important for regulating gene expression, maintaining the structural organization of the genome and possibly have other, yet unknown functions. Several comparative sequence approaches using alignments have recently been used to analyze corresponding coding and non-coding regions from differen...|$|R

40|$|Speaker {{recognition}} in noisy environments is challenging {{when there is}} a mis-match in the data used for enrollment and veri-fication. In this paper, we propose a robust feature extraction scheme based on spectro-temporal modulation filtering using two-dimensional (2 -D) autoregressive (AR) models. The first step is the AR modeling of the sub-band temporal envelopes by the application of the linear prediction on the sub-band dis-crete cosine transform (DCT) components. These sub-band en-velopes are stacked together and used for a second AR mod-eling step. The spectral envelope across the sub-bands is ap-proximated in this AR model and cepstral features are derived which are used for speaker recognition. The use of AR models emphasizes the focus on the high energy <b>regions</b> which <b>are</b> rel-atively <b>well</b> <b>preserved</b> in the presence of noise. The degree of modulation filtering is controlled using AR model order param-eter. Experiments are performed using noisy versions of NIST 2010 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) data with a state-of-art speaker recognition system. In these experiments, the proposed features provide significant improvements compared to baseline features (relative improvements of 20 % in terms of equal error rate (EER) and 35 % in terms of miss rate at 10 % false alarm) ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the coast}} along the Sea of Japan, oil bearing Tertiarys are {{scattered}} from Niigata to Akita Prefectures and other fossiliferous Tertiarys are found sporadically in Hokuriku region. The present author initially intended to clarify a biostratigraphy of these regions {{by means of}} calcareous nannofossils. But the scarcity of the calcareous nannofossils, especially in Niigata and Oga regions, didn't satisfy his initial expectation. Nevertheless he obtained some results through the research of the nannofossils. Outlines of them are as follows: 1) On the coast along the Sea of Japan, Neogene calcareous nannofossils appear from the late Nishikurosawa stage (middle Miocene) to the early Shibikawa stage (late Pliocene). 2) Calcareous nannofossil assemblages of the Oga and Nishiyama oil field regions have a great difference from the one of Hokuriku region. 3) Calcareous nannofossil assemblages of the Oga and Nishiyama oil field regions have simple floral composition, minority and ill state of preservation. 4) In Hokuriku region the sediments of the Onnagawa (middle Miocene) and Funakawa (late Miocene) stages yield plentiful and <b>well</b> <b>preserved</b> calcareous nannofossils. 5) Nannofossil assemblage from the Shichiba formation in Sado Island has an interim aspect of the both assemblages. 6) Onnagawan and Funakawan calcareous nannofossil assemblages in Hokuriku region have indistinctly an aspect of Paleogene or early Miocene assemblages. 7) On the coast along the Sea of Japan many discoasters were extinct in the late Funakawa stage except Discoaster brouweri. 8) On the coast along the Sea of Japan the Kitauran (latest Miocene) is very scarce in calcareous nannofossils. 9) Wakimotoan (early Pliocene) calcareous nannofossil assemblages in Hokuriku <b>region</b> <b>are</b> plentiful and <b>well</b> <b>preserved,</b> and they have many common species of the Japanese Pacific coast Neogene. 10) Coccolithus pelagicus (WALLICH) is a conspicuous species in the Neogene assemblages of the coast along the Sea of Japan.

40|$|The {{north coast}} of the Brazilian states of Para, and Maranhao, {{presents}} a large continuous belt of mangroves, covering an area of about 700 000 ha. Although mangroves in this <b>region</b> <b>are</b> relatively <b>well</b> <b>preserved,</b> expanding tourism, intensification of fisheries and of urban growth in the region may endanger this important coastal ecosystem. In spite of the immense area covered by mangrove forest, very few is known about species distribution and forest ecology in the region. The present study focuses on the growth dynamics of the mangrove species Rhizophora mangle L. under different conditions of inundation frequency, salinity and rainfall regime on the north coast of Brazil. The study concentrates on: 1) evidence of seasonality in primary production, reflected in phenology, litter fall and interactions with herbivores; 2) application of dendrochronological methods on R. mangle, including determination of tree age and influence of climatic and site-specific factors on tree growth; 3) applying these findings {{in an analysis of}} forest structure and dynamics on Ajuruteua Peninsula. Wood samples for dendrochronology were taken at three points along the coast of Para: Viseu, Sao Joao de Pirabas and Braganca. Detailed studies of phenology and litter fall, herbivory, forest structure and forest evolution were developed at different sites on Ajuruteua Peninsula, Braganca district. A study on litter fall and phenology demonstrated that rainfall seasonality is reflected in mangrove tree primary production. The description of a severe infestation by moth larvae in mangrove forests demonstrated that, besides climate and site-specific conditions, herbivory can be substantially influence the primary production. The wood of all studied specimens of R. mangle showed distinct rings. The rings were formed by a light and a dark layer. The light layer, formed {{at the end of the}} rainy season, is the result of a higher density of vessels; the dark layer, formed at the end of the dry season. The increase or decrease of vessels may be a reaction to seasonal salinity variation. Radiocarbon analysis showed that growth rings are annual. This allowed to the determination of tree age. The oldest tree was 111 years old. Growth curves revealed a linear growth (absence of trend-age). Growth rates varied strongly. The highest (however, not significantly different) rates were found at the sector of the Para coast with the highest tidal amplitudes, suggesting an influence of the tide on tree growth. The relationship between rainfall and growth was not easily interpretable, however, growth was positively correlated to rainfall in some areas. A presumed influence of rainfall may have been superimposed by the impact of other factors as salinity and input of fresh water. Growth rates on Ajuruteua Peninsula were highly variable. Trees were tentatively divided in three groups (fast, medium and slow growth). Although trees from each study sitecould occur in more than one group, there is an obvious trend that trees from frequently inundated areas dominate the group with the highest growth rate. Considering that all sites are submitted to similar climatic conditions, the absence of fast growing trees at certain sites may be due to the influence of local factors (e. g. salinity, inundation frequency or also neighbourhood competition among trees). It is assumed that neighbourhood competition is an important source of within-site variability of growth rates. The determination of the age of forest stands in combination with a classical study of forest structure allowed to propose a model of forest succession. This study demonstrated that the combination of forest structure surveys and dendrochronological methods provided informations concerning trees growth and forest development that were up to now not available. The application of these informations in mangrove forest management and preservation is suggested. In spite of the weak correlations between tree growth and climatic factors, dendrochronology may also help to understand changes of coastal vegetation within the past decades...|$|R
