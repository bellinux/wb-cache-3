40|$|This study aims at the {{development}} of a micromechanical model for structural composites using the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin method (MLPG) to predict the stiffness properties, and the shear correction factors of structural composites from the analysis of the representative volume element (RVE). Micromechanical analysis of structural composites is possible due to the presence of the RVE also called the unit cell. On the microscale, comparable to the scale of unit cell, the composite is heterogeneous due to the presence of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>yarn</b> and the matrix. However, on the macroscale, compared to the structural scale, the composite is assumed to be homogeneous and orthotropic. The homogeneous composite properties are then predicted from the properties of the constituent materials and their distribution. The highlight of the study is the treatment of some challenging problems in the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin method-based micromechanical analysis of structural composites. The unit cell is discretized and periodic boundary conditions are set up and imposed between opposite end-faces of the unit cell, essential boundary conditions are enforced by the penalty method. The treatment of material discontinuities at the interfaces between different phases of the composite is presented by means of the direct imposition of interface boundary conditions. In addition, an algorithm for handling of periodic boundary conditions in the MLPG method using the multipoint constraint technique is also presented. The MLPG formulation is presented for the six linearly independent deformations of the unit cell. From the forces acting on the unit cell for each of the six deformations, the elastic constants of the composite can be computed. In this study, a micromechanical model using both the finite element method and the MLPG method is suggested to predict the flexural stiffness properties and the shear correction factors for a class of composite beam problems including textile composite beams. Examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the current method, and it is validated by comparing the results with available analytical and numerical solutions. The current method shows great potential for applications in micromechanics, especially for textile composites...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{report that}} a {{prestressing}} technique {{similar to that}} traditionally used in prestressed concrete can improve the mechanical performance of flax fibre spun <b>yarn</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer-matrix composites. Prestressing a low twist yarn not only introduces tension to the constituent fibres and compressive stress to the matrix similar as in prestressed concretes, but also causes changes to the yarn structure {{that lead to the}} rearrangement of fibres within the yarn. Prestressing increases the fibre packing density in yarn, causes fibre straightening, and reduces fibre obliquity in yarn (improved fibre alignment along yarn axis). All these changes contribute positively to the mechanical properties of the natural fibre <b>yarn</b> <b>reinforced</b> composites. Crow...|$|R

Scaffolds were cultured in static conditions, during 28 days, with or without cell seeded or under dynamic conditions during 14 days in a bioreactor. Scaffolds’ biocompatibility and proliferation were investigated with Alamar Blue tests and cell nuclei staining.

They are manufactured by mechanically or chemically reinforcing a fabric consisting of fiber layers {{or a combination of}} fiber, weaving, yarn or textile layers. Also, unconventional textiles can be obtained by mechanically or chemically <b>reinforcing</b> a <b>yarn</b> pattern or multiple yarn patterns. The tendency of the industry to increase production of synthetic fibers în comparison to natural fibers is also visible în the field of unconventional textiles. Additionally, there is more and more emphasis on using fibers recovered from recycled materials and products which resulted from a classic textile manufacturing process. A TUFTING product is made from a backing fabric, usually cloth, <b>reinforced</b> with <b>yarn</b> introduced through the fabric in loops spaced equally relative to the stitches, and raised at the ends. The fur substitutes can also be obtained with unconventional TUFTING technologies, by reinforcing a backing cloth and then undergoing a final reinforcement by raising and felting on one side.

40|$|Hybrid {{systems with}} two or more fiber {{materials}} were used to combine the benefits of each fiber into a single composite product. Strength and toughness optimization of hybrid thin sheet composites has been studied extensively using combination of different fiber types with low and high modulus of elasticity. Hybrid reinforcement is more significant when the reinforcing structure is in fabric geometry. Fabric structure provides full control on {{the exact location of}} each yarn and its orientation in the composite during production, thus maximizes the reinforcing efficiency. A high-strength, high-modulus fiber primarily tends to increase the composite strength with nominal improvements in toughness. A low-modulus fiber expected to mainly improve toughness and ductility. Combination of two or more types of fiber can produce a composite that is both strong and tough as compared to a mono fiber composite. The purpose of the current work was to study hybrid warp knitted fabrics as reinforcement for cementbased composite, having AR (Alkali Resistance) glass and Polypropylene (PP) as the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>yarns.</b> The examined ratios between the two different yarns were 0 : 100, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25, 100 : 0 (glass: PP, by percentage).

This article describes a statistical-mechanical model which introduces the possibility to simulate heterogeneity in bond proper- ties.

Bernet et al. (1999) conducted a resin impregnation analysis for the CY method to evaluated the quality of the molded article with the void content. Lin et al.

However, in the case of complex and strongly curved components, draping leads to undesired distortions of the stitch and reinforcement structures. In addition, shaping by draping often requires much time and manual effort.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate the effect of introducing jute yarn on the mechanical properties of concrete. Jute fibre is produced abundantly in Bangladesh and hence, very cheap. The investigation on the enhancement of mechanical properties of concrete with jute yarn as reinforcement, if enhanced, will not only explore a way to improve the properties of concrete, it will also explore the use of jute and restrict the utilization of polymer which is environmentally detrimental. To accomplish the objective, an experimental investigation of the compressive, flexural and tensile strengths of Jute <b>Yarn</b> <b>Reinforced</b> Concrete composites (JYRCC) has been conducted. Cylinders, prisms and cubes of standard dimensions have been made to introducing jute yarn varying the mix ratio of the ingredients in concrete, water cement ratio, length and volume of yarn to know the effect of parameters as mentioned. Compressive, flexural and tensile strength tests had been conducted on the prepared samples by appropriate testing apparatus following Standards of tests. Mechanical properties of JYRCC were observed to be enhanced for a particular range of lengths of cut (10, 15, 20 and 25  mm) and volume content of jute yarn (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75  %). The maximum increment of compressive, flexural and tensile strengths observed in the investigation are 33, 23 and 38  %, respectively with respect to concrete without jute yarn.|$|R
40|$|Preforms and {{composites}} {{manufactured by}} novel flax/polypropylene cowrap spinning method Jinhua Jiang 1, 2 and Nanliang Chen 1, 2 In the past decade, natural fiber composites with thermoplastic matrices have been embraced by many composite manufactures for its properties such as lightweight and low cost. <b>Reinforced</b> cowrap spinning <b>yarns</b> and thermoplastics offer {{a potential for}} low-cost manufacturing of complex-shaped and good, drapable composite parts, due to reduced impregnation times and resin flow distance during processing. In this article, the cowrap spinning yarns were produced by cowrap spinning method with flax and polypropylene (PP) and then woven to fabric preforms. The natural flax fibers were twistless in yarns and preforms, and PP served as a carrier for flax and prevented damage to flax fibers during processing, and became the polymer matrix in the final composites. To get an even distribution of fibers and thermo-plastic resins in preforms and different flax fiber content, the main spinning parameters (hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed) were analyzed and optimized. Besides fabric structure, the parameters affecting the mechanical properties of flax/PP preforms and composites were investigated. The fabric density, fabric structure (including plain, twill, and basket weave), and yarn tensile orientation (at 0, 90, and 45) had a great influence on the tensile strength and elongation of preforms. Different pretreatments on flax/PP were investigated, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of thermoplastic composites showed improved wettability of impregnation and good adhesion and bonding interface between flax fiber and PP matrix in composites...|$|R
40|$|The article {{reports on}} the {{successful}} processing of flax-reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA) profiles by thermoplastic pultrusion into sandwich' structures consisting of commingled yarns as outer layers and layers of nonwoven material in the core section. The results showed that a good quality matrix impregnation was obtained. The profiles produced from only commingled yarns had higher impact strengths due to yarns {{in the middle of}} the profiles; the matrix of which did not melt during pultrusion. The flexural properties of the composites improved with increasing nonwoven layers. Good PLA impregnation improved the flexural properties. The tensile strength of the sandwich' structures was much lower than that of commingled yarn-based composites, this being attributed to the poor distribution of flax fibres and poor interfacial adhesion leading to poor stress transfer from matrix to fibres. Crystallinity decreased as the number of nonwoven layers increased presumably due to blockage of nucleating sites essential for crystal growth. The storage modulus of composites <b>reinforced</b> with commingled <b>yarns</b> was greater than that of the composites reinforced with sandwich' material, confirming effective transfer of stress from matrix to the commingled flax yarns and indicating that increasing nonwoven layers decreased adhesion between reinforcement and the matrix. The effects of a wide range of pultrusion process parameters on the mechanical properties of resulting profiles were investigated. Higher die temperatures (290 degrees C) and lower pulling speeds (0. 5 mmin(- 1)) improved the mechanical properties due to better melting and lower viscosity of the matrix, enabling increased penetration within the reinforcement. Flexural and tensile properties of microwave-heated samples were very low due to fibre degradation. Scanning electron microscopic images showed that fibre impregnation was good in sandwich' systems, but fibre distribution remained a challenge...|$|R
40|$|Silk is rediscovered {{the past}} decade as a {{possible}} biomaterial. As a strong and flexible natural material that biodegrades slowly, which is promising for tissue engineering applications. Spider silk exceeds the mechanical properties of silkworm silk. In this research silkworm mechanical and biochemical test analyzed {{the differences between the}} different silk fibres. To establish the biomedical possibilities, the cytotoxicity of the fibres was tested by culturing cells attached to the fibres for several weeks. Next to the cytotoxicity, the biocompatibility is a necessity before a material can be used as an implant material. In vivo studies were performed by implanting steam sterilized spider silk fibres subcutaneous in white Whistar rats. The acute reaction showing lots of ganulocytes by histological examination could be diminished significantly by cleaning the fiber-surface with enzymes. Also the fibrotic formation around the implant was comparable to the widely accepted polyglactin material that was brought under the skin heterolateral to the silk fibres. Mechanical tests showed that trypsin could be used in contrast to proteinase K. Cocoon silk, spider dragline and egg sac silk were used as fibres and as proteinic polymers to create porous 3 D scaffolds for cartilage regeneration. Human chondrocytes were seeded on it and cultured for several weeks to establish the scaffolds are not cytotoxic and cells can migrate, attach, grow and express their ECM in the pores of the spider silk matrix. Immunohistochemistry showed that the seeded chondrocytes expressed collagen II an aggrecan up to 6 weeks, which are typical for cartilage extracellular matrix. In a lesser extent there was also collagen I, showing some cells dedifferentiated in the material. Creating scaffolds with different pore-sizes and porosity, it was described that this influenced the mechanical properties of the construct. Bigger pore-sizes have a better interconnectivity, which improves the migration of the cells after seeding, but smaller pores give the cells a better surrounding, which chondrocytes need to maintain their differentiation and to express their extracellular matrix. Adding the mechanical stimulation and growth factors these scaffolds can be used for cartilage regeneration. Silk scaffolds could be <b>reinforced</b> with silk <b>yarns</b> to use them for tendon or ligament regeneration and as the shape can be adjusted other applications as meniscus regeneration also belong to the possibilities...|$|R
30|$|According to the {{previous}} study (Mansur and Aziz 1982; Chakraborty 2013; Meddaha and Bencheikh 2009; Bezerra et al. 2004) a number of difficulties are encountered while mixing natural fibres to produce composite. For instance, Meddaha and Bencheikh (2009) mentioned that inhomogeneous distribution of fibres yields bulk and surface flaws. The stress concentration at these flaws would accelerate crack propagation which results lower fracture strength of the mortar specimens (Bezerra et al. 2004). Chakraborty (2013) also reported to use natural fibres in FRCC that the agglomeration could not be avoided. The amount of fibres that {{can be added to}} a mix is limited by the tendency of ‘bailing’ (Mansur and Aziz 1982) where the fibres frequently intermesh and form fibre balls which is critical to be separated. The bailing of fibres results in an ineffectual and segregated mix which produces a highly porous and honeycombed concrete. As a result, a remarkable strength fall of the concrete composite occurs. From the above elucidation, it can be concluded that the fibre mixing plays a vital role in the perfection of mechanical properties of fibre reinforced concrete composites. On the other hand, jute yarn processing covers a long process line during its manufacturing along with fibre opening, cleaning, faults removing and parallelizing (Muttaki 2013). Furthermore, the loose dust is eliminated by softener where dirt falls off and pieces of bark and stick become damaged from the jute fibre during the process (Atkinson 1985). Carding machine initiates the parallelizing of the jute fibre and eventually drafting and doubling section also adds value to it (Atkinson 1985). However, the effect of using jute yarn on the mechanical behaviour of concrete <b>reinforced</b> with jute <b>yarn</b> has yet to be investigated. Additionally, the use natural fibres in concrete made with crushed stone have been universally used. The use of crushed bricks are very common (Rashid et al. 2009) in Bangladesh, parts of India and some other countries having scarcity of stone. Additionally, the mechanical properties of concrete made with crushed bricks are quite different than those made with crushed stone (Mansur et al. 1999; Mohammed et al. 2015). Investigative studies have not yet been conducted to evaluate the effect jute fibre or jute yarn on the concrete made with crushed bricks. To this end, it is very much rationale to determine the effect for exploring potential use of jute for obtaining enhanced concrete with low cost, without affecting the environment and minimum health hazard. With this background, the main objective of the study is to develop jute yarn-reinforced concrete composites and to investigate the effect of yarn length and content (volume fraction) on its mechanical behaviour.|$|R
