The area is located approximately 3 to 4 miles from the Pacific Ocean, in a region genera 11 y thought of as possessing a mild climate. After preliminary work showed lowest minimum temperatures in valley bottoms, five shelters with <b>recording</b> <b>thermometers</b> were located at various exposures within the area. Previous studies have related frost pockets primarily to the drainage of cold air down hillsides. This factor is felt to be of less significance then strong outgoing radiation, inversion strength, {{and the absence of}} wind. Variations of minimum and maximum temperatures, daily range, and inversion strength are analyzed for the five locations. Results show that frosts occur frequently in and around two valleys but are almost entirely absent at a nearby slope and mountain peak. maximum temperatures are fairly uniform except at the mountain site. Following from this, daily ranges are abnormally high in the valleys and subdued at elevated exposures. Minimum temperature inversions between valleys and hills are correlated with clear and cloudy weather. The strongest inversions occur during clear, calm, and dry conditions...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>recording</b> <b>{{thermometer}}</b> {{is a type}} of thermometer that records temperature {{changes over}} a period of time. One end of the strip is attached to a long, light metal lever that holds a special pen. Tiny movement of the bimetallic strip causes much larger movement of the free end of the lever and the pen. The pen traces a rising and falling line on a strip of paper attached to a slowly turning drum. The drum usually makes one turn every seven or so days, so afterwards each strip of paper contains a complete and accurate record of temperature changes for a whole week. There are normally two types of metal on the bimetallic strip. Mostly one is steel and one is copper. Because these metals expand and contract at different rates.When one of these metals expand it curls tighter, when one contracts it uncurl slightly. When it curls or uncurls, the data is converted into electric signals, which record the temperature change.|$|E

40|$|In {{horizontal}} ground source {{heat pumps}} (GSHPs) systems heat exchangers are located underground horizontally and a heat carrying medium is circulated within the exchanger, transferring {{the heat from}} or to the ground via a heat pump.

The aim {{of this study is to}} model trends in temperatures around a real GSHP system under the influence of several weather parameters, including solar radiation, thermal radiation, and convective heat transfer, at the ground surface. The experimental ground source heat pump plant is installed at the Caleffi Research Center (Piedmont Region, NW Italy) and involves a network of pipes buried 1 m below the surface, covering an area of about 210 m 2. A numerical simulation model that considered the energy balance at the ground surface is developed using the finite-element Comsol Multiphysics® package; Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of the 3 D model geometry. Heat transfer processes at the ground surface included those due to variable wind speed, air temperature, solar radiation, and long-wave radiation. The thermal field is solved with transient conditions by determining the ground temperature distribution. Model results are compared with experimental temperature data, which are collected with a monitoring system comprised of five <b>recording</b> <b>thermometers,</b> positioned about 80 cm below the ground surface.

One hundred and eighty Isabrown birds with 19 weeks of age were reared in a conventional shed. The birds were allotted in a completely randomized design containing two treatments, six replicates and fifteen layers per experimental unit. The experiment was carried out within a period of 12 weeks, which was divided in three cycles of twenty eight days each. During this experimental period, rations and water were provided in a standard diet through nipple and continuous drinker systems. Referring variables were analyzed to the productive performance (production of eggs, weight gain, feed consumption and feed efficiency) and quality of the eggs (weigh, mass and content of eggs and Haugh Units). The highest water temperature values were observed in the nipple system, that reached 30, 5 ºC (average values), while in the continuous system it reached 24 ºC. There was not effect of the treatments on the daily egg production, egg mass, egg weight average, internal and external quality of eggs, feed intake on a hen-day basis and alimentary conversion. Two systems can be used for put up water for laying hens without compromising of the production and productivity. However, through the watering systems continuous drinker is possible water supplies to a more appropriate temperature, even though there is bigger waste. Este trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo da avaliar a eficiência de dois tipos de bebedouros (calha e “nipple”) para poedeiras semipesadas, nos meses quentes do ano de 2004. Para a determinação da temperatura da água, das 8 às 18 h, foram instalados termômetros de mercúrio com o bulbo inserido no interior da água em bebedouros tipo “nipple” e calha. Foram utilizadas 180 aves da linhagem Isabrown com 19 semanas de idade, alojadas em galpão convencional. As aves foram distribuídas em um delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com dois tratamentos, seis repetições e quinze aves por unidade experimental. O experimento teve duração de 12 semanas, subdividido em três ciclos de 28 dias. As aves receberam ração adequada para atender as exigências nutricionais e água por meio de bebedouros calha e “nipple”. Foram analisadas variáveis referentes ao desempenho produtivo (produção de ovos, ganho de peso, consumo e conversão alimentar) e qualidade interna e externa dos ovos. Os maiores valores de temperatura da água foram observados no sistema “nipple”, que atingiu 30, 5 ºC, em média, enquanto no sistema calha atingiu 24, 0 ºC. Não foi observado efeito dos tratamentos sobre a produção diária de ovos, massa, peso médio, qualidade interna e externa dos ovos, consumo de ração e conversão alimentar. Os dois sistemas podem ser utilizados para fornecer água para aves em postura sem comprometimento da produção e produtividade. Entretanto, por meio do sistema calha é possível fornecer água a uma temperatura mais adequada, embora haja maior desperdício...|$|R
