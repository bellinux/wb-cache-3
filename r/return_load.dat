Requiring a <b>return</b> <b>load,</b> {{the result was that}} Watchet became a leading UK port for the export of car parts, tractors and other industrial goods. However, with the replacement of coal with oil from the mid-1960s, the port traffic began to terminally decline. The harbour was in commercial use until 2000, the harbour has now been converted into a marina for pleasure boats. It is surrounded by renovated quaysides and narrow streets. The commercial esplanade has been refurbished with new shelters, information points, and the provision of new paving in some areas, as well as railings, lamps, curved benches, planters and new tree plantings. There are several museums in the town, including the Market House Museum, which explores the history of the town and its harbour. The building was constructed in 1820 {{on the site of the}} previous market house which had been demolished in 1805. It was converted into a museum in 1979. It houses a collection of exhibits about the natural history of Watchet and the surrounding area. The focus is on nautical and maritime history of the port. Artefacts include those relating to: Archaeology, Coins and Medals, Land Transport, Maritime, Natural Sciences, Science and Technology and Social History. At the rear of the museum building is the old town lock-up for the temporary detention of people, often drunks who were usually released the next day or to hold people being brought before the local magistrate. The Watchet Boat Museum, which is housed in the 1862 Victorian architecture former railway goods shed, displays the unusual local flatner boats and associated artefacts.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of a standard gauge railway line to connect Pisagua with the interior started in about 1865, while Pisagua was still a Peruvian possession. Work continued under Chilean administration, and by 1935 Pisagua was the northern terminus of a 400 mi network of main and branch lines, with a connection to Iquique, the principal terminus of the line. Trains climbed from sea level at Pisagua to the interior plateau via three reversing zig-zags and a heavily graded line. Supplies for the interior towns and nitrate works were hauled up from the coast, and nitrate for export made up the <b>return</b> <b>load.</b> The principal traffic was always nitrate, after which came fuel, passengers, perishables, parcels, general merchandise, and livestock. Water for the steam locomotives and the town relied on two wells at Dolores (see map), 33 mi from Pisagua, which today still derives its water from this source.|$|E

This paper relies primarily on firm-level interview data to assess competition and bottlenecks in transporting time-sensitive perishable products across borders between Harare, Johannesburg, Lilongwe, and Lusaka. High transport prices in 2015 - almost double the benchmark rates applied and rates for transportation of commodities - are partly explained by concentration in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and lack of <b>return</b> <b>loads</b> to Johannesburg.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the current as stray current and supplied current of the substation, on the DC railway power system. In DC railway power supply system, the running rails are usually used as the return conductor(negative-polarity) for traction load current. This condition mainly focuses on economic considerations, since it does not require the installation of an additional return conductor. But, problems of low resistance between the running rails for the return conductor and earth allows {{a significant part of the}} <b>return</b> <b>load</b> current to leak into the earth. This current is normally called to as leakage or stary current. This stary currents creates serious problems for any electrified matter in the underground. Therefore, reduction of stray current of the DC railway power supply system is also of direct benefit to the operational and safety aspects of the DC railway systems.

40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the global}} atmospheric electric circuit operating between the Earthâ€™s surface and the ionosphere. Attention is drawn to the huge range of horizontal and vertical spatial scales, ranging from 10 âˆ’ 9 m to 1012 m, concerned with the many important processes at work. A similarly enormous range of time scales is involved from 10 âˆ’ 6 s to 109 s, in the physical effects and different phenomena {{that need to be}} considered. The current flowing in the global circuit is generated by disturbed weather such as thunderstorms and electrified rain/shower clouds, mostly occurring over the Earthâ€™s land surface. The profile of electrical conductivity up through the atmosphere, determined mainly by galactic cosmic ray ionization, is a crucial parameter of the circuit. Model simulation results on the variation of the ionospheric potential, âˆ¼ 250 kV positive with respect to the Earthâ€™s potential, following lightning discharges and sprites are summarized. Experimental results comparing global circuit variations with the neutron rate recorded at Climax, Colorado, are then discussed. Within the <b>return</b> (<b>load)</b> part of the circuit in the fair weather regions remote from the generators, charge layers exist on the upper and lower edges of extensive layer clouds; new experimental evidence for these charge layers is also reviewed. Finally, some directions for future research in the subject are suggested...|$|E

40|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} {{may result from}} {{cardiovascular}} overload, from systolic or from diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic left ventricular dysfunction may result from structural resistance to filling such as induced by pericardial constraint, right ventricular compression, increased chamber stiffness (hypertrophy) and increased myocardial stiffness (fibrosis). A distinct and functional etiology of diastolic dysfunction is slow and incomplete myocardial relaxation. Relaxation may be slowed by pathological processes such as hypertrophy, ischemia and by asynchronous left ventricular function. The present contribution analyses the occurrence of slow and incomplete myocardial relaxation in response to changes in systolic pressure {{and in response to}} changes in venous return. The regulation of myocardial relaxation by load is critically dependent on the transition from myocardial contraction to relaxation, which occurs in dogs when 82 % of peak isovolumetric pressure has developed or at a relative load of 0. 82. This corresponds to early ejection in normal hearts, but is situated even before aortic valve opening in severely diseased hearts. When load is developed beyond this transition, relaxation becomes slow and even incomplete. This is load dependent diastolic dysfunction. Load dependent diastolic dysfunction occurs in normal hearts facing heavy afterload and in severely diseased hearts even with normal hemodynamic parameters. This dysfunction should contribute to elevating filling pressures in most patients with severe congestive heart failure. This dysfunction can be reverted by decreasing systolic pressures or by decreasing venous <b>return.</b> <b>Load</b> dependent diastolic dysfunction gives us an additional reason to aggressively treat CHF patients with diuretics and vasodilator...|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper proposes an {{efficient}} cache line management algorithm for a security-aware cache architecture (SCache). SCache attempts {{to detect the}} corruption of return address values at runtime. When a return address store is executed, the cache generates {{a replica of the}} return address. This copied data is treated as read only. Subsequently, when the corresponding <b>return</b> address <b>load</b> is performed, the cache verifies the <b>return</b> address value <b>loaded</b> from the memory stack by means of comparing it with the replica data. Unfortunately, since the replica data is also a candidate for cache line replacements, SCache does not work well for application programs that cause higher cache miss rates. To resolve this issue, a lock and unlock data management algorithm is proposed in order to improve the security of SCache. The experimental results show that a proposed SCache model can protect about 99 % of <b>return</b> address <b>loads</b> from the threat of buffer overflow attacks, while it worsens the processor performance by only 1 %, compared with a non-secure conventional cache.

One explanation for this may be that SCA Transforest is a transport company operating mainly in shipping with existing logistics structures and their own vessels.
