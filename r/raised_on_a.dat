This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E

Walter, <b>Raising</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> shield in Byzantine iconography. — The author gives a {{repertory}} of the twenty-one examples {{known to}} him of representations of <b>raising</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> shield. By confronting them with written {{accounts of the}} ceremony, he attempts to establish the date at which this theme came into current use. He then studies its combination with those of coronation and unction, {{with a view to}} determining more accurately than hitherto how the theme passed from the illustration of one literary genre to that of another, and what was its function in iconographical programmes.

5|$|As Généreux {{pulled away}} to the west, Thompson, who had already been wounded several times, succeeded in turning his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of Généreux. Despite the collapsed wreckage of the mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of the obstruction to fire a raking broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn Généreux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing Généreux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, asking if they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the wreckage that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag <b>raised</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E

5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign four {{light horse}} brigades had been {{dismounted}} and fought alongside the infantry divisions. However, in March 1916 the ANZAC Mounted Division {{was formed in}} Egypt (so named because it contained one mounted brigade from New Zealand – the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade). Likewise, the Australian Mounted Division—formed in February 1917—was originally named the Imperial Mounted Division because it contained the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. Each division consisted of three mounted light horse brigades. A light horse brigade consisted of three regiments. Each regiment included three squadrons of four troops and a machine-gun section. The initial strength of a regiment was around 500 men, although its establishment changed throughout the war. In 1916, the machine-gun sections of each regiment were concentrated as squadrons at brigade-level. Like the infantry, the light horse regiments were <b>raised</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> territorial basis by state and were identified numerically (1st to 15th).|$|E

When he turned seven his mother taught him how to cook. After leaving the family home at age 13, Sanders pursued several professions {{including}} railroad worker and insurance salesman, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, a small city {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. By June, he had converted a storeroom into a small eating area using his own dining table, serving meals such as steaks and country ham to travelers.|$|E
5|$|Initially, <b>raised</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> reduced {{scale of}} only two rifle companies, the battalion's {{personnel}} were mainly drawn from volunteers from other Army units—mostly the independent companies {{that had been set}} up in 1941–42 to carry out irregular warfare—and as a result, most of the battalion's personnel had seen active service prior to being accepted. These volunteers completed their parachute training with 1st Parachute Training Unit before joining the battalion, and upon completion of their training qualified to wear the maroon beret, which was adopted by the 1st Parachute Battalion as a symbol of their elite status. In April 1943, while based at Scheyville Farm, the battalion raised a troop of engineers. Consisting of six officers and 51 other ranks, the 1st Parachute Troop, Royal Australian Engineers, was specially trained to undertake clandestine demolitions work alongside the battalion's rifle companies.|$|E
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors.

This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is <b>raised</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E

Unable to care for him alone, his father sent Martello to the Catholic boarding preparatory school attached to Assumption College, Worcester, which was run by the Augustinians of the Assumption. He spent six years at the school, later describing it as the unhappiest period of his life. He studied graphology and {{from the age of}} 16 began making radio appearances as a graphologist, also writing stories for magazines.|$|E
5|$|William Lloyd Oakley {{was born}} on February 27, 1966 in Westminster, Maryland and <b>raised</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm in Union Bridge, Maryland.

He attended St. Albans High School in Washington D.C., where he met and became best friends with Josh Weinstein in the eighth grade. The two created the school humor magazine The Alban Antic in 1983. Such would be the length of their partnership; the two often finish each other's sentences.
