40|$|Background. The TUNEIN (The Use of VTE {{prophylaxis}} in relatioN to patiEnt risk profiling) study evaluated venous thromboembolism (VTE) {{risk assessment}} and prophylaxis in private medical and surgical inpatients in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The {{study concluded that}} of the 608 patients enrolled, 54. 1 % were clinically evaluated {{to be at risk}} for VTE. A VTE risk assessment model (RAM), the Caprini score, increased the rate to 74. 6 %. Objectives. TUNEIN Wave 2, an extension of TUNEIN, was conducted on a national level including the public sector, focusing on surgical inpatients. Methods. The study was a national, prospective, noninterventional, multisite, epidemiological disease registry enrolling 453 surgical inpatients. The perceived clinical VTE risk, VTE risk score on Caprini RAM, VTE prophylaxis and clinical details were documented during a baseline visit. A bleeding risk score was provided. Results. Of the cohort, 269 patients (59. 4 %) were assessed to be at risk for VTE before applying the RAM. All patients (100 %), however, were at risk on the <b>RAM</b> <b>score.</b> Early mobilisation and assessment of the VTE risk as low were the most frequent reasons for nonprescription of prophylaxis. Only 15 patients in the private and 2 in the public sector were assessed as having a bleeding risk. Chemoprophylaxis differed between the healthcare sectors, with lowmolecularweight heparin predominating in the private sector and unfractionated heparin being prescribed only in the public sector. Conclusion. VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis need to improve in both the public and the private sectors. A formal RAM will improv...|$|E
