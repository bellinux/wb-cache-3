40|$|Radiography {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} NDT {{technique}} used for evaluation of weld defects in metal. Radiographic defects are classified based on the shape, location, orientation, depth, width etc. Once a radiographof a weld is taken, the radiographer examines the same for identifying the defects and quantitatively evaluating the same based on codes and specifications. In recent years digital imaging has superseded conventional imaging, which has led to a profound change in interpretation of radiographic images. A change in the Gray values of the digital image (edges) indicates the flaws on the <b>radiographic</b> image. This <b>paper</b> discusses the Gray level distribution of a test piece radiograph. The test piece considered is a stainless steel metal plate on which a square hole is drilled with different area and depth. The plate is radiographed using X-ray and gamma rays (IR 192) ...|$|R
40|$|Radiolucent mandibular lesions are {{commonly}} evident on {{head and neck}} imaging and present a diagnostic dilemma for the radiologist. These may represent {{a broad spectrum of}} lesions arising from both odontogenic and nonodontogenic structures. Furthermore, few radiolucent lesions are often identified as incidental lesions by the radiologist on imaging performed for different reasons. Location of the lesion, borders, internal structure, and its effect on surrounding structures are the key points to narrow the differential diagnosis. Imaging is essential not only for the diagnosis of lesions, but also to guide therapy and monitor the treatment response. Here is a case report on traumatic bone cyst that presented as an asymptomatic radiolucent lesion in right posterior mandible and was discovered incidentally on routine radiograph. The lesion was diagnosed based on patient′s anamnesis and <b>radiographic</b> examination.

40|$|Backgrund: Prosthetic {{rehabilitation}} of the edentulous patient with implant-supported bridges is today a routine and predictable treatment modality. The original protocol prescribed a healing period of 3 to 6 months prior to loading {{which means that the}} total treatment time can be extensive and that the patients often need to wear removable provisional prostheses during healing and treatment. The use of immediate implant loading protocols would significantly reduce treatment time. Aims: The aim of this thesis was to clinically and radiographically evaluate different protocols for immediate loading of dental implants with regard to implant survival and marginal bone resorption. Material & Methods: Paper I. The use of provisional implants (PIs) for support of a fixed temporary bridge during the healing of permanent implants was evaluated in 45 patients with either partially (19 patients) or totally (26 patients) edentulous maxillae. The patients were followed from implant surgery to abutment connection of the permanent implants. Paper II. The primary implant stability of 905 implants in 267 consecutive patients treated with implant-supported fixed prostheses was assessed using resonance frequency analysis (RFA) measurements (implants stability quations, ISQ) at implant placement surgery. The results were correlated with parameters related to the patient, implant site and the implant components. Paper III. A total of 96 patients were evaluated for immediate loading of implant-supported bridges in the posterior mandible (insertion torque > 30 Ncm, ISQ > 60). 77 patients (85 %) met with the criteria and a total of 257 implants were placed, 77 with a turned and minimally rough surface and 180 with an oxidized and moderately rough surface. A total of 111 FPDs were made. The bridges were supported by one implant and tooth or were freestanding constructions supported by 2, 3 or 4 implants. The patients were followed for at least one year with clinical and <b>radiographic</b> examinations. <b>Paper</b> IV. Twenty (20) patients treated with immediately loaded implant-supported bridges in the edentulous maxilla participated in the study group. Inclusion criteria for immediate loading were a minimum insertion torque of 30 Ncm and an implant stability value of 60 ISQ for the two posterior fixtures and a total sum of 200 (mean ISQ 50) for the four anterior fixtures was required. A group of 20 patients previously treated with implant-supported bridges in the maxilla by the same team following a two-stage protocol was used as a reference group. The patients were followed for one year with clinical and <b>radiographic</b> examinations. <b>Paper</b> V. A total of 115 one-piece implants (OPIs) with a moderately rough surface all the way up through the mocosa, were placed in 48 patients for immediate loading of single crowns and partial bridges in the mandible and the maxilla. A group of 97 patients previously treated by the same team under identical conditions with 380 two-piece implants (TPIs) for immediate loading was used as a control group. The patients were followed for one year with clinical and <b>radiographic</b> examinations. Results: <b>Paper</b> I. Seven (3. 6 %) PIs failed owing to infection or pain during the observation period and were removed. Seventeen (9 %) of 192 provisional implants showed mobility at the second-stage surgery, although they had served as support for the provisional bridge without clinical symptoms during the follow-up time. Five (2. 2 %) of the 230 permanent implants placed did not integrate and were subsequently removed at the second-stage surgery. Paper II. The mean primary stability for the 905 implants was 67. 4 ISQ (SD 8. 6) where 582 (64. 3 %) showed an ISQ value of 65 or higher and 761 (84. 1 %) implants an ISQ value of 60 or higher. Male patients showed higher ISQ values than females, mandibular implants were more stable than maxillary ones. Implants placed in posterior regions were more stable than in anterior sites, wide platform implants were more stable than regular/narrow platform ones. There was a correlation between bone quality and primary stability, with lower ISQ values with softer bone. A lower stability was seen with increased implant length. Paper III. A total of four (1. 6 %) of the 257 implants placed did not integrate and were subsequently removed. The overall cumulative survival rate was 98. 4 % after 1 year follow-up, 96. 1 % and 99. 4 % for turned and oxidized implants, respectively. The average bone loss was 0. 7 (S. D. 0. 8) mm after one year of follow-up. Paper IV. One (0. 8 %) of 123 immediately loaded implants placed did not integrate. In the control group, no implants were lost. The overall cumulative survival rates after 1 year were 99. 2 % for the study group and 100 % for the reference group. The mean change of marginal bone level was 0. 78 mm (SD 0. 90 mm) for immediately loaded implants and 0. 91 mm (SD 1. 04 mm) for reference group implants. The differences were not significantly different. Paper V. Six OPIs (5. 2 %) were removed during the follow -up period because of extensive bone resorption and subsequent soft tissue problems. After 1 year, the mean marginal bone loss was 2. 1 mm (SD 1. 3) for OPIs and 0. 8 mm (SD 1) for TPIs. 20 % of OPIs showed more than 3 mm of bone loss compared with 0. 6 % for TPIs. When compensating for vertical placement depth, OPIs still showed a lower marginal bone level and thus more exposed threads than TPIs. Depending on the criteria used, the success rate for OPIs was 46. 1 % or 72. 2 % compared with 85 % or 91. 6 % for TPIs. Conclusion: It is concluded that immediate loading of two-piece dental implants results in good clinical outcomes if high primary stability is achieved and a rigid splinting with well controlled occlusion is applied. Provisional implants can be used as support of a provisional bridge during submerged healing of permanent two-piece implants. Moreover, it is concluded that one-piece implants show more bone resorption and higher failure rates than two-piece implants after one year in function.

40|$|Objectives: To qualitatively explore {{difficulties}} emerging around radiographer-patient communication regarding {{obesity in}} radiographic encounters, and the situated strategies found by radiographers for handling such situations. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with eight experienced clinicians working in plain radiography (mean experience = 21. 56 years) were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), {{so as to}} highlight the practical, nuanced and real-world experiences of these individuals regarding obesity communication. Results: Participants generally viewed communicating with obese patients as a potential ‘minefield’, in which both parties {{were likely to be}} embarrassed. Most reported having had negative experiences in which patients had acted with denial or outright aggression during examinations but, conversely, all reported cases in which patients had been frank and open about their obesity, and even been happy to joke about it. Equally, all participants were able to document a range of communicative strategies for effectively handling potentially difficult situations. Results further indicate that communicative problems and embarrassment for the patient only generally arise within material contexts; i. e. when equipment is inadequate or multiple exposures are necessary. Conclusions: Participants largely expected any interaction about obesity with a patient to be embarrassing for both parties, but their actual experience was much more varied. This indicates a more complex communicative environment than may be expected, and also a potential availability heuristic in play that requires quantitative clarification. Advances in knowledge: There has, to date, been no empirical investigation of obesity-related communication in everyday <b>radiographic</b> contexts.

40|$|The Westinghouse Science and Technology Center has {{undertaken}} {{a program to}} develop nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques for characterizing the internal structure of SiC particle-reinforced aluminum matrix composites at critical stages during fabrication [1 – 5]. Because of {{the large number of}} processing variables in the manufacture of metal matrix composites (MMC), the likelihood of having detrimental discontinuities is high. The detection of potential defects early in the processing cycle would increase the overall system yield, lower costs, and enhance final product quality [4]. The aim of this investigation was to develop and conduct NDE at various stages of MMC fabrication, correlate the results with microstructural characterization, and establish qualified product quality assurance processes. A large-scale billet was fabricated specially using powder metallurgy techniques to facilitate this objective. The billet contained implanted silicon-carbide particle and aluminum powder clusters as inspection targets. The billet was subsequently extruded into a primary cylindrical extrusion, and finally into a flat plate. The NDE objectives included evaluating the detectability and mapping the implanted defects through each of the processing steps. Comprehensive evaluation of MMC structures requires the use of multiple NDE techniques, including ultrasonic, eddy current, and <b>radiographic</b> testing. This <b>paper</b> concentrates on the results of the ultrasonic investigations. Our experimental approach was: (1) fabricate a MMC billet with intentionally placed inhomogeneities; (2) develop and implement NDE techniques to characterize the MMC internal structure; (3) extend the NDE techniques to intermediate processing and final product forms; and (4) correlate the NDE data with microstructural characterization and mechanical testing results...|$|R
40|$|A {{consensus}} {{protocol for}} treatment of distal radius fractures (DRF) has been developed to aid clinicians in treatment decision making. The protocol was evaluated in Paper I using a validated subjective outcome instrument, DASH in 518 consecutive patients. A good final subjective result was achieved with the proposed protocol, regardless of initial severity with a low median DASH score in all groups at final follow up 1 year after the fracture. No differences were seen for the various operative techniques. In Paper II, 50 patients with an unstable or complex DRF were randomized to either closed reduction and external fixation, or open reduction and internal fixation using the TriMed® system. Pronation/supination and grip strength were better in the internal fixation group at one year compared to the external fixation group. There were no differences in DASH scores or in <b>radiographic</b> parameters. In <b>Paper</b> III we investigated function in patients following an osteotomy due to a malunion after a DRF. Instead of autologous iliac crest bone graft we used a slow resorbing bone substitute (Norian SRS®), consisting of hydroxyapatite, {{to fill the gap}} in combination with the TriMed system for fixation. We were able to improve forearm rotation, flexion/extension and radioulnar deviation from. Grip strength increased and DASH scores decreased substantially. The achieved radiographic correction was consistent over the first year but the resorption was slow and the time to remodel was long. In Paper IV a novel bone substitute (Cerament®) was used with a faster resorbing mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium sulphate. 15 consecutive patients with a radiographic and clinically manifesting malunion after a DRF underwent an osteotomy. The same technique was used for fixation of the osteotomy as in Paper III but this time with Cerament® as bone substitute. Grip strength increased and DASH scores decreased. A fast remodelling of the bone was noticed but also an increase of ulnar variance from immediately postoperatively to final follow up. Using a bone substitute, the operation can be performed as an outpatient procedure and donor site pain avoided. Osteotomy of the distal radius is an effective treatment for malunited distal radius fractures, but perhaps a more rigid fixation is needed in fast remodelling bone substitutes...|$|R
40|$|Cortical hand {{bone loss}} in {{rheumatoid}} arthritis Evaluating digital X-ray radiogrammetry as outcome measure of disease activity, response variable to treatment and predictor of bone damage Background and objective Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease characterised by destruction of joints. The outcome in RA is heterogeneous, {{and it is}} important to select the patients with high risk for serious bone damage in the joints early in the disease course. New treatment with biologic agents has the ability to halter this damage, the most used agents block anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF therapy). There exist no simple tests that can predict the progression in the individual patient. The gold standard is to evaluate the joint destruction (erosions) on radiographs of the hands. Periarticular osteoporosis is a sign that may appear before the erosions, however can not be quantified based on the visual impressions seen on radiographs. The objective of this doctoral thesis was to evaluate the value of a new method of measuring periarticular osteoporosis to assess disease activity and prognosis in RA patients. Methods Periarticular osteoporosis was measured by digital X-ray radiogrammetry (DXR) which measures cortical bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical ratio (MCI) from radiographs of the hands. The computer calculates DXR in a defined area in the metacarpal bones 2 - 4. This thesis consists of four papers: Two longitudinal observational studies (Paper 1 and 2), one blinded randomised study (Paper 3) and one study evaluating the precision of the DXR method (Paper 4). Results Paper 1 included 215 patients followed for two years. In this study DXR was compared to the gold standard for measuring BMD: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Loss of cortical bone measured by DXR was influenced by disease activity, while DXA-BMD loss was not. DXA-BMD loss was only found in a subgroup with short disease duration (< 3 years). Paper 2 was a 10 -year observational study in 136 RA patients with disease duration ≤ 4 years. The patients who lost DXR the first year of follow-up had a greater joint damage on radiographs both after 5 and 10 years, even when corrected for the present most used  predictors: Positive rheumatoid factor (anti-CCP), high inflammation measured by C-reactive protein and presence of erosions on radiographs. Paper 3 was a 2 -year double blind, randomised study of 768 patients with RA evaluating the effect of anti-TNF therapy on hand bone. The patients were divided in three treatment groups: Methotrexate (MTX), anti-TNF therapy (adalimumab) or a combination of these. The combination group lost less hand bone, the anti-TNF therapy monotherapy group lost more and the MTX group lost most hand bone. The order of hand bone loss across the three treatment groups was similar to the order of <b>radiographic</b> progression. <b>Paper</b> 4 evaluated the precision of DXR. A satisfying precision of 0. 14 - 0. 46 was found dependent of the radiographic equipment.   Conclusions Hand bone loss measured by DXR is a feasible and precise method. It is influenced by disease activity, treatment with anti-TNF therapy and can predict subsequent radiographic bone damage. This thesis support that DXR {{has the potential to be}} a useful tool evaluating the disease severity in the individual RA patients.         PhD i klinisk medisi...|$|R
