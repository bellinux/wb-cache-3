40|$|The strudel <b>production</b> <b>line</b> {{consists}} of several workstations and machines in series supplied {{with a common}} transfer mechanism and control system that have different failure modes. When a random failure occurs, the failed machine stops and forces most of the line upstream of the failure to operate without processing whereas the material (raw, intermediate or end-product) of the line downstream {{may have to be}} scrapped due to quality deterioration during the stoppage. The failure impact is the drop of <b>line</b> reliability and <b>production</b> rate. A reliability and maintainability analysis of strudel <b>production</b> <b>line</b> at machine, workstation and entire line level was developed. Descriptive statistics of the failure and repair data was carried out and the best fitness index parameters were determined. Data collection <b>from</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> and their analysis were valid for a period of sixteen months. Furthermore, the reliability and hazard rate modes for all workstations and the entire <b>production</b> <b>line</b> were calculated.
