5|$|Ancient weather {{forecasting}} methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition.

However, {{not all of these}} predictions prove <b>reliable,</b> <b>and</b> many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.|$|E

5|$|The Red Army {{employed}} D-1 howitzers from 1944 onwards, {{during the}} final stages of World War II. The D-1 was used primarily used against personnel, fortifications and key structures in the enemy rear.

The D-1 was finally withdrawn from service in the mid-seventies.|$|E

5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E

5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, <b>reliable,</b> <b>and</b> dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's MirageIII pilots {{generally}} {{found the}} process of converting to the Hornet to be straightforward.

The Hornets have also proven to be mechanically <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> easy to maintain, though shortages of spare parts reduced availability rates {{during the early years of}} their service with the RAAF. The updates installed as part of the HUG process have further simplified maintenance procedures. In recent years, however, the aging aircraft have required much more servicing than was the case in the past.|$|E

5|$|The main {{literary}} {{sources for}} the 4th-century army are the Res Gestae (History) of Ammianus Marcellinus, whose surviving books cover the period 353 to 378. Marcellinus, himself a veteran soldier, is regarded by scholars as a <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> valuable source. But he largely fails {{to remedy the deficiencies}} of the Notitia as regards army and unit strength or units in existence, as he is rarely specific about either. The third major source for the late army is the corpus of imperial decrees published in the East Roman empire in the 5th and 6th centuries: the Theodosian code (438) and the Corpus Iuris Civilis (528–39). These compilations of Roman laws dating from the 4th century contain numerous imperial decrees relating to all aspects of the regulation and administration of the late army.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} kind of coral kept is soft coral, {{especially}} zoanthids and mushroom corals, which are especially {{easy to grow}} and propagate {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, because they originate in enclosed parts of reefs where water conditions vary and lighting may be less <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> direct. More serious fishkeepers may keep small polyp stony coral, which is from open, brightly lit reef conditions and therefore much more demanding, while large polyp stony coral is a sort of compromise between the two.|$|E
