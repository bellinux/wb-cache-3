25|$|The English {{answer to}} this was Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (later {{abridged}} and renamed Fanny Hill) written in 1748 by John Cleland. While the text satirised the literary conventions and fashionable manners of 18th century England, it was more scandalous for depicting a woman, the narrator, enjoying and even <b>reveling</b> <b>in</b> sexual acts with no dire moral or physical consequences. The text is hardly explicit as Cleland wrote the entire book using euphemisms for sex acts and body parts, employing 50 different ones just for the term penis. Two small earthquakes were credited to the book by the Bishop of London and Cleland was arrested and briefly imprisoned, but Fanny Hill continued to be published {{and is one of}} the most reprinted books in the English language. However, it was not legal to own this book in the United States until 1963 and in the United Kingdom until 1970.|$|E
25|$|Parnok left Moscow in {{late summer}} 1917 and spent the Russian Civil War years in the Crimean town of Sudak with Erarskaya. Soon after their arrival, she was {{approached}} by Alexander Spendiaryan (known in Russia as Alexander Spendiarov) and asked to prepare the libretto for a 4-act opera Almast, based on an Armenian legend. Parnok immediately set to work, sourcing her dramatic verse on the epic poem, The Taking of Tmuk Fortress, by Hovhannes Tumanyan and using Erarskaya as her inspiration. She finished the libretto by the winter of 1918, long before Spendiaryan had completed the musical score, and returned to reading Sappho. At that time in Russia, as elsewhere, Sappho was considered a heterosexual poet because she wrote about desire. Both physical love and desire, were perceived as masculine traits, thus women poets who wrote erotic lyrics without shame, regardless of their sexual orientation, were often given the label Sapphic. Simultaneously, she and Eugenia Gertsyk, Adelaida's sister, became closer friends, <b>reveling</b> <b>in</b> their spiritual quest. She viewed her relationship with Eugenia as that of an older and wiser guide, who could help her mature spiritually and break her addiction to love.|$|E

We argue that in contexts in which both service consumption and community activity deplete resources, the latter might actually substitute for the former.

The present study reports empirical evidence of the so-called <b>reveling</b> effect <b>in</b> the online gaming context and suggests that theories motivating a positive relationship between engagement and service spending are oversimplified; for the relatively inactive community members an increase in engagement leads to increased spending, but for the already active members increasing engagement decreases spending.

5000|$|Donne's metaphysical conceit {{occurs at}} line 27; [...] "O my America! my new-found-land/My kingdome, safeliest when with one man man’d/My Myne of {{precious}} stones, My Emperie/How blest am I in this discovering thee!" [...] (27-30). K. W. Gransden sees this excerpt as an “analogy from Elizabethan navigation and discovery, by {{which means he}} speaker depicts the lover's journey to consummation in the most modern possible fashion. Donne neatly hits the traditional estimate of love by expressing {{it in terms of}} an adventure”. Here, Gransden commends Donne’s comparison of sexual intercourse to an adventure, which was a modern way for his speaker to coax the mistress into bed.Donne's metaphysical conceit also dabbles in gendered power dynamics of early modern England. Dr. Ilona Bell suggests that [...] "If the woman is speaker's kingdom and his empire, he is her king and emperor, <b>reveling</b> unabashedly <b>in</b> his masculine dominion over her”, which suggests that Donne's speaker takes a position of superiority and governance over his mistress. However, {{it is important to note}} that without the [...] "new-found-land", AKA the mistress, Donne's speaker would not be a king. As much as the mistress needs the speaker, the speaker needs the mistress. This is also reverent in the last lines of the poem, [...] "To teach thee, I am naked first, why then/What needst thou have more covering then a man?" [...] (47-8); Donne's speaker removes his clothes to guide, or teach, his mistress; however, since he is naked first, he places himself in a place of vulnerability. Bell notes that [...] "male domination was fundamental to Donne's poetic and cultural inheritance. Not surprisingly, therefore, Donne's poems acknowledge the sexual stereotypes and gender hierarchy that subordinated early modern women to men...; however, his poems also dramatise the ways in which Donne challenged... the patriarchal polity and society into which was born and died”. By supplying the reader with a metaphysical conceit that places the speaker over his mistress, but in a way that obviously shows his dependence on her, as well as providing an open-ended scenario where the man is either guiding his mistress into nudity or left vulnerable as she remains clothed, Bell's theory is supported.|$|R

But it deviates from there as Dracula had managed to reach her crypt and spirited her away before Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, Quincy and Harker can kill her due to Holmwood's treachery. She becomes a minion to Dracula and helps with his plan to take over London. During her first confrontation with the heroes, she is horribly scarred when Holmes manages to hit her with a flare. She recovers by turning on Holmwood and feeding on him before leading an ambush with Dracula's brides against the heroes. However, she reveals she is not particularly loyal to Dracula, <b>reveling</b> more <b>in</b> her vampiric power than in serving him; even stating she enjoys being a monster now. She is immune to religious symbols, considering herself more enlightened than Dracula's other brides since she was turned in the recent times. However, as Lucy trades insights with Helsing (who sees her as suffering the curse of the undead, in contrast to her twisted view of it being a blessing that frees her from her human responsibilities), she realizes that she is outmatched as the brides are killed. Lucy then proposes a deal, in which she will kill the last bride for them and leave them alone in exchange for not coming after her. Before escaping through the ceiling, her last words are an apology to Jonathan for the death of Mina (who in this version killed herself before she turned) and her regret that Mina [...] "doesn't know what she's missing". Her fate is left unresolved as the heroes make Dracula their top priority after he infiltrates Buckingham Palace to kill the Queen and take over London. At the end of the mini-series, Lucy is the only vampire not accounted for and is still at large through London. Ironically managing to survive the events of the story in her undead state. In this version, Lucy is portrayed as a red-haired, likely a reference to the 1992 film, Bram Stokers's Dracula.|$|R

What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E

Closing this knowledge gap is critical for better management of surface water in light of drought and increasing human demand for fresh water, especially as the earth’s hydrological system responds to a changing climate. Nowhere on earth is this hydrologic uncertainty more acute than the Arctic, where already difficult-to-obtain in situ observations have declined in recent decades and where rising air, soil, and water temperatures exert outsized impact on natural systems. Furthermore, even basic fluvial science is underdeveloped in the Arctic, as routine field measurements are logistically challenging and sometimes dangerous to obtain. To these ends, this dissertation seeks to combat these global hydrologic challenges, and is centered on rivers at the intersection between geography, fluvial hydrology, and geomorphology. Specifically, this dissertation asks and answers three interconnected questions that I believe are critical for improved scientific understanding of global and Arctic hydrology: (1) Can river flows and freshwater resources be quantified globally, even in remote and/or politically sensitive regions? (2) What can we learn about rivers by thinking about them spatially? (3) How do rivers of the cryosphere differ from their better-studied temperate counterparts? The work herein is built on extensive field work, satellite remote sensing, modeling, and GIS, and contains seven chapters. This document compiles original information about the geomorphology of rivers (that is, how they shape and are shaped by the landscape, Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 7) and applies that knowledge to develop a novel methodology for estimating river discharge from remotely sensed imagery (Chapters 2, 3, and 6). Building on this work, this document also critically considers how these methods might influence local politics (Chapter 5). In sum, this document represents an attempt to holistically understand rivers from numerous vantage points, and succeeds <b>in</b> <b>reveling</b> previously undiscovered river behavior by applying a geospatial paradigm to fluvial science...|$|R
