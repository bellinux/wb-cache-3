5|$|From 18 May 1952, {{when all}} Berlin {{terminal}} stations {{and all other}} long-distance stations in West Berlin were closed, the station Zoologischer Garten remained the only long-distance station for {{the western part of}} the city. The last domestic train of the GDR (East German) railways <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Stadtbahn in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{heyday of}} the line was between 1923, when the GCR was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and 1948, when the LNER was nationalised to form the British Rail Eastern Region. As a result, many prestigious locomotives, such as Flying Scotsman, Sir Nigel Gresley, and Mallard which <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> East Coast Main Line, were {{frequent}} visitors to the line. Special trains <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line to destinations such as Scotland. The station's busiest use came after the construction of Wembley Stadium in 1923, when {{it was used to}} contain large crowds wishing to see the FA Cup Final. Special services ran from Marylebone to the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park the following year.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{versions}} of the T1000 stock have earlier been used on the Oslo metro. This includes 146 cars of the types T1 through T4, that have third-rail only operation, and thus did not run on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås lines. These ran usually in units of three or six (sometimes four or five) cars. Types T5 to T8, 49 in total, delivered with both third-rail and overhead wire equipment, normally <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Holmenkollen line (two cars) and Kolsås line (three cars).|$|E
5|$|Although {{it had its}} own {{branch line}} into Brookwood Cemetery, most of {{the route of the}} London Necropolis Railway <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{existing}} London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Consequently, a site was selected in Waterloo, near the LSWR's recently opened London terminus at Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo). The building was specifically designed for the use of mourners. It had many private waiting rooms, which could also be used to hold funeral services, and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level. Existing railway arches were used for the storage of bodies.|$|E
5|$|As {{support for}} {{multiple}} instruction set architectures complicates symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support, DragonFly BSD now limits its {{support to the}} x86-64 platform. DragonFly originally <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> x86 architecture, however as of version 4.0 {{it is no longer}} supported. Since version 1.10, DragonFly supports 1:1 userland threading (one kernel thread per userland thread), which is regarded as a relatively simple solution that is also easy to maintain. Inherited from FreeBSD, DragonFly also supports multi-threading.|$|E

50|$|Line 2 <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{right hand}} track, whereas <b>the</b> Shinbundang Line <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left hand track; {{this is because}} the Shinbundang Line is a {{national}} railway line (which typically <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left), while Line 2 is a subway line (which typically <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right in Seoul). This can be confusing to tourists making a transfer here, as many tourists are accustomed to riding <b>on</b> either <b>the</b> left-hand track or the right-hand track.|$|R
5|$|As {{the cars}} arrived in 1978 and 1979 Amtrak {{employed}} them on short-haul routes radiating from Chicago. The first coaches entered regular service on February 26, 1979, running from Chicago to Milwaukee. The coaches, {{led by an}} EMD F40PH locomotive, displaced the regular Turboliner equipment. The equipment continued to operate on the run for several weeks. The Illini and Shawnee trains received Superliner coaches soon after; the first Superliner dining car <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Shawnee as a lounge.|$|E
5|$|Better Off Ted is an American satirical sitcom series, {{created by}} Victor Fresco (known for his other {{television}} series Andy Richter Controls the Universe and the short-lived shows Life on a Stick and The Trouble with Normal) who {{also served as}} the show's executive producer. The series <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ABC network from March 18, 2009, to January 26, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican {{nomination}} for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> previous administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, {{and support for}} American involvement in World War I. The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among Irish and German Americans. Coolidge was elected {{by a margin of}} 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.|$|E

Track 3 and 4 are used by trains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Maximilian Railway. Services run in each direction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Maximilian Railway three times an hour, a Regional-Express service <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Karlsruhe-Neustadt route, a Regionalbahn service <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Neustadt-Wissembourg route and a Regionalbahn service <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Karlsruhe-Neustadt route.

5|$|Due to the MTA {{financial}} {{crisis in the}} late 2000s, the G was to be cut back from Forest Hills–71st Avenue to Court Square at all times beginning June 27, 2010. However, due to planned track repairs during the times the G normally <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> IND Queens Boulevard Line, it ceased running on that line on April 19. In addition, train headways were reduced, which inconvenienced about 201,000 weekly commuters since they had to wait longer for G trains.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of {{military}} leader Manuel Noriega, Arias was an opposition leader {{as the president of}} the Christian Democratic Party of Panama, a member party of the Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance (ADOC). He <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ticket of three-time former president Arnulfo Arias (no relation) in the 1984 election as the National Alliance of Opposition's candidate for Second Vice President. Arnulfo Arias was narrowly defeated by Noriega ally Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino, and the opposition stated that the election had been fraudulent.|$|E

The District {{operated}} four trains per hour from Mansion House to Hammersmith. Also leaving every hour from Mansion House were two GWR middle circle services to Aldgate via Addison Road and two L services to Broad Street via Willesden Junction. Three services an hour travelled between West Brompton and Earl's Court.|$|E

The {{exceptions are}} <b>the</b> trains <b>on</b> Line 1, {{as well as}} those on Line 4 south of Namtaeryeong Station. These lines <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left-hand track because these rail lines are operated by Korail, South Korea's national railway operator.|$|R

5|$|In March 1950 the {{municipality}} decided definitely {{to close the}} tramway, but its actual closure came somewhat later. It was not until Saturday, 28 February 1953 that the last tram <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Champ de Courses line, 76 years after the network's first service. But the Rouennaise did not forget the tram's services rendered, organising a first-class funeral: Just before the last scheduled run, a parade of honour made up of three trams ran from the Hôtel de ville to the Trianon depot, cheered by the crowds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty {{to run for}} Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that he try connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as he was completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of Charing Cross {{passed to}} the Southern Railway (SR) in 1923 {{following}} the Big Four grouping. The line was electrified in 1926 to cater for suburban services. The lighter load of multiple-unit electric trains was found to put far less strain on the bridge, and so traffic was redesigned so that local services <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> older section, with mainline services using the 1887 extension.|$|E
25|$|Once the Coastal Link {{is fully}} implemented, Tri-Rail will operate in three {{separate}} services. The Green Line would <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> FEC tracks from Jupiter to Downtown Fort Lauderdale.

5|$|The {{fall of the}} Berlin Wall and German reunification {{made for}} a sudden spike of {{importance}} for the Stadtbahn. The first InterRegio train ran to Cologne in 1990. Since 1991, Intercity trains to Karlsruhe, Cologne and Hamburg used the Stadtbahn. The Hamburg line was soon extended to Dresden and Prague, and the former Interzonenzug trains from Munich were converted to InterCity trains and now <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Stadtbahn as well.|$|E
5|$|The first {{train to}} use the new line was pulled by the Victoria. It left Manchester at 8:00am, and arrived in Bolton 26minutes 30seconds later. The second train was pulled by the Fairfield. The trains {{originally}} <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right hand set of rails, an unusual practice in England, however the railway later changed to left-hand running with the connection of the MB at Clifton. Ten trains ran in each direction per weekday, and two on Sundays. The journey from Salford to Bolton took about 35minutes.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and <b>ran</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
