50|$|Lefebvre’s idea of <b>the</b> “right <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city” {{has been}} {{integrated}} into modern, urban movements as {{a plea for}} {{a new kind of}} urban politics and a critique on urban neoliberalism. The most common modern interpretation of his concept comes from David Harvey in his article “The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city,” where he notes that <b>the</b> phrase ‘right <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city’ is an empty signifier that lacks meaning. Harvey does not believe that <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city is a privilege that already exists, but a collective struggle people face to produce and create life within the city and decide the kind of urbanization they want. He believes capitalist urbanization lacks ‘the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city.’ The RTC uses ‘the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city’ as a call to action for people <b>to</b> produce <b>the</b> living conditions that meet their need by taking back their cities.|$|R

40|$|The {{break-up}} {{with the}} repressive regime, {{and above all}} rehabilitation of the consequences for victims, includes determining {{the truth about the}} character, carriers and methods of systematic violation of basic human rights.

The paper deals with the normative contents of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth and different aspects of this concept that international courts recognize in relation to victims of repressive regimes. The results of the analysis indicate that the concept of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth sets before <b>the</b> states requirements <b>to</b> try to provide institutional preconditions for individual and collective victims to find out and access the truth, but that the case-law does not recognize as enforceable any authorisation which stems from <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth.
