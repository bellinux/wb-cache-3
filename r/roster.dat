40|$|Many <b>rostering</b> methods first create {{shifts from}} some given {{staffing}} levels, {{and after that}} create <b>rosters</b> from the set of created shifts. Although such a method has some nice properties, it also has some bad ones. In this paper we outline a method that creates <b>rosters</b> directly from staffing levels. We use a Branch-and-Price (B&P) method to solve this <b>rostering</b> problem and compare it to an ILP formulation of the subclass of <b>rostering</b> problems studied in this paper. The two methods perform almost equally well. Branch-and-Price, though, {{turns out to be}} a far more flexible approach to solve <b>rostering</b> problems. It is not too hard to extend the Branch-and-Price model with extra <b>rostering</b> constraints. However, for ILP this is much harder, if not impossible. Next to this, the Branch-and-Price method is more open to improvements and hence, combined with the larger flexibility, we consider it better suited to create <b>rosters</b> directly from staffing levels in practice...|$|R

The moves left the team with nine former Bengals on their <b>roster,</b> a situation they expected, as they knew that Bengals owner Paul Brown had more young talent than {{he would be able}} to keep on his team. Linebacker Richard Wood was obtained from the New York Jets for a future draft choice, with injury-plagued running back Harold Hart placed on injured reserve to make <b>roster</b> space for him.

40|$|Personnel <b>rostering</b> has {{received}} ample attention in recent years.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a method to}} solve {{personnel}} <b>rostering</b> problems is outlined. The method discussed creates <b>rosters</b> directly from staffing levels and employee preferences. This opposed to lots of other <b>rostering</b> methods that first create shifts based on the staffing levels and after that create <b>rosters</b> from the set of created shifts. Via an example it is stressed that this `two-step' approach is suboptimal and sometimes even {{unable to find a}} solution. To create <b>rosters</b> directly from staffing levels and employee preferences we modelled the <b>rostering</b> problem as a Branch-and-Price problem. To assess the quality of the Branch-and-Price model we compared an implementation of it with the implementation of an integer linear programming formulation of the <b>rostering</b> problem. This comparison is based on a significant number of generated data sets to explore {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these models. From these results the Branch-and-Price model looks very promising, because both implementations perform almost equally well. However, opposed to the integer linear programming approach, the Branch-and-Price method is more open to improvements and more flexible towards implementations in practise. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{production}} of effective workforce <b>rosters</b> {{is a common}} management problem. <b>Rostering</b> problems are highly constrained and require extensive experience to solve manually. The decisions made by expert rosterers are often subjective and are difficult to represent system-atically. This paper presents a formal description of a new technique for capturing <b>rostering</b> experience using case-based reasoning methodology. Examples of previously encountered constraint violations and their cor-responding repairs are used to solve new <b>rostering</b> problems. We apply the technique to real-world data from a UK hospital. ...|$|R

40|$|Nurse <b>rostering</b> {{deals with}} the task of {{assigning}} shifts to nurses subject to various legislative and organisational constraints. It is generally assumed that these problems are hard, whereas, actual proofs supporting such statements are rare. This talk concentrates on simple nurse <b>rostering</b> problems, formulated as minimum cost network flow problems. A class of nurse <b>rostering</b> problems is identified which can thus be solved in polynomial time.

40|$|Nurse <b>rostering</b> is an {{attractive}} research domain due to its societal relevance, while academics are intrigued by its combinatorial complexity. Descriptions of nurse <b>rostering</b> problems vary largely across the literature, which makes {{it almost impossible to}} track down scientific advances of models and corresponding approaches. The present chapter introduces a mathematical formulation of a generic nurse <b>rostering</b> model. It provides common elements present in most nurse <b>rostering</b> research as well as important hospital constraints that are usually omitted from academic models. The new mathematical model satisfies all the basic requirements for future nurse <b>rostering</b> research and practical developments. Finally, the importance of public datasets is discussed, together with the characteristics of the various benchmark instances and research results obtained working on these instances. status: publishe...|$|R
