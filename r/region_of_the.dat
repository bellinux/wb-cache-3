However, relatively much larger expansions are known in the diplodocoid sauropods Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus. In MCCM-HUE-8741, the small opening in the skull roof middle is responsible for a swelling on the endocast that is suggestive of a pineal system. It is in the exact position where the pineal gland is expected to have been, between the forebrain and the midbrain.|$|E

Hence, to investigate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secretions <b>of</b> different <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epididymis on spermatozoa motility, an in vitro study was undertaken to observe the changes in <b>the</b> patterns <b>of</b> motility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> testicular spermatozoa incubated with luminal contents <b>of</b> different <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epididymis in the lizard Eutropis carinata for the first time.

The spermatozoa from <b>the</b> testis, different <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epididymis exhibited 8 different patterns of motility (a-h).
