60|$|The mean {{temperature}} of the twenty-four hours was 32.7 degrees (max. 41.5 degrees/min. 27.2 degrees), mean dew-point 29.7, and saturation 0.82. The mercury suddenly fell below the freezing point at sunset; and from early morning the radiation was so powerful, that a thermometer exposed on snow sank to 21.2 degrees, and stood at 25.5 degrees, at 10 a.m. The black bulb thermometer rose to 132 degrees, at 9 a.m. on the 27th, or 94.2 degrees above the {{temperature of the}} air in the shade. I did not then observe that of radiation from snow; but if, as we may assume, it was not less than on the following morning (21.2 degrees), we shall have a difference of 148.6 degrees Fahr., in contiguous spots; the one exposed to the full effects of the sun, the other to that of radiation through a rarefied medium to a cloudless sky. On the 28th the black bulb thermometer, freely suspended over the snow and exposed to the sun, rose to 108 degrees, or 78 degrees above that of the air in the shade (32 degrees); the <b>radiating</b> <b>surface</b> of the same snow in the shade being 21.2 degrees, or 86.8 degrees colder.|$|E
60|$|We {{come now}} to the third point in question, the thermal {{influence}} of woods upon the air above them. It will be remembered {{that we have seen}} reason to believe their effect to be similar to that of certain other surfaces, except in so far as it may be altered, {{in the case of the}} forest, by the greater extent of effective radiating area, and by the possibility of generating a descending cold current as well as an ascending hot one. M. Becquerel is (so far as I can learn) the only observer who has taken up the elucidation of this subject. He placed his thermometers at three points:[55] A and B were both about seventy feet above the surface of the ground; but A was at the summit of a chestnut tree, while B was in the free air, fifty feet away from the other. C was four or five feet above the ground, with a northern exposure; there was also a fourth station to the south, at the same level as this last, but its readings are very seldom referred to. After several years of observation, the mean temperature at A was found to be between one and two degrees higher than that at B. The order of progression of differences is as instructive here as in the two former investigations. The maximum difference in favour of station A occurred between three and five in the afternoon, later or sooner according as there had been more or less sunshine, and ranged sometimes as high as seven degrees. After this the difference kept declining until sunrise, when there was often a difference of a degree, or a degree and a half, upon the other side. On cloudy days the difference tended to a minimum. During a rainy month of April, for example, the difference in favour of station A was less than half a degree; the first fifteen days of May following, however, were sunny, and the difference rose to more than a degree and a half.[56] It will be observed that I have omitted up to the present point all mention of station C. I do so because M. Becquerel's language leaves it doubtful whether the observations made at this station are logically comparable with those made at the other two. If the end in view were to compare the progression of temperatures above the earth, above a tree, and in free air, removed from all such radiative and absorptive influences, it is plain that all three should have been equally exposed to the sun or kept equally in shadow. As the observations were made, they give us no notion of the relative action of earth-surface and forest-surface upon the temperature of the contiguous atmosphere; and this, as it seems to me, was just the crux of the problem. So far, however, as they go, they seem to justify the view that all these actions are the same in kind, however they may differ in degree. We find the forest heating the air during the day, and heating it more or less according as there has been more or less sunshine for it to absorb, and we find it also chilling it during the night; both of which are actions common to any <b>radiating</b> <b>surface,</b> and would be produced, if with differences of amount and time, by any other such surface raised to the mean level of the exposed foliage.|$|E

40|$|While {{classical}} Rayleigh streaming, whose circulations are {{perpendicular to}} the transducer <b>radiating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> is well-known, transducer-plane streaming patterns, in which vortices circulate parallel to the surface driving the streaming, have been less widely discussed. Previously, a four-quadrant transducer-plane streaming pattern has been seen experimentally and subsequently investigated through numerical modelling. In this paper, we show that by considering higher order three-dimensional cavity modes of rectangular channels in thin-layered acoustofluidic manipulation devices, a wider family of transducer-plane streaming patterns are found. As an example, we present a transducer-plane streaming pattern, which consists of eight streaming vortices with each occupying one octant of the plane parallel to the transducer <b>radiating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which we call here eight-octant transducer-plane streaming. An idealised modal model is also presented to highlight and explore the conditions required to produce rotational patterns.

40|$|The hygrothermal comfort indoor {{conditions}} are defined as: those environmental {{conditions in which}} an individual exposed, expresses a state of satisfaction. These conditions cannot always be achieved anywhere in an optimal way and economically; {{in some cases they}} can be obtained only in work environments specific areas. This could be explained because of air conditioning systems designing is generally performed both {{on the basis of the}} fundamental parameters' average values, such as temperature, velocity and relative humidity (T-a, v(a) e phi(a)) and derived parameters such as operating temperature and mean radiant one (T-op eT(mr)). However, in some specific cases - large open-spaces or in case of <b>radiating</b> <b>surfaces</b> - the descriptors defining indoor comfort conditions, based on average values, do not provide the optimum values required during the air conditioning systems design phase. This is largely due to the variability of real environmental parameters values compared to the average ones taken as input in the calculation. The results obtained in previous scientific papers on the thermal comfort have been the driving element of this work. It offers a simple, original and clever way of thinking about the new domotic systems for air conditioning, based on the "local mean radiant temperature. " This is a very important parameter when one wants to analyze comfort in environments characterized by the presence of <b>radiating</b> <b>surfaces,</b> as will be seen hereinafter. In order to take into account the effects of radiative exchanges in the open-space workplace, where any occupant may find themselves in different temperature and humidity conditions, this paper proposes an action on the domotic climate control, with ducts and vents air distribution placed in different zones.

In air conditioned rooms designed by systems with average parameters, it may happen that an individual, in some places or times, may feel sensations of thermal discomfort. These phenomena can be exacerbated by heat exchanges occurring in the presence of sources of radiation, such as radiant floors or ceilings or large glass surfaces sunny; these surfaces accentuate the radiative heat exchange with the body surfaces of the exposed individual. This paper proposes a "local mean radiant temperature" valid for the regular calculation of comfort in environments characterized by the presence of <b>radiating</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The present study compares the values of the parameters representing the hygrothermal comfort punctual, PMV, in environments characterized by <b>radiating</b> <b>surfaces</b> located in specific positions (ceiling, floor or walls), calculated with the local radiant temperature suggested in this study, with the corresponding values obtained with the mean radiant temperature proposed by the literature...|$|R

While not all lines use a taper, the standard classical transmission line employs a taper from 1/3 to 1/4 area (ratio of terminus area to starting area directly behind driver). This taper serves to dampen the buildup of standing waves within the line, which can create sharp nulls in response at the terminus output at even multiples of the driver's Fs.|$|E
