5|$|Responses are {{polyclonal}} {{in nature}} as each clone somewhat specializes in producing antibodies against a given epitope, and because, each antigen contains multiple epitopes, {{each of which}} in turn can be recognized {{by more than one}} clone of B cells.

40|$|This is to our {{knowledge}} the first report of a leptospirosis outbreak in a community. It is also {{the first time a}} public health laboratory with its manpower and technical facilities constraint utilized the commercially available leptospira antigens for the rapid macro-slide agglutination test as to pools and as specific serotype antigens. This has helped the clinicians and epidemiologists identify the etiology of the outbreak. At the time of the outbreak in 1976, of 101 sera from patients and residents with complaints within the month, 34 % were positive to one or more leptospira antigen pools; 74 % and 25 % to Pool 3 and to Pool 2 alone or in combination with other pools respectively. Of 517 sera from prisoners without complaints, 1 % <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> one or more pools, 80 % of these <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> Pool 3 alone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Limonene and linalool {{are common}} {{fragrance}} terpenes. Both oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool {{have recently been}} patch tested in an international setting, showing contact allergy in 5. 2 % and 6. 9 % of dermatitis patients, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To investigate concomitant reactions between oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool in consecutive dermatitis patients. METHODS: Oxidized R-limonene 3. 0 % (containing limonene hydroperoxides 0. 33 %) and oxidized linalool 6 % (linalool hydroperoxides 1 %) in petrolatum were tested in 2900 consecutive dermatitis patients in Australia, Denmark, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> either oxidized R-limonene or oxidized linalool. Of these, 25 % had concomitant reactions to both compounds, whereas 29 % <b>reacted</b> only <b>to</b> oxidized R-limonene and 46 % only to oxidized linalool. Of the 152 patients <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> oxidized R-limonene, 46 % <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> oxidized linalool, whereas 35 % of the 200 patients <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> oxidized linalool also <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> oxidized R-limonene. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the patients (75 %) <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> {{only one of the}} oxidation mixtures, thus supporting the specificity of the reactions. The concomitant reactions to the two fragrance allergens suggest multiple sensitizations, which most likely reflect the exposure to the different fragrance materials in various types of consumer products. This is in accordance with what is generally seen for patch test reactions to fragrance materials...|$|R

5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and <b>react</b> <b>to</b> the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E

Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would <b>react</b> <b>to</b> the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable.

5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not <b>react</b> <b>to</b> the applause.
