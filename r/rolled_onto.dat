5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while {{a thick layer of}} fog <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E
5|$|The camp's new commandant Kurt Franz, {{formerly}} its deputy commandant, {{took over}} in August. After the war he testified that gassings had stopped by then. In reality, despite the extensive damage to the camp, the gas chambers were intact, and the killing of Polish Jews continued. Speed was reduced, with only ten wagons <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> the ramp at a time, while the others had to wait. The last two rail transports of Jews {{were brought to the}} camp for gassing from the Białystok Ghetto on 18 and 19 August 1943. They consisted of 76 wagons (37 the first day and 39 the second), according to a communiqué published by the Office of Information of the Armia Krajowa, based on observation of Holocaust trains passing through the village of Treblinka. The 39 wagons that came to Treblinka on 19 August 1943 were carrying at least 7,600 survivors of the Białystok Ghetto Uprising.|$|E

50|$|Since {{picture and}} sound are usually {{recorded}} separately, the editor must synchronize them. The editor loads one picture <b>roll</b> <b>onto</b> a film plate and its corresponding magnetic <b>roll</b> <b>onto</b> a sound plate. Then he advances {{the film to}} find the frame where the {{two parts of the}} Clapperboard came together. The editor repeats the process on the magnetic roll to find the frame with the clap sound. Once found, he marks the frame on both rolls as the synchronization point, and switches the flatbed to interlock mode. From then on, both picture and sound rolls advance or reverse by exactly the same amount to maintain synchronization.|$|R

5|$|As well as passengers, Nairana {{regularly}} carried cargo, including gold bullion, {{and live}} {{animals such as}} horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed {{in one of the}} ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 {{as a result of a}} ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River, having sustained only minor damage.|$|E

25|$|The new {{leadership}} took {{the team to}} Sri Lanka for the Singer World Series ODI tournament and then on a Test-playing tour of Pakistan. Waugh scored 53 runs at 17.66 and took five wickets in 16.20. On the latter tour, Waugh made 73 in the First Test, which Australia agonisingly lost by one wicket. His 98 in the Second Test at Rawalpindi was notable for his survival against a hostile barrage of short-pitched bowling from Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. He eventually fell when a bouncer struck his body and <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> the stumps. A shoulder injury forced {{him out of the}} final Test, which Australia drew and therefore lost the series. Waugh scored 153 runs at 38.25 with two half-centuries and took two wickets at 72.00 as Australia won the ODI tournament.|$|E
25|$|Chaz Mostert {{took his}} first V8 Supercar pole {{position}} when he qualified fastest for the first race of the Ubet Perth Super Sprint. His teammate Mark Winterbottom qualified second {{and went on to}} score pole position for the second race. Winterbottom made a better start than Mostert in the first race and the pair went on to finish first and second, while Craig Lowndes finished in third. Jamie Whincup, after qualifying in 21st place, managed to finish in 15th place but lost the championship lead to Lowndes. Winterbottom won the second race ahead of Whincup and Fabian Coulthard. With Lowndes finishing fifth, Winterbottom took the championship lead. Mostert took his second pole in qualifying for the Sunday race. The session saw Lee Holdsworth make a mistake at turn six and his car <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> its side after digging into the sand trap. Despite starting off the front row, Mostert and Winterbottom finished fourth and 15th respectively after their tyre strategy was ruined by a safety car on lap 48. Will Davison won the race, taking Erebus Motorsport's second ever victory, after passing Lowndes for the lead with five laps remaining. Coulthard finished third despite starting 24th. With Winterbottom finishing down the order, Lowndes left the event with the championship lead.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was between Dusty Rhodes and Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Rhodes had the early {{advantage}} by performing bionic elbows. Rhodes targeted Flair's right foot {{and sent it}} into the ringpost. After throwing Flair {{down from the top}} turnbuckle, Rhodes attempted to apply the figure four leglock. Flair kicked him off, and Rhodes hurt his injured left ankle. Flair failed to apply the figure four leglock, and Rhodes sent Flair outside. Rhodes sent Flair's head into the ringpost and guard rail, and performed a diving crossbody and mounted punches. Rhodes then missed a kick with his left foot, and Flair gained the advantage. Flair targeted the left leg, and applied the figure four leglock. Flair broke the hold when Rhodes <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> his stomach. After exchanging attacks, Rhodes performed a clothesline, and pulled Flair into the referee, knocking him outside the ring. Rhodes applied the figure four leglock, as Ole and Arn Anderson came down to interfere. Rhodes kicked Arn out, but Ole performed a high knee to Rhodes from behind. A new referee came down to officiate, and as Flair picked up Rhodes, Rhodes pinned him with an inside cradle to win the match and the title.|$|E

25|$|Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey {{stayed at}} the crease for {{a major part of}} the morning session. Ishant Sharma troubled Ponting {{throughout}} this period, with the Australian captain unable to take control. After a seven-over spell, Anil Kumble was about to replace Sharma with RP Singh, when Virender Sehwag asked him to retain Sharma. The ploy worked and Ponting was dismissed off the first ball of that over. This triggered the fall of the Australian resistance, as they lost four wickets in the session after lunch (including the contentious dismissals of Hussey and Andrew Symonds). Sehwag was brought in to bowl and responded with the prize scalps of Adam Gilchrist and Brett Lee. Towards the end, Michael Clarke (61) kept up the resistance in partnerships of 50 and 24 with Gilchrist and Mitchell Johnson. Johnson himself made his first Test fifty and was involved in a whirlwind partnership of 74 with Stuart Clark, but once last man Shaun Tait came in at the fall of Clark, it was only a matter of time before India took the match; RP Singh did the honours with a yorker that went hit Tait's foot outside the leg stump and <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> his stumps, half an hour before the close of the day's play.|$|E
25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|E
25|$|Fred Trueman (0/59) gave Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry a torrid time, {{his first}} ball to Simpson <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> the stumps, {{but failed to}} {{dislodge}} the bail and they survived the day with 16/0. They moved along to 104 by lunch, but not without a few scares. Brian Statham missed a simple caught and bowled off Simpson and Trueman's strong left arm nearly had Lawry run out while backing up. Simpson had made 109, 66 not out, 28, 122, 130, 9, 110 and 50 {{so far in the}} season and looked tired when he edged Ted Dexter (2/78) behind to the vigilant England wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 71 in a stand of 136. Norm O'Neill came in and promptly drove Dexter for 4, then hooked him for another. He took a boundary off Barry Knight and even Lawry joined in the act, hooking Statham to the boundary as they added 80 runs in 79 minutes. Knight was reduced to bowling down the leg-side without a slip and O'Neill hooked to the boundary and smashed him over mid-on, which even brought applause from Dexter. Lawry moved smoothly to 98 then hooked a long hop from Fred Titmus (1/81) into the hands of David Sheppard in the deep. Neil Harvey came out to attack the bowling - he rarely did anything else - and the runs flowed regardless of Dexter's attempts to plug the gaps. O'Neill was out to a beautiful ball from Statham (1/67) that cut back and had him lbw for 56 with 9 fours and Harvey's 57 with 6 fours ended when he tried to hit Dexter out of the ground and was caught by Statham at deep mid-off. Peter Burge (47 not out) had kept Harvey company in a stand of 84, and added 37 runs with Brian Booth (19 not out) in the last half hour and Australia were 362/4, 377 runs ahead {{by the end of the}} fourth day. Benaud's decision to not declare and have a bowl that evening was criticised by the press and several theories were advanced as to why. Some thought he was playing mind-games with the English batsmen, giving them an uncertain and nervous night, others that he was afraid of Dexter's batting power. A more likely explanation was that Benaud had suffered a groin strain after his 42 over marathon in the first innings and he didn't want to declare until he knew he would be fit on the last day. In any case after inspecting the wicket with Neil Harvey and bowling a few balls in front of the pavilion he declared ten minutes before play started. England were given 378 runs to win, a total that they have yet to make in a fourth innings against Australia.|$|E

500|$|... "One of {{the more}} {{interesting}} experiments undertaken to extend the range of the early jets in order to give fighter protection to the piston-engine bombers, was the provision for inflight attachment/detachment of fighter to bomber via wingtip connections. One of the several programs during these experiments was done with a B-29 mother ship and two F-84D 'children', and was code named 'Tip Tow'. A number of flights were undertaken, with several successful cycles of attachment and detachment, using, first one, and then two F-84s. The pilots of the F-84s maintained manual control when attached, with roll axis maintained by elevator movement rather than aileron movement. Engines on the F-84s were shut down in order to save fuel during the 'tow' by the mother ship, and inflight engine restarts were successfully accomplished. The experiment ended in disaster during the first attempt to provide automatic flight control of the F-84s, when the electronics apparently malfunctioned. The left hand F-84 <b>rolled</b> <b>onto</b> the wing of the B-29, and the connected aircraft both crashed with loss of all on board personnel (Anderson had uncoupled so did not crash with the other two aircraft)." ...|$|E
