40|$|Cypermethrin (CPMN) is a {{synthetic}} pyrethroid {{used as an}} insecticide in large-scale commercial agricultural applications {{as well as for}} domestic purposes. In the present study a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based method was developed and validated for the quantitation of CPMN metabolites, 3 -phenoxybenzoic acid (3 -PBA) and cis- and trans- 3 -(2, 2 -dichlorovinyl) - 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1 -cyclopropane (cis- and trans- Cl(2) CA). The developed method was applied for the monitoring of CPMN metabolites in hair of laboratory animals (rabbits) intentionally exposed per os to CPMN at 40 (low dose) and 80 (high dose) mg/kg weight/day for 16 weeks. The analytical method comprises three main steps: isolation of analytes from hair, analytes derivatization, and subsequent instrumental analysis by GC-MS. The limits of detection ensured by the method are 4. 0, 3. 9 and 1. 0 pg/mg hair for cis-Cl(2) CA, trans-Cl(2) CA and 3 -PBA, respectively. The instrument responce is linear (r(2) > 0. 99) in the investigated concentrations range from 25 to 1000 pg/mg. With and between-run precision as well as accuracy were estimated and found satisfactory. Analytes were efficiently isolated by solid-liquid extraction from hair with recoveries greater than 84. 8 % for cis-Cl(2) CA, 87. 2 % for trans-Cl(2) CA and 96. 4 % for 3 -PBA. <b>Rabbit's</b> <b>hair</b> showed increasing levels for all metabolites (metabolites accumulation in a time and dose dependent manner) over time and in a dose-dependent manner.

50|$|Only {{certain types}} of fiber can be wet felted successfully. Most types of fleece, such as those taken from the alpaca or the Merino sheep, can be put through the wet felting process. One may also use mohair (goat), angora (<b>rabbit),</b> or <b>hair</b> from rodents such as beavers and muskrats. These types of fiber are covered in tiny scales, similar to the scales found on a strand of human hair. Heat, motion, and {{moisture}} of the fleece causes the scales to open, while agitating them causes them to latch onto each other, creating felt. There is an alternative theory that the fibers wind around each other during felting. Plant fibers and synthetic fibers will not wet felt.|$|R

In certain lowly reptiles, in the lampreys, and especially in a peculiar New Zealand lizard, the pineal gland has the most convincing resemblance to an eye, both in its general build and in the microscopic structure of its elements; and it seems now more than probable that this little vascular pimple in our brains is a relic of a third and median eye possessed by ancestral vertebrata.

Hence, the morphological structure of <b>rabbit</b> <b>hair</b> was investigated again in this study, using optical microscopy and the scanning electron microscopy. The basic shape of the hair scale, the cortex distribution and the medulla of different fineness were studied. It was founded that no medulla existed when the diameter was less than 10 um.
