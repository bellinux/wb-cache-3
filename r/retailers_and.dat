30|$|One of {{the major}} {{characters}} and functions of family factories is that: it expands the ethic roles of kinship relationships from inner family to networks between supplier, <b>retailer</b> <b>and</b> wholesaler; on the other way around, the supplier, <b>retailer</b> <b>and</b> wholesaler will follow the ethic and moral regulations within the family factory. It forms a value-chain between family factory, supplier, <b>retailer,</b> <b>and</b> wholesaler, 22 and it forms a win-win network based on value-chain. The four parties of family factory, supplier, <b>retailer,</b> <b>and</b> wholesaler build up a “beehive” together, which is called value-chain “beehive”. The owner of the family factory is the “queen bee” of the value-chain “beehive”.|$|R

5|$|An early {{criticism}} of the SmarTrip cards had been that they were only sold at suburban Metrorail stations, online, a few selected <b>retailers,</b> <b>and</b> Metro sales offices. However, in 2008, Metro reached an agreement with CVS/pharmacy to sell the cards at 187 DC-area locations {{in an effort to}} increase SmarTrip use. The SmarTrip cards are also sold at area grocery store chains. In late 2012 WMATA installed SmarTrip vending machines at all Metrorail stations.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to industrial growth, the 1880s and 1890s were {{a period of}} significant growth in downtown commercial building. The retail district was centered at Fourth Street and Washington Avenue, while banking and business was centered to the south, at Fourth and Olive streets. During the 1890s, significant <b>retailers</b> <b>and</b> businesses moved westward; among the new buildings constructed {{as a result of}} this movement was the Wainwright Building. Designed by Louis Sullivan in 1891, the Wainwright was the tallest building in the city at the time of its construction and remains an example of early skyscraper design.|$|E

5|$|A toyline for {{the film}} was {{confirmed}} by Hasbro in February 2012. Despite the movie's release being moved from June 2012 to March 2013, the initial assortments of figures, vehicles, and role-play items were shipped to <b>retailers,</b> <b>and</b> appeared on store shelves in May 2012. A Variety article was published stating that the already released figures had been pulled from the shelves and recalled by Hasbro, although the company's official statement indicated that existing product would be sold through. New product shipments were halted by Hasbro, but existing Retaliation figures were available in Target, Wal-Mart, and Toys R Us as late as December 2012. The toyline was re-released in the United States in February 2013. A four-part limited series comic book titled G.I. Joe: Retaliation Movie Prequel was published by IDW Publishing from February 2012 to April 2012. Written by John Barber, it acted as a prequel to the 2013 movie.|$|E
5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with <b>retailers</b> <b>and</b> players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E
