At the tip displacement along the wire the resistance (<b>R</b> <b>wire</b> ∼ 30 kΩ, what is typical for diffusive regime) demonstrates quasi-periodical oscillations with an amplitude about 3 %. The period of the oscillations depends on the number of electrons in the nanowire and is consistent with expected for standing electron waves caused by ballistic electrons in the top subband of the InAs nanowire...|$|E
