The implementation of the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) amendments of 1990 have affected every source of air pollution in the U. S. including cotton gins. The goal of this project was to develop guidelines, that will help cotton ginners comply with FCAA amendments at reasonable cost. Several alternate abatement strategies were proposed for removing particulate from cotton gin exhausts. Emission factors from these abatement strategies were estimated. The cost of investing in these strategies was estimated. The reduction in emissions, achieved by installing a better abatement strategy were calculated. The costs per tonne of reduction in emissions when changing from one abatement strategy to a more efficient strategy were estimated. Gins with a ginning capacity from less than 10 bales per hour to greater than 35 bales per hour were analyzed. These figures help in defining the "economic reasonableness" of investing in a particular strategy. The performance of <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> <b>filters</b> was evaluated using a small scale model at different inlet loadings of fine dust only and fine dust and trash combinations. Their performance was compared with cyclones and preseparator cyclone systems. Results from these tests suggest that cyclone systems are more efficient and less expensive than <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> <b>filters</b> in controlling particulate from cotton gin exhausts...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> designs {{available}} vary {{in physical}} aspects and their characteristics. The filtration area ranges from 0.5 m2 to 125 m2. Disregarding {{the size of}} the design, filter cloth washing is a priority as it ensures efficiency of cake washing and acting vacuum. However, a smaller design would be more economical as the maintenance, energy usage and investment cost would be less than a bigger <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>drum</b> filter.Over the years, the technology drive has pushed development to further heights revolving around <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> in terms of design, performance, maintenance and cost. This has also {{led to the development of}} smaller <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> vacuum <b>filters,</b> ranging from laboratory scale to pilot scale, both of which can be used for smaller applications (such as at a lab in a university) [...] High performance capacity, optimised filtrate drainage with low flow resistance and minimal pressure loss are just a few of the benefits. With advanced control systems prompting automation, this has reduced the operation of attention needed hence, reducing the operational cost. Advancements in technology also means that precoat can be cut to 1/20th the thickness of human hair, thus making the use of precoat more efficient [...] Lowered operational and capital cost can also be achieved nowadays due to easier maintenance and cleaning. Complete cell emptying can be done quickly with the installation of leading and trailing pipes.Given that the filter cloth is usually one of the more expensive component in the <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> build up, priority on its maintenance must be kept quite high. A longer lifetime, protection from damage and consistent performance are the few criteria that must not be overlooked.Besides considering production cost and quality, cake washing and cake thickness are essential issues that are important in the process. Methods have been performed to ensure a minimal amount of cake moisture while undergoing good cake washing with large cake dewatering angle. An even thickness of filter cake besides having a complete cake discharge is also possible. 611 ...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear grade {{ammonium}} diuranate (ADU) and UO powders were produced on a pilot plant scale by the continuous single-stage precipitation of ADU with ammonium hydroxide, dewatering with a <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> vacuum <b>filter</b> or a solid bowl centrifuge, and batch-tray drying and calcination-reduction to UO powder. Precipitation at 50 ºC and pH {{values in the}} range 7. 2 to 8. 0 produced ADU materials which could be converted to UO powder by calcination and reduction at temperatures of 600 to 730 ºC, and fabricated into sintered pellets with densities of 10. 37 to 10. 77 g cm- 3. The lower the pH of precipitation the lower was the reduction temperature required to achieve a specified pellet density. Precipitation with ammonium hydroxide at 80 ºC and with ammonia gas at 50 ºC offered no advantages over precipitation with ammonium hydroxide at 50 ºC. The UO 2 powders and sintered pellets produced from ADU powders precipitated by the three methods were similar. Precipitation at pH 7. 5 and 50 ºC is recommended since a reasonably filterable precipitate can be produced reproducibly without a need for stringent control, and considerable flexibility {{is available in the}} subsequent production of a sinterable UO 2 powder.

Cotton gins emit particulate and lint fiber into the atmosphere {{as a result of their}} ginning process. All the gins in Texas are required to install Baseline Best Available Control Technology (BBACT) in order to obtain a permit to construct or operate. Gins that are located in densely populated areas or those which are in violation of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) regulations may be required to install additional controls. TNRCC Permit Engineers define the additional controls that a gin must install to reduce emissions. However, some of these controls may not be financially viable for the gins. The ginners can use the criterion of 'economic reasonableness' to negotiate an appropriate abatement strategy. Several additional air pollution abatement strategies using combinations of cyclones, <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> <b>filters,</b> and baffle type pre-separators have been defined. Procedures to estimate costs of equipment and emission factors for various abatement equipment are described in detail.

50|$|Generally, {{the main}} {{process in a}} <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> is {{continuous}} filtration whereby solids are separated from liquids through a filter medium by a vacuum. The filter cloth {{is one of the}} most important components on a filter and is typically made of weaving polymer yarns. The best selection of cloth can increase the performance of filtration. Initially, slurry is pumped into the trough and as the drum rotates, it is partially submerged in the slurry. The vacuum draws liquid and air through the filter media and out the shaft hence forming a layer of cake. An agitator is used to regulate the slurry if the texture is coarse and it is settling rapidly. Solids that are trapped on the surface of the drum are washed and dried after 2/3 of revolution, removing all the free moisture 6.|$|R

50|$|During {{the washing}} stage, the wash liquid {{can either be}} poured onto the drum or sprayed on the cake. Cake {{pressing}} is optional but its advantages are preventing cake cracking and removing more moisture.

There are a few types of discharge which are scraper, roller, string, endless belt and pre coat.5 The filtrate and air flow through internal pipes, valve and into the vacuum receiver where the separation of liquid and gas occurs producing a clear filtrate 7. Pre coat filtration is an ideal method to produce a high clarity of filtrate. Basically, the drum surface is pre coated with a filter aid such as diatomaceous earth (DE) or perlite to improve filtration and increase cake permeability. It then undergoes the same process cycle as the conventional <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> however, pre coat filtration uses a higher precision blade to scrape off the cake 6.|$|R

To the best of our knowledge, the hysteresis phenomenon was observed for the first time in the transition between cataracting-centrifuging regimes, which was shown to be dependent on the physical properties of the particles such as sphericity, density and particle-wall friction coefficient.

40|$|This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} methods for measuring and describing particle size distribution from three different spots in Tilapia recirculating system at University of Life Ccience in Ås, Norway. For this purpose serial filtration over different mesh size and parallel filtration over different mesh size methods were compared. Water samples were taken from before <b>drum</b> <b>filter,</b> after <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> and after bio-filter (MBBR) and filtrated through eight different mesh size classes and calculated in mg suspended solids per liter (mgSS/l). Serial method is telling about suspended solids between two filter sizes, while parallel method tells about suspended solids bigger of a given filter size. Each filtering method was done three times in three different days. Results of serial filtration showed large difference in mgSS/l between days, especially between 0, 45 – 10 µm. Small particles (< 30 µm) are dominating in both methods. Water before <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> contains a lot of large particles which are reduced after treatment in the <b>drum</b> <b>filter.</b> First and third days of serial filtration were more effective for the total suspended solids (TSS) after <b>drum</b> <b>filter,</b> unlike the second day which showed no decrease of TSS after drum filter: 9, 71 mgSS/l before <b>drum</b> <b>filter,</b> and 10 mgSS/l after <b>drum</b> <b>filter.</b> In the first day TSS before <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> was 23, 58 mgSS/l and after <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> it was reduced to 8, 8 mgSS/l.

Parallel filtration method can be calculated as comparing samples, same as serial filtration method. This way of calculations of parallel filtration gave negative values for some of the particle size groups which bring into question the accuracy of the method.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model was built {{and used to}} show the motion of particles in a cascade <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> dryer. In a cascade <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> the flights pick up the particles {{at a number of}} points in {{the lower half of the}} drum while, in the upper half, the particles fall freely. A model is derived where the drag force exerted on the particles throughout the falling period is emphasised. The motion of the particles in a <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> is described by three actions: Cascade; Kiln and Bouncing. In this study a horizontal <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> was used where both the kiln and bouncing actions have minimal effect, therefore, the focus is on the cascade motion of the particles. A characteristic of the model is the 'falling number' which is found to be dependent on the curtain properties. The model has demonstrated its ability to predict the effect of many important parameters such as drying medium velocity, drum rotation speed, particle size and feeding flow rate. It has been shown that increasing the drying medium velocity by 2. 5 times results in an 85 % decrease in the residence time. Also, the number of falling is shown to be limited and a function of the drum rotation speed, in this case 0. 59 falling per second. An important feature of this model is the ability to predict the mean resident time, contact time interval and the resting time interval. The maximum error between the predicted and the measured data was < 10 %. ...|$|R
