40|$|<b>Riparian</b> <b>lands</b> {{are among}} the most {{productive}} ecosystems on earth. They occupy only a small proportion of the landscape but frequently support a greater variety and abundance of animal life than adjacent habitats. ~ Important habitat components include vegetation (often taller, denser, more diverse, and more complex in <b>riparian</b> <b>lands),</b> food, standing water, shelter from predators, sites for nesting and roosting, and a local microclimate with less extreme temperatures and more humid conditions than adjacent areas. ~ Wildlife species differ in their dependence on the riparian zone: some are confined to it throughout their lives; others may use it only occasionally, although their long-term persistence depends on access to intact riparian habitats. ~ Riparian areas are often corridors for wildlife movement. This occurs naturally in dry regions, where stream-side vegetation forms distinctive networks across the landscape. In regions where most native vegetation has been cleared for human use, vegetated riparian zones also provide habitat for many species. ~ Degradation of <b>riparian</b> <b>lands</b> by clearing and grazing has negative impacts on a range of wildlife species which depend on these riparian areas. ~ Restoration of <b>riparian</b> <b>lands,</b> including fencing to exclude livestock and re-instatement of native vegetation, can lead to improved riparian habitat for a variety of wildlife species. There may also be benefits to other aspects of farm productivity, such as reduced impacts of pest species. PRINCIPLES FOR RIPARIAN LANDS MANAGEMENT 8. 1 Wildlife ecology in <b>riparian</b> <b>lands</b> <b>Riparian</b> <b>lands</b> occupy only a small proportion of the landscape, but they frequently have a much higher species richness and abundance of animal life than adjacent habitats. Research in Australia has documented the importance of <b>riparian</b> <b>lands</b> to a variety of wildlife across many habitat types. The majority of this work has been on birds, and mostly in eastern and northern Australia, but the results are likely to be applicable to wildlife in general across the country, since work in other countries has provided similar conclusions (e. g. Knopf et al. 1988). In savanna landscapes in northern Australia, it has been found that the number of species of birds, mammals, reptiles, frogs and spiders (Williams 1993,Woinarski et al. 2000...|$|R

5000|$|Lux v. Haggin (1881)Miller and Lux first {{filed suit}} against Haggin in 1879. The {{important}} issue {{in this case was}} determining what constitutes a watercourse. In order for Miller and Lux to be riparian landowners, they had to prove that the slough was in fact a watercourse. Their main argument was that the slough {{was an integral part of}} a major water system with a clearly defined waterway: water flowed down from the Sierras to Kern River, through Buena Vista Slough and into Lake Tulare. Haggin, on the other hand, argued that the slough was indistinguishable from swampland, and that the water present in the slough was merely overflow from Lake Tulare. On November 3, 1881 Judge Brundage ruled that [...] "no continuous or defined channel" [...] existed in Buena Vista swamp, and therefore Miller and Lux were not considered <b>riparian</b> <b>land</b> owners. Judge Brundage also included in his opinion that irrigation by means of appropriation was a [...] "natural necessity" [...] in the state of California.|$|E
5000|$|Lux v. Haggin was a {{historic}} {{case in the}} development of water rights in California. During this time, the population was rapidly increasing and appropriation of water would soon become a necessity. The decision was important because it gave the court a chance to either continue to uphold English common law and riparian rights or give appropriative rights supremacy. In the end, the court recognized both water rights systems, but decided that appropriative rights were secondary to riparian rights. The ruling [...] "created chaos by shackling the state with two fundamentally incompatible water allocation systems." [...] Additionally the original definition of [...] "reasonable" [...] water use under English common law was changed. The court decided that water could be used for commercial and agricultural purposes as long as the use did not negatively affect other riparian landowners. This broadening of the [...] "reasonable" [...] use definition meant that <b>riparian</b> <b>land</b> owners could now use more water then previously allowed.|$|E

50|$|Named for Ross R.

The main purpose of the infrastructure project was to create a permanent water source to supply drinking water for the Mississippi capital city of Jackson. Flooding of the Jackson section of the Pearl River had been studied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers since 1930 and city leaders envisioned commercial and industrial benefits from land reclamation associated with flood control. The Jackson Chamber of Commerce prior to the completion of the reservoir promoted <b>riparian</b> <b>land</b> reclamation with industrial development, a new bypass for U.S. Highway 49 constructed upon a levee, straightening the Pearl River channel and potential navigation. Construction on the lake was completed in 1963, and the water level reached average capacity in 1965. In the 1980s two power companies including the local electricity producer, Mississippi Power and Light Company, made an applications to the federal government authorities to modify the dam to produce hydropower.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic mining benefited California {{in three}} ways; it filled the state coffers, lined {{the pockets of}} mining {{corporations}} and fueled the boom of the mountain mining towns. Downstream, it was another story. Tons of sediment and detritus from the mining operations destroyed farmland and <b>riparian</b> <b>land.</b> It also {{changed the course of}} rivers in the Sacramento Valley. Once out of the steep slopes of the hills and mountains, the river water in the valley ran slower, allowing the debris to settle. Silt began to accumulate {{on the bottom of the}} Yuba and Feather rivers, making the channels significantly more shallow, which threatened to end the vital riverboat traffic and subsequent trade with Sacramento and San Francisco. Citizens of the downstream towns and cities such as Marysville became alarmed at the increased risk of flooding the shoaling of the rivers presented. Eventually a system of levees would enclose Marysville to combat the new threat, permanently limiting the growth of the city. Besides threatening urban communities, valuable farmland became buried under the mining debris. Farmers began to see more frequent and devastating flood losses, and soon a legal battle erupted to stop hydraulic mining once and for all.|$|E
40|$|Construction of the Dalles, Bonneville, McNary, and John Day Dams on the Columbia River by {{the federal}} {{government}} resulted in a substantial loss of riparian bottomland along the Columbia River. Impacts associated with the Mid-Columbia Projects were assessed for several wildlife species using the Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) developed by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USDI-FWS 1980). The studies documented the loss of riparian habitat and established a baseline against which mitigation measures could be developed (USDI-FWS 1990 and USDE-BPA 1990). The impact assessments established a mitigation goal, a portion of which would be satisfied by the creation, restoration, and enhancement of <b>riparian</b> <b>lands</b> on tributaries to the Columbia River, including the Yakima Valley. The Yakama Nation (YN), the Northwest Power Planning Council, and the Bonneville Power Administration have agreed that the Yakama Nation would be funded to implement habitat restoration on lands within and adjacent to their reservation. Some of the targeted lands are owned by the Yakama Nation, some are trust lands, and some lands have been in private ownership. Since the early 1990 s, the Yakama Nation has been in the process of assembling <b>riparian</b> <b>lands</b> into Wildlife Management Areas, and restoring natural hydrology and natural cover-types on these lands. The Northwest Power Planning Council, through the Bonneville Power Administration, has supported the program. HEP studies were performed by the Yakama Nation in 1990 (Bich et al. 1991) to establish baseline conditions and inventory wildlife habitat at the initiation of the restoration project. The 1990 HEP used a simplified version of the HEP to quantify baseline conditions. The present assessment is designed to evaluate the progress of the mitigation plan in meeting its stated goals.

Banded Tilapia (Tilapia sparrmanii) is yet another introduced fish that has an adverse effect on the stocks of B. calidus, in its case due to competition for food.
