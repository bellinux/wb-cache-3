500|$|Super Mario 3D Land {{received}} critical acclaim. It {{received an}} aggregated score of 90.09% on GameRankings and 90/100 on Metacritic. The game sold over 343,000 copies {{in its first}} week in Japan, helping to move over 145,000 Nintendo 3DS units. Famitsu awarded Super Mario 3D Land a score of 38/40, praising level design, accessibility for beginners {{and the use of}} 3D. IGN gave the game a score of 9.5 and an Editor's Choice award, calling it [...] "brilliant and addictive" [...] and stating that [...] "3D gaming has never been fully realized before this". GamesRadar gave the game a score of 9/10, praising its wealth of content, although criticising the inclusion of a <b>run</b> <b>button</b> and some easy difficulty. Game Informer gave 3D Land a 9.5/10, saying [...] "it lives up to the level of quality set by previous entries and is easily the best reason to own a 3DS". They also complimented the use of both a <b>run</b> <b>button</b> and the 3D effects while criticising the [...] "lack of variety in boss battles".|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{scheduled}} for localization into the English language for a North American release as Earth Bound, but despite the localization work being fully completed and scheduled for release, the project was abruptly cancelled in 1991 due to the game's size and scope making a cartridge release too impractical, and due to the impending release of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America. The game's localization was a significant undertaking for Nintendo of America, necessitating the censorship of {{a large amount of}} imagery & dialogue to conform with Nintendo of America's policies against gore, drug use, and sexual content, revising the layout of certain areas to reduce their difficulty, adding a <b>run</b> <b>button</b> (which in actuality simply doubles the game's speed on the overworld) and several new features to the in-game menus (i.e. commands that allow the player to examine items and enemies), changing the game's map feature from an item to a Start button command, renaming certain characters and areas to appeal more to American audiences (i.e. Mother's Day being renamed Podunk, Holy Loly Mountain being renamed Mt. Itoi, and Gyiyg being renamed Giegue), and altering the ending to explain the fates of the main characters. In this new ending, it is explained that the captured adults are freed from the cave and reunited with their children, and the group parts ways. Lloyd is given a hero's welcome back at his school, Teddy fully recovers, reforms himself, and becomes a performer at the karaoke bar where he was first met, and Ana receives a letter from Ninten, who returns home to his family and takes a much-needed rest. This ending also features a roll call of most of the cast (which would become standard for the Mother series), a new credits sequence, set to a re-arranged version of the tracks [...] "Airplane Ride" [...] and the Easter/Youngtown theme, and a post-credits scene where Ninten's father attempts to call him and alert him of something important, acting as a sequel hook. Before its ultimate cancellation in the west, the game was set to be released with an 80-page strategy guide and a separate release of the soundtrack (similarly to the Japanese release) and even received small amounts of advertisement via previews in gaming magazines such as Nintendo Power.|$|E
50|$|Hammer throw - Spinning {{initiated}} by pressing a <b>run</b> <b>button</b> {{once and then}} correctly timed press of action button to choose angle (45 is optimal).|$|E
50|$|Triple jump - Speed is {{controlled}} by the <b>run</b> <b>buttons,</b> jump and angle are controlled by action button. There are three attempts at the qualifying distance, and player fouls if first jump is after the white line.|$|R
50|$|Weight lifting - Power used to {{lift weights}} is {{controlled}} by <b>run</b> <b>buttons,</b> while shift of weight from lifting up to pushing above the head {{is controlled by}} action button. There are two attempts at the qualifying weight.|$|R
50|$|Long horse - Speed {{to run at}} {{horse is}} {{computer}} controlled, player jumps and pushes off horse via the action button, and rotates {{as many times as}} possible via <b>run</b> <b>buttons</b> (and tries to land straight up on feet). There are three attempts at the qualifying score.|$|R
50|$|High jump - Running (speed set by computer) {{and then}} action button {{must be held}} down to {{determine}} angle of jump. Once in the air, the <b>run</b> <b>button</b> can be rapidly pressed for additional height.|$|E

50|$|On 3 August 2010, Button joined League One side Plymouth Argyle on a season-long loan. Playing for {{the first}} time at League One level, {{injuries}} from September though to November disrupted his spell and he was dropped on 22 February 2010 after an eight-game losing <b>run.</b> <b>Button</b> managed to oust Romain Larrieu as number-one and regain his place in early April, though his efforts were in vain as Plymouth finished 23rd and suffered relegation to League Two. Button made 30 appearances during the season.|$|E
50|$|Skeet {{shooting}} - Selecting left {{or right}} shot via the two <b>run</b> <b>buttons</b> while a clay-bird is in the sight. There are three rounds to attempt to pass the qualifying score. If a perfect score is attained then a different pattern follows allowing for a higher score.|$|R
5000|$|Swimming - Swimming {{speed is}} {{controlled}} by two <b>run</b> <b>buttons,</b> and breathing {{is controlled by}} the action button when prompted by swimmer on screen. There is one re-do if a player fouls due to launching before the gun, but only one [...] "run" [...] at the qualifying time.|$|R
50|$|Hyper Sports, {{known in}} Japan as Hyper Olympic '84 (ハイパーオリンピック'84) is an arcade game {{published}} in 1984 by Konami. It is {{the sequel to}} 1983's Track & Field and features seven all-new Olympic events. Like its predecessor, Hyper Sports has two <b>run</b> <b>buttons</b> and one action button per player. The Japanese release of the game sported an official license for the 1984 Summer Olympics.|$|R
50|$|Elevators {{have a car}} top {{inspection}} station that allows the car to be operated by a mechanic {{in order to move}} it through the hoistway. Generally, there are three buttons: UP, RUN, and DOWN. Both the RUN and a direction button must be held to move the car in that direction, and the elevator will stop moving as soon as the buttons are released. Most other elevators have an up/down toggle switch and a <b>RUN</b> <b>button.</b> The inspection panel also has standard power outlets for work lamps and powered tools.|$|E
50|$|The {{graphics}} {{were lifted}} {{straight from the}} arcade version, but the HUD was restricted to a simple vitality bar - the score and number of lives were displayed prior to starting the level. The sound was modified slightly to adapt it to the more limited audio hardware. The graphics were brighter. The controls were modified slightly {{to make it possible}} to only perform a high jump when the <b>run</b> <b>button</b> was pressed, whereas it was possible in the arcade version to perform one simply by being in motion when jump was pressed.|$|E
5000|$|Although Mythologies is {{classified}} as an action-adventure game, its play controls {{are very similar to}} the 2D Mortal Kombat fighting games. The player has four attack buttons, along with a block button and a <b>run</b> <b>button</b> like in Mortal Kombat 3. The player controls Sub-Zero as they would in a fighting game, including the use of command-based special moves, to fight enemies and venture through levels. A [...] "turn" [...] button is used to change the direction Sub-Zero is facing, while an [...] "action" [...] button is used to pick up or use items. The player also has access to a status screen which keeps tracks of the players inventory, experience points, and special moves they gain during the game.|$|E
50|$|Common {{uses for}} this size of battery include some small flashlights, remote control door chimes, glucose meters, small desk clocks, {{wireless}} microphones, laser pointers, some vintage calculators, and film cameras. However, as technology has improved, {{many of these}} devices now <b>run</b> on <b>button</b> batteries.|$|R
5000|$|International Track & Field is a 3D {{update of}} Konami's Track & Field series, in which {{up to four}} players compete in eleven {{different}} Olympic events. The game was released for the PlayStation and the arcades in 1996. The arcade version was released only in Japan as Hyper Athlete. In 2008 the game was released on PlayStation Network. All six events from the first game, 1983's Track & Field, are included, but only three events (swimming, pole vault and triple jump) are taken from the sequel, Hyper Sports. International Track & Field uses the three-button control system of its predecessors (two <b>run</b> <b>buttons</b> and one action button per player) and the eleven disciplines can be attempted in any order. The available events are: ...|$|R
50|$|Currently, most Dynamics GP {{installations}} {{have been}} moved to MS SQL Server - so you can use Dexterity for custom forms drawing only and make the <b>buttons</b> <b>run</b> SQL stored procedures.|$|R
5000|$|The Turbografx-16 version, {{produced}} by NEC Avenue {{was released in}} Japan on March 27, [...] It was released as a Super CD-ROM² title which supported a specialized 3-button controller that NEC released only in Japan. An American version for the TurboGrafx 16 was released by Turbo Technologies Inc. as well. With the 3-button controller, the player can control their character as they would in the Mega Drive version, with two buttons to rotate the character and one to shoot. With the standard TurboGrafx-16 controller, the <b>Run</b> <b>button</b> {{is used in the}} place of the third button to rotate the character to the left. The TurboGrafx-16 is one-player only, but allows the player to select between either of the two Unknown Soldiers {{at the start of the}} game (with their respective abilities from the arcade version retained).|$|E
5000|$|Duhan is {{also the}} only {{location}} where the game can be saved, {{with the exception of}} suspending data, which can be done at any point outside of the town. Suspended data is deleted once loaded. Beneath the town lies the dungeon that is in this case called the Labyrinth of Duhan. Movement in the dungeon is 1st person 3D, with the thumbsticks allowing the player to [...] "peek" [...] around before turning in 90 degree increments. The shoulder buttons allow one to side-step, and there is a <b>run</b> <b>button</b> (O). That, combined with the unlockable shortcuts to deeper reaches adds a welcome enhancement to what veterans of the series might recall as a tedious trudge. The environments are memorable and varied, with NPCs spread about such {{that it is difficult to}} get lost in the earlier levels. There is an automap and plenty of transfer potions that one can buy, ensuring that after the first few hours, the player will have the ability to come and go from the Labyrinth with relative ease.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the standard punch, kick, and jump buttons and a designated <b>run</b> <b>button,</b> the player now has an evade button for dodging attacks. If the player times their evasion right so as to perfectly dodge an enemy attack, they will [...] "Gleam" [...] by briefly glowing red, during which time their attacks will be more powerful. The player can collect life-replenishing sodas, money to buy items from shops, and special mixtapes that can be equipped from a pause menu. Two different tapes can be equipped at once: one to grant the brothers a powerful attack that consumes a separate energy meter, and one to alter their statistics and grant special effects (such as {{making it easier to}} stun enemies or healing HP with every connecting blow). By collecting multiple copies of a tape, its effect gradually increases until it reaches a maximum capacity. Each tape's maximum capacity can be increased further by visiting a [...] "Tapesmith" [...] and paying him Mythril, which is obtained from defeated bosses.|$|E

50|$|After {{retiring}} on {{the last}} lap of the European Grand Prix, Kimi Räikkönen was the 11th driver on the track in qualifying, and he managed to line up 7th on the grid. Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello suffered a gearbox failure {{before the start of}} his qualifying lap, and was forced to abort his <b>run.</b> Jenson <b>Button</b> managed to take pole position, with Michael Schumacher second, and both Renault drivers on the second row.|$|R

5000|$|Like all 1401 programs, Autocoder was {{stored in}} binary form on punched cards. When the cards were {{inserted}} into the card reader, pressing the <b>Run</b> <b>button</b> on the computer (a floor-standing unit; the card reader/punch was a peripheral, and there was neither keyboard or monitor) {{the contents of the}} first 80-character card were read into memory locations 0-79, and the instruction at address 0 was executed, thus beginning the bootstrap loader. Autocoder took human-intelligible symbols (such as a period to indicate [...] "stop") and transformed them into the instructions the machine recognized. It supported conditional branching, named subroutines, counting iterations, and what IBM called its Advanced Programming Feature, an optional feature involving three separate bytes between location 80 and 90. (Since memory locations 0-79 were reserved for the card reader, 100-179 for the card punch, which punched a card with the data in these locations when the [...] "punch" [...] command was issued, and 200-279 for the (single) printer, locations 80-99 were orphans and available for other purposes that only needed a few bytes.) ...|$|E
50|$|The PC Engine version (published by NEC Home Electronics and {{developed}} by Capcom) was released exclusively in Japan on June 12, 1993. The accuracy of this port is high {{compared to the}} Super NES port of The World Warrior, as it featured the barrel breaking bonus stage that was cut out from that version, along with numerous voice clips by the announcer and the elephants in Dhalsim's stage (these were later integrated in Street Fighter II Turbo for the SNES). This version was released on a 20-Megabit HuCard. NEC Avenue released the Avenue Pad 6 specifically for the PC Engine version of Champion Edition, which added four additional action buttons (labelled III through VI) {{in addition to the}} standard I and II buttons. Other six button controllers were later released for the platform such as the Fighting Commander PC by HORI and the Arcade Pad 6 by NEC Home Electronics. When the game is played on a standard two-button controller, the <b>Run</b> <b>button,</b> along with buttons I and II, are used as switchable attack buttons, while the Select button is used to toggle between punches and kicks. This version was released on Virtual Console on November 16, 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The list {{at the top}} of the Scripts {{category}} {{panel has}} a line for each Script. The line columns show the Script name, type of activity, last Activity date-time, and next Activity date-time if scheduled. The List View Toolbar can be used to Add, Remove, Duplicate, Run immediately, Save, or Revert a Script. The Scope Bar can be used to restrict the list to Backup, Restore, or Utility Scripts. The buttons on the detail pane are used to show a Summary and to define Sources, Media Sets or Copy Destinations, Rules (the new Retrospect Macintosh term for Selectors), Schedules, and Options for the Script. Backup media actions can no longer be specified for a Media Set; instead each schedule for a Backup Script now specifies a possibly-different media action for its specified Media Set. By dragging in the Sources list of the Summary detail pane view—not in the unchangingly-alphabetized check-box list of the Sources detail pane view, the administrator can change the sequence in which Sources are processed by the Script—which is otherwise determined by the Source's alphanumeric computer name at time it is added to the Script. Since Scripts that have been created by clicking Backup/Restore/Copy buttons in the top Toolbar appear as list lines, they can be rerun—with or without modifications—using the <b>Run</b> <b>button</b> in the List View toolbar; therefore Retrospect Macintosh 8 has eliminated the [...] "run documents" [...] that existed through Retrospect Macintosh 6 (and continue to exist in Retrospect Windows).|$|E
50|$|The game {{is entirely}} {{controlled}} with the mouse. Moving it controls the camera, while the left <b>button</b> <b>runs</b> forward {{and the right}} walks backwards. Moving into certain objects or areas can cause the character to do additional actions like jumping or activating switches.|$|R
50|$|At the 2009 Turkish Grand Prix the Brawns {{were beaten}} to pole by Vettel after {{struggling}} with pace throughout Friday and Saturday, for Button especially. At the start, Barrichello's anti-stall cut {{in and he}} fell {{to the back of}} the grid; Button meanwhile, after pointing the car at Vettel got off cleanly and inherited the lead at turn 10 when Vettel <b>ran</b> wide. <b>Button</b> led the race calmly for the rest of the race with his team mate having many incidents before giving Brawn their first retirement after losing seventh gear.|$|R
50|$|One button will light up, and {{the player}} {{has a certain}} amount of time to press the correct button. As the player makes progress, the player has less time to press the correct button. The game ends if the player presses the wrong <b>button,</b> <b>runs</b> out of time, or beats the game with the maximum score of 999 (20 minutes). The Titanium version of Light Speed allows you to score over 2,384 points (over an hour's worth of game play). The Ice Edition allows you to score over 9,999 points (that's 7,615 more points than the Titanium Edition). Unlike the original, Titanium and the Ice, the Micro Edition has a ranking system for how well a person plays. Micro Edition ends when the player presses the wrong <b>button,</b> <b>runs</b> out of time, or reaches the maximum score of 99.|$|R

30|$|The image acquisition, object detection, and path {{planning}} in MATLAB take approximately 1.6  s to compute while {{running on a}} PC with an AMD Phenom II ×  6 3.31 -GHz processor and 16  GB RAM. The object locations and {{path planning}} data calculated by the feedback block (Fig.  2) are saved in a.mat file. A MathScript node included in the actuation block in LabVIEW reads the data from the.mat file and sends it to the sequence generator for actuating the microrobots along the planned path. The feedback block runs in MATLAB and the actuation block runs in LabVIEW, so the operator needs to manually enter the.mat file location in the MathScript node and click the <b>run</b> <b>button</b> in the actuation block. This operation takes approximately 5  s, {{so there is a}} total delay of approximately 6.5  s between the image acquisition and the microrobot actuation.|$|E
50|$|It {{looked as}} if Sutil and Button's two-stop {{strategies}} were successful as Sutil got ahead of Rosberg in the later pit stops and finished the race in sixth place. Button was also going strong - catching and passing many drivers including Rosberg for sixth at Turn 1 when Rosberg outbraked himself and <b>ran</b> wide. <b>Button,</b> like Sutil, was only passed in the pit-line {{and not on the}} track, although his back luck continued from Silverstone and he suffered his second successive mechanical retirement, with a hydraulics failure. Only two laps later, Vitantonio Liuzzi became the fourth and final retirement of the race when his car had an electrical failure.|$|R
5000|$|Button won {{again at}} the [...] from fourth on the grid with Barrichello in fifth from sixth. <b>Button</b> <b>ran</b> most of the race in clean air and {{maintained}} the lead after the Toyotas pitted and fell down the order. This {{was the first time}} they were slower, with the fuel corrected qualifying times, in the season and was blamed on the lack of development on the car.|$|R
50|$|The second {{practice}} session {{was held in}} similar weather to the first; the only difference was a slightly higher peak track temperature of 40 C. During this session, Vettel set the fastest lap of the day, a 1:25.722; Webber finished with the second-fastest time. Grosjean {{ended up with the}} third fastest time. The Mercedes drivers were again quick—Hamilton in fourth and Rosberg sixth. They were split by Alonso; with teammate Massa in seventh. Räikkonen set the eighth fastest time. The McLaren drivers <b>ran</b> slower— <b>Button</b> in ninth and Pérez tenth. Williams driver Pastor Maldonado suffered from a loose wheel nut which deflated his right-front tyre, {{as a result of an}} earlier pitstop. Williams were fined €60,000.|$|R
