50|$|Early depth {{sounding}} {{was achieved}} using lead line sounding (or sounding line), where a lead weight {{attached to a}} length of rope marked with depth values. As this method was mechanical in nature, the only correction that {{was applied to the}} <b>sounding</b> was the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sounding</b> for tidal height. In the mid 20th century, sonar systems were developed to allow the measurement of underwater distances using the two way travel time of an acoustic pulse. This allowed the surveyor to take many more soundings in a given period of time and was less labor intensive than using a lead line.|$|R
40|$|Hybrid rocket {{propulsion}} technology shows promise {{for the next}} generation <b>of</b> <b>sounding</b> rockets and small launch vehicles. This paper seeks to provide details on the process of developing hybrid propulsion systems to the academic and amateur rocket communities to assist in future research and development. Scaling hybrid rocket motors for use in sounding rockets has been a challenge due to the inadequacies in traditional boundary layer analysis. Similarity scaling is an amendment to traditional boundary layer analysis which is helpful in removing some of the past scaling challenges. Maintaining geometric similarity, oxidizer and fuel similarity and mass flow rate to port diameter similarity are the most important scaling parameters. Advances in composite technologies have also increased the performance through weight <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounding</b> rockets through and launch vehicles. Technologies such as Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV) for use as fuel and oxidizer tanks on rockets promise great advantages in flight performance and manufacturing cost. A small scale COPV, carbon fiber ablative nozzle and a N class hybrid rocket motor were developed, manufactured and tested to support the use of these techniques in future sounding rocket development. The COPV exhibited failure within 5 % of the predicted pressure and the scale motor testing was useful in identifying a number of improvements needed for future scaling work. The author learned that small scale testing is an essential step {{in the process of developing}} hybrid propulsion systems and that ablative nozzle manufacturing techniques are difficult to develop. This project has primarily provided a framework for others to build upon in the quest for a method to easily develop hybrid propulsion systems sounding rockets and launch vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The {{utility of}} VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) {{temperature}} and moisture soundings and cloud and water vapor motion winds in defining a storm and its surroundings at subsynoptic scales has been examined using a numerical analysis and prognosis system. It is {{shown that the}} VAS temperature and moisture data, which specify temperature and moisture well in cloud-free areas, are complemented by cloud and water vapor motion data generated in the cloudy areas. The cloud and water vapor 'winds' provide thermal gradient information for interpolating the soundings across cloudy regions. The loss of analysis integrity due to the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> VAS <b>sounding</b> density in the cloudy regions associated with synoptic activity is ameliorated by using cloud and water vapor motion winds. The improvement in numerical forecasts resulting from the addition of these data to the numerical analysis is recorded...|$|R
40|$|A {{so-called}} {{wind shear}} (a vector difference of wind speeds in two {{points of the}} space referred to the distance between them) is of essential practical interest to air force. The wind shear is a hidden and cliffhanging phenomenon. The growth of aircraft incidents at their taking off and landing have drawn attention to this phenomenon. Laser methods {{are one of the}} advanced remote techniques to measure a speed and detect a wind shear. Remote laser methods of wind speed measurement are divided into Doppler and correlation ones. More simple (and, respectively, demanding less expensive equipment) are correlation methods and near to them non-Doppler techniques. Today almost all existing wind correlation lidars run in the visible range. However, in terms of safety for an eye, other ranges: near infrared (IK) and ultra-violet (UF) ones are also of interest. The work assesses a <b>sounding</b> range <b>of</b> the aircraft lidar in UF, visible, and near IK spectral ranges to solve a problem of wind shear detection for different altitude levels in the troposphere. Results of calculations show that the sounding ranges decrease with increasing flight altitude (at lidar parameters used in calculations) to be in range from ~ 2. 7 - 3. 3 km (the lowest atmospheric layer height ~ 0) to ~ 200 - 300 m (a flight altitude of 10 km). And the main <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sounding</b> range vs height is within the range of heights of 5 - 10 km. Such dependence is caused by the strong <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> aerosol extinction and atmosphere scattering with the altitude increase in this altitude range. In a ground layer of the terrestrial atmosphere (height ~ 0) the greatest sounding range is realized for a wave length of 0. 532 microns. With increasing flight altitude a difference in sounding ranges for the wave lengths of 0. 355; 9. 532 and 1. 54 microns decreases, and at big heights the greatest range <b>of</b> <b>sounding</b> is realized for a wave length of 1. 54 microns. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{connection}} with the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>sounding</b> rockets launched per year, {{there is a general}} need to make the most effective use <b>of</b> each <b>sounding.</b> In particular, it is often necessary to combine the results from different types of instruments to obtain a meaningful and complete picture of the atmosphere. For this reason, data from different rockets must be compatible. The present investigation is concerned with the utilization <b>of</b> the temperature <b>soundings</b> <b>of</b> the Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) as the uniform comparison standard. Gille et al. (1984) have compared the LIMS temperatures to a set of 122 U. S. datasonde rockets. In the current study, a comparison between soundings by rocketborne instruments of the USSR and LIMS is combined with the results of the previous LIMS-U.

40|$|The {{required}} number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> for geotechnical {{site investigation}} depends on different {{factors such as}} geology of the site, soil variability {{and the type of}} project to build. Indications on the number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> are given in codes of practice (Eurocode 7 [...] .) but they focus mainly on a minimal number which depends only on the area of the project. Geotechnical investigation is a process conducted, in general, in two steps. The first step consists in collecting available information and executing a limited number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> on site, while the second step of investigation is based on the first and requires more soundings for soil testing. The preliminary information is expressed by using random sets of the influencing factors (soil variability, geology [...] .). Intervals of values are proposed by experts (engineers) concerning the influence of each factor based on preliminary information from site (soil variability, geology, type of project). The expert proposes an interval of values based on his degree of belief. Using Eurocode 7 recommendations for site soundings, an “objective function” f(X) is constructed to rely “soil variability” to the number <b>of</b> <b>soundings.</b> It permits constructing the random set and obtain the number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> by unit area for each expert (engineer). The same reasoning is applied with other parameters such as geology and an inference system is obtained. Information is aggregated from the available parameters (Soil variability, Geology [...] .) and the random sets computed from which upper and lower probabilities (probability boxes) are built. They permit optimizing the number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> to be carried out on site. Author preprin...|$|R

On {{the basis of}} acoustic analysis of transcripts of radio advertising tape recordings, broadcasted at different radio stations, {{as well as in}} the result of processing the representative part of phrases with the help of special computer programs, the author determines the parameters of superfix means. The article proves that the stylistic parameters of advertising phonetic style are oriented on modern orthoepy, and that the originality <b>of</b> radio advertising <b>sounding</b> is determined by two tendencies – the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> stressed vowels duration in the terminal and non-terminal word and the increase of pre-tonic and post-tonic vowels duration of non-terminal word in a phrase. The article also shows that the peculiarity of rhythmic structure of terminal and non-terminal word in radio advertising is formed by means of leveling stressed and unstressed sounds in length. The specificity of intonational structure of an advertising text consists in the following peculiarities: matching of syntactic and syntagmatic division, which allows to denote the blocks of semantic models, forming the text of radio advertising; the allocation of keywords into separate syntagmas; the design of informative parts of advertising text by means of symmetric length correlation of minimal speech segments; the combination of interstyle prosodic elements in the framework <b>of</b> <b>sounding</b> text. Thus, the conducted analysis allowed to conclude, that the texts <b>of</b> <b>sounding</b> advertising are designed using special pronunciation style, marked by sound duration...|$|R
