40|$|We examine current {{numerical}} <b>relativity</b> <b>computations</b> {{of gravitational}} waves, which typically determine the asymptotic waves at infinity by extrapolation from finite (small) radii. Using simulations {{of a black}} hole binary with accurate wave extraction at r= 1000 M, we show that extrapolations from the near-zone are self-consistent in approximating measurements at this radius, although with a somewhat reduced accuracy. We verify that ψ_ 4 is the dominant asymptotic contribution to the gravitational energy (as required by the peeling theorem) but point out that gauge effects may complicate the interpretation of the other Weyl components...|$|R
40|$|In {{calculations}} of the inspiral of binary black holes an intermediate approximation is needed that can bridge the post-Newtonian {{methods of the}} early inspiral and the numerical <b>relativity</b> <b>computations</b> of the final plunge. We describe here the periodic standing wave approximation: A numerical solution is found {{to the problem of}} a periodic rotating binary with helically symmetric standing wave fields, and from this solution an approximation is extracted for the physically relevant problem of inspiral with outgoing waves. The approximation underlying this approach has been recently confirmed with innovative numerical methods applied to nonlinear model problems. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|We give a {{brief summary}} of results and ongoing {{research}} {{in the application of}} linearized theory to the study of black hole collisions in the limit in which the holes start close to each other. This approximation can be a valuable tool for comparison and code-checking of full numerical <b>relativity</b> <b>computations.</b> The approximation works quite well for the head-on case and this is motivation to pursue its use in other more interesting contexts. We summarize current efforts towards establishing the domain of validity of the approximation and its use in generation and evolution of initial data for more interesting physical cases.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{possibility}} of a dimensional reduction of the Einstein equations in S 3 black-hole lattices. It was reported in previous literature that the evolution of spaces containing curves of local, discrete rotational and reflection Symmetry (LDRRS) can be carried out via a system of ODEs along these curves. However, 3 + 1 Numerical <b>Relativity</b> <b>computations</b> demonstrate {{that this is not the}} case, and we show analytically that this is due to the presence of a tensorial quantity which is not suppressed by the symmetry. We calculate the term analytically, and verify numerically for an 8 -black-hole lattice that it fully accounts for the anomalous results, and thus quantify its magnitude in this specific case. The presence of this term prevents the exact evolution of these spaces via previously-reported methods which do not involve a full 3 + 1 integration of Einstein's equation.

40|$|Open Access - IOP selectThis {{paper is}} {{motivated}} {{by the need to}} improve the post-Newtonian (PN) amplitude accuracy of waveforms for gravitational waves generated by inspiralling compact binaries, both for use in data analysis and in the comparison between post-Newtonian approximations and numerical <b>relativity</b> <b>computations.</b> It presents (i) the non-linear couplings between multipole moments of general post-Newtonian matter sources up to order 3. 5 PN, including all contributions from tails, tails-of-tails and the non-linear memory effect; and (ii) the source mass-type octupole moment of (non-spinning) compact binaries up to order 3 PN, which permits completion of the expressions of the octupole modes $(3, 3) $ and $(3, 1) $ of the gravitational waveform to order 3. 5 PN. On this occasion we reconfirm by means of independent calculations our earlier results concerning the source mass-type quadrupole moment to order 3 PN. Related discussions on factorized resummed waveforms and the occurence of logarithmic contributions to high order are also included...|$|R
40|$|Computability in Europe (CiE) is an {{informal}} network of European scientists working on computability theory, including its foundations, technical development, and applications. Among {{the aims of}} the network is to advance our theoretical understanding of what can and cannot be computed, by any means of computation. Its scientific vision is broad: computations may be performed with discrete or continuous data by all kinds of algorithms, programs, and machines. Computations may be made by experimenting with any sort of physical system obeying the laws of a physical theory such as Newtonian mechanics, quantum theory or <b>relativity.</b> <b>Computations</b> may be very general, depending upon the foundations of set theory; or very specific, using the combinatorics of finite structures. CiE also works on subjects intimately related to computation, especially theories of data and information, and methods for formal reasoning about computations.

40|$|We {{compute the}} {{gravitational}} Chern-Simons term explicitly for an adiabatic family of metrics using standard methods in general relativity. We use {{the fact that}} our base three-manifold is a quasi-regular K-contact manifold heavily in this computation. Our key observation is that this geometric assumption corresponds exactly to a Kaluza-Klein Ansatz for the metric tensor on our three manifold, which allows us to translate our problem into the language of general <b>relativity.</b> Similar <b>computations</b> have been performed in a paper of Guralnik, Iorio, Jackiw and Pi (2003), although not in the adiabatic context.

40|$|Barack and Sago [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 191101 (2009) ] have {{recently}} computed {{the shift of}} the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the Schwarzschild spacetime due to the conservative self-force that arises from the finite-mass of an orbiting test-particle. This calculation of the ISCO shift {{is one of the}} first concrete results of the self-force program, and provides an exact (fully relativistic) point of comparison with approximate post-Newtonian (PN) computations of the ISCO. Here this exact ISCO shift is compared with nearly all known PN-based methods. These include both "nonresummed" and "resummed" approaches (the latter reproduce the test-particle limit by construction). The best agreement with the exact (Barack-Sago) result is found when the pseudo- 4 PN coefficient of the effective-one-body (EOB) metric is fit to numerical relativity simulations. However, if one considers uncalibrated methods based only on the currently known 3 PN-order conservative dynamics, the best agreement is found from the gauge-invariant ISCO condition of Blanchet and Iyer [Classical Quantum Gravity 20, 755 (2003) ], which relies only on the (nonresummed) 3 PN equations of motion. This method reproduces the exact testparticle limit without any resummation. A comparison of PN methods with the ISCO in the equal-mass case (computed via sequences of numerical relativity initial-data sets) is also performed. Here a (different) nonresummed method also performs very well (as was previously shown). These results suggest that the EOB approach—while exactly incorporating the conservative test-particle dynamics and having several other important advantages—does not (in the absence of calibration) incorporate conservative self-force effects more accurately than standard PN methods. I also consider how the conservative self-force ISCO shift, combined in some cases with numerical <b>relativity</b> <b>computations</b> of the ISCO, can be used to constrain our knowledge of (1) the EOB effective metric, (2) phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown templates, and (3) 4 PN- and 5 PN-order terms in the PN orbital energy. These constraints could help in constructing better gravitational-wave templates. Lastly, I suggest a new method to calibrate unknown PN terms in inspiral templates using numerical-relativity calculations...|$|R
40|$|Massive gravity in {{the weak}} field limit is {{described}} by the Fierz-Pauli theory with 5 degrees of freedom in four dimensions. In this theory, we calculate the gravitomagnetic effects (potential energy) between two point-like, spinning sources that also orbit around {{each other in the}} limit where the spins and the velocities are small. Spin-spin, spin-orbit and orbit-orbit interactions in massive gravity theory have rather remarkable, discrete differences from their counterparts in General <b>Relativity.</b> Our <b>computation</b> is applicable for large distances, for example, for interaction between galaxies or galaxy clusters where massive gravity is expected to play a role. We also extend the computations to quadratic gravity theories in four dimensions and find the lowest order gravitomagnetic effects and show that at small separations quadratic gravity behaves differently than General Relativity.

40|$|We {{compute the}} {{quadrupole}} mode of the gravitational waveform of inspiralling compact binaries {{at the third}} and a half post-Newtonian (3. 5 PN) approximation of general <b>relativity.</b> The <b>computation</b> is performed using the multipolar post-Newtonian formalism, and restricted to binaries without spins moving on quasi-circular orbits. The new inputs mainly include the 3. 5 PN terms in the mass quadrupole moment of the source, and the control of required subdominant corrections to the contributions of hereditary integrals (tails and non-linear memory effect). The result is given {{in the form of}} the quadrupolar mode (2, 2) in a spin-weighted spherical harmonic decomposition of the waveform, and may be used for comparison with the counterpart quantity computed in numerical relativity. It is a step towards the computation of the full 3. 5 PN waveform, whose knowledge is expected to reduce the errors on the location parameters of the source.

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in numerical <b>relativity</b> now allows <b>computation</b> of the {{binary black hole}} merger, whereas post-Newtonian and perturbative techniques {{can be used to}} model the inspiral and ringdown phases. So far, most gravitational-wave searches have made use of various post-Newtonian-inspired templates to search for signals arising from the coalescence of compact binary objects. Ajith et al have produced hybrid waveforms for non-spinning binary black-hole systems which include the three stages of the coalescence process, and constructed from them phenomenological templates which capture the features of these waveforms in a parametrized form. As a first step towards extending the present inspiral searches to higher-mass binary black-hole systems, we have used these phenomenological waveforms in a search for numerically-simulated signals injected into synthetic LIGO data as part of the NINJA project.
