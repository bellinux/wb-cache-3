Trust and institutional contexts are thus in place to address such concerns. The IS literature has long studied trust’s effects on customers’ shopping intention. To make better use of vendors’ limited resources in trust building, recent studies shed light on narrowing down trust’s operational boundary for a more effective range. Integrating the findings on the nonlinear and conditional effects of trust, this study aims at understanding the complex moderating effects of institutional contexts {{on the relationship between}} trust and repurchase intention. Drawing on prospect theory, we hypothesize that customers will perceive the effectiveness of institutional contexts in mitigating risks in two distinct conditions (perceived effective and perceived ineffective) and hence exhibit different repurchase patterns. Our findings reveal an inverted U-shaped nonlinear relationship between trust and repurchase intention in perceived effective contexts and a U-shaped nonlinear in perceived ineffective contexts using survey data collected from online customers in the United Kingdom. Implications for vendors’ effective trust cultivation in two conditions are accordingly provided...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{outsourcing}} of IT-functions to vendors {{is today}} common among companies. This {{is done to}} achieve efficiency by taking part of the economies of scale {{and is expected to}} result in cost savings for the company. Other reasons for outsourcing are higher quality, competence and flexibility. There are many strategic objectives to be met and these are based on a partnership involving many individuals who will need to cooperate. We believe that whether an outsourcing will succeed or not is determined in collaboration between client and developer and that a poor working relationship can generate significant costs. A well-functioning relationship is of high importance for the outsourcing success. We want to create {{a deeper understanding of the}} factors that are essential for building good relations with focus on the operational level of business. Our study is based on a qualitative case study where we look at a company that conducted a comprehensive outsourcing. The study is based on three interviews with respondents at different levels of the customer organization. We use Quality Partnership to support and to examine the quality of the relationship. The model and results from our interviews show that good relationships are characterized by trust, understanding and good communication. Moreover, a healthy profit and risk sharing, strong information sharing and participation are needed for a partnership to develop. The basis for stable cooperation and partnership is a clear and comprehensive contract that works as support all the way down to the operational level. A partnership is also characterized by high dynamics and commitments and expectation that will most likely change over time. Furthermore, it is vital that there is a clarity <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> commitment and that there are reasonable expectations of both parties.

40|$|This study {{measures}} {{the value of}} website quality {{in terms of its}} impact on trust, intention to transact and price premiums. Prior research on online auctions has focused on the use of reputation systems for building trust in online auction vendors and subsequently to generate price premiums. This study examines the extent to which trust can be induced by improving the quality of online auction listings. A survey of 701 eBay users is conducted which compares the price premiums of two nearly identical online auction businesses, one that has online auction listings with a perceived high quality and the other that has substantially lower perceived quality. Results {{of this study indicate that}} website quality can explain 49 % of the variation in the trust for eBay sellers. In fact, it shows that sellers with good website quality are all perceived to be equally trustworthy regardless of their eBay reputation; whereas sellers with poor website quality are not perceived to be trustworthy even if they have a high eBay reputation score. The results also show that the trust resulting from increased website quality increases intention to transact and results in price premiums of 12 % (on average) for sellers with higher quality listings. Theories from marketing, economics, and social psychology are used to explain why website quality induces trust in unknown vendors without providing any concrete evidence <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>vendor’s</b> past history...|$|R

This study was carried out to establish the perceptions of students, principals, dean ofstudents andfinance officers on outsourcing of catering services at institutions of higher learning in Harare during the period of the hyperinflation period in Zimbabwe. The variables in the study addressed issues that uncovered the impact, effects and value created through outsourcing catering services at institutions of higher learning. A survey was conducted in which four institutions of higher learning participated. Two types of data collection instruments were used. These were interview schedules and questionnaires. The questionnaires were used to collect data from three hundred and sixty students, (ninety from each institution) at four institutions of higher learning in Harare. Face to face interviews with key respondents comprising four Principals ofcolleges and one university dean of students and four finance officers at each of the institutions selected using purposive sampling were conducted. The proposition of the study was; outsourcing non-core business improves operational efficiencies of an organization, reduces operational costs and improves company focus. The major findings of the study were that students expressed discontent with <b>regards</b> <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> service quality and customer relations. Outsourcing of catering services created value at institutions through shedding off noncore activities and focusing on the core business of education, training and researching. The findings of the study enabled the researcher to arrive at a conclusion on sustainable outsourcing of catering. Recommendations to build a legal contract with clear objectives and service level expectations of the outsourcing institution were made...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze factors that can {{influence}} the competitiveness of companies in the furniture cluster of Bento Gonçalves, Rio Grande do Sul. By a literature review, we identify four factors that can influence competition in clusters: the region's productivity, innovation, relationship with suppliers, and cooperation between companies. The research method is the single case study. The research techniques are the review of specific bibliographic and documentation of the studied cluster, and interviews with experts of the cluster. The main findings are: the cluster has high productivity, mainly by hi-tech machinery employed by the main companies; innovation is permanent and motivated by the imposition to medium and short companies of business goals by the main companies; the relationship with suppliers is problematic <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> large-scale <b>vendors</b> by <b>the</b> lack of the practice of collective purchases in the area; and cooperation between enterprises is small, by the culture of the region that don´t appreciate depending on resources available outside the companies.

40|$|Abstract Many {{organizations}} consider outsourcing {{their information}} technology (IT) development projects as an attractive risk-mitigating approach. In such an engagement, <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> may agree {{to complete a}} project for a fixed cost and according to a defined time schedule. Nevertheless, while <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> is liable for the traditional project risks, other forms of risk may arise, which are <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> risks. This paper presents a recent case study of a project failure that demonstrates some of <b>the</b> major <b>vendor</b> risks and their contribution to system development failure. The risks discussed in the paper are: (a) Adversarial relationships and loss of trust between <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> and <b>the</b> client; (b) <b>Vendor</b> management de-escalation of commitment; and (c) Difficulty in breaking the contractual engagement. The case shows that by outsourcing, an organization might not eliminate the traditional IT project risks but rather exchange them for equally fatal <b>vendor</b> risks. Furthermore, <b>the</b> case raises doubts <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of the contract-driven control approach to mitigate vendor risks. This paper suggest that perhaps, since placing all risks on <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> is impractical, a partnership approach of sharing risks and rewards {{may be more effective}} in bringing the client and <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> to successful project outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Due to its complex nature, {{after-sales service}} support for {{systems such as}} {{aircraft}} engines is commonly outsourced to <b>the</b> <b>vendor.</b> A key input to contracting for such support is system reliability. When producttechnology is new, <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> often knows more about reliability than the buyer, potentially leading to contractual inefficiencies. This paper examines the role of after-sales contracts as a mechanism for signaling reliability. We focus on two commonly encountered categories of contracts, the (generalized) Time and Material contract and the performance-based contract (PBC). We find that they differ substantially {{in their ability to}} signal reliability, achieve system efficiency, and allocate rents in the supply chain. While <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> of a reliable product is always better-off with PBC, the same is not true for the buyer or <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> of an unreliable product.

40|$|Transfers {{of joint}} stock {{companies}} can be executed {{in several ways}} - for example by transferring individual shares or by transferring all shares or by selling the company's assets and liabilities. It is not fully clear which rules should apply to transfers of joint stock companies. Some legal experts claim that the Sales Act (Köplagen) is applicable, while others claim that the rules for promissory notes (Skuldebrevslagen) should apply. This distinction is of great significance <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> extent of <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> liability. According to Skuldebrevslagen <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> liability is rather limited, while Köplagen enjoins <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> a more extensive liability. A transfer of a joint stock company brings about great economical risks, both for <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> and for <b>the</b> purchaser. Therefore it has become customary to execute a so-called due diligence, before the actual purchase takes place. The concept of due diligence derives from Anglosaxon law and appears in Sweden since the 1990 's. The purchaser is allowed to examine the company before the purchase. Normally the purchaser engages expertise to do the actual investigation, for example a law firm.

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{dynamics of}} the city involve the presence of temporary elements that are unplanned and unexpected. Yet the presence of such elements {{is contrary to the}} attempts to achieve harmony and perfection of 'ideal city', and they become 'out of place' elements that need to be rejected. This thesis is about the rejection of street vendors as temporary elements in the city. The great increase of street vendors in many countries has inevitably changed the visual image of the cities. Their presence has continuously become the subject of debates, whether they should be maintained or banished from urban areas. However, {{there was a lack of}} evidence on <b>the</b> users' view <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> street <b>vendors</b> as rejected urban elements. This research explores the users' evaluation towards the presence of street vendors in urban places in Jakarta, Indonesia through a preference approach. The objectives are to examine: 1) the extent to which the users perceive <b>the</b> street <b>vendors</b> as 'out of place' elements in urban places; 2) the change of the users' evaluation of street vendors as 'out of place' elements in urban places from day time to night time; and 3) the extent to which the presence of street vendors as 'out of place' elements contributes to the users' general evaluation of urban places. The methods combine open-ended questionnaire with a standardised rating scale to elicit the users' responses towards slides of urban scenes with street <b>vendors.</b> <b>The</b> research found that users' evaluation towards the presence of street vendors as 'out of place' elements is not absolute; <b>the</b> street <b>vendors</b> are not always perceived negatively by the users. In particular, the users' evaluation of street vendors as 'out of place' changed from day time to night time, and their presence were perceived as less 'out of place' at night time. The research confirmed the important role of street vendors as temporary elements in the users' general evaluation of urban environment. The findings provide some implications for planning process to incorporate the presence of street <b>vendors</b> in <b>the</b> cities. They suggest some possibilities to develop ways to make their presence' in place', rather than taking for granted that their presence is 'out of place'. ...|$|R
