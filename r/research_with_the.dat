5|$|Genomics {{is central}} to malaria <b>research.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> {{sequencing}} of P.falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can be studied.

5|$|In {{the time}} that Gates was there, {{research}} focused mainly on honey production, brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and cranberry industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities {{from day to day}} as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology <b>research,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E

5|$|MIT {{was elected}} to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and remains a {{research}} university with a very high level of research activity; research expenditures totaled $718.2 million in 2009. The federal government was the largest source of sponsored <b>research,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million. MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty. In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties. Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{resulted}} in a dramatic increase of sponsored <b>research,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1943–1944 budget being the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the EES's other income (most notably, its state appropriation). Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the state had cut the station's appropriation by 40 percent, but increased support from industry and government eventually counteracted low state support. The electronics and communications research that Directors Gerald Rosselot and James E. Boyd attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were {{a study on the}} propagation of electromagnetic waves, and United States Navy-sponsored radar research.|$|E
5|$|Between 1913 and 1916, Gerhard Heilmann {{published}} {{a series of}} articles in the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society, all heavily illustrated and dealing with the question of the origin of birds. He first proposed the idea of a popular treatise on bird evolution in 1912 to Otto Helms, the editor of the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society. Helms supported the idea but recommended that Heilmann first seek professional advice on the topic. Despite the lack of formal training in zoology, Heilmann succeeded in amassing his <b>research</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of several others, including the expert in prehistoric animals at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen, Adolf Herluf Winge, and the biologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson of the University of Dundee. Winge, though initially showing interest in Heilmann's work, later proved {{to be a source of}} frustration by refusing to engage Heilmann in depth on various scientific queries. Heilmann eventually broke off contact, expressing some bitterness at the apparent change of heart, which Heilmann later ascribed to Winge's belief in Lamarckism.|$|E

25|$|As {{in other}} liberal denominations, this notion offered a {{conceptual}} framework for reconciling the acceptance of critical <b>research</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> maintenance of a belief {{in some form of}} divine communication, thus preventing a rupture among those who could no longer accept a literal understanding of revelation. No less importantly, it provided the clergy with a rationale for adapting, changing and excising traditional mores and bypassing the accepted conventions of Jewish Law, rooted in the orthodox concept of the explicit transmission of both scripture and its oral interpretation. While also subject to change and new understanding, the basic premise of progressive revelation endures in Reform thought.|$|E
25|$|Advanced {{stem cell}} {{research}} takes place in Israel.

In 2011, Israeli scientist Inbar Friedrich Ben-Nun led a team which produced the first stem cells from endangered species, a breakthrough that could save animals in danger of extinction.

25|$|Through his <b>research</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rats, {{he learned}} that forgetting was {{dependent}} {{on the amount of}} tissue removed and not where it was removed from. He called this mass action and he believed that it was a general rule that governed how brain tissue would respond, independent of the type of learning. But we know now that mass action was true for these rats, because learning to run a maze is known as complex learning and it requires multiple cortical areas, so cutting into individual parts alone will not erase the memory from the rats' brains, but taking large sections removes multiple cortical areas at one time and so they can forget.|$|E

25|$|LDP is a {{reactive}} programming language. It {{has been}} used to trigger debugging in the earlier <b>research.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> addition of language that enables the programmer to build operations {{in the development of the}} shape of the matrix, it can be used to analyze the distributed local conditions. It can operate on fixed-size, connected groups of modules providing various functions of state configuration. A program that addresses a fixed-size module rather than the entire ensemble allows programmers to operate the claytronic matrix more frequently and efficiently. LDP further provides a means of matching distributed patterns. It enables the programmer to address a larger set of variables with Boolean logic, which enables the program to search for larger patterns of activity and behavior among groups of modules.|$|E
