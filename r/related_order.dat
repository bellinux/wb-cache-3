500|$|The {{fossil record}} of the Dermaptera starts in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic period about [...] in England and Australia, and {{comprises}} about 70 specimens in the extinct suborder Archidermaptera. Some of the traits believed by neontologists to belong to modern earwigs are {{not found in the}} earliest fossils, but adults had five-segmented tarsi (the final segment of the leg), well developed ovipositors, veined tegmina (forewings) and long segmented cerci; in fact the pincers would not have been curled or used as they are now. The theorized stem group of the Dermaptera are the Protelytroptera. These insects, which resemble modern Blattodea, or cockroaches owing to shell-like forewings and the large, unequal anal fan, are known from the Permian of North America, Europe and Australia. There are no fossils from the Triassic when the morphological changes from Protelytroptera to Dermaptera took place. The most likely, and most closely resembling, <b>related</b> <b>order</b> of insects is Grylloblattaria, theorized by Giles in 1963. However, other arguments have been made by other authors linking them to Phasmida, Embioptera, Plecoptera, and Dictyoptera.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group is}} {{difficult}} to characterize phenotypically, although members often have dentate leaves, with the teeth having [...] a single vein running into a congested and often deciduous apex (i.e., violoid, salicoid, or theoid). Also, zeylanol [...] has recently been discovered in Balanops and Dichapetalum [...] which are in the balanops clade (so-called Chrysobalanaceae s. l.). The so-called parietal suborder (the clusioid clade and Ochnaceae s. l. were also part of Parietales) corresponds with the traditional Violales as 8 (Achariaceae, Violaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Lacistemataceae, Scyphostegiaceae, Turneraceae, Malesherbiaceae, and Passifloraceae) of the order's 10 families along with Salicaceae, which have usually been assigned as a <b>related</b> <b>order</b> or suborder, are in this most derived malpighian suborder, so that eight of the 10 families of this suborder are Violales.

5000|$|Like all tunicates, {{they are}} filter feeders. Unlike the <b>related</b> <b>order</b> Ascidiacea, which are sessile, {{but like the}} order Larvacea, they are free-floating; they take in a flow of water, from which they gather the {{plankton}} on which they feed. They then force the water through their bodies and eject it out through the rear siphon in a jet that propels {{in a way that}} suggests a tiny ramjet. This is an effective means of propulsion, by which Doliolida can move quite quickly.|$|E

5000|$|Amblypygi is {{an ancient}} order of {{arachnid}} chelicerate arthropods also known as whip spiders and tailless whip scorpions (not {{to be confused with}} whip scorpions and vinegaroons that belong to the <b>related</b> <b>order</b> Thelyphonida). The name [...] "amblypygid" [...] means [...] "blunt rump", a reference to a lack of the flagellum ("tail") that is otherwise seen in whip scorpions. They are harmless to humans. Amblypygids possess no silk glands or venomous fangs. They rarely bite if threatened, but can grab fingers with their pedipalps, resulting in thorn-like puncture injuries.|$|E

50|$|They are {{distinguished}} from other sea cucumbers {{by the presence}} of flattened, often leaf-like tentacles, but without the other large appendages found in the <b>related</b> <b>order</b> Elasipodida. They do not have introvert or retractor muscles. The tube feet often form a clearly demarcated sole. They have 15-30 shield-shaped retractile tentacles surrounding their mouths. The body wall is thick and leathery and contains ossicles, including some table-shaped ones. They have respiratory trees for gas exchange. The mesentery of the posterior loop of their gut is attached to the right ventral interradius. The muscles that run longitudinally down the body are arranged into five double bands. They can shoot out sticky white threads known as cuvierian tubules from their cloacas in order to distract or entangle predators. They are usually found in exposed shallow-water environments.|$|E
