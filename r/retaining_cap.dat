40|$|Objective. Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) {{is characterized}} by early endothelial damage evolving to vascular desertification. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF- 1) and its receptor CXCR 4 regulate specific steps in new vessel formation. We undertook this study to determine whether an alteration of the SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 axis might {{be involved in the}} pathogenetic mechanisms following ischemic damage during SSc. Methods. We enrolled 36 SSc patients and 15 controls. Skin biopsy samples were obtained from each subject, and the expression of SDF- 1 and CXCR 4 was assessed by immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blot analyses. Furthermore, isolated microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) from 4 patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) and 3 controls were analyzed for SDF- 1 and CXCR 4 by confocal laser scanning microscopy, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. Results. SDF- 1 and CXCR 4 were up-regulated in the skin of patients with early (edematous) SSc, both in the diffuse and limited cutaneous forms, and progressively decreased, with the lowest expression in the latest phases of both SSc subsets. MVECs from patients with dcSSc expressed significantly higher amounts of both isoforms of SDF- 1 in the early stage of disease, with a progressive reduction of SDF- 1 and CXCR 4 in later stages. On the surface of cultured MVECs from patients with dcSSc, SDF- 1 and CXCR 4 colocalized in polarized areas, suggesting that they are activated in vivo and that they are under strict genetic control to <b>retain</b> <b>capping</b> function. Conclusion. Due to its transient expression, SDF- 1 could be considered a future therapeutic target to induce new vessel formation in SSc...|$|R

40|$|Many {{believe that}} U. S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts {{will provide the}} swing vote in the court's {{decision}} in Shaun McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (McCutcheon), a case challenging the constitutionality of caps on {{the total amount of}} campaign contributions an individual may make to candidates, political parties, and political action committees. Based on his comments during oral arguments, some have speculated that Roberts will vote to strike down limits on aggregate contributions to candidates but will support maintaining limits on contributions to parties and political action committees (PACs). We illustrated in Part 1 of this two-part series that eliminating limits on aggregate contributions to candidates while leaving other aggregate limits intact would enable joint fundraising committees (JFCs) operated by party leaders and elected officials to solicit contributions as large as $ 2. 5 million from a single donor. This report shows that a supposed middle ground that permitted unlimited aggregate contributions to candidates but <b>retained</b> <b>caps</b> on contributions to parties would also likely end up eroding the integrity of limits on contributions to parties. Under a scenario in which only caps on total contributions to candidates were struck down, the party leaders and elected officials who administer joint fundraising committees would likely end up soliciting checks of more than $ 2. 5 million from major donors. The vast majority of these contributions would be distributed to candidates in increments of $ 5, 200 per recipient. However, because candidates could transfer their share of contributions received from JFCs to party committees, leaders of JFCs, would likely pressure candidates, the majority of whom are running in uncompetitive races, to redirect that money to back party committees. Using conservative estimates about the number of major donors that would contribute $ 2. 5 million to a joint fundraising committee if the court eliminated caps on total contributions to candidates, and data on the number of competitive and non-competitive congressional races in recent election cycles, we estimate that eliminating the aggregate limit on contributions to candidates could enable candidates to transfer more than $ 74 million to the national party committees combined. Each donor would effectively be contributing the equivalent of more than $ 1. 8 million to party committees, or more than 24 times the legal limit...|$|R

40|$|The yeast snoRNP protein, NOP 1, is {{structurally}} and functionally homologous to vertebrate fibrillarin and {{is essential}} for viability. A conditionally lethal allele was constructed by placing NOP 1 expression {{under the control of}} a GAL promoter. Growth on glucose medium results in the depletion of NOP 1 over several generations, during which cell growth is progressively impaired. Pulse labelling of proteins shows that NOP 1 depleted strains are greatly impaired in the production of cytoplasmic ribosomes, and they have a reduced level of rRNA. Northern hybridization and pulse-chase labelling of pre-rRNA show a progressive impairment of all pre-rRNA processing steps. The pathway leading to 18 S rRNA is particularly affected. Methylation of pre-rRNA is concomitantly impaired and unmethylated pre-rRNA accumulates and is not processed over long periods. NOP 1 depletion does not prevent the accumulation of seven snoRNAs tested including U 3; the levels of two species, U 14 and snR 190, decline. The snoRNAs synthesized in the absence of NOP 1 <b>retain</b> TMG <b>cap</b> structures.
