50|$|The two TDRSS {{satellite}} ground terminals {{are located}} at NASA White Sands Complex, {{which is in}} the Las Cruces area. All radioed commands and received telemetry that go to and from the tracking and data relay satellites go by way of these terminals at the White Sands Complex. At first, just one large ground terminal system for the TDRSS was designed and built. However, some years later, due to increased user demand NASA ordered the design and construction of a second ground terminal system about 5 km away. Thus, there are now two functionally identical and <b>redundant</b> <b>satellite</b> ground terminals there, which are known as the White Sands Complex. Due to a Zone of Exclusion, no user support over the Indian Ocean, a ground terminal was built in Guam to support TDRS.|$|E

Merging this data with satellite infrared images would provide a robust, affordable, all-weather, global ocean monitoring system {{in support of the}} Navy Tactical Oceanography mission. The present Navy system for mapping ocean features uses sea surface temperature maps from NOAA satellite radiometers and sea surface height profiles from the Navy GEOSA T radar altimeter satellite. GEOSAT is a 1450 -pound, completely <b>redundant</b> <b>satellite</b> with a 207 -pound, 165 -watt radar altimeter. GEOSAT was developed by JHU/APL and launched in March 1985 on an Atlas-E. A lightsat-compatible radar altimeter instrument has now been developed at APL that achieves full GEOSAT measurement capability In one-half the weight and power (95 pounds and 69 watts), primarily by applying the latest advances in RF and digital components. A form, fit, and function engineering model of the altimeter is being fabricated for performance validation. The conceptual design of GEOSCOUT, a Scout launched version of the GEOSAT satellite, was completed to establish the technical feasibility of the radar altimeter lightsat concept. The spacecraft weight was reduced to 395 pounds and the configuration made Scout-compatible. These weight and volume reductions were made possible by downsizing the instrument, eliminating subsystem redundancy, and by updating subsystem designs. The success of the GEOSCOUT conceptual design has encouraged APL to pursue the next logical step: a combined altimeter/radiometer lightsat. Work on that concept has now begun...|$|E

While ARAIM depends on multiple <b>redundant</b> <b>satellites</b> in view and will perform best for multi-constellation users, the modernization of the GPS satellite constellation and Operational Control Segment provides a basis for future improvements in ARAIM availability for GPS-only users due to improved ranging accuracy and lower satellite fault probabilities.

40|$|GPS/GLONASS pseudo-range and {{carrier phase}} {{observations}} {{are affected by}} errors such as cycle slips, multipath effects, residual atmospheric biases, orbital errors, inter-channel biases and random noise. Due {{to the presence of}} these errors, instantaneous (singleepoch) ambiguity resolution using state-of-the-art GPS techniques becomes quite difficult, and even fails if the observations are seriously contaminated. Unfortunately this is not an unlikely event in kinematic positioning applications. In this paper an adaptive procedure based on a real-time stochastic model estimated from the previous residual series, and a multiple outlier detection algorithm based on correlation analysis theory, is proposed. Tests have been carried out using dual-frequency GPS/GLONASS and GPSonly receivers, and single-frequency GPS/GLONASS receivers, over distances ranging up to 10 kilometres. The results indicate that after applying the proposed adaptive procedure the success rates of ambiguity resolution using a single epoch of data can be significantly improved up to 98. 3 %, and the kinematic positioning accuracy is very high {{in the case of a}} large number of <b>redundant</b> <b>satellites...</b>|$|R
30|$|The COMMStellation™ {{satellite}} network [9, 10] is an orbit with an altitude range around 1000 km. It consists of six orbital planes with 12 satellites in each plane. Those planes have an additional two <b>redundant</b> <b>satellites</b> in every orbit. The spacing between the orbital planes is 30 ° apart. The Earth station is 10 ° {{in the minimum}} elevation angle to maximize the coverage area of satellites. This will improve the link quality by decreasing multipath fading and having positive impact on link quality when compared with lower elevation of the Earth station. Both the uplink and downlink of the satellite link bandwidth is 1.1 Gbps, and {{the capacity of the}} satellite node is 8.8 Gbps. There are two types of stations; they are (1) trunk station that always connects to the Internet backbone and (2) user station for individual client to connect to the satellite link. The available bandwidth of the Internet backbone of the trunk station has a setup link which is the STM- 4 transmission and cross link communication which is the STM- 1 transmission.|$|R

40|$|The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation/Reflective (RO/R) {{instrument}} collects global atmospheric {{data and}} oceanic wind speed data for weather prediction and climate researches. This paper proposes the conceptual {{design of the}} satellite constellation and the satellite to realize the GNSS-RO/R mission based on the cubesat platform, with the goal to achieve cost effectiveness and minimum deployed schedule. The cubesat considered in the study is 6 U and within 10 kilogram. The proposed innovative constellation consists of 12 (minimum required) plus 6 (backup) satellites on three 500 km altitude sun synchronous planes, 6 satellites even phasing on each plane. It {{is expected to have}} 3000 profile measurements per day at minimum (3600 profiles as a goal). The payload instrument will be able to collect RO/R measurements via GPS and GLONASS. The mission lifetime is 3 years. The on-orbit redundancy, instead of <b>redundant</b> <b>satellite</b> components, is adapted to increase system reliability. The satellite design of this study faces very tough challenging to meet the 10 -kg mass constraint. The proposed solutions to lower down mass include the creative payload design, the plasma thruster based reaction control subsystem and attitude control subsystem, the use of special non-space grade made-in-Taiwan components, and the creative mission scheduling among satellites to optimize daily global coverage with limited duty cycle of each satellite (the duty cycle can not be 100 % because of mass saving on solar array and battery). The study demonstrates the feasibility to achieve the system design. The lessons learned of the system design study have also been introduced. The international cooperation and investment to realize this development is welcome...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGPS {{by itself}} is {{unsatisfactory}} as a sole means of navigation for civil aviation users. "Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring" (RAIM) has been proposed whereby a receiver makes use of <b>redundant</b> <b>satellite</b> information to check {{the integrity of the}} navigation solution. Two types of algorithms can provide RAIM function: the currently used snapshot methods only process the current measurements and the sequential ones process all past and current measurements. The principal limitation of snapshot RAIM is its availability. Indeed for a Non-Precision Approach (NPA) phase of flight there are periods when the five satellites (with sufficiently good geometry) required for fault detection are not available; these periods sometimes last more than 10 minutes. As well, the fault detection and exclusion function can be unavailable fm mom than an hour. Use of sequential algorithm will with no doubt improve this situation but will probably not be sufficient to allow GPS to meet Civil Aviation requirements. As a solution an attempt could be made to hybridize GPS with an Inertial Navigation System (INS). Two solutions for hybridization are considered. The simplest solution is to use the INS as a primary system of navigation and to update it periodically with the GPS solution. The GPS position must then be carefully monitored by a sequential algorithm that tests the least squares residuals of the GPS solution. The integrity of the INS must then be monitored by another algorithm. The other solution is to hybridize more finely the two systems by using a bank of Kalman filters that take into account all the measurements from GPS satellites and INS. Then a sequential algorithm will try to detect and isolate any faulty GPS channel or INS sensor...|$|E

40|$|Integration of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with Inertial Navigation System (INS) {{has been}} {{considered}} as the best technique that can provide high accuracy and reliable positioning and navigation results. This is because the characteristics of errors in both sensors complement each other. Despite significant progress {{over the last two}} decades, it is necessary to ensure that the navigation solution provided by such integration meets the requirements of the navigation system performance particularly in terms of accuracy and integrity. While various quality control techniques (e. g., extended Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring procedures) have been adopted in integrated navigation systems, their performances are limited to detect single fault at a time. However, this is not always the case because the system may include more than one failure simultaneously. As a result, the need of integrity monitoring systems that provide satisfaction performance should take the highest priority. The aim of this research is to analyze reliability and integrity monitoring under the presence of multiple faults in different GNSS/INS integration modes. In this research four main GNSS systems, integrated multi constellations and different GNSS observations including pseudorange and carrier phase and hence different GNSS/INS integration scenarios have been investigated with respect to the quality control procedures. More specifically, the contributions of this research are: a) Adaptive Kalman filtering As Kalman filtering is normally used in integration GNSS/INS systems, the integration filter should be optimal in order to get optimal integration. Optimal integration filter requires realistic assumption of the measurement model and system covariance matrices R and Q respectively otherwise the filter will be suboptimal or sometimes diverge. This thesis has evaluated the performances of adaptive Kalman filtering methods in integrated navigation systems. This was through comparing adaptive Kalman filtering methods based on covariance analysis, and innovation and residual analysis. In addition, the Influence of moving window sizes on the performance of adaptive filtering has also been investigated. This allows selecting realistic values of both Q and R that give the best stable state estimates. b) Multi-faults detection and identification It is necessary to evaluate the capability of the fault test in terms of detection and identification of single and multiple faults in integrated GNSS/INS systems with different types of GNSS observations. In this research two GNSS/INS integration scenarios based on satellite pseudorange and carrier phase with respect to multi-faults detection and identification in measurement and dynamic models have been investigated. Besides, the internal reliability measures have been employed to measure the capability of the system to detect and identify faults in both GNSS/INS models. This leads to highlight the problems that are associated with detection and identification of multiple faults in measurement and dynamic models. c) Integrity and reliability of integrated GNSS/INS systems Horizontal and vertical protection levels for single and multiple faults as a function to the number of visible satellites and the satellites geometry have been analyzed in GNSS and integrated GNSS/INS systems. In addition, the influences of the dynamics and vehicle trajectory on the reliability and integrity levels have also been investigated. d) Analysis of separability of multiple simultaneous faults The influence of number of <b>redundant</b> <b>satellites,</b> satellites geometry and different structures of dynamic on the capability of the system to detect and identify faults in integrated GNSS/INS systems has been analyzed. In addition, multi-dimensional correlation coefficients between fault detection statistics have been used as an indicator of the capability of the system to separate multiple faults...|$|R
30|$|Most outdoor {{navigation}} {{systems such}} as surface vessels use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) to measure their position.

A supporting positioning system that is <b>redundant</b> of the <b>satellite</b> signals is therefore necessary. By estimating the vessel movements using the surroundings, a mean of measuring {{the reliability of the}} GPS system is provided. The movement estimates can also be used during a GPS outage providing accurate position and movement estimates over a limited period of time. This support system could aid the crew in critical situations during a GPS outage, avoiding costly PR disasters such as running aground.|$|R
40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a {{satellite}} navigation {{system in which}} a user receives signals from at least four satellites and then can estimate {{the location of the}} receiver and the offset of the receiver clock from GPS reference time. The system is operated by the Department of Defense, but part of the system has been made available to the civil community. Currently, the accuracy and integrity of this system are being examined to determine the suitability of GPS for use in the National Airspace. The intrinsic accuracy which has been made available to the civil community has proven to be better than was originally planned and is quite satisfactory for civil aviation users;The question which remains unanswered pertains to the integrity of the system; that is, can it be assured that an alarm will be raised if the user 2 ̆ 7 s horizontal error exceeds a specified protection level due to {{a satellite}} signal malfunction. The system has many built-in features which monitor the signal quality but to satisfy civil aviation specifications (pertaining mainly to safety), an independent verification of the system integrity is required. The current proposed techniques for performing the integrity check are either based on a civilian ground monitoring system and communication link or on algorithms performed inside the GPS receiver which perform a consistency check of <b>redundant</b> <b>satellite</b> signals. The latter approach is sometimes referred to as receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM);This dissertation begins by presenting a review of the current RAIM techniques and then a new scheme is proposed which has some advantages over the previous approaches. It was found that even with the proposed 21 -satellite configuration, which always yields six to nine satellites in view, it is possible that poor integrity geometries can exist where failures in certain satellites cannot be observed in the consistency check. It appears that this fundamental limitation will require the use of aiding information independent of the GPS signals if continuous GPS integrity is to be provided 100...|$|E
40|$|GPS is {{the most}} widely used {{satellite}} navigation system. By design, there is no provision for real time integrity information within the Standard Positioning Service (SPS). However, in safety critical sectors like aviation, stringent integrity performance requirements must be met. This can be achieved using special augmentation systems or at the user sensor level through Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) or both. RAIM, which is considered as the most cost effective method relies on data consistency, and therefore requires redundant measurements for its operation. An external aid to provide this redundancy can be {{in the form of an}} Inertial Navigation system (INS). This should enable continued performance even during RAIM holes (when no <b>redundant</b> <b>satellite</b> measurements are available). However, the integrated system faces the risk of failures generated at different levels of the system, in the operational environment and at the user sensor (receiver) level. This thesis addresses integrated GPSIINS architectures, the corresponding failure modes and the sensor level integrity algorithms used to protect users from such failure modes. An exhaustive literature review is conducted to identify the various failure modes. These are then grouped into classes based on their characteristics and a mathematical (failure) model is specified for each class. For the analysis of failures, a simulation of a typical aircraft trajectory is developed, including the capability to generate raw measurements from GPS and the INS. The simulated GPS and INS measurements for the aircraft are used to evaluate the performance of the current integrity algorithms. Their performances are assessed for the most difficult case of failures; slowly growing errors (SGE), and shown to be inadequate (i. e. a considerable period of time is required for detection). This is addressed by developing a new algorithm based on the detection ofthe growth rate ofa typical test statistic (assuming a single failure at a time). Results show that the new algorithm detects slowly growing ramp-type errors faster than the current methods, with a forty percent improvement in the time it takes to detect the worst case SGE. The algorithm is then extended to include detection of multiple SGEs for which a new tightly coupled method referred to as the 'piggyback architecture' is proposed. This method provides the novel capability of detecting all failures including those affecting the INS. The proposed algorithms are validated with real GPS and INS data. In this way, the integrity performance of the integrated system is enhanced against the worst case failures with a detection time that is beneficial for the achievement of stringent time-to-alert requirements. A practical implementation would then comprise of the use of the rate detector algorithm alongside the current methods. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{observations and}} analysis experienced by a utility end user. As SCADA systems become {{a crucial part}} of daily operations for utilities, finding low-cost, reliable communications for substations in remote geographic locations often presents a challenge. Current SCADA communications methods, including framerelay, T 1, and fiber are often unreasonably expensive, in terms of installation costs and length of service contracts. Consequently, this can make integrating a utility’s entire system into a SCADA network economically unfeasible or difficult to justify. In an effort to overcome these obstacles, Plumas-Sierra Rural Electric Cooperative (PSREC) recently installed <b>redundant,</b> commercially available <b>satellite</b> Internet connections, from two separate providers, at two of its substations. These satellite Internet connections serve as redundant communications paths for the substations and enable their integration into the SCADA system.
