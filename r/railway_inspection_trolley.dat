40|$|Subject of investigation: contact {{network of}} trunk {{electrified}} railways. Purpose of the work: provision for reliable and economic current pick-off and {{improvement of the}} quality of operation of the contact network of electrified railways. A principle is developed for simultaneous measurement of wear of two contact wires in the fixed points {{with the use of a}} system monitoring the position of wires relative to the plan-view way axis. Methods are created for the design and investigation of the measuring skids with follow-up movable carriages. A device is developed for measuring the wear of the wires. Created are a stand and a specialized sector for the experimental dynamic investigation of the contact network diagnostical devices. The device for measuring the wear of contact wires is incorporated in the complex of the developed equipment of a laboratory <b>railway</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>trolley</b> for testing the contact network. The results of the work provide for the increase of the reliability of operation of the contact network owing to the detection of impermissible deviation of its parameters, and for the increase of labour productivity by way of automation of the production processesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increase}} in railway usage which led to reduced time for rail maintenance. Railway switches and crossings (S&C) are an important asset and they typically account for 30 % of the total budget spent on maintenance. The first part of this work researches the feasibility of automatically inspecting S&Cs in accordance with Network Rail inspection requirements and the likely necessary advancements. Current S&C inspection requirements, as well as current and developing inspection solutions, were analysed and categorised. This revealed the required technological advances and likely changes that the railway will have to adopt. The second part of the work researches the weakness of conventional S&C profile inspection practices used in industry. The work identified the main reasons that can lead to poor traditional inspection of the S&C profile, developed a novel, automatic method to carry out the profile measurements which eliminated human error and identified possible improvements in the area of S&C profile inspection. During this research, an <b>inspection</b> <b>trolley</b> was prototyped, field trials were carried out, and good results were obtained...|$|R

He was charged with clearing the Luderitz-Keetmanshoop railway line that had been damaged by German colonial soldiers, as they retreated into the interior. Farrar got damaged boreholes at Garub between Luderitz and Kubis working to provide 150,000 gallons {{of water a day}} for South African troops.

40|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>inspection</b> is an {{important}} task in railway maintenance to ensure safety. The fastener is {{a major part of}} the railway which fastens the tracks to the ground. The current article presents an efficient method to detect fasteners on the basis of image processing and pattern recognition techniques, which can be used to detect the absence of fasteners on the corresponding track in high-speed(up to 400 km/h). The Direction Field is extracted as the feature descriptor for recognition. In addition, the appropriate weight coefficient matrix is presented for robust and rapid matching in a complex environment. Experimental results are presented to show that the proposed method is computation efficient and robust for the detection of fasteners in a complex environment. Through the practical device fixed on the track inspection train, enough fastener samples are obtained, and the feasibility of the method is verified at 400 km/h...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{high speed}} dual purpose rail/road {{vehicles}} employing fixed non-destructive testing (NDT) sensors {{are used to}} inspect rails. Due to the uncertainties in characterisation of the defects when they are detected at high speed, manual re-visiting of the defects by expert operators is required before any decision regarding track maintenance is made. This research {{has been driven by}} a desire from the rail industry for a robotic system performing faster than human operators and being capable to both detect and characterise rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks in rails with the aim of automating the existing manual inspection and enhancing its accuracy and reliability. This thesis combines expert systems technologies with robotic NDT to fulfil this aspiration. A great deal of effort has been spent to develop a robotic <b>inspection</b> <b>trolley</b> which can automatically detect and characterise the RCF cracks in rails using an alternating current field measurement (ACFM) sensor. It uses a rule based expert system (RBES) proposed to control the robotic trolley and more importantly process ACFM data for both detecting and sizing defects. The developed system can detect the possible presence of defects in railway tracks at high speed pass (5 - 20 km/h) and can automatically return to an identified defect location to perform a slower and more detailed scan (up to 20 mm/s) across a rail section to determine the size, depth and number of cracks present in that section...|$|R

5000|$|Bridges Adams {{patented}} {{an improved}} carriage spring, {{which he called}} [...] "bow springs". These {{could also be used}} on railway carriages, and the manufacture proved profitable. The manufacture was based in the Currier Factory in Drury Lane and Parker Street, Soho. The business was carried out in the name of Samuel Adams, Bridges Adams's uncle. In 1842 the factory moved from its small premises to three acres of land adjoining the Eastern Counties Railway at Fair Field, Bow. The company now traded as Adams & Co. He founded the Fairfield Locomotive Works (...) in Bow, East London, in 1843, where he specialized in light engines, steam railcars (or railmotors) and <b>inspection</b> <b>trolleys.</b> These were sold in small numbers to railways all over Britain and Ireland, including the Fairfield steam carriage for the broad gauge Bristol and Exeter Railway and the Enfield for his most important customer, the Eastern Counties Railway, with its headquarters at nearby Stratford. Dissatisfied with the scarf joints then in use for joining iron track, he invented the first railway fishplate, {{in the form of an}} unbolted wedge between adjoining chairs, in collaboration with Robert Richardson, a junior engineer under Peter Bruff on the Eastern Counties Railway. The two men patented the invention in 1847. Although the design was successful, with sales to the Eastern Counties Railway among others, financial difficulties forced Adams to relinquish the patent. This [...] "wedge" [...] version was soon overtaken by an improved, bolted design by James Samuel of the Eastern Counties Railway. He also supplied an 2-2-0 well tank to the Roman Railway.|$|R

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} data are {{typically}} generated in applications such as surveillance of power lines and <b>railways,</b> <b>inspection</b> of gas pipes, and security surveillance. In the latter application it is a necessity that the data is transmitted to the control centre ``on-the-fly'' for analysis. Also missions related to other applications would greatly benefit from near real-time analysis and operator interaction based on captured data. This is the motivation behind this paper on coarse offline motion- and communication-planning for cooperating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem is defined in order to solve the surveillance mission. To efficiently transmit the data back to the base station the vehicles are allowed to store data for later transmission and transmit via other vehicles, in addition to direct transmission. The paths obtained by solving the optimization problem are analyzed using a realistic radio propagation path loss simulator. If the radio propagation path loss exceeds the maximum design criterion the optimization problem is solved again with a stricter communication constraint, and the procedure is continued in an iterative manner until the criterion is met. The proposed algorithm is supported by simulations showing the resulting paths and communication topologies for different choices of delay tolerance...|$|R
