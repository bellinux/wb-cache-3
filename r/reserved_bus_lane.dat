40|$|Bus {{travel in}} mixed traffic suffers from low speed and {{unreliability}} in Seoul. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has implemented {{a type of}} bus preferential treatment at most major arterials in Seoul since 1996. That is, the <b>reserved</b> <b>bus</b> <b>lane</b> designated for bus use only by land and pavement markings and signs, but not by fixed physical barriers. Until 1996 bus use the most predominant travel mode in Seoul, however the share of bus trips decreased remarkably from 1990 to 1997 due to the fast growing subway supply and the increased number of private vehicles. However, after the regular bus lanes were extended, the bus service improved and thus, the buses again became the predominant travel mode since 1998. In this paper, the performance impacts of reserved bus lanes in Seoul were evaluated and several suggestions for improving {{the effectiveness of the}} bus preferential treatment are proposed. The impacts of reserved bus lanes on both bus and auto performance were primarily measured by the relative speed changes of buses and autos and the average circulation rate of bus trips. Empirical results showed that the bus lanes were successful in improving average bus performance compared with other adjacent traffic. It was confirmed that right turning movement of the buses would cause the deterioration of bus speed in the curbside bus lanes. The average circulation rate of daily bus trips during the bus operation periods was somewhat increased by the bus lane introduction. A current warrant for reserved bus lanes in Korea was reviewed, and average bus speed during peak periods was proposed as a new warrant. In order to improve the effectiveness of the <b>reserved</b> <b>bus</b> <b>lane,</b> the type of lane markings in <b>reserved</b> <b>bus</b> <b>lane,</b> enforcement strategies for illegal parking in the bus lane and FIFO service at bus stops are discussed...|$|E

The desirable objective of passengertransportation, within the general goal, is moving more people in fewer vehicles.

Provision of <b>reserved</b> <b>bus</b> <b>lanes</b> {{is one of the}} important Bus-priority measures. The impact of introduction of an exclusive <b>bus</b> <b>lane</b> can be measured in terms of reduction in speed of other categories of motor vehicles, due to the consequent reduction in road space, over a wide range of traffic volume.

This goal, in respect of road transport, can be attained by encouraging public transport modes like buses by assigning priority. This paper is concerned with application of micro simulation technique to study the impact of provision of <b>reserved</b> <b>bus</b> <b>lanes</b> on the flow of highly heterogeneous traffic on urban roads.

The impact of introduction of an exclusive <b>bus</b> <b>lane</b> is measured in terms of the reduction in speed of other categories of motor vehicles, due to the consequent reduction in road space, over a wide range of traffic volume.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the rise in}} car use and decline in bus use in developing countries using a theoretical, mode choice model and numerical simulations. The empirical literature points to rising per capita income as a primary determinant of rising motor vehicle use, known as motorization. This analysis of commuter car/bus mode choice shows {{that in addition to}} rising income, other factors may drive rising car use at the urban level. First, greater income inequality increases car use if car use is still low, and reduces car use if it is already high. Second, traffic congestion hinders buses more than cars, causing positive feedback between car use and travel time that reduces bus use and contributes to its abrupt collapse. Third, policy interventions to reduce congestion in urban areas, such as tolling car use and reserving lanes for buses, increase consumer surplus by maintaining bus service as an alternate travel mode, even as incomes rise. Socially optimal <b>reserved</b> <b>bus</b> <b>lanes</b> may achieve most of the gains from a socially optimal toll on car use.

40|$|When {{the toll}} rings around Bergen and Oslo was {{established}} in 1986 and 1990 respectively, {{they were part of}} a major scheme to speed up road investments. In Oslo twenty percent of the revenue was allocated to public transport investments. The paper studies the impact of these major investments in road and public transport infrastructure on car travel and on public transport services. The paper comprises of three parts: Firstly, it describes the important features of the schemes. Emphasis is placed on the funding mechanisms (toll ring, government co-funding) and on description of the investment packages. Secondly, the effects for public transport operations and performance are investigated. We look at developments in aggregate indicators like operating costs, travel patterns, modal split etc. It is concluded that qualitative improvements, like <b>reserved</b> <b>bus</b> <b>lanes</b> and fully connected metro services, have played an important role in Oslo, whereas public transport has lost ground in Bergen, mainly due to reduced subsidies. Thirdly, the effects on car travel (traffic volumes, travel times and timing) are analysed. It is concluded that the overall volume of car traffic and the traffic volume in the three broad sectors of both regions only to a minor extent is influenced by the investment program. Increase in income, labour and population is more important as explanatory factors. There is however a difference a difference in car travel growth rates between Bergen and Oslo, reflecting the greater emphasis on public transport both in investment programs and subsidy level in Oslo. In the end, effects of land use changes on car travel and the role of trunk road investments in land use changes is discussed and main findings are summed up and conclusions drawn. ...|$|R
