5000|$|Histologically also it <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> lateral {{periodontal}} cyst {{which has}} a distinctive thin, nonkeratinized epithelium which is 1-5 cell layers thick and <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> reduced enamel epithelium.|$|R
5|$|The buttonquails are small, drab, running birds which <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> true quails. The female is the {{brighter}} {{of the sexes}} and initiates courtship. The male incubates the eggs and tends the young.|$|E
5|$|The kinglets are a {{small family}} of birds which <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> titmice. They are very small insectivorous birds in the genus Regulus. The adults have colored crowns, giving rise to their name.|$|E
5|$|The kinglets are a {{small family}} of birds which <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> titmice. They are very small insectivorous birds in the genus Regulus. The adults have colored crowns, giving rise to their name. Two species have been {{recorded}} in Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|In Kingdom Come, the United Nations Headquarters {{building}} strongly <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Hall of Justice {{as depicted}} on Superfriends, just as <b>the</b> metahuman prison <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> cartoon's {{headquarters of the}} Legion of Doom.|$|R
50|$|The male Andaman Mormon <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> blue Mormon (Papilio polymnestor) while <b>the</b> female <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> female form alcanor of {{the great}} Mormon (Papilio memnon) and is a mimic of the Andaman clubtail (Losaria rhodifer).|$|R
500|$|Cirrus Vertebratus clouds, <b>resembling</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of bones as hinted {{by the word}} [...] "vertebratus". They look more like fish bones, with fibrous lines that originate from one which <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance of}} fish bones.|$|R

5|$|The ribosomes coded {{for by the}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{are similar}} to those from bacteria in size and structure. They closely <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> bacterial 70S ribosome and not the 80S cytoplasmic ribosomes, which are coded for by nuclear DNA.|$|E
50|$|It is {{said that}} King Vajra first had three idols of Krishna carved {{but he had never}} seen Krishna, so they were then carved from the {{description}} of Uttara, the mother of Maharaja Parikshit. He had three different images carved, but none of them were perfect. Govindaji <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> face, Madana Mohan <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> navel down to the lotus feet, and Gopinath <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> trunk of the body, from the navel to the neck.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> Jutland {{strongly}} <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Schleswig, another {{heavy draft}} breed with similar origins that {{was influenced by}} Oppenheim LXII and his descendants. With the exception of feathering on its lower legs, <b>the</b> Jutland also <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Suffolk Punch.|$|R
25|$|Another {{significance}} of Hammond’s postulate {{is that it}} permits us to discuss {{the structure of the}} transition state in terms of the reactants, intermediates, or products. In the case where the transition state closely <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> reactants, the transition state is called “early” while a “late” transition state is the one that closely <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> intermediate or the product.|$|R
5|$|The {{series is}} a part of the company's {{franchise}} reboot, where Hasbro released a new line of Littlest Pet Shop toys designed to more closely <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> characters on the show. A mobile game and comic book adaptation were also commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The vireos are a {{group of}} small to {{medium-sized}} passerine birds restricted to the New World. They are typically greenish in color and <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> wood warblers except for their heavier bills. Eight species have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the pyramid, Djedkare's {{mortuary}} temple was laid out. The east façade of the mortuary temple was flanked by two massive stone structures, which <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> later pylons. The mortuary temple is connected via a yet unexcavated causeway to a valley temple.|$|E
50|$|Female. <b>Resembles</b> <b>the</b> male, but larger.|$|R
25|$|Dahul (دهول), closely <b>resembling</b> <b>the</b> Bur variety.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Le-Seyde <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Zimmer Golden Spirit.|$|R
5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes. A carcass was {{so named because}} the iron cage was thought to <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> ribs of a body. A carcass {{was filled with a}} highly flammable mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, The Adventure of Link {{was one of}} {{the first}} games to combine {{role-playing}} video game and platforming elements to a considerable degree. Over the next few years, a number of Japanese-made games appeared with a similar format; major titles such as Cadash (1989) closely <b>resemble</b> <b>The</b> Adventure of Link, with side-scrolling platform stages supplemented by RPG-like statistical systems, weapons, armor, magic spells, and so forth.|$|E
50|$|It <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> European mountain-ash, Sorbus aucuparia.|$|R
50|$|Its shape {{somewhat}} <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Tyrolean hat.|$|R
50|$|The MG7 {{comes in}} two variants, <b>the</b> first which <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Mark I MG ZT with twin front lights, and <b>the</b> second, which <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Mark II Rover 75 V8. A long {{wheelbase}} version, called the MG7L, features the deeper radiator grille of the Rover 75 V8.|$|R
5|$|Additionally, {{the game}} cabinet {{of the fictional}} Fix It Felix Jr. arcade game is stylized to {{strongly}} <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> cabinet of the original Nintendo Donkey Kong arcade game, with Ralph and Felix taking similar poses as Donkey Kong and Mario, respectively. The Hero's Duty game is {{a reference to the}} hugely successful first-person shooter games Halo and Call of Duty.|$|E
5|$|After General Edmund Allenby took {{command of}} the EEF at midnight on 28 June, he reorganised the force to reflect {{contemporary}} thinking and to <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> organisation of Allenby's army in France. He deactivated Eastern Force, establishing in its place two infantry and one mounted corps under his command: the XX, the XXI Corps and the Desert Mounted Corps (formerly the Desert Column).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the layers}} of pinacocytes and choanocytes <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> epithelia of more complex animals, they are not bound tightly by cell-to-cell {{connections}} or a basal lamina (thin fibrous sheet underneath). The flexibility of these layers and re-modeling of the mesohyl by lophocytes allow the animals to adjust their shapes throughout their lives to take maximum advantage of local water currents.|$|E
50|$|The A9, {{designed}} by Bertone, {{was the last}} prototype of Anadol. It was a 4-door sedan with a very modern design for the early 1980s. The rear parts of <b>the</b> car <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> future Peugeot 405, while <b>the</b> overall form <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> Volvo sedans of the mid-1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The modern Dorian mode is {{equivalent}} to the natural minor scale (or the Aeolian mode) but with a major sixth. The modern Dorian mode <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Greek Phrygian harmonia in the diatonic genus.
