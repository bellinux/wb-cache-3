500|$|All presidential {{election}} candidates receiving at least 10 {{percent of the}} vote are awarded an equal sum as election-campaign reimbursement. The amount is decided by the government at least 30 days before the election. This amount was set at 250,000 kuna ( [...] euro) for the 2009–2010 {{presidential election}}, representing a 50-percent decrease from the sum determined for the previous presidential election (when the reimbursement sum was set at half-a-million kuna). Similarly, the government also reimburses the political parties and slates for each parliamentary seat won. For the 2011 parliamentary election, each seat will be given 180,000kuna (euro). A sum of 30,000kuna (euro) will be paid to parties or candidates failing to win any parliamentary seats if they receive more than five percent of votes in a constituency. In addition, national-minority-representative candidates running on the minority ballot failing to win parliamentary seats (but still winning at least 15 percent of votes in their constituency) will receive 27,000kuna (euro) if the minority comprises less than 1.5 {{percent of the total population}} of Croatia.

The reason for my research is mainly its topicality and rapid evolution in a few past years. The boom of the mass claim recovery realized by the specialized "debt companies" was the reason of the legislative amendments and led to the ground-breaking decisions of the Constitutional Court, which resulted in the repeal of the regulation No. 484 / 2000 Coll.
