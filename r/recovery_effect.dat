For instance, a systematic experimental case study performed in [...] shows that an intermittent discharge current in case of Alkaline, Ni-MH and Li-Ion batteries results in a decreased usable energy output compared to a continuous discharge current of the same average value. This is primarily due to the increased Overpotential experienced due to the high peak currents of the intermittent discharge over the continuous discharge current of same average value.|$|E

A paper trail had confirmed that Dank had been dispensed Thymosin Beta-4 by the Como Compounding Pharmacy; however, no direct evidence was found that it was this Thymosin rather than a different legal Thymosin which had been administered to players, and this missing evidence link had been key to the AFL Tribunal's not guilty verdict under the 'links in the chain' evidence consideration. Part of the WADA submission to the appeal, which the CAS accepted in its comfortable satisfaction of guilt, was that Thymosin Beta-4 was the only form of Thymosin which would have had the soft tissue <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> that Dank had attributed to it - text messages from Dank had specifically described Thymosin as the cornerstone of the soft tissue recovery program. Two urine samples taken from Essendon players during 2012 were also found to contain elevated levels of Thymosin Beta-4; the levels were not sufficiently high to constitute a failed drug test, but they added to the cable of evidence against the players.|$|E
40|$|Wearable {{sensors and}} {{healthcare}} devices use small lightweight batteries to power their typical operations of monitoring and tracking. It becomes absolutely vital to effectively utilise {{all the available}} battery charge for device longevity between charges. The electrochemical <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> enables the extraction of more power from the battery when implementing idle times in between use cycles, and {{has been used to}} develop various power management techniques. However, there is no evidence concerning the actual increase in available power that can be attained using the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect.</b> Also, this property cannot be generalised on all the battery chemistries since it is an innate phenomenon, relying on the anode/cathode material. Indeed recent developments suggest that <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> does not exist at all. This paper presents experimental results to verify the presence and level of the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> in commonly used battery chemistries in wearable sensors and healthcare devices. The results have revealed that the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> significantly does exist in certain batteries, and importantly we show that it is also comprised of two different time constants.

40|$|With the {{perennial}} demand for longer runtime of battery-powered Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs), several techniques {{have been proposed}} to increase the battery runtime. One such class of techniques exploiting the battery <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> phenomenon claims that performing an intermittent discharge instead of a continuous discharge will increase the usable battery capacity. Several works {{in the areas of}} embedded systems and wireless sensor networks have assumed the existence of this <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> and proposed different power management techniques in the form of power supply architectures (multiple battery setup) and communication protocols (burst mode transmission) in order to exploit it. However, until now, a systematic experimental evaluation of the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> has not been performed with real battery cells, using high accuracy battery testers to confirm the existence of this recovery phenomenon. In this paper, a systematic evaluation procedure is developed to verify the existence of this battery <b>recovery</b> <b>effect.</b> Using our evaluation procedure we investigated Alkaline, Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery chemistries, which are commonly used as power supplies for WSN applications. Our experimental results do not show any evidence of the aforementioned <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> in these battery chemistries. In particular, our results show a significant deviation from the stochastic battery models, which were used by many power management techniques. Therefore, the existing power management approaches that rely on this <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> do not hold in practice. Instead of a battery <b>recovery</b> <b>effect,</b> our experimental results show the existence of the rate capacity effect, which is the reduction of usable battery capacity with higher discharge power, to be the dominant electrochemical phenomenon that should be considered for maximizing the runtime of WSN applications. We outline power management techniques that minimize the rate capacity effect in order to obtain a higher energy output from the battery...|$|E

40|$|Seven {{experiments}} demonstrate substantial forgetting {{and memory}} <b>recovery</b> <b>effects</b> using a behavioral methodology designed to produce strong retrieval bias. The procedure, which strengthens {{memories of a}} large subset of items (fillers) presented in an experiment, reduced recall of the unstrengthened subset (targeted critical items) as much as 63 % on a free recall test. On a subsequent cued recall test, appropriate cues produced nearly complete recovery; cued memories for subjects in the Forget group were as accurate as the Control group. Although free recall was strongly influenced, implicit memory was not affected by the forgetting procedure. Distinctive and emotionally-charged materials (e. g., expletives, death-related words) were quite susceptible to the forgetting and <b>recovery</b> <b>effects.</b> Tests using independent probes 1 repeatedly failed to find that these forgetting effects involved an inhibitory mechanism.

3000|$|The {{inertial}} {{control has}} a substantial impact on system performance. The short term impact is {{the delivery of}} extra power from WT with substantially reducing the ROCOF, providing time for the active governors to respond (see Fig.  8). Increasing the capability of WT to release hidden inertia (increasing H [...] emu [...]) helps to delay the UFLS. However, the frequency response provided by emulated inertia cannot completely avoid UFLS. Decreasing the amount of emulated inertia reduces not only the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> but also frequency support provided by wind farms. Results demonstrate UFLS helps to reduce the negative <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> caused by emulated inertia and increase security level during the extreme loss of power infeed.|$|E

A specific advantage of supercapacitors over traditional batteries is their performance over large numbers of discharge cycles. Likewise, in the case of wearable devices, it is essential to efficiently manage the available power. Supercapacitors exhibit a small <b>recovery</b> <b>effect,</b> in part due to ion diffusion. Modelling this effect allows an increase in available energy to be realized following the sleep times during a discharge cycle thus increasing the time between charging for wearables.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how compensation type and failure type explain the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> of compensation, using a meta-analysis (Study 1) and an experiment (Study 2). Drawing on resource exchange theory, we propose new classifications for both compensation and failure type and find three major results. First, {{consistent with our}} matching hypothesis, the strongest <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> is generally observed when compensation represents a resource similar to the failure {{it is supposed to}} offset, that is, immediate monetary compensation for a monetary failure, exchange for a flawed product, reperformance for a failed service, and psychological compensation for lack of attention. Surprisingly, lack of attention may also be rectified by the other compensation types. Second, consistent with our intertemporal choice hypothesis, immediate monetary compensation is generally more effective than delayed monetary compensation. Yet, this effect also varies with failure type. Third, resource-based classifications explain the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> of compensation better than current classifications of compensation and failure type. As a theoretical contribution, the resource-based classifications help to explain the fluctuating effect sizes of compensation reported in prior research. From a managerial point of view, practitioners can choose the appropriate compensation type for a failure, one that repays in kind what customers have lost. As a result, companies achieve stronger recovery effects without additional costs...|$|E

One of the actual disadvantages for this technology is the highly pronounced rate capacity effect, which reduces the available capacity to be discharged when high currents are used.
