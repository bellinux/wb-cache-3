In her review of Illmatic, Minyah wrote, [...] "I must maintain {{this is one of}} the best hip-hop albums I have ever heard" [...] and wrote of its content, [...] "Lyrically, the whole shit is on point. No cliched metaphors, no gimmicks. Never too abstract, never superficial." [...] She also commented on the impact of Nas's [...] "poetic realism" [...] writing: “Nas’ images <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personal memories and people, both passed and present… All this may sound like melodrama but it not just me. I've been hearing similar responses all over. While 'Memory Lane' is my shit, my homies claim 'The World Is Yours,' and if you've got peoples doing time, then 'One Love' may hit you the hardest.". With the backing of Schecter and the other editors on the staff, Minya awarded Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating.|$|E

Describing the song [...] "Matador", he said: [...] "parts of it <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Siouxsie and the Banshees album.

2500|$|Across that {{threshold}} I {{had been}} afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. [...] I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it. [...] God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. [...] To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. [...] Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. [...] The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me {{no matter what it}} might bring. [...] The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained to <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. [...] But it no longer depressed me. [...] I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.|$|E
2500|$|Rumors {{began to}} {{circulate}} {{alleging that the}} Buccaneers were a disorganized and confused organization, and returning veterans were promised that changes were forthcoming. It was pointed out {{that none of the}} team's administrative staff had any experience in their position, {{at the same time that}} a team of rookie players and coaches was being fielded. These problems were addressed with the firings and resignations of six coaches and administrators at the beginning of the year. Head coach John McKay used the opportunity to take control of more aspects of the organization, and selected replacements of his choosing. McKay was criticized over his handling of the players, and was accused of cutting veterans who could have helped the team, such as Ira Gordon, over ego conflicts. A perception arose that McKay was intolerant toward challenges to his authority, as he frequently cut players who argued with him, and surrounded himself with former USC players and staff. Concern that McKay preferred players who would keep their mouth shut, rather than players with talent, produced resentment among veterans who worried that their limited career spans would be spent with a losing team. Critics accused McKay of attempting a style of play that was more appropriate for the college game, and noted Don Shula's comment that preparing for the Buccaneers was like preparing to play USC. Reporters who covered the team indicated that McKay did not respond to the losing streak with the humor that it was hoped he would, but that he became an [...] "old grouch" [...] who complained about his coaching assistants, game-day officiating, and opposing coaches who he accused of running up the score. This was reflected in a bitter tone that had crept into McKay's trademark humor, with comments such as [...] "I keep a picture of O.J. Simpson by my side at all times to <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> days when I knew how to coach".|$|E

Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] It {{was important to me}} that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Welsh, that they should have their own message. <b>The</b> strata <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slate frontage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wales Millennium Centre <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizons just beyond Penarth Head.
