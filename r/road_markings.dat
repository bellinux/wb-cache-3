Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover <b>road</b> <b>markings.</b> Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E

5|$|Since opening, {{there have}} been reports {{relating}} to an increased number of road traffic incidents at Switch Island, the main terminus of the A5758 road. Some road users have noted that a lack of clear <b>road</b> <b>markings</b> and signage may be a contributing factor towards the traffic collisions, whilst Sefton Council noted that they continue to review the operation of the road and associated junctions. Following continued incidents at the junction with Switch Island, the council confirmed in July 2016 that it was in talks with Highways England and Merseyside Police with Bill Esterson, MP for Sefton Central, calling for changes to be considered to the road to improve safety.|$|E

25|$|Shared space schemes {{extend this}} {{principle}} further {{by removing the}} reliance on lane markings altogether, and also removing road signs and signals, allowing all road users to use {{any part of the}} road, and giving all road users equal priority and equal responsibility for each other's safety. Experiences where these schemes are in use show that road users, particularly motorists, undirected by signs, kerbs, or <b>road</b> <b>markings,</b> reduce their speed and establish eye contact with other users. Results from the thousands of such implementations worldwide all show casualty reductions and most also show reduced journey times. After the partial conversion of London's Kensington High Street to shared space, accidents decreased by 44% (the London average was 17%).|$|E

25|$|In most of Continental Europe, {{the default}} rule {{is to give}} {{priority}} to the right, but this may be overridden by signs or <b>road</b> <b>markings.</b> There, priority was initially given according to the social rank of each traveler, but early {{in the life of}} the automobile this rule was deemed impractical and replaced with the priorité à droite (priority to the right) rule, which still applies. At a traffic circle where priorité à droite is not overridden, traffic on what would otherwise be a roundabout gives way to traffic entering the circle. Most French roundabouts now have give-way signs for traffic entering the circle, but there remain some notable exceptions that operate on the old rule, such as the Place de l'Étoile around the Arc de Triomphe. Priority to the right where used in continental Europe may be overridden by an ascending hierarchy of markings, signs, signals, and authorized persons.|$|E
25|$|Stop {{signs are}} used globally. However, most {{countries}} see fewer {{of them than}} North America and South Africa, because all-way stops are never used and may even be legally prohibited. In a majority of European and Central Asian countries, as well as Cuba in North America, junctions without traffic lights or roundabouts are controlled by stop signs on minor roads and by white, yellow and black priority diamond signs on the major road. In the UK, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, New Zealand and Australia, stop signs are restricted to situations wherein coming to a dead stop is actually necessary because of severely limited sight lines. At {{the vast majority of}} minor intersections in these countries Give Way signs and/or equivalent <b>road</b> <b>markings</b> are used. Finally, at the busier crossing streets, Give Way signs may be replaced by (mini) roundabouts, which also work on the give way (rather than stop) principle.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{road network}} is {{generally}} well designed. An efficient system of highways, flyovers, ringroads and underpasses serve the city, {{and allow for}} the transport of goods and vehicles. The roads are not always well-maintained however, and often have incorrect, poorly visible or no <b>road</b> <b>markings,</b> as well as potholes in some roads and inner-city streets. In recent years, a rapid increase in car ownership has meant that traffic jams, lack of parking spaces and overcrowding are also not uncommon, especially on smaller streets. Road accidents {{are also on the}} rise because of the increase in vehicles and the subsequent lax in attention given by authorities to dangerous driving. In a rare RTA conflict health study, road traffic accidents were studied during the period of the 2011 armed conflict, in which Benghazi was a focal point of events. It was found that while the number of road traffic accidents had decreased during the period of the war, the morbidity and mortality of the injured had increased significantly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Road</b> surface <b>markings</b> {{are used}} on paved roadways to provide {{guidance}} and information to drivers and pedestrians. Uniformity of the markings {{is an important}} factor in minimizing confusion and uncertainty about their meaning, and efforts exist to standardize such markings across borders. However, countries and areas categorize and specify <b>road</b> surface <b>markings</b> in different ways — white lines are called white lines mechanical, non-mechanical, or temporary. They can be used to delineate traffic lanes, inform motorists and pedestrians or serve as noise generators when run across a road, or attempt to wake a sleeping driver when installed in the shoulders of a road. Road surface marking can also indicate regulation for parking and stopping.|$|R

25|$|The European Union {{used the}} Units of Measure Directive {{to attempt to}} achieve a common system of weights and {{measures}} and to facilitate the European Single Market. Throughout the 1990s, the European Commission helped accelerate the process for member countries to complete their metric conversion processes. Among them is the United Kingdom where laws in some or all contexts mandate or permit many imperial measures, such as miles and yards for road-sign distances, road speed limits in miles per hour, pints of beer, and inches for clothes. The United Kingdom secured permanent exemptions for the mile and yard in <b>road</b> <b>markings,</b> and (with Ireland) for the pint (Imperial) of draught beer sold in pubs (see Metrication in the United Kingdom). In 2007, the European Commission also announced that (to appease British public opinion and to facilitate trade with the United States) it was to abandon the requirement for metric-only labelling on packaged goods, and to allow dual metric–imperial marking to continue indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|As {{the overall}} or {{external}} {{size of a}} roundabout (in the UK {{referred to as the}} Inscribed Circle Diameter – ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for <b>road</b> <b>markings</b> or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – an annulus around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.|$|E

However, visibility of these roads reduce or disappear caused by the disrepair {{in a short time}} after the construction. These <b>road</b> surface <b>markings</b> have a mission to be a visual guide on behavior of lane utilization of drivers. For this reason, it has crucial importance to prevent traffic accidents. Unfortunately, the necessary importance to <b>road</b> surface <b>markings</b> are not given by the authorities in urban and rural roads of Turkey. Generally, standard road marking paint are used in all roads because of its low price and it loses retroreflectivity performance after short time. As a result of this situation chaos, lane indiscipline and many traffic accidents occur in urban and rural roads. Whereas, many different road painting materials are used such as Epoxy, Methyl Methacrylate, Polyester, Thermoplastic, Polyurea etc. to obtain higher performance and resistance according to different road characteristics and environmental conditions. In the scope of this study, a general information were given about the utilization of different surface marking materials which is used in developed countries effectively. Additionally, a number of recommendations and guidance notes have been provided for road makers and decision authorities wishing to use these materials in Turkey. ...|$|R

In order to connect these parts, the second module exploits the network characteristics of roads for global grouping. The third module completes the network based on an analysis of path lengths within the network. An evaluation of the results shows that the system benefits from the integration of different types of knowledge within the road extraction scheme. In addition to the scheme for rural areas, we present first results of an approach for road extraction in urban areas that focuses on the substructure of <b>roads</b> (<b>markings,</b> lanes) and related objects (vehicles) ...|$|R
