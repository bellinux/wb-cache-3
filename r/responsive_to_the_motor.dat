40|$|A full {{spectrum}} color monitor, connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera and lens system {{of a television}} camera supported by a gantry frame over a terrain model simulating an aircraft landing zone, projects the monitor image onto a lens or screen visually accessible to a trainee in the simulator. A digital computer produces a pattern corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lights associated with the landing strip onto a monochromatic display, and an optical system projects the calligraphic image onto the same lens {{so that it is}} superposed on the video representation of the landing field. The optical system includes a four-color wheel which is rotated between the calligraphic display and the lens, and an apparatus for synchronizing the generation of a calligraphic pattern with the color segments on the color wheel. A servo feedback system <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> servo <b>motors</b> on <b>the</b> gantry frame produces an input <b>to</b> <b>the</b> computer so that the calligraphically generated signal corresponds in shape, size and location <b>to</b> <b>the</b> video signal...|$|R
40|$|Helicity {{switching}} {{in biological}} and artificial systems {{is a fundamental}} process that allows for the dynamic control of structures and their functions. In contrast to chemical approaches <b>to</b> <b>responsive</b> behaviour in helicates, the use of light as an external stimulus offers unique opportunities <b>to</b> invert <b>the</b> chirality of helical structures in a non-invasive manner with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, we report that unidirectional rotary motors with connecting oligobipyridyl ligands, which can dynamically change their chirality upon irradiation, assemble into metal helicates that are <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> light. <b>The</b> <b>motor</b> function controls <b>the</b> self-assembly process {{as well as the}} helical chirality, allowing switching between oligomers and double-stranded helicates with distinct handedness. The unidirectionality of the light-induced motion governs the sequence of programmable steps, enabling the highly regulated self-assembly of fully responsive helical structures. This discovery paves the way for the future development of new chirality-dependent photoresponsive systems including smart materials, enantioselective catalysts and light-driven molecular machines...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{elected representatives}} should be <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{wishes of the}} {{majority}} of citizens has been an issue often discussed from a normative perspective. This article shifts the focus by looking at the determinants of support for responsiveness among citizens. Its core argument is that attitudes towards responsiveness vary systematically depending on the policy gains an individual can expect from a government that is <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> preferences {{of the majority of}} citizens. The analysis of data from the European Social Survey and twenty-one countries confirms these expectations. Individuals whose ideological stances are well reflected by the incumbent government are less favourable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea that governments should be <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> preferences of the majority, while one’s proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ideological location of the median citizen increases the odds of support for responsiveness. Self-interested attitudes are found across a variety of European democracies...|$|R
