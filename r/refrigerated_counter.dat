40|$|Imagine {{there is}} a {{platform}} {{that makes it possible}} to discuss organics between all parties in the organic food chain based on their individual criteria. The MultiTrust project has endeavoured to find a tool to solve this challenge: How to make overall assessments of the effects of organic production {{in such a way that}} they actually can make a difference in practice. Organic products have to compete against conventional products, and often the organic have difficulties comparing when measured on single criteria. The hall mark of organics is the holistic approach, considering many issues at the same time, and therefore {{there is a}} need for overall assessments. Overall assessments can be very complex and therefore difficult to communicate. And it can be difficult to determine how they can be made simpler, because simplification implies a range of chices on what is important and how to weigh the different criteria. Hence, if the overall assessments are simple, they typically are so by way of hiding information (perspectives, choices and values) in form of indexes or the like. Organic products are not only prducts that have been produces in accordance with the organic rules. Many producers want to make an extra effort above the standard secured by the organic label. The organic products harbour qualities that have been determined through a range of choices and actions made in the organic production and in the following processing, transport and trade. Emphasis can be put on the type of organic manure, the design of the orchard to promote natural enimies, how to ensure high animal welfare and well-being, how to save energy in the production, what kind of packaging to use for retailing the products, etc. When the consumer stands at the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>counter</b> in the shop, and when the farmer spreads straw in the calf box, they know very little about each other and how the other actors in the food chain act, and they have limited options for making contact. But if the initiatives that are made to improve organics are to succeed, then the other actors in the chain have to be able to honour the extra effort. There is a need to commun icate and coordinate across the organic value chain. The MultiTrust project has illuminated these challenges through a range of analyses, workshops and hearings with representatives of the organic actors and stakeholders. This work has led to the development of a prototype tool that is able to establish contacts across the chain and give the consumers an overview of what has been done in the organic value chain to give the products their particular qualities. The tool is an interactive, internet-based platform where farmers, companies, retailers and consumers can work together to improve organics based on multiple criteria. The MultiTrust project has produced an animated video to illustrate the problematic and show how the tool can be built and how different actors can be involved.

50|$|However, in the 1950s {{the hall}} was still almost {{unchanged}} and it had fallen behind the times, lacking modern refrigeration and storage space. In 1957 the first <b>refrigerated</b> <b>counters</b> finally arrived to the hall and the first florist and stationery opened shop there.|$|R
50|$|Begley and {{two other}} IRA volunteers from the Ardoyne area hijacked a blue Ford Escort and drove it to the fish shop. When they arrived, Begley and Sean Kelly, wearing the white coats and caps of {{delivery}} men, entered the shop carrying the bomb. Begley was killed when the bomb exploded prematurely, also killing an off-duty UDA member, Michael Morrison, and eight civilians, including two children. Forensic evidence pointed to Begley holding the five pound bomb, which had an 11-second fuse, above the <b>refrigerated</b> serving <b>counter</b> at the fish shop when it exploded. Kelly was convicted of murder {{for his part in}} the Shankill Road bombing.|$|R
40|$|Freezing of herring (Clupea harengus) {{for human}} {{consumption}} is increasing in the Nordic herring industry, either onboard the fishing vessels or right after landing. The quality of frozen herring as a raw material does not only depend on the frozen storage conditions applied, but also on compositional features, something which in turn can vary with season and catching ground. To unravel the link between biological variations, basic muscle composition, and sensory properties of frozen herring, a unique herring raw material was caught by commercial fishing vessels at three locations: around Iceland, outside the Norwegian coast, and in Kattegat/Skagerrak. The samplings were done according to a specific scheme and conducted over several seasons and 2 years. The herring was converted into butterfly fillets, packed in cardboard boxes, frozen, and then stored at 20 degrees C or 80 degrees C for up to 18 mo. The sensory quality was characterized by objective sensory profiling. It was shown that two generalized sensory variables could be defined from a principal component analysis of the sensory data. Except for the expected pronounced effect from storage time, the most distinct variation followed the lipid content, which in turn varied with season. An unexpected conclusion was that catching location only had a minor affect on the changes in sensory quality of herring during frozen storage. Knowledge about how season and catching location affect herring during frozen storage will be useful for optimizing the utilization of herring for frozen storage {{for human consumption}}. Practical Application: The {{results of this study}} constitute important information for the herring processing industry when handling raw materials with different geographical and seasonal history. The reported information on a highly equal sensory quality of geographically diverse raw materials will give consumers and retailers valuable knowledge on the changes in eating quality to expect after long-term frozen storage under conditions similar to household freezers or <b>refrigerated</b> <b>counters</b> in supermarkets...|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} {{would be}} carried out by Thomas Begley and Seán Kelly, two relatively young IRA members from Ardoyne. They drove from Ardoyne to the Shankill in a hijacked blue Ford Escort, which they parked on Berlin Street, around the corner from Frizzell's. Dressed as deliverymen, they entered the shop with the five-pound bomb in a holdall. It was shortly after 1PM on a Saturday afternoon and the area was crowded with mostly women and children. Whilst Kelly waited at the door, Begley made his way through the customers towards the counter, where the bomb detonated prematurely. Forensic evidence showed that Begley had been holding the bomb over the <b>refrigerated</b> serving <b>counter</b> when it exploded. Begley was blown to pieces along with nine other people—including the owner John Frizzell, his daughter Sharon McBride, 13-year-old Leanne Murray and UDA member Michael Morris. His common-law wife Evelyn Baird and seven-year-old daughter Michelle were also killed as was another couple, George and Gillian Williamson, and Wilma McKee. The force of the blast caused the old building to collapse into a pile of rubble. The upper floor came down upon those inside the shop, crushing many of the survivors under the rubble, where they remained until rescued some hours later by volunteers and emergency services. About 57 people were injured. At the scene during the rescue operation were several senior loyalists, including Adair and Billy McQuiston. The latter had been in a pub on the nearest corner when the bomb went off. Among those rescued from the rubble was the badly-wounded Seán Kelly.|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a vida útil do repolho minimamente processado sob diferentes condições de atmosfera modificada. O mesmo foi dividido em três etapas seqüenciais, sendo adotado em cada uma delas a mesma metodologia para o processamento mínimo do repolho, que consistiu em seleção, lavagem, retirada do talo central, corte em tiras, enxágüe 1, sanitização, enxágüe 2 e centrifugação. Na primeira etapa avaliou-se o comportamento respiratório e produção de etileno do repolho inteiro e minimamente processado, em sistema fechado, nas temperaturas de 5 ºC e 10 ºC por 6 horas. Na segunda, a influência da atmosfera controlada sobre o repolho minimamente processado. O produto foi submetido a um fluxo contínuo de nove misturas gasosas ternárias, previamente umidificadas, com diferentes concentrações de O 2 e CO 2, complementadas com N 2, sendo utilizado como controle o ar atmosférico. O experimento foi realizado na temperatura de 5 ºC por 10 dias. Nesta fase foram {{realizadas}} análises de cor (L*, a*, b*), incremento no escurecimento, ácido ascórbico, pH, acidez titulável e sólidos solúveis. Na terceira etapa determinou-se a vida útil do repolho minimamente processado acondicionado em embalagens de polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD), 32 µm de espessura, com atmosfera modificada ativa (2 % O 2; 6, 5 % CO 2) e passiva, e em bandejas de poliestireno expandido revestidas com filme de policloreto de vinila (PVC), 20 µm de espessura. O produto foi armazenado por 16 dias em câmara frigorífica na temperatura de 5 ºC e em um balcão refrigerado conveniência, com o intuito de representar os locais de comercialização a varejo. Analisou-se a concentração gasosa (O 2 e CO 2) no interior das embalagens, cor (L*, a*, b*), incremento no escurecimento, atividade da polifenoloxidase e peroxidase, ácido ascórbico, pH, acidez titulável, sólidos solúveis, perda de massa fresca, coliformes totais e fecais, contagem total de microrganismos aeróbios mesófilos, bolores e leveduras, Salmonella sp, Listeria monocytogenes e análise sensorial (Análise Descritiva Quantitativa -ADQ Modificado) no repolho minimamente processado. Observou-se que o repolho inteiro e minimamente processado, armazenado na temperatura de 5 ºC, apresentou atividade respiratória significativamente menor que o armazenado a 10 ºC, e nas duas temperaturas o repolho minimamente processado apresentou atividade respiratória significativamente maior que o repolho inteiro. Não foi detectada produção de etileno. Em atmosfera controlada, para a maioria das variáveis analisadas, as misturas utilizadas não apresentaram variação significativa em relação ao tratamento controle. No entanto, as misturas M 1 (2 % O 2; 3 % CO 2) e M 5 (2 % O 2; 6, 5 % CO 2) não apresentaram diferença significativa entre si, porém apresentaram-se como as mais adequadas para o armazenamento do repolho minimamente processado, por não ter ocorrido redução significativa nos valores de L*, menor incremento no escurecimento, menor redução de vitamina C, sólidos solúveis e estabilidade nos valores de pH e acidez titulável. A atmosfera modificada ativa não foi efetiva no aumento da vida útil do repolho minimamente processado, quando comparada aos demais tratamentos. A embalagem de PEBD é mais adequada ao acondicionamento do repolho minimamente processado, no entanto, a embalagem de PVC também apresenta resultados satisfatórios no acondicionamento do repolho minimamente processado. Houve uma grande variação na temperatura do balcão refrigerado conveniência em comercialização simulada, não influenciando significativamente na vida útil do produto, quando comparado ao submetido na temperatura de 5 ºC. Considerando-se a análise sensorial, a vida útil do repolho minimamente processado foi de 11 dias para todos os tratamentos, com exceção do submetido a comercialização simulada na embalagem de PEBDativa e PEBDpassiva, que apresentaram vida útil de 16 dias. No entanto, todos os tratamentos apresentaram contagem alta de coliformes totais, aeróbios mesófilos e bolores e leveduras, limitando a vida útil do produto em 7 dias. De acordo com as análises microbiológicas o repolho minimamente processado apresentou ausência de Salmonella sp e L. monocytogenes e coliformes fecais abaixo de 10 UFC g- 1. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluates the shelf life of the minimally processed cabbage under different conditions of modified atmosphere. The same was divided in three stages sequences, being adopted in {{each one of them}} the same methodology for the minimally processed of the cabbage, that consisted of selection, wash, retreat of the central shaft, cut in ribbons, rinse 1, sanitation, rinse 2 and centrifugation. In the first stage it was evaluated the breathing behavior and ethylene production of the whole cabbage and minimally processed, in closed system, in the temperatures of the 5 ºC and 10 ºC for 6 hours. In the second stage, the influence of the controlled atmosphere on the minimally processed cabbage. The product was submitted to a continuous flow of nine ternary gaseous mixtures, previously humidified, with different concentrations of O 2 and CO 2, complemented with N 2, being used as control the atmospheric air. The experiment was accomplished in the temperature of 5 ºC by 10 days. In this phase color analyses were accomplished (L*, a*, b*), increase in the darkening, ascorbic acid, pH, titratable acidity and soluble solids. In the third stage was determined the shelf life of the minimally processed cabbage conditioned in packed in low density polyethylene (PEBD), 32 µm of thickness, with modified atmosphere active (2 % O 2; 6, 5 % CO 2) and passive, and in trays of expanded polystyrene covered with film of 20 µm of thickness polyvinyl choride (PVC). The product was stored by 16 days in refrigerating chamber in the temperature of 5 ºC and in a <b>counter</b> <b>refrigerated</b> convenience, with the intention of representing the commercialization places to retail. The gaseous concentration was analyzed (O 2 and CO 2) inside the packed, color (L*, a*, b*), increase in the darkening, activity of the polyfhenoloxidase and peroxidase, ascorbic acid, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, loss of fresh mass, total and fecal coliforms, total count of microorganisms mesophily aerobics, mould and yeasts, Salmonellae sp, Listeria monocytogenes and sensory analysis (Quantitative Descriptive Analysis Modified - ADQ) in the minimally processed cabbage. It was observed that the whole cabbage and minimally processed, stored in the temperature of 5 ºC, they presented breathing activity significantly smaller than stored them to 10 ºC, and in the two temperatures the minimally processed cabbage presented breathing activity significantly larger than the whole cabbage. No ethylene production was detected. In controlled atmosphere, for most of the analyzed variables, the used mixtures did not present significant variation of the treatment it controls. However, the mixtures M 1 (2 % O 2; 3 % CO 2) and M 5 (2 % O 2; 6, 5 % CO 2) they did not present significant difference to each other, however they came as the most appropriate for the storage of the minimally processed cabbage, for not having happened significant reduction in the values of L*, smaller increment in the darkening, smaller vitamin reduction C, soluble solids and stability in the pH values and titratable acidity. Modified atmosphere active was not effective in the increase of the useful life of the minimally processed cabbage, when compared to the other treatments. The packing of PEBD is more appropriate to the conditioned of the minimally processed cabbage, however, the packing of PVC also presents satisfactory results in the conditioned of the minimally processed cabbage. There was a great variation in the temperature of the <b>counter</b> <b>refrigerated</b> convenience in simulate commercialization, not influencing significantly in the useful life of the product, when compared to the submitted in the temperature of 5 ºC. Being considered the sensorial analysis, useful life of the minimally processed cabbage went of 11 days to all the treatments, except for submitted him the simulate commercialization in the packing of PEBD active and PEBD passive, that presented useful life of 16 days. However, all the treatments presented high count of total coliforms, mesophily aerobics and mould and yeasts, limiting the useful life of the product in 7 days. In agreement with the analyses microbiological the minimally processed cabbage presented absence of Salmonellae sp and L. monocytogenes and fecal coliforms below 10 UFC g- 1...|$|R
