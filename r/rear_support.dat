5|$|To {{support the}} Marine attack towards Mupyong-ni, Hagaru-ri became an {{important}} supply dump with an airfield under construction. Smith and 1st Marine Division headquarters were also located at Hagaru-ri. With {{the bulk of the}} 1st Marine Division gathered at Yudam-ni, Hagaru-ri was lightly defended by two battalions from the 1st and 7th Marines, the rest of the garrison being composed of engineers and <b>rear</b> <b>support</b> units from both the Army and the Marine Corps.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Chinese {{plan called}} for the 58th Division to attack Hagaru-ri {{on the night of}} 27 November, but the division became lost in the countryside due to the outdated Japanese maps it used. It was not until the dawn of 28 November that the 58th Division arrived at Hagaru-ri. Meanwhile, from the fighting and ambushes that had occurred the previous night, the garrison at Hagaru-ri noticed the Chinese forces around them. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas L. Ridge, commander of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), predicted the Chinese attack would come on the night of 28 November. Almost everyone, including <b>rear</b> <b>support</b> units with little combat training, was pressed into the front line due to the manpower shortage, and the entire perimeter was on full alert by 21:30.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to show the results of {{enlarging}} the liquid argon vessel and moving the heavy supports by a varying magnitude {{less than or equal}} to 6 inches. In order to accomplish this, the center of gravity of the entire calorimeter had to be calculated, which includes: the center of gravity of the liquid argon vessel, the modules and the argon. Enlarging the cryostat for the endcap calorimeter and moving the <b>rear</b> <b>supports</b> along with it results in different load distributions on each support. By taking moments and finding these loads one can plot the loads on each support versus the enlargement of the cryostat and movement of the <b>rear</b> <b>supports.</b> This plot is shown in figures 2 and 3 for an empty and filled endcap respectively. The graph of weight vs. length of the vessel enlargement shows a significant decrease in the load that the heavy support experiences as the vessel gets larger, therefore the stress in the member decreases...|$|R

50|$|The rifle has an {{accuracy}} of 1.5 MOA. The barrel is free-floating. The two-part machined steel receiver features an integral accessory rail for mounting optical sights.

This weapon can accurately engage targets at a range of 1500 m.|$|E
50|$|In 1899 Switzerland {{procured}} 69 heavy machine guns, designated MG 00, {{mainly from}} Vickers, Sons & Maxim in London. These guns had tripod mounts designed for cavalry use with a gunner's seat {{attached to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>support</b> strut. The machine gun MG 00 was chambered for the 7.5x53.5 mm GP 90 cartridge and was later adapted for firing the more powerful 7.5x55 mm GP 11 cartridge.|$|E
50|$|Karl Maybach's {{engine was}} a {{long-stroke}} design, with dimensions of 86×100 mm. The crankshaft had eight main bearings, one being a smaller outrigger at the <b>rear,</b> <b>supporting</b> the camshaft drive gears. In a novel feature for reduced noise, these {{were made of}} Novotext, a resin-impregnated fibre composite. A further novel feature {{was the use of}} enlarged four-bolt main bearing caps on three of the bearings.|$|R
30|$|There was no {{passage from}} the front to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>support.</b> Because the <b>rear</b> link bar was fixed {{in the middle of}} the support base, {{operators}} could not go through two supports from the front to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>support.</b> The only way was to go to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>support</b> via face ends, which resulted in difficulties in terms of safety and maintenance.|$|R

50|$|There {{were several}} types of joust, {{including}} some regional preferences or rules. For example, in fourteenth-century Germany, distinction was made between the Hohenzeuggestech, where {{the aim was to}} break the lance, and the Scharfrennen, where knights sought to unhorse their opponents. These types called for different lances (light in the former, heavy in the latter), and saddles (where the Scharfrennen called for saddles without front or <b>rear</b> <b>supports,</b> which would impede the fall).|$|R

50|$|Another {{way is to}} {{assemble}} the different pieces into a block, forge weld it together, and then draw out the steel into a sword so that the correct steel {{ends up in the}} desired place. This method is often used for the complex models, which allow for parrying without fear of damaging the side of the blade. To make honsanmai or shihozume types, pieces of hard steel are added to the outside of the blade in a similar fashion. The shihozume and soshu types are quite rare, but added a <b>rear</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Addressing {{acute and}} long-standing {{issues such as}} the {{ineffectiveness}} of Russia’s defense industrial and procurement policies was also one of Serdyukov's chief aims. The questions addressed included: [...] "why, with so much spending on defense, do the Armed Forces possess so little new equipment? Why does the design and testing of many new types of armament take decades to show results?" [...] Serdyukov initiated modifications to the Russian military uniform and addressed the issue of the physical condition of Russia’s generals and senior officers: the entire service personnel of the General Staff, irrespective of rank, must now meet set physical standards upon threat of dismissal. He also called for mergers of Military academies, sharp cuts in the number of military bases, and reductions in <b>rear</b> <b>support</b> and noncombat units.|$|E
5000|$|Group Challenge: The Wine Rack: After {{agreeing on}} the kitchen design (including {{questionable}} decisions such as using floor tiles for the counter) and while the nominators are painting their rooms (Joe's in red and Tex's in yellow, while Casey had his room wallpapered), the contestants must build {{a piece of furniture}} for the kitchen. Joe, as foreman, chooses a wine rack, but miscommunication between him and his two teams (Dez and Charmaine on the frame, while Casey and Tex deal with the square shelves). Joe's frustrations kick in, and when Dez talks behind his back (on how Joe is hands-off), Joe ejects him from the area. The project itself is a failure due to the cubbyholes being too large (and lacking any <b>rear</b> <b>support),</b> a failure that Joe readily takes one on the chin.|$|E

50|$|Leading {{up to the}} hasty attack, the {{reconnaissance}} {{element in}} contact with the enemy will generally continue to reconnoiter the enemy's position and perform their tasks. Often one section will remain {{in contact with the}} enemy while another will continue its reconnaissance up to a limit of advance established by the commander. Both reconnaissance elements are looking for the presence of other enemy units, to the flanks or <b>rear,</b> <b>supporting</b> the objective enemy unit. Immediately prior to the attack the commander may choose to direct the battle from the position of the reconnaissance element in overwatch.|$|R
