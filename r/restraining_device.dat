5|$|The Utica Psychiatric Center {{is housed}} in a Greek Revival {{structure}} that was an insane asylum, and {{the birthplace of the}} Utica crib—a <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> frequently used at the asylum from the mid-19thcentury to 1887. The Stanley Center for the Arts, a mid-sized concert and performance venue, was designed by Thomas W. Lamb in 1928 and today features theatrical and musical performances by local and touring groups. The Hotel Utica, designed by Esenwein & Johnson in 1912, became a nursing and residential-care facility during the 1970s. Notable guests had included Franklin D. Roosevelt, Judy Garland and Bobby Darin. It was restored as a hotel in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Women {{have used}} a variety of {{garments}} and devices to cover, restrain, reveal, or modify the appearance of breasts. Bra or bikini-like garments are depicted on some female athletes in the 14th century BC during the Minoan civilization era. From the 14th century onward, the undergarments of wealthier women in the Western world were dominated by the corset, which pushed the breasts upwards. In {{the latter part of the}} 19th century, women experimented with various alternatives such as splitting the corset into a girdle-like <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> for the lower torso and transferring the upper part to devices suspended from the shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|Escape: [...] The magician (or less often, an assistant) {{is placed}} in a <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> (i.e., {{handcuffs}} or a straitjacket) or a death trap, and escapes to safety. Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water, and being tied up {{and placed in a}} car being sent through a car crusher.|$|E

5000|$|Charlie Kopetski, Barb's blind, {{mechanical}} genius brother. He invents {{most of her}} {{weapons and}} metahuman <b>restraining</b> <b>devices.</b> He also despairs that he must fix {{the things that she}} continuously breaks during her escapades.|$|R
40|$|Automobiles do {{not protect}} {{passengers}} from the forces generated in traffic accidents. Although some compensatory protection {{can be provided}} by <b>restraining</b> <b>devices,</b> seat belts are not enough and must be supplemented by upper torso restraints. Cars should be designed {{with a view to}} better protection of passengers against injury from striking against hard surfaces or protuberances...|$|R
2500|$|As a Fox Sports {{analyst and}} broadcaster, Waltrip's opinions, views and {{comments}} carry considerable weight with drivers, team owners, fans and NASCAR heads. Waltrip {{has never been}} shy about expressing his views, even if controversial. His critical comments about safety have {{played a significant role}} in many safety innovations current drivers enjoy today including the [...] "HANS" [...] (head and neck <b>restraining</b> <b>device,</b> credited for saving the lives of many drivers in all forms of motorsports), [...] "soft walls" [...] or [...] "SAFER" [...] (steel and foam energy reduction) barriers, [...] "full face" [...] helmets, and the new cars now driven by all NASCAR drivers.|$|E
2500|$|Opinions vary among magicians {{on how to}} {{categorize}} a given effect, {{but a number of}} categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then [...] "restore" [...] it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a <b>restraining</b> <b>device.</b> Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects.|$|E
50|$|Thumbcuffs are a metal <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> that lock thumbs in {{proximity}} to each other.|$|E
50|$|Sentinels are technologically advanced, {{and have}} {{exhibited}} {{a wide variety}} of abilities. They are armed (primarily with energy weapons and <b>restraining</b> <b>devices),</b> capable of flight, and can detect mutants at long range. They possess vast physical strength, and their bodies are highly resistant to damage. Some are able to alter their physical forms or re-assemble and reactivate themselves after they have been destroyed.|$|R
50|$|An Arab strap is {{a sexual}} device, usually made of leather and a metal ring, that is placed around the penis and testicles. This device is usually {{included}} {{in the group of}} cock rings and cock harnesses usually {{to play the role of}} a bondage-type sex toy. The name is probably derived from <b>restraining</b> <b>devices</b> used for mating Arabian horses, including the analogous method of binding.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} two decades, a new style of pool has gained popularity. These consist of a small vessel (usually about 2.5 × 5 m) in which the swimmer swims in place, either against the push of an artificially {{generated}} water current or against the pull of <b>restraining</b> <b>devices.</b> These pools have several names, such as swim spas, swimming machines, or swim systems. They are all examples of different modes of resistance swimming.|$|R
50|$|The tramp {{chair was}} a one-person <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> used by American police, largely during the 19th century, as a mild form {{of torture and}} public humiliation.|$|E
50|$|In {{its most}} simple form, it {{consists}} of swimming while being held relatively stationary by a flexible <b>restraining</b> <b>device,</b> such as a harness or a foot restraint. This training method is used {{by a number of}} swim teams, such as the ones at Purdue University, University of Indianapolis, Florida State University and the University of Florida. Likewise, Special Forces Scuba Team members at Fort Bragg use a commercial <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> in their personal training for open water swimming. Users often indicate that it takes {{a certain amount of time}} to learn to compensate for the feeling of swimming against a restraint. However, for those who have familiarized themselves with these systems, tethers enable the swimmer to swim at any speed, even flat-out sprints, and to vary the speed at will.|$|E

5000|$|A {{search of}} Black's van found <b>restraining</b> <b>devices</b> {{including}} assorted ropes, sticking plaster, and hoods; a Polaroid camera; numerous articles of girls' clothing; a mattress; and {{a selection of}} sexual aids. Black claimed that on his long-distance deliveries he would pull into a lay-by and dress in the children's clothing before masturbating; he gave no plausible explanation for the sexual aids. (None of the clothing had belonged {{to any of the}} victims.) ...|$|R
5000|$|By 1838 Jean Esquirol had {{declared}} in his Des Maladies Mentales that masturbation was [...] "recognized in all countries {{as a cause}} of insanity." [...] Doctor John Harvey Kellogg and Rev. Sylvester Graham were among those who proposed that circumcision and eating a bland, meatless diet would curb masturbation. [...] The medical literature of the time also described more invasive procedures including electric shock treatment, infibulation, <b>restraining</b> <b>devices</b> like chastity belts and straitjackets, cauterization or - as a last resort - wholesale surgical excision of the genitals.|$|R
25|$|In 1899, at age 22, {{he opened}} W. H. Hodgson's School of Physical Culture in Blackburn, England, {{offering}} tailored exercise regimes for personal training. Among his customers {{were members of}} the Blackburn police force. In 1902, Hodgson himself appeared on stage with handcuffs and other <b>restraining</b> <b>devices</b> supplied by the Blackburn police department and applied the restraints to Harry Houdini, who had previously escaped from the Blackburn jail. His behavior towards Houdini generated controversy; the escape artist had some difficulty removing his restraints, complaining that Hodgson had deliberately injured him and jammed the locks of his handcuffs.|$|R
50|$|From the 16th century, the {{undergarments}} of wealthier {{women in}} the Western world were dominated by the corset, which pushed the breasts upwards. In the later 19th century, clothing designers began experimenting with alternatives, splitting the corset into multiple parts: a girdle-like <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> for the lower torso, and devices that suspended the breasts from the shoulder to the upper torso.|$|E
50|$|Some matches have a {{container}} stationed {{in or near}} the ring, with the object of the match being to trap the opposing wrestler in it. Many of these matches take the name of the container, such as Ambulance match and the Casket match. A similar type of match aims to restrain opposing wrestlers somehow, and the match often takes the name of the <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> - for example, the Stretcher.|$|E
50|$|The Crusader {{apparently}} (from a Terra Obscura continuity standpoint) operated as {{a superhero}} until 1969, when, {{on a mission}} to stop an alien from converting Earth into a spaceship, he was imprisoned in an alien <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> which Tom Strong imagined to be a heavily localized time-loop. This bubble kept him in suspended animation until he was freed in 2000 by Strong and his fellow SMASH member, Tom Strange.|$|E
25|$|Inside Bonin's van, {{investigators}} discovered numerous artifacts attesting to his culpability in the Freeway Killer murders. These {{items included}} various <b>restraining</b> <b>devices</b> including lengths of nylon cord, {{an assortment of}} knives, a tire iron, and household implements such as pliers and coat hangers. Furthermore, both the interior of Bonin's van and sections of his home were extensively bloodstained, and the inner handles from the passenger-side and rear doors of his vehicle had been removed in an obvious effort to prevent a victim escaping the vehicle. Inside the glove box, investigators also discovered a scrapbook of newspaper clippings related to the murders.|$|R

50|$|Near {{the holes}} in {{the top and bottom of}} the door, some <b>restraining</b> <b>device</b> is {{provided}} for the rods to pass through, to prevent them from falling away entirely when in the unlocked position, and thus not inserted into {{the holes in}} the door. This consists of either a rubber or plastic gasket fitted into {{the holes in the}} door and protruding up or down a short distance, or else a small metal plate with a hole in it welded to the inside of the door through which the rod extends in any position.|$|E

5000|$|Public humiliation {{exists in}} many forms. Most often a {{criminal}} {{was placed in}} the center of town and having the local populace enact a form of [...] "mob justice" [...] on the individual. The punishment of public humiliation could be, amongst other things, an offender being forced to relate his crime, such as by exaggerated physical parody: a 'shame flute' for a bad musician or wearing a giant rosary (schandstenen, [...] "stones of shame") for someone late to church. The offender could alternatively be sentenced to remain exposed in a specific public place, in a <b>restraining</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Constitution and the Criminal Code include {{safeguards}} {{to ensure}} that no criminal suspect can be compelled to make a self incriminating confession or be convicted or punished in cases where the only evidence against the accused is his own confession.

In addition, civil and criminal suits alleging abuse during interrogation and detention have been brought against some police and prosecution officials. In 2003, the use of leather restraining body belts was abolished. Softer leather handcuffs without body belts were instituted as substitute <b>restraining</b> <b>devices.</b> Amnesty International has urged Japan to reform its police interrogation methods.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{national}} research program an experimental campaign was carried out on a real scale mock-up consisting of a steel-concrete composite frame equipped with dissipative bracings, based on High Damping Rubber (HDR) devices and elasto-plastic buckling <b>restrained</b> <b>devices</b> also called Buckling Restrained Braces (BRBs). With reference to HDR devices free vibration tests, followed by force-controlled and displacement-controlled cyclic tests were performed. The experimental tests aim at studying the dynamic response of the coupled system in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of HDR devices in increasing the stiffness and dissipation capacity of the frame. With regards to BRBs only displacement controlled tests are performed, since their behavior is not time dependent. In this case the aim of the tests is to investigate the dissipative properties of the devices and their fatigue behavior...|$|R
