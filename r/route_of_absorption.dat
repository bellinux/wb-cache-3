40|$|The <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> of {{ingested}} compounds is a {{determinant of}} their distribution and metabolism.

Understanding the fate of an ingested compound requires determination {{of the importance of}} each of these routes. Portal vein absorption can be estimated from the difference in concentrations of an ingested compound between the portal vein and peripheral vessel blood. To make these estimations, one must make assumptions on the basis of estimates of flow rate and dilution. We report here methodology that allows a direct measurement of portal vein absorption that is independent of these assumptions. Mesenteric lymph was diverted from rats by cannulation. Portal blood was sampled after duodenal infusion of a bolus of compound of interest along with a portal absorption marker, 3 -O-methylglucose. Since lymph was diverted, the appearance in portal blood was solely the result of portal absorption. Absorption was quantified by the areas under the curve for the compound and marker.

In conclusion, the ATI molecule was found to have more affinity towards the stratum corneum as compared towards the infundibulum and it followed a straight pathway to penetrate (until 600 ns of simulation).

Previous studies have characterised the mechanism of nerve agent toxicity in rodent models, however, it is generally accepted {{that one of the most}} appropriate animal models for human skin absorption is the domestic pig. The purpose of the present study was to measure and compare the skin absorption kinetics of VX in vitro using pig, human and guinea pig skin to highlight any potential species differences in skin permeability. When undiluted VX was applied directly to the skin, the permeability of guinea pig skin was approximately 7 -fold greater than human skin. There was no significant difference in the permeability of pig and human skin. When VX diluted with isopropyl alcohol was applied to the skin, the permeability of guinea pig skin was approximately 4 -fold greater than human skin. There was no significant difference in the permeability of pig and human skin.

The potentially deadly toxic has multiple <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption,</b> which make a fast and effective detection method extremely important. We developed a dynamic method of detection by observing the spectral changes when sodium azide binds to cobinamide, a vitamin B₁₂ analogue. The K/a of sodium azide binding to cobinamide {{was found to be}} 6. 10 x 10 ⁻⁵ 1 /M. The detection limit and quantification limit of the cobinamide-based method performed in phosphate buffer were 180 nM and 580 nM respectively. The method was sensitive and accurate enough to detect sodium azide at a concentration of 25 µM in blood samples. The absorbance values change upon addition of sodium azide in the 300 nm to 600 nm range. At 420 nm, the absorbance values increases linearly upon addition of sodium azide and decreases linearly at 491 nm upon increasing addition of sodium azide. The 420 nm: 491 nm wavelength ratio was chosen for accuracy and sensitivity. Our method has a lower detection limit and quantification limit when compared to the micro-diffusion assays described in literature. Although the cobinamide based method is less sensitive than ion chromatography or gas chromatography methods, the assay described in this paper has a potential higher throughput, is easier to process, and is sensitive enough to detect potentially toxic concentrations in biological samples.

40|$|The {{influence}} of secretory transporters on intestinal permeability {{characteristics of the}} H 2 receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine was studied in Caco- 2 monolayers and rat intestinal mucosa mounted in Ussing chambers. Both drugs exhibited vectorial transport across rat ileum with significantly greater (2 - 4 -fold) permeability in the serosal-to-mucosal than the mucosal-to-serosal direction, indicative of net mucosal secretion. Mucosal ranitidine secretion was also observed in rat distal colon, although to a lesser degree. Ileal ranitidine secretion was concentration dependent and significantly reduced by the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates verapamil and cyclosporin. In contrast, probenicid, an inhibitor of the multidrug-related protein, {{had no effect on}} ranitidine permeability. The paracellular marker mannitol showed no evidence of asymmetric permeability or sensitivity to P-gp inhibitors. Significant expression of P-gp protein in rat intestinal epithelial cells was confirmed by immunoblotting. Caco- 2 monolayers, which overexpress P-gp, also showed asymmetric permeability of ranitidine and cimetidine. In this model, ranitidine permeability in the mucosal-to-serosal direction decreased by 95 % as monolayer resistance increased from 150 to 500 /cm 2, indicating a primarily paracellular route of transport. However, serosal-to-mucosal permeability was insensitive to resistance changes, consistent with a primarily transcellular route in this direction. These data indicate that ranitidine and cimetidine can act as substrates for intestinal P-gp and suggest that the balance between absorptive and secretory mechanisms as a factor in determining intestinal absorption needs to be a routine consideration even for compounds expected to have a predominantly paracellular <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption...</b>|$|E

The dog should first be characterised as atopic, and then it is suitable to screen the dog 2 ̆ 7 s blood for individual allergen identification to guide treatment. ELISA and intra-dermal testing correlate poorly, so which test should be believed? This is controversial and raises the possibility that both tests are right, each corresponding to different sub-types of atopy. Perhaps allergens are percutaneously absorbed leading to atopic dermatitis.

Styrene (phenylethylene, vinylbenzene) is an important intermediate in chemical synthesis and monomer for plastics manufacture. It is a colorless, refractive, oily liquid of density d 20 = 4 0. 909. Its melting and boiling points are- 33 and 146 °C, respectively. It is sparingly soluble in water, but soluble in most organic solvents. Its vapor has a characteristic, penetrating odor, the perception of which diminishes as exposure is continued (1). Styrene may be absorbed into the bloodstream by all routes: on peroral administration or inhalation, by percutaneous absorption, or after subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration. The most common <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> in industrial exposure are pulmonary and percutaneous. The ACGIH recommended threshold limit value (TLV) is 100 ppm (420 mg/m 3 of air).

The cardiovascular pressor effect has been utilized by numerous investigators (6, 7, 15), but its apparent best accuracy does not exceed 10 per cent. The oliguric effect requires the test substance in considerable degree of concentration, and is therefore unsuited for its microdetection.

In this study, percutaneous BPA absorption was measured in vivo and ex vivo in the rat, and ex vivo in humans. An approximately 12 -fold difference in permeability between rat skin and human skin was found, with permeability being higher in the rat. In addition, inter- and intra-individual variability of up to tenfold was observed in humans. No accumulation of BPA in the skin was found during exposure. The skin clearance rate following exposure was estimated at 0. 4  μg/cm²/h. Ex vivo and in vivo percutaneous absorption fluxes of BPA in the rat {{were in the same}} range (about 2. 0  μg/cm²/h), suggesting that extrapolation to the in vivo situation in humans may be possible. The European tolerable daily intake (TDI) of BPA is 50  μg/kg body weight. However, many research projects have highlighted the significant effects of BPA in rodents at doses lower than 10  μg/kg/day. A 1 -h occupational exposure over 2, 000  cm² (forearms and hands) may lead to a BPA absorption of 4  μg/kg/day.

A linear microdialysis probe (5 -kDa cut-off) was implanted in the dermis of the back of the guinea pig and perfused (5 mu L/min) with physiological Ringer's solution. VX (296 or 592 mu g/kg) was applied (33 mu L/kg) over the site of the microdialysis probe and dialysate samples collected for up to 6 h. The VX dialysate concentration was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Quantitation was performed over the range 0. 1 to 100 ng/mL and the calibration was linear. VX was detected within 15 min, reaching a peak at 30 min following both VX doses. After this time the VX concentration decreased. There was a clear dose-dependent recovery of VX in the dialysate and the total amount recovered was statistically significant between the two doses.

Pharmacokinetics is the movement of drugs through the body with time and is at least partially reliant upon the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> administration, <b>absorption,</b> distribution and metabolism of the medication. A common <b>route</b> <b>of</b> administration is oral administration, however if this method is to work the drug {{must be able to}} get to the stomach and stay there. In cases of vomiting and nausea this method of administration is not an option. Suppositories can, in some situations, be administered instead. Medication can also be administered through intramuscular injection, or through intravenous injection. The amount of time required for absorption varies dependent upon many factors including drug solubility, gastrointestinal motility and pH. If a medication is administered orally the amount of food in the stomach may also affect the rate <b>of</b> <b>absorption.</b> Once absorbed medications must be distributed throughout the body, or usually with the case of psychiatric medication, past the blood–brain barrier to the brain. With all of these factors affecting the rapidity of effect, the time until the effects are evident varies. Generally, though, the timing with medications is relatively fast and can occur within several minutes. As an example, physicians usually expect to see a remission of symptoms thirty minutes after haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is administered intramuscularly. Antipsychotics, especially Haloperidol, as well as assorted benzodiazepines are the most frequently used drugs in emergency psychiatry, especially agitation.|$|R
40|$|The {{anxiolytic}} 9 -carboline abecamil {{was administered}} to female rats at doses of 10, 50, and 250 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks either intragas-tncally once a day or continuously via the feed. On days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28, plasma level profiles (0 - 24 hr) and, additionally, on day 28, concentration profiles (0 - 24 hr) in liver, kidney, and brain were determined in identical groups of animals. Fecal excretion of un-changed abecamil also was determined as a measure for entenc <b>absorption.</b> After both <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> administration, <b>absorption</b> was prac-tically complete. Drug uptake via the feed resulted in a plateau-like plasma level without explicit maxima or minima. Indications were observed for a positive food intake plasma level correlation with lower plasma levels {{during the day and}} higher concentrations at night, for a slight increase of drug plasma levels during the 4 -week period, and a dose-proportional increase of mean plasma concentra-tions. lntragastric treatment was characterized by clearly distinguish...|$|R
50|$|Sedation by pharmacologic methods may be {{obtained}} by two general routes. The enteral <b>route</b> involves <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> medication across enteric membranes which line the alimentary canal from the oral cavity, through the digestive tract, ending in the rectum. This route includes medications that are either swallowed, absorbed through the mucosa of the oral cavity, or inserted rectally. The parenteral route involves the administration of sedative drugs other than absorption across enteric membranes (outside of the alimentary canal). These methods include intravenous, inhalation, intramuscular, and submucosal administration, among others.|$|R
