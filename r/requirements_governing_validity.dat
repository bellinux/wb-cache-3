40|$|Abstract Cognitivists about Practical Rationality {{argue that}} we can {{explain some of the}} (apparent) {{requirements}} of practical rationality by appealing to the require-ments of theoretical rationality. First, they argue that intentions involve beliefs, and, second, they show how the theoretical <b>requirements</b> <b>governing</b> those involved beliefs can explain some of the practical <b>requirements</b> <b>governing</b> those intentions (or they show how these apparently practical requirements are actually theoretical requirements). This paper avoids the ongoing controversy about whether and how intentions involve beliefs and focuses instead on this second part of the Cognitivist approach, where I think Cognitivism faces significant difficulties. I proceed by considering two attempts by Cognitivists to explain (apparent) requirements of practical rationality and I argue that neither of them succeed...|$|R

40|$|Individual Papers no. 64 Approaching phonological {{data from}} the {{standpoint}} of Emergent Grammar (EG) minimizes the role of Universal Grammar. EG takes a “bottom-up” approach to analysis, positing representations and both lexical and phonological relations among representations. This paper explores tonal alternations resulting from morpheme concatenation in Margi (Hoffmann 1963). These patterns show many properties associated with both autosegmental and more general behaviors: many-to-one association, one-to-many association, melodies, polarity, iterativity. The essence of our approach is to derive the relevant properties from constraints holding of actually occurring allomorphs. That is, no abstract “underlying representations” are posited. Surface-based phonotactics and morphological selectional <b>requirements</b> <b>govern</b> the patterns of allomorphs observed on the surface. In Margi, three surface phonotactics – a strong prohibition on HL sequences, a weak prohibition on LH sequences, and a restriction limiting contours to monosyllabic words – govern tonal patterns on morphemes with level H, level L, rising and changing tone patterns. Selectional <b>requirements</b> <b>govern</b> tonal polarity in Margi as well...|$|R

50|$|Capital {{requirement}} (also {{known as}} regulatory capital or capital adequacy) {{is the amount}} of capital a bank or other financial institution has to hold as required by its financial regulator. This is usually expressed as a capital adequacy ratio of equity that must be held as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. These requirements are put into place to ensure that these institutions do not take on excess leverage and become insolvent. Capital <b>requirements</b> <b>govern</b> the ratio of equity to debt, recorded on the liabilities and equity side of a firm's balance sheet. They {{should not be confused with}} reserve <b>requirements,</b> which <b>govern</b> the assets side of a bank's balance sheet—in particular, the proportion of its assets it must hold in cash or highly-liquid assets.|$|R
