5|$|On April 20, 1978, Smythe {{suffered}} a heart attack. He spent {{a month in the}} hospital, in time to spend May 18 at Woodbine, where he had four horses racing that day. His health continued to deteriorate and Conn <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dying. He arranged for Thomas Smythe to take over the Conn Smythe Foundation, and he made gifts of money to relatives. Conn Smythe {{died at the age of}} 85 in 1980 at his home on Baby Point. He is interred with Irene at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 February, Blücher, {{commanding}} a Prussian Corps and elements of two Russian Corps, resumed his attack against Marmont. The latter continued to fall back until he was reinforced. Napoleon arrived on the battlefield with strong combined-arms forces, which allowed the French to launch a determined counterattack and drive back the leading elements of the Army of Silesia. Blücher <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> facing the Emperor in person and decided to pull back and avoid another battle against Napoleon. In practice, Blücher's attempt to disengage proved extremely difficult to execute, as the Coalition force was by now in an advanced position, had virtually no cavalry present to cover its retreat and was facing an enemy who was ready to commit its numerous cavalry.|$|E

5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E
5|$|In July 1933, Parsons became {{liaison officer}} between the Bureau of Ordnance and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, DC. At the NRL he was briefed {{by the head}} of its Radio Division, A. Hoyt Taylor, who told him about {{experiments}} that had been carried out into what the Navy would later name radar. Parsons immediately recognized the potential of the new invention to locate ships and aircraft, and perhaps even track shells in flight. For this, he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to need high frequency microwaves. He discovered that no one had attempted this. The scientists had not considered all the applications of the technology, and the Navy bureaus had not grasped their potential. He was able to persuade the scientists to establish a group to investigate microwave radar, but without official sanction it had low priority. Parsons submitted a memorandum on the subject to the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) requesting $5,000 per annum for research. To his dismay, the BuOrd and Bureau of Engineering, which was responsible for the NRL, turned his proposal down.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} {{reaction}} {{from most of}} the military commanders. Phát's rebels set up their command post in the Saigon home of General Dương Ngọc Lắm, a Diệm loyalist who had been removed from his post as Mayor of Saigon by Khánh. In contrast to Phát's serene demeanour, his incoming troops prompted worshippers at the Roman Catholic cathedral attending mass to flee in panic. The Buddhists, however, made no overt reaction to a coup that would dent their rights. Air Force commander Kỳ had promised two weeks earlier to use his planes against any coup attempt, but there was no reaction early in the morning. Đức mistakenly thought Kỳ and his subordinates would join the coup, but later <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mistaken. After he found out that he had been tricked into thinking that the plotters had great strength, he defected. Several U.S. advisers were chased away by rebel officers who did not want interference in the coup. They thought the Americans would not approve of their actions, as both U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Taylor and President Lyndon Johnson had made optimistic comments about South Vietnam recently.|$|E

Lambert said that he believed that Fitzmorris' suit had cost Lambert the governorship.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April, {{the left}} wing of the Austrian army under Beaulieu, Sebottendorf, and Pittoni {{attacked}} Cervoni's French brigade in the Battle of Voltri. Cervoni made a fighting retreat and escaped intact to Savona down the coast. Beaulieu belatedly <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> now dangerously separated from his right wing under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Argenteau.

25|$|Fortunately, he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ruining his life, {{and took}} up new interests. He began to draw. Then he took up blacksmithing, so he could repair the iron farm {{implements}} that had recently been introduced to the area. Self-taught as usual, he made his own tools, forge and bellows. He was soon doing a good business either repairing items or selling items he had created himself. His spurs and bridle bits were in great demand because he liked to decorate them with silver. Although he maintained his store, he not only stopped drinking but stopped selling alcohol.|$|E

Friends attending the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania {{encouraged him to}} join them, so he enrolled there and received an MBA in 1971. Another friend from Wharton invited him to visit Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, where he met developer Charles Fraser, who offered Rummell a job.|$|E

25|$|At that time, Maudgalyāyana dwelled {{alone in}} a forest hut. Nevertheless, {{when he saw the}} bandits approaching, he made himself vanish with psychic powers. The bandits found an empty hut, and {{although}} they searched everywhere, found nobody. They left and returned on the following day, for six consecutive days, with Maudgalyāyana escaping from them in the same way. On the seventh day, Maudgalyāyana suddenly lost the psychic powers he had long wielded. Maudgalyāyana <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> now unable to escape. The bandits entered, beat him repeatedly and left him lying in his blood. Being keen on quickly getting their payment, they left at once. Maudgalyāyana's great physical and mental strength was such {{that he was able to}} regain consciousness and was able to journey to the Buddha. In some accounts, he then returned to Kalasila and died there, teaching his family before dying. In other accounts, he died in the Buddha's presence.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit {{say that}} Raven was {{born out of}} the darkness. He was weak and lost. As he began {{traveling}} aimlessly experiencing the world, he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the Raven Father, Creator of All Life. Once he realized who he was, he gathered up his strength and flew out of the darkness to a new place which he called earth, but he was still alone, so he decided to create plants. As he flew around exploring this new world, he came upon a man whom the legend claims {{was the first of the}} Inuit people. Raven fed the man and taught the man to respect the world around him. Soon after, a woman came to be and Raven taught the both of them how to cloth themselves, build shelter, and make canoes to travel the water. As the two bred and spawned children, Raven cared for their children and educated them as he had done before.|$|E
25|$|Buell, under {{pressure}} from the government to take aggressive action, was almost relieved of duty (only the personal reluctance of George H. Thomas to assume command from his superior {{at the start of a}} campaign prevented it). As he approached Perryville, Kentucky, he began to concentrate his army in the face of Confederate forces there. Bragg was not initially present with his army, having decided to attend the inauguration ceremony of a Confederate governor of Kentucky in Frankfort. On October 8, fighting began at Perryville over possession of water sources, and as the fighting escalated, Bragg's Army of Mississippi achieved some tactical success in an assault against a single corps of Buell's Army of the Ohio. That evening Bragg <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> facing Buell's entire army and ordered a retreat to Harrodsburg, where he was joined by Kirby Smith's Army of Kentucky on October 10. Despite having a strong combined force, Bragg made no attempt to regain the initiative. Buell was equally passive. Bragg retreated through the Cumberland Gap and returned to Murfreesboro by way of Chattanooga.|$|E
