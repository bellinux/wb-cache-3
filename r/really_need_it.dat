500|$|Before Hendrix was 19 years old, law {{enforcement}} authorities had twice caught him riding in stolen cars. When given a choice between spending time in prison or joining the Army, he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord, California, {{he was assigned to}} the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He arrived there on November 8, and soon afterward he wrote to his father: [...] "There's nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks, then when you go to jump school... you get hell. They work you to death, fussing and fighting." [...] In his next letter home, Hendrix, who had left his guitar at his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan's house in Seattle, asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible, stating: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> now." [...] His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand-painted the words [...] "Betty Jean" [...] to Fort Campbell. His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties, which led to verbal taunting and physical abuse from his peers, who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return.|$|E

Such is the position of my tenants. I am a soldier, and must perforce be absent. What I need greatly is someone who will fill my place in this respect. I have an old friend who is captain of the garrison, and sees to all things in the household; I have an intendant, I believe a worthy young man, who collects my rents and looks to the feeding {{and needs of the}} servants and garrison; but I need someone who would interest herself actively in the condition of my tenants, who would be a friend to them in sickness, would give aid from my purse to those who <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> would send food to the starving, and aid my intendant by advising him as to who are worthy of relief and who are suffering from their own idleness or thriftlessness--who will, in short, act as I would have my wife act had I one.|$|E

Nobody noticed their nakedness before, perhaps; nobody can help noticing it now, the fig-leaf makes it so conspicuous.
