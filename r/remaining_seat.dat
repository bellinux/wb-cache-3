She refused to indicate which way she would lean, arguing that Mundingburra electors should cast their vote first without undue pressure.|$|E
25|$|In fact, the Liberals had {{not held}} a {{metropolitan}} {{seat in the}} western suburbs since 1996, when they lost the seat of Essendon. At the 1996 election, the Liberals also lost Ivanhoe (their <b>remaining</b> <b>seat</b> north of the Yarra—Eltham—was lost in 2002). After the 2002 election landslide, the ALP held every Melbourne seat except for a thin band of strong Liberal seats in the eastern suburbs. To win government, the Liberals needed to win back their traditional heartland seats in eastern and south-east Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Under the new constitution, the {{legislature}} was officially dissolved on 31 March 1959. An election {{was held on}} 30 May of the same year, where all 51 seats in the Assembly will be popularly elected. In this election, 43 out of 51 PAP candidates were elected; Lim-led SPA had only four out of 34 candidates elected; the United Malays National Organisation won three seats, while the <b>remaining</b> <b>seat</b> was won by an independent candidate. The Liberal Socialist Party (led by E. H. Holloway), the Workers' Party (led by David Marshall) and the LF (led by Francis Thomas) did not win any seat.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{constitution}} provides {{each state}} with two Senators. Montana's two U.S. senators are Jon Tester (Democrat), last reelected in 2012, and Steve Daines (Republican), first elected in 2014. The U.S. constitution provides each {{state with a}} single Representative, with additional representatives apportioned based on population. From statehood in 1889 until 1913, Montana was represented in the United States House of Representatives by a single representative, elected at-large. Montana received a second representative in 1913, following the 1910 census and reapportionment. Both members, however, were still elected at-large. Beginning in 1919, Montana moved to district, rather than at-large, elections for its two House members. This created Montana's 1st congressional district {{in the west and}} Montana's 2nd congressional district in the east. In the reapportionment following the 1990 census, Montana lost one of its House seats. The <b>remaining</b> <b>seat</b> was again elected at-large. Greg Gianforte is the current officeholder.|$|E
25|$|In February 1955, a new constitution, the Rendel Constitution was implemented. Singapore {{would create}} its first Legislative Assembly with {{majority}} of the seats popularly elected, to replace the existing Council. 25 out of 32 seats would be elected by the general populace, four seats would be allocated to Governor-appointed unofficial members, three seats taken by ex officio members, respectively the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary, while the <b>remaining</b> <b>seat</b> {{would be for the}} unofficial Speaker of the Assembly nominated by the Governor. Moreover, the post of the Chief Minister was added, which would be assumed by the leader of the majority party in the Assembly, sharing the responsibility with the Governor. The Governor continued to take control over areas such as external affairs, internal security, defence, broadcasting and public relations, whereas the power of policy-making for the people's welfare lied {{in the hands of the}} Chief Minister.|$|E
25|$|Lim {{left the}} PP in July 1949 {{and joined the}} Labour Party of Singapore (LP), whom Lim shared a similar {{political}} stand with. Later in June 1950, he was elected LP's Chairman, and was chosen to serve as Chairman of the SCAWU in July of the same year. Under support of the union, he contested in the Keppel constituency during the Legislative Council election held in April 1951, and was successfully elected as a Councillor. In this election, the number of elected seats increased from six to nine; The PP won six, LP won two, while the <b>remaining</b> <b>seat</b> was won by an independent candidate. In May 1951, Lim founded the Singapore Trades Union Congress (STUC) and appointed himself as Chairman. In the same year, he {{was funded by the}} United States Information Agency to study the labour movement in the US. However, LP's internal struggle among the different factions got worse and worse. The faction led by party's Secretary-General Peter Williams successfully coerced Lim to step down as Chairman. He eventually left the party.|$|E

25|$|A wave {{of strikes}} hit Poland in April and May 1988, {{and a second}} wave began on 15 August that year when a strike broke out at the July Manifesto coal mine in Jastrzębie-Zdrój, the workers {{demanding}} the re-legalisation of Solidarity. Over the next few days, sixteen other mines went on strike followed {{by a number of}} shipyards, including on 22 August, the Gdansk Shipyard, famous as the epicentre of the 1980 industrial unrest that spawned Solidarity. On 31 August 1988 Lech Wałęsa, the leader of Solidarity, was invited to Warsaw by the Communist authorities, who had finally agreed to talks. On 18 January 1989 at a stormy session of the Tenth Plenary Session of the ruling United Workers' Party, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, the First Secretary, managed to get party backing for formal negotiations with Solidarity leading to its future legalisation – although this was achieved only by threatening the resignation of the entire party leadership if thwarted. On 6 February 1989 formal Round Table discussions began in the Hall of Columns in Warsaw. On 4 April 1989 the historic Round Table Agreement was signed legalising Solidarity and setting up partly free parliamentary elections to be held on 4 June 1989 (incidentally, the day following the midnight crackdown on Chinese protesters in Tiananmen Square). A political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (with the one <b>remaining</b> <b>seat</b> taken by an independent candidate). At the same time, many prominent Communist candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them.|$|E
500|$|Although UMNO {{supported}} ketuanan Melayu, {{it formed}} an [...] "Alliance" [...] with the MCA and the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) {{to contest the}} 1955 Federal Legislative Council elections. This took many by surprise, as the MCA had strenuously insisted on equal political rights for all citizens. Its President, Tan Cheng Lock, was himself a Straits Chinese, albeit not as extremist as the secessionists. Although initially dismissed as a marriage of convenience, the Alliance won 51 out of 52 seats available. The sole <b>remaining</b> <b>seat</b> went to the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party (PMIP; later known as PAS), a Malay-based party and strong advocate of ketuanan Melayu. The total defeat of non-communal parties led the Alliance to perceive the political atmosphere as inhospitable for multi-racial parties. A coalition government comprising mono-racial parties in which party leaders privately brokered compromise decisions was thought more stable and better suited to Malayan politics.|$|E
500|$|I Corps assumed {{responsibility}} for the front in Cyrenaica on 15 February 1941, but within days Blamey was informed that his troops would be sent on the expedition to Greece. Blamey has been criticised for allowing this when {{he knew it was}} extremely hazardous, after he was told that Menzies had approved. He insisted, however, on sending the veteran 6th Division first instead of the 7th Division, resulting in a heated argument with Wavell, which Blamey won. He was under no illusions about the odds of success, and immediately prepared plans for an evacuation. His foresight and determination saved many of his men, but he lost credibility when he chose his son Tom to fill the one <b>remaining</b> <b>seat</b> on the aircraft carrying him out of Greece. The campaign exposed deficiencies in the Australian Army's training, leadership and staff work that had passed unnoticed or had not been addressed in the Libyan Campaign. The pressure of the campaign opened a rift between Blamey and Rowell, which was to have important consequences. While Rowell and Brigadier William Bridgeford were extremely critical of Blamey's performance in Greece, this opinion was not widely held. Wavell reported that [...] "Blamey has shown himself a fine fighting commander in these operations and fitted for high command." ...|$|E

[...] A wave of Revolutions of 1989, sometimes called the [...] "Autumn of Nations", swept across the Eastern Bloc. [...] In the People's Republic of Poland in April 1989, the Solidarity organization was legalized, allowed to participate in parliamentary elections and captured a stunning 99 out of the 100 available parliamentary seats (with the one <b>remaining</b> <b>seat</b> taken by an independent candidate).
