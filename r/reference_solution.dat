30|$|In conclusion, in this work, finally, all {{opinions}} {{expressed by}} Trukenmüller (2017) are refuted. It is proven that the erroneous <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> of the AUSTAL not only violate the relevant integral sentences. Mass conservation is also differentially violated because of Janicke’s convention. For two case studies, which {{are described in}} Janicke (2001), the inconsistency of the <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> of the AUSTAL is demonstrated using the example of calculated deposition and sedimentation flows. It also shows that soil concentrations have to be calculated speculatively because of the appearance of an indeterminate expression. The associated thought model describes strange rather a segregation than the spread of air pollutants. In addition, the correct <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> are derived and the concentration distributions thus calculated are compared with the faulty graphics of the AUSTAL. It is further shown that the method described in Venkatram and Pleim (1999), the relationship between deposition and sedimentation velocities is erroneous. This result is of considerable interest, since not only {{the authors of the}} AUSTAL use these incorrect connections. Also in Simpson et al. (2012) refers to these inadmissible contexts when developing a high-priority Western European transport model. In this work a correction is made. The use of the Janicke Convention justifies the triviality of all <b>reference</b> <b>solutions.</b> This proof is also kept. Finally, critical terms {{of the authors of the}} AUSTAL are analyzed. They show little physical understanding of deposition and sedimentation and explain all the differences with the theory of the spread of air pollutants.|$|R

5000|$|When making {{transmission}} measurements, the spectrophotometer quantitatively {{compares the}} fraction of light that passes through a <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> and a test solution, then electronically compares the intensities of the two signals and computes the percentage of transmission of the sample compared to the reference standard. For reflectance measurements, the spectrophotometer quantitatively compares {{the fraction of}} light that reflects from the reference and test samples.

These bandwidths are transmitted through the test sample. Then the photon flux density (watts per metre squared usually) of the transmitted or reflected light is measured with a photodiode, charge coupled device or other light sensor. The transmittance or reflectance value for each wavelength of the test sample is then compared with the transmission or reflectance values from the reference sample. Most instruments will apply a logarithmic function to the linear transmittance ratio to calculate the 'absorbency' of the sample, a value which {{is proportional to the}} 'concentration' of the chemical being measured.|$|E

The most long-lived radioactive wastes, including {{spent nuclear fuel}}, are usually managed to be contained and isolated from the environment {{for a long period of}} time. Spent nuclear fuel storage is mostly a problem in the United States, following a 1977 President Jimmy Carter prohibition to nuclear fuel recycling.

30|$|In this {{simulation}} scenario, for {{a reasonable}} speed of nodes, our protocol outperforms the <b>reference</b> <b>solution.</b> Take, as an example, a flooding interval of 50 seconds. From Figure 4 (a), {{we can see}} that the detection time of the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> protocol is 5000 seconds. The performance of our protocol depends on the average speed of the system. If the average speed of the system is slow, for example, 5 [*]m/s, then the detection time is more than 6000 seconds. However, if the network nodes move faster, then our solution improves over the <b>reference</b> <b>solution.</b> For instance, when the average speed is 20 [*]m/s, the detection time is as low as 1600 seconds, much faster than the <b>reference</b> <b>solution.</b> From this experiment, {{it is also clear that}} the performance of our protocol depends on the average speed in the network: the faster the better. While the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> is an excellent solution for slow networks, for example, where nodes are carried by humans walking, our solution is the best for faster networks, and it is always the best when the energy overhead must be low. Now, we will switch cooperation on, and see that the performance of our protocol increases considerably, even though with some drawbacks when the energy budget is small.|$|E

Such methods enable a significant reduction of computational resources as opposed to <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation for a large number of realizations of random media. CLS solutions, which neglect correlations induced by the spatial disorder, are faster albeit approximate, and might thus show discrepancies with respect to <b>reference</b> <b>solutions.</b> In this work we propose a new family of algorithms (called 'Poisson Box Sampling', PBS) aimed at improving the accuracy of the CLS approach for transport in $d$-dimensional binary Markov mixtures. In order to probe the features of PBS methods, we will focus on three-dimensional Markov media and revisit the benchmark problem originally proposed by Adams, Larsen and Pomraning and extended by Brantley: for these configurations we will compare <b>reference</b> <b>solutions,</b> standard CLS solutions and the new PBS solutions for scalar particle flux, transmission and reflection coefficients.
