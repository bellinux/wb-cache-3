30|$|For future research, {{longitudinal}} {{studies on the}} impacts of such kind of teacher development programs on student change in academic performance {{would be useful to}} address several questions: First, the classroom practice observation revealed nuances when knowledge and beliefs are translated into practice. While becoming more sensitive to language use as evidenced by teachers’ attention to language features at the three levels and their oral conversation with the students when assignments are returned, we wonder how teachers would provide follow up instruction without an assessment design specifically related to the detailed language objectives. Second, what is the impact of such kind of teacher development on students’ academic performance over time? The grant that supported this <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>distributed</b> {{in such a way that}} we were unable to compare individual student school performance over an academic year. We were limited to a semester when collecting this data, thus focusing more on teacher performance alone. Full cycles of instructional objectives, student performance, feedback from teachers, and follow-up student performance on similar tasks with the same group of students would provide data to reveal teacher effectiveness on student learning as a result of teacher development. Third, what is the lasting effect of such kind of professional development on teacher practice? Three years from now, after having completed this study, it would benefit us to follow up with the teachers to determine whether or not they are still attentive to the language demands of the curriculum content they teach. Finally, how are state teacher evaluation systems compatible or not compatible with linguistically informed education across the curriculum? After all, teachers’ performance is heavily influenced not only by their beliefs, but also external force coming from local, state, and federal authorities. An answer to this question would have implications for all stake holders.|$|E

From the database of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), 41 238 articles with first authors who resided in those countries were extracted. These articles were analyzed by subject area, type of study, country, number of authors and institutions that participated in the investigation, and citations received by each article. Also analyzed were 95 articles in epidemiology selected {{from a pool of}} 570 published by authors from the six countries in 11 public health journals that enjoy international prestige. The results showed that the number of published works increased by 117 % between the first and last five-year periods within the study period. Clinical <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>distributed</b> the most evenly among the countries, and public health research was the most concentrated (60. 7 % originated in Brazil). The numbers of biomedical and public health research articles showed relatively more growth than those reporting on clinical research throughout the period. A relative decrease was found in articles by only one author, which suggests a greater frequency of team efforts, and an increase was seen in articles with authors tied to two or more national or foreign institutions, which indicates greater cooperation between institutions and countries. The average number of citations received by each article was three, which was less than half the number received per article in the ISI database (7. 78). Regarding the subset of 95 articles in epidemiology, the great majority (96 %) dealt with infectious diseases or maternal and child health, while in the international literature 78 % of such articles were about chronic diseases. This group of articles gave evidence of more cooperation with international institutions and had a citation index of 4. 36 per article. It is concluded that, despite the inherent limitations, this type of study reveals some general trends in the development of research in the six Latin American countries with the greatest scientific production and makes it possible to formulate hypotheses on the factors that influence these trends. Taken with the proper caution, the results of studies like this one can be of great value in defining health science and technology policies...|$|E

Due to recent reports of country-level shortages of BPG, an evaluation was undertaken to quantify countries that have experienced shortages in the past 2 years and to describe factors contributing to these shortages. Country-level data about BPG shortages were collected using 3 survey approaches. First, a survey designed by the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and <b>Research</b> <b>was</b> <b>distributed</b> to 41 countries and territories in the Americas and 41 more in Africa. Second, WHO conducted an email survey of 28 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention country directors. An additional 13 countries were in contact with WHO for related congenital syphilis prevention activities and also reported on BPG shortages. Third, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) collected data from 14 countries (where it has active operations) to understand the extent of stock-outs, in-country purchasing, usage behavior, and breadth of available purchasing options to identify stock-outs worldwide. CHAI also conducted in-person interviews in the same 14 countries to understand the extent of stock-outs, in-country purchasing and usage behavior, and available purchasing options. CHAI also completed a desk review of 10 additional high-income countries, which were also included. BPG shortages were attributable to shortfalls in supply, demand, and procurement in the countries assessed. This assessment {{should not be considered}} globally representative as countries not surveyed may also have experienced BPG shortages. Country contacts may not have been aware of BPG shortages when surveyed or may have underreported medication substitutions due to desirability bias. Funding for the purchase of BPG by countries was not evaluated. In all, 114 countries and territories were approached to provide information on BPG shortages occurring during 2014 - 2016. Of unique countries and territories, 95 (83 %) responded or had information evaluable from public records. Of these 95 countries and territories, 39 (41 %) reported a BPG shortage, and 56 (59 %) reported no BPG shortage; 10 (12 %) countries with and without BPG shortages reported use of antibiotic alternatives to BPG for treatment of maternal syphilis. Market exits, inflexible production cycles, and minimum order quantities affect BPG supply. On the demand side, inaccurate forecasts and sole sourcing lead to under-procurement. Clinicians may also incorrectly prescribe BPG substitutes due to misperceptions of quality or of the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Targets for improvement include drug forecasting and procurement, and addressing provider reluctance to use BPG. Opportunities to improve global supply, demand, and use of BPG should be prioritized alongside congenital syphilis elimination efforts...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{show the}} {{effective}} use of technology and audiovisual materials in {{the teaching and learning}} of EFL. It intends to offer an efficient way to improve students’ listening skills through the use of intensive listening (Harmer 2007). That listening skills need to be reinforced both in and outside the classroom is proved by the evidence of the weak competence of Spanish students in oral skills in English provided by a number of surveys at national and European level (Hornero et al. 2013). According to the students’ perceptions, there {{would seem to be a}} need to insist on the practice of listening. Moreover, doing listening tasks outside the classroom following their teacher’s guidance, surely increases the students’ motivation and helps to get them used to the authentic L 2 sounds (Mur et al. 2013). For that purpose a representative sample of undergraduate students of the degree in Primary Education with a pre-intermediate B 1 was selected. The students, whose ages ranged from 18 to 22, belonged to the so-called E-generation (Prensky 2001), which is characterised by living surrounded by a digital culture and their ability to perform multiple tasks. These students have a low tolerance for lectures and prefer active rather than passive learning, which leads to a change in the model of pedagogy, “from a teacher focused approach based on instruction to a student focused model based on collaboration” (Tapscott, 2009). The study was developed in three stages. First, an initial questionnaire designed specifically for this piece of <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>distributed</b> in order to shed light on our students’ English level as well as on the ways and resources they use to learn English. The questionnaire revealed that oral communication skills (listening, speaking and pronunciation) were usually underestimated even though language curricula consider communication as the ultimate goal of learning a language. Bearing in mind these results, the present study proposed two main activities, one focused on listening comprehension and another on the improvement of pronunciation through audiovisual materials, as part of their continuous assessment in the subject Inglés en Educación Primaria I. Students were given clear instructions for the completion of the tasks based on clips from the British animated children’s television seriesPeppa Pig and Ben and Holly’s Little Kingdom. Their choice was justified by the thematic focus that is related to one of the units of the subject and the clarity of the RP accent used in both series. Finally, a post-test demonstrated that watching video clips allowed students to see language in use, that is, to activate all their competences to comprehend oral discourses and to relate paralinguistic behaviour to intonation, an effective way to learn at the same time a range of cross-cultural clues. Training future teachers with these tools and activities –once it has been proved they are effective and motivating– we are paving the ground for a more straightforward  inclusion of these materials and technologies in the EFL teaching and learning process and ensuring an updating in the methodologies of foreign language teaching, a demand made by students themselves...|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} of accumulated radiation doses in people professionally exposed to ionizing radiation was performed using methods of biological (chromosomal aberrations frequency in lymphocytes) and physical (radionuclides analysis in urine, whole-body radiation meter, individual thermoluminescent dosimeters) dosimetry. A group of 84 "A" category employees after {{their work in}} the territory of former Semipalatinsk test site (Kazakhstan) was investigated. The dose rate in some funnels exceeds 40 μSv/h. After radionuclides determination in urine using radiochemical and WBC methods, it was shown that the total effective dose of personnel internal exposure did not exceed 0. 2 mSv/year, while an acceptable dose limit for staff is 20 mSv/year. The range of external radiation doses measured with individual thermo-luminescent dosimeters was 0. 3 - 1. 406 µSv. The cytogenetic examination showed that chromosomal aberrations frequency in staff was 4. 27 ± 0. 22 %, which is significantly higher than at the people from non-polluting settlement Tausugur (0. 87 ± 0. 1 %) (р ≤ 0. 01) and citizens of Almaty (1. 6 ± 0. 12 %) (р≤ 0. 01). Chromosomal type aberrations accounted for 2. 32 ± 0. 16 %, 0. 27 ± 0. 06 % of which were dicentrics and centric rings. The cytogenetic analysis of different types group radiosensitivity among «professionals» (age, sex, ethnic group, epidemiological data) revealed {{no significant differences between}} the compared values. Using various techniques by frequency of dicentrics and centric rings, the average cumulative radiation dose for group was calculated, and that was 0. 084 - 0. 143 Gy. To perform comparative individual dosimetry using physical and biological methods of dose assessment, calibration curves (including own ones) and regression equations based on general frequency of chromosomal aberrations obtained after irradiation of blood samples by gamma-radiation with the dose rate of 0, 1 Gy/min were used. Herewith, on the assumption of individual variation of chromosomal aberrations frequency (1 – 10 %), the accumulated dose of radiation varied 0 - 0. 3 Gy. The main problem in the interpretation of individual dosimetry results is reduced to different reaction of the objects to irradiation - radiosensitivity, which dictates the need of quantitative definition of this individual reaction and its consideration in the calculation of the received radiation dose. The entire examined contingent was assigned to a group based on the received dose and detected cytogenetic aberrations. Radiosensitive individuals, at the lowest received dose in a year, showed the highest frequency of chromosomal aberrations (5. 72 %). In opposite, radioresistant individuals showed the lowest frequency of chromosomal aberrations (2. 8 %). The cohort correlation according to the criterion of radio-sensitivity in our <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>distributed</b> as follows: radio-sensitive (26. 2 %) — medium radio-sensitivity (57. 1 %), radioresistant (16. 7 %). Herewith, the dispersion for radioresistant individuals is 2. 3; for the group with medium radio-sensitivity — 3. 3; and for radio-sensitive group — 9. These data indicate the highest variation of characteristic (reactions to radiation effect) in the group of radio-sensitive individuals. People with medium radio-sensitivity show significant long-term correlation (0. 66; n= 48, β ≥ 0. 999) between the values of doses defined according to the results of cytogenetic analysis and dose of external radiation obtained with the help of thermoluminescent dosimeters. Mathematical models based on the type of violation of the radiation dose according to the professionals radiosensitivity level were offered...|$|E
