25|$|I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> out to bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts {{had just}} taken the second new ball. I had a really close lbw {{decision}} when I had scored about five. I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, knew that I hit it. But thankfully he gave me not out. I went into lunch {{the next day at}} 99 not out and I was so happy to get a century with my parents and friends watching.|$|E
25|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} with Walt Shepperd, Lewis said:My {{mother was a}} worker, worked in the garment trades. My mother was an indomitable spirit. My grandfather had no sons. He had six daughters. They lived in Poland or Russia, every five years it would change. My mother being the oldest daughter, they saved their money, {{and when she was}} about sixteen they sent her to the United States, not knowing a word of English. She went to work in the garment center, worked her back and rear-end off and brought over to the United States her five sisters and two parents. I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> on picket lines with my mother. My mother wouldn't back down to anyone.|$|E

500|$|From 1958 to 1959 Williamson {{worked for}} Harvey Comics collaborating with former EC artists Reed Crandall, Torres and Krenkel and inking the pencils of Jack Kirby (for Race to the Moon #2–3 and Blast-Off #1). [...] On inking Kirby, Williamson relates: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> up to Harvey and getting work there. They said, 'We haven't got any work for you, {{but we have}} some stories here that Jack penciled. Do you want to ink them?' I'd never really inked anybody else before, but I said, 'Sure,' because I looked at the stuff, and thought, I can follow this, it's all there. I inked it and they liked it, and they gave me three or four stories to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Not knowing at {{the time}} that he would be {{referring}} to deleted scenes, Andrew Lincoln told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> on set for the season premiere and seeing a couple of the prop guys, and they just looked at me as they gave me my gun and they went, 'You know, in this episode we kill more zombies than in the whole of Season 1.' They actually counted the kills! And when it came time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted. We just got sent zombies towards us and we had to improvise stabbing, so it was a bit touch-and-go from time to time." ...|$|E
500|$|Valene's storyline in {{her first}} two episodes on Dallas focuses on the {{rebuilding}} of her relationship with estranged ex-husband Gary Ewing. When Valene arrives in Texas to find her daughter, Lucy Ewing, she is brought back into {{the drama of the}} Ewing family. Upon arrival, she is reunited with Gary with whom she slowly falls back in love. Once Dallas became a hit, series creator David Jacobs proceeded to launch a spin-off series titled Knots Landing, which would feature Valene and Gary prominently. The actress had strong input on how they would create her character outline. She recalled, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." ...|$|E
5000|$|Julia Phillips, in You'll Never Eat Lunch in this Town Again, <b>remembered</b> <b>going</b> {{backstage}} at a Stones' concert: [...] "There is a smelly Israeli sic named Freddie {{who seems to}} be very important to everybody.

No doubt they were back revelling in the corrals full of wild horses.|$|R
500|$|... "My mother {{growing up}} was really, really close friends with an Indian woman. She {{ended up having}} an {{arranged}} marriage oddly enough and I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to her wedding {{and it was one}} of the only weddings that I've EVER been to, besides my own mother's, and it was the biggest party, the most fun ever. So when I was doing 'Bounce', you know I don't actually drink or smoke so I thought I don't wanna do a video in a club like poppin' bottles and all this stuff, although the song's about partying. I [...] do a celebration... and it made me think of that experience with my mother's friend going to an Indian wedding and having the most crazy and amazing time and I though I wanna do an Indian wedding! And I wanna do it in India! And I wanna do it properly...and I put an elephant in there for good luck." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I {{was supposed to be}} in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E
500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'" [...] He graduated in 1987, {{at the age of}} 22.|$|E
50|$|They {{decided that}} the {{political}} problem was impractical to address directly, and that what was needed was an educational group to counter the arguments of the pro-choice movement. Filice <b>remembers</b> <b>going</b> {{around the room and}} asking each if they wanted to be chairman, but each of them declined. So, by default, Filice became the chairman of this emergent pro-life group in San Francisco. Thus was born United for Life of San Francisco.|$|R

2500|$|Hodge is {{very proud}} of her status as the {{daughter}} of immigrants, and her upbringing in Orpington, saying in 2015: [...] "I’m an immigrant ... My father was German-Jewish and had a very heavy German accent, and I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> home with a black boyfriend and being lambasted by my parents. [...] I’ve grown up with the notion that immigrants very quickly become settled and turn their anger and hostility on the following wave. I get that in Barking." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "1000 Stars" [...] {{was written}} by Chris Braide, Hattie Webb and Charlie Webb for Natalie Bassingthwaighte's debut solo album of the same name. It was {{recorded}} live at Untouchable Sound Studios in London. Bassingthwaighte stated that the song is [...] "all about that moment of falling in love, that moment of perfection". She {{then went on to}} say, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> into the studio and singing it from it the beginning to end over and over again. I haven't sung like that since my musical theatre days. That's me there, no bells and whistles, no sound effects; it was me in the purest form just having a good sing." ...|$|E

2500|$|God, {{that was}} horrible. That was when Ray tried to top himself. I {{thought he looked}} a bit weird after the show—I didn't know that he'd taken a whole bloody bottle of weird-looking {{psychiatric}} pills. It was a bad time. Ray suddenly {{announced that he was}} going to end it all ... I think he took the pills before the show. I said to him towards the end that he was getting a bit crazy. I didn't know what happened—I suddenly got a phone call saying he was in the hospital. I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to the hospital after they'd pumped his stomach and it was bad.|$|E
2500|$|Due to past experiences, {{in later}} years Marriott became wary of success and fame as well as {{involvement}} with big record companies, and turned down lucrative concert and recording deals with names such as EMI. Because of this attitude, the band grew resentful, believing that he was holding them back, and Packet of Three was disbanded. For the next year Marriott took time off. By now he was 39 years old. He had health problems, was overweight, and had a scruffy appearance. There was little left of the striking 1960s mod icon. Film-maker Paolo Sedazzari recalled, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> {{to see him in}} the 1980s, and he was brilliant. Great voice, great guitarist but what I couldn't get over were the dungarees and the mullet haircut. That was really disappointing." [...] According to his wife, Marriott still smoked cannabis and took cocaine, but nothing compared to what he had once consumed. In his later years Marriott liked reading; his favourite authors included Stephen King, Philip K. Dick and anything on Noël Coward, whom Marriott had always admired.|$|E
2500|$|Keith Morris was the {{photographer}} who took Drake's photo {{for the cover}} of Bryter Layter (1971) and he was commissioned to photograph Drake for the cover of Pink Moon. However, the photos were not used as Drake's rapidly deteriorating appearance, hunched figure and blank expression were not considered good selling points. Island's creative director Annie Sullivan, who oversaw the shoot, recalled the difficulty in making a decision around {{the cover of the}} LP: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> to talk to , and he just sat there, hunched up, and even though he didn't speak, I knew the album was called Pink Moon, and I can't remember how he conveyed it, whether he wrote it down... he wanted a pink moon. He couldn't tell me what he wanted, but I had 'pink moon' to go on." [...] Island picked a piece of surrealist Dali-esque art by Michael Trevithick, who was incidentally a friend of Drake's sister Gabrielle. Although Drake was not outspoken in his opinion on the cover art of Pink Moon, many close to him felt that he approved.|$|E

The only time the event was {{canceled}} was in 1918, due {{to many of the}} riders' involvement in World War I”. Lewis Plugge a Cordova resident has jousted at St. Joseph for 40 years, and <b>remembered</b> <b>going</b> to Old St. Jose (locals call the church) and “loading up the horses {{in the back of a}} farm truck because we did not own a horse trailer.” Jousting is also Maryland's official state sport.|$|R

At the age of five or six, he would go into the woods to pick mushrooms and berries for cooking. In his teens, he bicycled to cook at a small restaurant in Vien, Switzerland, which was his first job as a cook. During World War II, Rossel served as a Private in the Swiss Army and as a cook.|$|R

We were due to play 2 days later. Our first-ever big arena gig, it's called Sheffield Arena now. At the sound check, I was strumming away on the acoustic guitar, and our kid (Liam Gallagher) said, 'What's that you're singin'?' I wasn't singing anyway, I was just making it up. And our kid said, 'Are you singing 'So Sally can wait'.' And I was like – that's genius! So I started singing, 'So Sally can wait.' I <b>remember</b> <b>going</b> back to the dressing room and writing it out. It all came really quickly after that." [...] Noel claims that the character [...] "Lyla", from Oasis' 2005 single is the sister of Sally. In the interview on the DVD released with the special edition of Stop the Clocks, Noel also revealed that a girl approached him {{and asked him if}} Sally was the same girl as in the Stone Roses' track [...] "Sally Cinnamon". Noel replied that he'd never thought of that but thought it was good anyway.|$|E
