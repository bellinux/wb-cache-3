500|$|While in London, Wong was romantically {{linked with}} writer and {{broadcasting}} executive Eric Maschwitz, {{who wrote the}} lyrics to [...] "These Foolish Things (<b>Remind</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Of</b> You)" [...] as an evocation of his longing for her after they parted. Wong's first talkie was The Flame of Love (1930), which she recorded in French, English and German. Though Wong's performance– particularly her handling of the three languages– was lauded, all three versions of the film received negative reviews.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of Nirvana {{frontman}} Kurt Cobain in April 1994, drummer Dave Grohl entered a state of depression, and {{found it difficult to}} both listen to music and play instruments. He was uncertain of what to do next, even considering abandoning his musical career despite a few invitations by bands such as Danzig or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to become their drummer, because [...] "it would just <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> being in Nirvana; every time I sat down at a drum set, I would think of that." ...|$|E

500|$|... "These Foolish Things" [...] is a {{song from}} the British musical comedy Spread it Abroad, written by Harry Link, Holt Marvell and Jack Strachey. It was {{introduced}} by French actor Jean Sablon, who also recorded it in French as [...] "Ces petites choses". Billie Holiday recorded it in 1936 with Teddy Wilson and His Orchestra. Benny Goodman had a #1 hit with the song in 1936. Lester Young made a 1952 recording with Oscar Peterson's trio, replacing the original melody almost completely. The song {{is also known as}} [...] "These Foolish Things <b>Remind</b> <b>Me</b> <b>of</b> You".|$|E
500|$|After the Indiana game, Dari Nowkhah {{wrote in}} ESPN's [...] "Heisman Watch" [...] column that Robinson was [...] "running {{away with the}} Heisman Trophy" [...] and {{compared}} him to 1988 Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders:"We haven't seen this type of college football playmaker since ... Barry Sanders? [...] I'm not saying Robinson reminds me of Sanders. (How could a quarterback <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a running back?) But there is a shocking resemblance between the diminutive playmakers in their speed, elusiveness and quickness. So is the effect the two have on my {{sense of what is}} right and wrong. Being that dominant on a football field somehow feels wrong. It's unfair." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, Pitchfork {{announced}} that Don't Stop {{would be released}} via independent label Smalltown Supersound and Annie's own label Totally Records.

The latter initially featured backing vocals by British pop group Girls Aloud, but their record label intervened.|$|E

500|$|Like its predecessor, {{the second}} {{deputation}} went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany. In Paris, where the 1878 Exposition Universelle was in progress, Kruger saw a hot air balloon {{for the first}} time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. [...] "High up in mid-air", he recalled, [...] "I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as we had gone so far, to take me all the way home." [...] The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal [...] "to <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my journey through the air". The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an open letter in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the review}} for Illmatic was {{handled by the}} magazine's {{columnist}} Miss Info (then writing under the nom de plume, [...] "shortie"), who shared Schecter's enthusiasm for Nas' album. In her review of Illmatic, Minyah wrote, [...] "I must maintain {{this is one of}} the best hip-hop albums I have ever heard" [...] and wrote of its content, [...] "Lyrically, the whole shit is on point. No cliched metaphors, no gimmicks. Never too abstract, never superficial." [...] She also commented on the impact of Nas's [...] "poetic realism" [...] writing: “Nas’ images <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the personal memories and people, both passed and present… All this may sound like melodrama but it not just me. I've been hearing similar responses all over. While 'Memory Lane' is my shit, my homies claim 'The World Is Yours,' and if you've got peoples doing time, then 'One Love' may hit you the hardest.". With the backing of Schecter and the other editors on the staff, Minya awarded Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating.|$|E
500|$|Comparisons between Degrassi: The Next Generation {{and other}} genre {{specific}} series {{have also been}} made throughout the run. Jake Surette, a writer with AfterElton.com, a website which focuses on the portrayal of homosexual and bisexual men in the media, reported on the portrayal of two Degrassi: The Next Generation gay characters. [...] "Degrassi features ongoing stories of real-life teen dilemmas—including intense gay and lesbian storylines—and does it without the righteous, 'On a Very Special Blossom endings that many teen dramas and sitcoms thrive on." [...] Kevin Thompson of The Palm Beach Post said the series [...] "is told from a teenager's point of view since the writers {{have no interest in}} appealing to a broad-based demographic like the writers on, say, Fox's The O.C. ... it connects with teens on their level". PopMatters's Jodie Janella Horn also compared it with The O.C., saying that while scenes from Degrassi could be [...] "actual scenes from my actual teenage life... The O.C. will never <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> anything in my life", adding that it is the most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". He referred to [...] "Mars, Bars" [...] {{as one of the}} finest episodes of season three, praising the Valentine's Day subplot, the development of the mystery of Dean O'Dell's death, and Muhney's performance. Regarding Logan, he opined that although he did not like him moping after his breakup with Veronica, this episode fixed that by including him in the Valentine's Day subplot and setting up a romantic relationship with Parker: [...] "it's just a huge relief to see Logan in a different light and interacting with different people, finally." [...] He also praised Lamb's death scene as being devoid of clichés by not giving him an act of heroism for his dying moments. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode. He saw the episode and the previous episode as a return to form for Veronica Mars, writing, [...] "it's episodes like these last two that <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> what this show looks like when it's really cooking." [...] He also enjoyed the lack of a redemptive moment for Lamb {{at the end of his}} life as well as the comedic value of some scenes in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} well {{received}} amongst critics, especially {{in regards to}} the episodes with Kevin Smith and the storylines on oral sex and the school shooting. The Palm Beach Post said the series [...] "is told from a teenager's point of view since the writers have no interest in appealing to a broad-based demographic like the writers on, say, Fox's The O.C. ... it connects with teens on their level", though it was still [...] "surprised Jay used the graphic oral sex term you'd hear in just about every high school hallway in America", that word being [...] "blow-job". The Boston Herald said [...] "it is important for teens to learn about sexually transmitted diseases and the cost of unprotected sex ... and should help parents begin conversations with their own children". PopMatters's Jodie Janella Horn described Degrassi: The Next Generation as [...] "the most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre". Another comparison was made between Degrassi: The Next Generation and The O.C., saying [...] "The O.C. will never <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> anything in my life", while the events in the two-part episode [...] "Voices Carry" [...] with [...] "hotel room trashing, projectile launching, fist fighting at weddings bi-polar loon Craig , was like an actual scene from my actual teenage life and just like me, Ashley thinks they're going to pull through it together". AfterElton.com, a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay and bisexual men in the media praised the series for [...] "not only focusing on gay teens, but it showcases gay sex, and relationships. By not stereotyping [...] they are helping thousands of confused and shameful teenagers feel accepted, in Canada and America alike." [...] Ben Neihart called Degrassi: The Next Generation [...] "tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD!" [...] (the best teen TV in the world) in a six-page article in The New York Times. Commenting that [...] "the explosive-issue-per-capita ratio is seriously out of whack", he admitted that [...] "the teen-diary attention to microissues (zits, periods, parents' night) gives the episodes a peculiar authenticity no matter how outrageous their story lines".|$|E
