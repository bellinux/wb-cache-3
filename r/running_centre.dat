50|$|A North Sydney rugby union junior, Allan's senior {{career was}} with the Gordon rugby club in Sydney where {{his father was a}} coach. Tressider {{described}} him as a fine <b>running</b> <b>centre</b> with powerful acceleration once he got outside a rival.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{traditional}} masking experiments {{do not fit}} in with the effect of "two-tone inhibition" revealed by single-nerve-fibre studies. This is considered a serious objection against the interpretation of a masking pattern as reflecting the auditory spectrum of a masker. The results of a different masking paradigm, based on the pulsation threshold, do reveal an effect similar to "two-tone inhibition. " Therefore, such pulsation-threshold patterns might reflect more accurately the auditory spectrum of the masker. Pulsation-threshold patterns of three vowel-like sounds were determined. These were compared with the spectral patterns of the "vowels" after analysis with a 1 / 3 octave-band filter with <b>running</b> <b>centre</b> frequency. It appeared that the pulsation-threshold patterns are sharper than the 1 / 3 octave-band spectra and, in some cases. even more pronounced than the original vowel spectra. This has interesting implications with regard to vowel-perception theories, such as theories on "formant extraction. ...|$|E
