40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the botanical evidence for the function of so-called 'corn-driers' from Roman-period Britain. The charred grain assemblages associated with corn-driers from twenty-one sites have been analysed. The results indicate that these kilns should be regarded as multi-functional structures; both the <b>roasting</b> <b>of</b> germinated <b>grains</b> for the production of malt and the parching/drying/ <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> in preparation for consumption and storage are functions implied by the botanical evidence. The need for further experimental research is identified...|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} {{analysis}} the <b>roasting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> and making flour of it by the hand mill symbolizes {{the process of the}} and resurrection of the god. It means {{the beginning of a new}} period. The mill as a cosmic machine produces periods of time. Thus, the mill doesn't mean only worldly, also cosmic and it is often made by a mythological smith like Finnish blacksmith Ilmarinen. He makes a mill which is called Sampo. In Serbian tradition the blacksmith gives the water mill to people. This symbolic and cultural association between the smith and mill is remarkable for the continuity between Kothar and Khidr.|$|R
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} activity <b>of</b> {{extract from}} <b>roasted</b> barley grain was evaluated by various methods in vitro and in vivo. Results {{showed that the}} extract exhibited high antioxidant activities in vitro and in vivo, evidenced by its ability to chelate ferrous ions, scavenge hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, and prevent lipid peroxidation of liver homogenate. The extract significantly increased the total antioxidant capability (T-AOC) in aged mice (P < 0. 05). The activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) increased while levels of malondialodehyde (MDA) and manoamine oxidase (MAO) decreased in both the liver and brain of aged mice treated with the extract compared to the control (untreated mice). The results demonstrate potential antioxidant activities and antiaging effect <b>of</b> <b>roasted</b> barley <b>grain.</b> This provides scientific support for the use <b>of</b> <b>roasted</b> barley <b>grain</b> as an antioxidant against oxidative stress...|$|R
2500|$|Bread was {{a staple}} food, and {{as in the}} Bible, the meal is {{designated}} by the simple term [...] "to eat bread," [...] so the rabbinical law ordains that the blessing pronounced upon bread covers everything else except wine and dessert. Bread was made not only from wheat, but also from barley, rice, millet, lentils, etc. Many kinds of fruit were eaten. [...] There was a custom to eat apples during Shavuot, while specific fruit and herbs were eaten on holidays and special occasions such as, Rosh Hashana. Children received nuts and <b>roasted</b> ears <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> especially {{on the evening of}} Passover. Olives were so common that they were used as a measure (zayit).|$|R

50|$|Porter is a {{historically}} significant style developed in 18th century London, {{which is the}} ancestor of stout, a style now considered typically Irish.

They differ from dark milds and old ales in the use <b>of</b> <b>roast</b> <b>grains,</b> which adds to the bitterness, and lends flavours of toast, biscuit or coffee.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to reduce the {{formation}} <b>of</b> acrylamide during <b>roasting</b> <b>of</b> chicory roots by soaking the fresh roots in a solution of calcium chloride, by the use of different temperature and time <b>of</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>of</b> dried roots, as well as by the addition of the enzyme (asparaginase) during <b>roasting</b> <b>of</b> dried roots. It was shown, that with increasing <b>roasting</b> temperature <b>of</b> chicory roots from 100 - 175 ° C the acrylamide content also increased, while at a temperature of 210 ° C the growth was inhibited. Increasing roasting time from 10 - 25 minutes resulted in an increased acrylamide content. Soaking the roots in the CaCl 2 solution for 20 minutes reduced the formation of acrylamide during the roasting approximately by 40 %, similarly as the application of asparaginase to the dried roots during the roasting process...|$|R
