25|$|In {{food and}} wine pairings, the {{diversity}} of Merlot can lend itself to {{a wide array of}} matching options. Cabernet-like Merlots pair well with many of the same things that Cabernet Sauvignon would pair well with, such as grilled and charred meats. Softer, fruitier Merlots (particularly those with higher acidity from cooler climate regions like Washington State and Northeastern Italy) share many of the same food-pairing affinities with Pinot noir and go well with dishes like salmon, mushroom-based dishes and greens like chard and <b>radicchio.</b> Light-bodied Merlots can go well with shellfish like prawns or scallops, especially if wrapped in a protein-rich food such as bacon or prosciutto. Merlot tends not to go well with strong and blue-veined cheeses that can overwhelm the fruit flavors of the wine. The capsaicins of spicy foods can accentuate the perception of alcohol in Merlot and make it taste more tannic and bitter.|$|E
500|$|Fats and {{proteins}} {{reduce the}} perception of tannins on the palate. When Cabernet Sauvignon is paired with steak or dishes with a heavy butter cream sauce, the tannins are neutralized, allowing {{the fruits of the}} wine to be more noticeable. In contrast, starches such as pastas and rice will have little effect on tannins. The bitterness of the tannins can also be counterbalanced by the use of bitter foods, such as <b>radicchio</b> and [...] endive, or with cooking methods that involve charring like grilling. As the wine ages and the tannins lessen, more subtle and less bitter dishes will pair better with Cabernet Sauvignon. The oak influences of the wine can be matched with cooking methods that have similar influences on the food-such as grilling, smoking and plank roasting. Dishes that include oak-influenced flavors and aromas normally found in Cabernet Sauvignon—such as dill weed, brown sugar, nutmeg and vanilla—can also pair well.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Radicchio</b> {{usually has}} {{variegated}} red or {{red and green}} leaves.

50|$|Fructans {{are another}} source of {{prebiotic}} soluble dietary fibers. They are often found in the soluble fibers of foods which are high in sulfur, such as the Allium and Cruciferous vegetables. Sources of fructans include wheat (although some wheat strains such as spelt contain lower amounts), rye, barley, onion, garlic, Jerusalem and globe artichoke, asparagus, beetroot, chicory, dandelion leaves, leek, <b>radicchio,</b> the white part of spring onion, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, fennel and prebiotics such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), oligofructose and inulin. While many of these foods lack in butyrate production compared to resistant starch, {{they do have a}} number of benefits. They generally possess a low glycemic index which appeals well to diabetics. They also appeal to those on the ketogenic diet who benefit from beta-hydroxybutyric acid, which is a HDAC inhibitor which can cross the blood brain barrier and be used as fuel in the mitochondria of brain cells. Other HDAC inhibitors in these butyrate producing foods are sulforaphane, which has promise in inhibiting human breast cancer cells. Sulforaphane has also been shown to promote hair growth in mice, it contains compounds which prevent ulcers, and helps with cognitive function in rats. It is good to note that sulforaphane in broccoli is destroyed if prepared improperly. Diallyl disulfide found in the fructans containing garlic has been shown to reduce chemical toxicity and carcinogenesis in rodents, and shows synergestic benefits with butyrate when it comes to inhibiting the growth of human cancer tumor cells in the colon.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the present {{research}} is the <b>Radicchio</b> of Treviso Rosso Igp, in the specific typologies of tardivo and precoce, which culture is particularly widespread in the provinces of Treviso, Padua and Venice and that has received the European recognition in 1996. The main purpose of this research has been to analyse if the community guardianship has brought benefits to the productive flow as a whole and, more specifically, to the enterprises of the production sector. At this purpose the sector of <b>radicchio</b> has been presented describing production, market and institutional factors. In particular, it has been pointed out the impact of European recognition on 23 enterprises members of the Consortium for the tutelage and valorisation of the <b>Radicchio</b> of Treviso Rosso (and the <b>Radicchio</b> of Castelfranco Variegato) constituted in 1996. The result is a positive impact due to quality politics pursued by the Consortium, the adoption of an innovative trade packaging, the greater visibility of <b>radicchio</b> even out of the traditional areas of production and consumption. In fact, these factors have yielded the prices of the different typologies of <b>radicchio,</b> not only the Igp one, giving to the enterprises the possibility to get better economic performances. In the future, the same positive results could be gathered through a more efficient contrast at the smuggled goods, promotional activities and increasing of supply...|$|E
40|$|Gun {{sprinklers}} were {{commonly used}} in Italy to irrigate <b>Radicchio.</b> Although this high-pressure irrigation system allows large areas to be irrigated in a short time, it has some major disadvantages. Disadvantages include {{the impact of the}} drops on the soil and crop can be very strong, the high volume of water used tends to increase water use and runoff and water distribution uniformity is low. A 3 -year experiment was conducted in North-East Italy in order to evaluate the possibility of using a mini-sprinkler irrigation system with low-volume application rates. The use of mini-sprinkler resulted in a higher distribution uniformity, higher Christiansen uniformity coefficient and a higher water use efficiency. Energy cost was also lower when the mini-sprinkler system was used for irrigation as compared to the irrigation gun system. <b>Radicchio</b> head weight and marketable yield were higher when plants were irrigated with the mini-sprinkler as compared to those irrigated with the irrigation gun. Therefore, the use of mini-sprinklers resulted in not only a reduction in water use and energy cost but also an increase in <b>radicchio</b> production...|$|E
40|$|After {{purchasing}} seed {{it often}} happens {{that all the}} seed is not used during one season, but they are stored {{for a couple of}} years. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether germination of <b>radicchio</b> and endive is still high enough after longer storage. We also wanted to define seed vigor in relation to the year of production and variety, and whether pretreatment with KNO 3 could improve germination of older seed of <b>radicchio</b> and endive. The seed of three varieties of <b>radicchio</b> (‘Pallarossa’, ‘Verona’ and ‘Pandizucchero’) and three varieties of endive (‘Dječja glava’, ‘Pankalierka’ and ‘Escariol žuta’), from five seasons of certification (06 / 07, 07 / 08 08 / 09, 09 / 10 and 10 / 11) was tested. The following seed traits were analyzed: 1000 seed weight, moisture, germination rate, standard germination test, seed electrical conductivity, and the amount of absorbed water per gram of seed for 24 hours. Seed was germinated in two soaking treatments: in tap water with cooling pre-treatment, and KNO 3. Based on the results, it was concluded that treatment with KNO 3 significantly increases the standard germination of <b>radicchio,</b> as compared with water, and does not improve the germination of endive seed, but on the contrary, it has a negative effect. In both plant species, conductivity does not increase with seed age, because the oldest seed did not show the highest EC. In order to fully assess the impact of aging on seed vigor in tested plant species it is necessary to conduct further research...|$|E
40|$|<b>Radicchio</b> (Cichorium intybus subsp. intybus var. foliosum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} leaf chicories, used mainly as a component for fresh salads.

Indeed, the availability of the first genome sequence for this plant species will provide a powerful tool to be exploited in the identification of markers associated with or genes responsible for relevant agronomic traits, influencing crop productivity and product quality. The plant material used for the sequencing of the leaf chicory genome belongs to the <b>Radicchio</b> of the Chioggia type. Genomic DNA was used for library preparation with the TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation chemistry (Illumina). Sequencing reactions were performed with the Illumina platforms HiSeq and MySeq, and sequence reads were then assembled and annotated.

40|$|The use of {{raised beds}} (i. e., ridged soil layers) to {{cultivate}} vegetables can improve soil quality, crop performance, water use and even reduce soil erosion. Although those advantages {{are well known}} and documented in the literature for many vegetable species, <b>Radicchio,</b> a particular variety of chicory, is usually cultivated in flat seed-beds and, therefore, the achievable benefits of raised beds for this vegetable are not yet known. The possibility to grow plants of <b>Radicchio</b> on raised beds is here evaluated by comparing the most important yield performances indicators deriving from the adoption of this practice (grown plants percentage, average head weight, marketable yields, and net incomes) with the same indicators recorded with a conventional practice making use of flat seed-beds. The results evidenced that raised beds for <b>Radicchio</b> had a statistically {{significant effect on the}} average head weight (+ 55. 45 g plant- 1 with 15 -cm beds) with significant increases of field yields (up to + 30. 6 %) and net incomes (up to + 29. 7 %) on the trials with flat seed-beds. The experiment showed that the production of chicory can take an economical advantage from the use of raised seed-beds and, therefore, this system is preferable to the traditional cultivation practice...|$|E
