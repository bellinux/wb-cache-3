[...] The operator would be disconnected from the circuit, allowing her to handle another call, while the caller heard an audible <b>ringback</b> signal, so that that operator would not have to periodically report that she was continuing to ring the line.|$|E

5000|$|All Belief {{plans are}} {{nationwide}} with no additional roaming {{charges in the}} United States. These plans all include at no additional charge: incoming calls, nights & weekends starting at 7pm, and mobile-to-mobile calls between U.S. Cellular customers. At {{the beginning of the}} Belief Project, customers were only required to fulfill one twenty-four month agreement per line ("One-and-Done Contracts"). After the first initial contract, customers no longer had to sign contracts and could continue to buy new phones at promotional prices when eligible. However, as of Q3 2013, the [...] "one-and-done" [...] contract provision was discontinued on all plans, and, as of January 8, 2015, customers can no longer receive a device subsidy on most Belief Plans when eligible. Instead, they have to purchase devices at full cost without contract, or purchase devices on no-interest 24-month installment plans added to their monthly bills (see Shared Data Plans below). Customers on Belief Plans earned points each month as part of the Belief Rewards program and they could also be earned by referring customers or participating in other promotional activities. These points could be redeemed for early upgrades, free accessories, phones, overage [...] "forgiveness" [...] and ringtones and <b>ringbacks.</b> However, the Rewards Points program has been discontinued as of September 1, 2015.|$|R
50|$|<b>RingBack</b> Tone Advertising, or RBT-Ads (also {{known as}} <b>RingBack</b> Advertising, Ad <b>RingBack,</b> Ad-RBT, AdRBT, Voice Ads, or Biz-Ring), replaces the <b>Ringback</b> tone period, or {{standard}} acoustic signal a caller hears that indicates the called phone is ringing, with advertisements or other promotional messages.

50|$|Some <b>ringback</b> {{numbers are}} local or {{regional}} in scope, {{while others are}} larger in scope. Every telephone company determines its own <b>ringback</b> numbers for each individual central office. Under the North American Numbering Plan, most North American area codes reserve telephone numbers beginning with 958 and 959 for internal testing. Some companies also reserve 999 for test exchanges. Numbers within these test exchange block ranges are used for various types of local and long-distance testing; generally, this block includes a <b>ringback</b> number (to test the ringer when installing telephone sets) and a loop around (which connects a call to another inbound call to the same or another test number). <b>Ringback</b> numbers may appear in the 958 exchange, {{but there is no}} requirement that they reside there.|$|E

50|$|Typically, a lineman {{tests the}} {{terminal}} equipment (telephone set) ringer by calling a <b>ringback</b> telephone number or a vertical service code, and then hanging up {{and waiting for}} the telephone to ring. When answering, the switch may play a low frequency signal tone, at which point the technician flashes the line (hangs up briefly) one or more times. A higher pitched tone then indicates <b>ringback</b> is engaged, and the technician hangs up. The phone will then ring, answering only with a verification tone when picked up. The verification tone is added so that telephone subscribers cannot easily use the <b>ringback</b> system as an intercom, to call other extensions of their own phone line by simply initiating a <b>ringback</b> test {{and waiting for the}} phone to stop ringing and converse when someone else on their own line has answered the extension.|$|E
