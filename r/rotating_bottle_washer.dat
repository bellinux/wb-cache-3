Because wherever a control of liquid is required, it can be used. It can be used in chemical and oil industries also. Water is used for washing purpose in <b>bottle</b> <b>washer</b> machine. Total three parameters are controlled 1. level, 2. flow and 3. pressure etc. There is a very strong interaction in between these parameters. Pressure and flow are required to control for better washing. The aim is to maintain above listed variable by using Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). It increases efficiency and response time both. By modifying hardware this loop can use for bottle filler also. For that a valve is required at output side. Almost industry requirement is an output with safety. So, safety aspects are also considered in it. Different sensors and valves are used with PLC. They are controlled by a program. According to the program PLC generates different signals and valve is controlled. This way pressure, level and flow can control. As an extra feature a Human Machine Interface (HMI) is also connected.

(Engineering Management) Abstract: When the {{complexity}} of the controller plant is a non-linear system, the production process cannot be fulfilled by the control effect and {{it is not easy to}} manipulate the parameters on Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller. The major objective under study is simulating and modelling machinery then come up with a suitable intelligent Condition Based Maintenance system (i. e to develop a suitable intelligent system using fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence). The area under study of Fuzzy Logic came as a concern of nonlinear systems which fail to give correct information since machines use conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative and hence this is for linear systems. Considering vibrations and continuous failure of machines, this will cause incorrect data portraying. Three companies were done in this thesis and all were analysed using fuzzy logic and some finite element analysis of components to monitor the parameters. Root cause analysis was also done to determine what was failing on different equipments. Three companies in a developing country were used as case studies for testing fuzzy logic approaches and models to machinery failure analysis. The three companies are designated as follows: Beverages Production Company, Hydro Power Generating Company and Water Distributing Company. The overall effectiveness of the companies were heavily affected due to many breakdowns. The main problem was found to be resulting from failure to monitor nonlinear systems that naturally exist in such environments. On the <b>bottle</b> <b>washer</b> at Beverages Production Company, fuzzy logic with Model Reference Adaptive Control to prevent failure on the <b>bottle</b> <b>washer</b> and introduce an intelligent Condition Based Maintenance program was done, a solution to come up with a control system that monitors water in the dam as well as protecting the equipment from failure and do stability control of machinery for Water Distributing Company as well as apply the concept of Maintenance Free Operating Period reliability metric to determine maintenance intervals as opposed to Mean Time Between Failure to the Hydro-Power Generation Company and also do a Simulink control on the governor. The results of the simulation of the control strategy of Fuzzy Logic Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller have much preferred performance as compared to the general Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller. This was done in the Simulink/Matlab simulation environment. The innovations behind this thesis at Beverages Production Company, the pneumatic valve of the <b>bottle</b> <b>washer</b> which controls the discharge of clean bottles was occasionally sticking or failing resulting in significant loss of production in the plant since all the other processes which follow depend on the <b>bottle</b> <b>washer.</b> The main causes of failure were caused by poor control of temperature and pressure. Excessive moisture and abrasive particles also caused failures. In order to solve this problem a Model Reference Adaptive Fuzzy Controller was designed for the pneumatic valve using the Matlab software. The error resulting from the difference between the actual system output and that of the reference model was executed by the Fuzzy Logic Controller. At company Hydro-Power Generation Company, the administering system of a 150 Megawatts Francis Turbine was developed using fuzzy logic. The representative framework parameters were mirrored with the real information accessible in the power plant. At Water Distributing Company the problem of corroding gates and failure was solved using solid works, Matlab, Programmable Logic Controller and Simulink. The sluice gate valve was controlled and done stability by Matlab to avoid failure. After fuzzy logic is applied in each and every company under study, the breakdowns will be less and machinery can be diagnosed and prognosis is easy to foresee the failures. A new gate was designed by the researcher. The research has shown that fuzzy logic being intelligent, machinery can last longer and production is high. The limitations are that although it is good in monitoring but in some machinery and companies may not work well because of environment like in the water gates. It is also expensive to implement and difficult to convince management to do the research for a start...|$|R

40|$|Processes {{and systems}} using water today are being {{subjected}} to increasingly stringent environmental regulations on effluents and there is growing demand for fresh water. This {{study was conducted in}} a factory of carbonated soft drinks in Khartoum North industrial area. The aim of the study is to identify all the processes using fresh water, then minimize the water consumption in these processes, also to develop a wastewater management system by studying the possibility of reuse, recycling and treatment. During the year of 2007 - 2008, the water consumption was (1900 m 3 /day) and the wastewater generated was (1300 m 3 /day), also samples of wastewater were collected and analyzed in order to evaluate the existing conditions of the waste and to determine the impact of each activity inside the plant on the effluent quantity and quality. The results of the analysis of wastewater samples from the final effluent were compared with the discharge standards to the public sewer of the Sudanese Standards & metrology Organization(SSMO). The results showed that â€“ with the exception of few cases â€“ the quality of wastewaters generated falls within the specified limits. However the operating SWI is considered high (4. 13 m 3 per m 3 of final product) consequently the amount of wastewater discharge â€“ which is 69 % of the water intake â€“ is high. The <b>bottle</b> <b>washer</b> is the main source of wastewater (69 % from the final effluent) with high values of Chemical oxygen demand(3200 mg/L), Total dissolved solids (2900 mg/L) and pH(10. 26). The factory has a pretreatment unit (precipitation tanks) which reduces the Total dissolved solids (from 790 to 350 mg/L), Total suspended solids (from 450 to 100 mg/L) and also reduces the Chemical oxygen demand (from 695 to 120 mg/L. XII It is recommended to segregate The <b>bottle</b> <b>washer</b> wastewater and treat it separately to reduce the TDS,COD and pH values. Also to reuse of the wastewater generated from the back wash in other activities that do not require a high quality of water such as floor washing and irrigation of the green yards in the plant...|$|R

40|$|Pasteurized {{bottled milk}} {{supplied}} {{by a single}} dairy was frequently found to be contaminated with Yersinia spp. Investigations were carried out at the dairy {{in an effort to}} pinpoint the source of these organisms. Viable counts obtained from milk bottle rinses indicated that bottle washing was often unsatisfactory, and on one occasion Y. frederiksenii was isolated from the pooled rinse water of six bottles. Samples of milk were taken on arrival at the dairy and at various stages following pasteurization. Heat resistance tests carried out on strains of yersinia isolated from pasteurized milk indicated that they would not survive the pasteurization process. However two strains of yersinia were isolated from a sample of milk taken immediately after pasteurization but before bottling. The thermograph indicated that the time/temperature conditions applied during pasteurization were adequate. The presence of yersinia strains in the milk at this stage therefore suggests that undetectable levels of raw milk were being allowed to contaminate the pasteurized milk. The absence of yersinia in cartoned samples produced on the same day as contaminated bottled samples indicated that environmental contamination of the bottle filler valve also may have occurred at times. Results of this investigation indicate that increased vigilance is required to ensure proper operation of pasteurizers and <b>bottle</b> <b>washers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{water bottle}} {{flipping}} challenge consists of spinning a bottle, partially filled with water, {{and making it}} land upright. It is quite a striking phenomenon, since at first sight it appears rather improbable that a tall <b>rotating</b> <b>bottle</b> could make such a stable landing. Here we analyze the physics behind the water bottle flip, based on experiments and an analytical model {{that can be used}} in the classroom. Our measurements show that the angular velocity of the bottle decreases dramatically, enabling a nearly vertical descent and a successful landing. The reduced rotation is due to an increase of the moment of inertia, caused by the in-flight redistribution of the water mass along the bottle. Experimental and analytical results are compared quantitatively, and we demonstrate how to optimize the chances for a successful landing. Comment: submitted to American Journal of Physic...|$|R

Excellent agreement was obtained between the experimental and predicted data using the modified competitive Langmuir-like model and the LeVan-Vermeulen model. The agreement obtained from the original competitive Langmuir-like model was less satisfactory. These observations are not surprising because the competitive Langmuir-like model assumes that the capacities of the adsorbates are equal, while the other 2 models take into account the differences in the capacities of the components...|$|R
