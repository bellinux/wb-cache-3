50|$|Curtis {{was first}} {{introduced}} to show business as a 14-year-old runaway with the circus. He traveled throughout the country by train as a roustabout with Ringling Brothers, Clyde Beatty and Rudy Brothers circuses. Circus life was rough for roustabouts and laborers, and this helped Curtis develop a ‘tough-guy’ attitude that later prepared him for ‘bad-boy’ actor roles. He next traveled the <b>race</b> <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> and worked with thoroughbred horses. He already had an affinity for horses, having learned to ride bareback {{growing up in the}} Adirondack Mountains. Curtis then moved to New York City, where he modeled for a major modeling agency, which booked him for commercials and photographic assignments, portraying him as a young all-American teenager.|$|E
5000|$|Gray Morrow {{was born}} in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he {{attended}} North Side High School. He recalled in 1973 that, [...] "Comic art was certainly the first artform I remember being impressed with ... Those gorgeous gory newsstand spreads...." [...] After serving as editor of his high-school yearbook, for which he did cartoons and illustration, and working a number of odd jobs including [...] "soda jerk, street repairman, tie designer, exercise boy on the <b>race</b> <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> etc.," [...] he enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago, Illinois, in late summer 1954, studying two nights a week for three months under Jerry Warshaw for [...] "the total of my entire formal art training." [...] His first formal commission [...] "was something like a bank ad or a tie design when I was still in my teens." [...] He joined the city's Feldkamp-Malloy art studio, later being fired. Feeling encouraged by a meeting with comic-strip artist Allen Saunders, Morrow submitted strip samples to various syndicates with no luck.|$|E

25|$|After the war, the California Roadster Association (CRA) {{was formed}} to run auto races with roadsters that <b>raced</b> on oval <b>track</b> and {{attempted}} land speed records on dry salt flat lakes. After World War II, the sanctioning body began sanctioning sprint car races. In 1946, Edelbrock decided to expand his involvement into midget car racing, purchasing a car made by Frank Kurtis. In addition to racing the car, he wanted a test bench for the racing products he was developing. Edelbrock's team toured the dirt <b>track</b> <b>racing</b> <b>circuit</b> of Southern California with flathead guru Bobby Meeks tuning the cars. Many famous drivers, including two Indianapolis 500 winners, were {{in the ranks of}} the Edelbrock team, including Walt Faulkner, Perry Grimm, Cal Niday, Danny Oakes, Harry Stockman, Bill Vukovich, Rodger Ward and Bill Zaring.|$|R
50|$|The {{gameplay}} of Uniracers involves racing riderless unicycles {{around a}} 2D track. Heavy {{emphasis is placed}} on performing stunts. Performing stunts causes the unicycle to go faster on <b>race</b> or <b>circuit</b> <b>tracks</b> and earn points on stunt tracks. The stunts that can be performed are relatively simple, mostly only involving jumping in the air and rotating about a given axis in 3D space. The idea {{is to be able to}} perform these stunts quickly in tight situations while landing the unicycle on its wheel to avoid wiping out, which results in the loss of accumulated speed.|$|R
50|$|The United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen was {{a memorable}} race - the Lotus team had returned, and Brazilian {{newcomer}} Emerson Fittipaldi, who found himself as Lotus team leader after Rindt's death was consistently competitive throughout. He was challenged by Mexican Pedro Rodriguez, wanting to win again after his Spa triumph four months earlier. Rodriguez {{ran out of}} fuel, and although he stormed through the track, Fittipaldi was able {{to hold on to}} win his first ever Formula One championship race. This was the last F1 race at the original Watkins Glen permanent <b>race</b> <b>track</b> - the <b>circuit</b> was rebuilt for the following year. Also, Rindt had posthumously won the Drivers' Championship at this race - Ickx had failed to gain the 37 or more total points necessary to overtake Rindt's total at the last race in Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Bugatti Circuit is a {{permanent}} <b>race</b> <b>track</b> located within <b>Circuit</b> des 24 Heures, named after Ettore Bugatti. The circuit uses {{a part of the}} larger circuit and a separate, purpose-built section. The sections of track on the Bugatti Circuit that are on the Circuit des 24 Heures include the Ford Chicane {{at the end of the}} lap, the pit complex, and the straight where the Dunlop Tyres bridge is located. At this point in the overlapping section of the tracks there is a left right sweep that was added for motorcycle safety in 2002. Vehicles turning to the left continue onto the Circuit des 24 Heures, toward Tertre Rouge and Mulsanne, vehicles turning to the right at La Chapelle will continue the Bugatti Circuit. The infield section features Garage Vert, a back straight, the 'S' du Garage Bleu, and Raccordement, which joins back at the Ford chacane.|$|R
50|$|Martinsville Speedway is an International Speedway Corporation-owned NASCAR {{stock car}} <b>racing</b> <b>track</b> located in Henry County, in Ridgeway, Virginia, {{just to the}} south of Martinsville.

50|$|A coded <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> based {{system is}} {{essentially}} an inductive system that uses the running rails as information transmitter. The coded <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> serve a dual purpose: to perform the train detection and rail continuity detection functions of a standard <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> and to continuously transmit signal indications to the train. The coded <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> systems {{eliminate the need for}} specialized beacons.|$|R
50|$|A <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> {{interrupter}} may {{be fitted}} at catch points, trap points or buffer stops {{to maintain a}} <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> in the 'occupied' state {{in the event of}} a derailment. The <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> remains de-energised until the interrupter is replaced.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} {{approaches}} {{to provide a}} continuous path for traction current that spans multiple <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> blocks. The simplest method installs insulated <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> joints on {{only one of the}} two rails with the second being a path for the return current and a ground for the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> rail. This has the disadvantage of only being able to detect breaks in one rail so the more popular two rail system uses impedance bonds to permit traction current to pass between isolated <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> blocks while blocking current at <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> frequencies.|$|R

50|$|A short, {{lightweight}} and fast train passing over an insulated blockjoint may {{disappear from the}} departing <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> before it appears in the arriving <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> allowing false clear signals to be given. This problem can be overcome by introducing a time delay of say 1 - 2 seconds into the departing <b>track</b> <b>circuit.</b> Electronic <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> such as the CSEE can easily incorporate such a time delay.|$|R
5000|$|In {{electrified}} areas, jointless <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> require fewer impedance bonds {{than any}} other double rail traction return <b>track</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R

50|$|If {{the lines}} are <b>track</b> <b>circuited</b> and a wagon or train using the catchpoint could foul an {{adjacent}} line, then a <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> interrupter will be fitted {{to one of the}} run-off rails.
