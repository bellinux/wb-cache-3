50|$|Some {{hard disk}} drives simply fail because of worn out parts, others fail prematurely. Drive {{manufacturers}} typically specify a {{mean time between}} failures (MTBF) or an annualized failure rate (AFR) which are population statistics that can not predict the behavior of an individual unit. These are calculated by constantly <b>running</b> <b>samples</b> of the drive for a short amount of time, analyzing the resultant wear and tear upon the physical components of the drive, and extrapolating to provide a reasonable estimate of its lifespan. Hard disk drive failures tend to follow the concept of the bathtub curve. Drives typically fail within a short time if there is a defect present from manufacturing. If a drive proves reliable for a period of a few months after installation, the drive has a significantly greater chance of remaining reliable. Therefore, even if a drive is subjected to several years of heavy daily use, it may not show any notable signs of wear unless closely inspected. On the other hand, a drive can fail at any time in many different situations.|$|E

This paper {{investigates the}} model {{matching}} problem in discrete systems with free- design zeros of the reference model for any fractional order-hold {{and a wide}} set of admissible values of the <b>running</b> <b>sampling</b> period used in the discretization process of a linear and time-invariant single-input single-output continuous-time plant. For such a purpose, a fast input sampling rate at sufficiently small sampling period is used with an appropriate set of scalar gains to generate them within the slow <b>running</b> <b>sampling</b> period. This makes possible to stabilize the discrete plant zeros what allows their cancellation in the model matching problem synthesis irrespective of either the absence of continuous-time zeros or the presence of continuous-time critically stable or unstable ones. The design philosophy is extended to model matching based adaptive control schemes by using appropriate partitions of the parameter space so that {{a finite number of}} sets of scalar gains is pre-calculated to be stored and then used to online accommodate the numerator of the estimated transfer functions so that it might be a stable time-varying polynomial with no common factors with the estimated plant poles...|$|R

40|$|Background: In most {{measurements}} of gene expression, mRNA is first reverse-transcribed into cDNA. We studied the reverse transcription reaction {{and its consequences}} for quantitative {{measurements of}} gene expression. Methods: We used SYBR green I-based quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) to measure the properties of reverse transcription reaction for the �-tubulin, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, Glut 2, CaV 1 D, and insulin II genes, using random hexamers, oligo(dT), and gene-specific reverse transcription primers. Results: Experimental variation in reverse transcription-QPCR (RT-QPCR) was mainly attributable to the reverse transcription step. Reverse transcription efficiency depended on priming strategy, and the dependence was different for the five genes studied. Reverse transcription yields also depended on total RNA concentration. Conclusions: RT-QPCR gene expression measurements are comparable only when the same priming strategy and reaction conditions are used in all experiments and the samples contain the same total amount of RNA.

We examined the possibilities and limitations of signal summing, an under-utilized, easy-to-apply practice to increase LOQs for an immunosuppressant LC-MS/MS method. The limits of signal summing for everolimus were tested by <b>running</b> <b>samples</b> of everolimus at three concentrations in triplicate programming, increasing amounts of identical transitions in a constant cycle time up to the maximum number the software permitted to sum. The increase in peak area and the signal-to-noise ratio were determined. The effect on imprecision of peak areas and response ratios was evaluated by injection of a low concentration of everolimus tenfold using respectively one and five identical transitions, retaining an identical ion counting time. We compared the imprecision, LOQ, and recovery for our routine everolimus method (using one transition for everolimus and one for d 3 -everolimus) and an adapted method summing three identical transitions for everolimus (and one for d 3 -everolimus). The increase in signal was close to the theoretically expected one with a larger experimental spread for everolimus once more than five transitions were used. There was no clear beneficial effect of summing on imprecision. The adapted everolimus method showed a lower LOQ, but comparable imprecision and recovery as the routine method. Quantification levels can be improved by signal summing. No clear effect on imprecision was observed. status: publishe...|$|E

In a separate study, intracellular thiol concentration was determined in lymphocyte subsets from eight characteristically similar men by flow cytometry, of which T-cell memory populations were further identified {{on the basis of}} CD 27, CD 28, and CD 45 RA expression. Total lymphocyte protein carbonyls were transiently increased with exercise and returned to baseline within 15 min (P < 0. 001). This change was accompanied by an increase in plasma lipid peroxides (P < 0. 05) and total antioxidant capacity (P < 0. 001). Correlation analyses showed that lymphocyte protein carbonyl content was not related to changes in the cellular composition of peripheral blood during exercise. Natural killer cells (CD 3 (-) CD 56 (+)) and late-differentiated/effector memory cells (CD 4 (+) /CD 8 (+) CD 27 (-) CD 28 (-) /CD 45 RA(+)), which mobilized most with exercise, showed high intracellular thiol content (P < 0. 001). High thiol content suggests a lower oxidative load carried by these lymphocytes. Thus vigorous exercise resulted in a transient increase in lymphocyte oxidative stress.

ENZ-KIT was superior in detecting resting eHSP 70 (1. 54 [*]±[*] 3. 27 ng·mL− 1; range 0. 08 to 14. 01 ng·mL− 1), with concentrations obtained from 100 % of samples compared to 19 % with EKS- 715 assay. The ENZ-KIT requires optimisation prior to <b>running</b> <b>samples</b> {{in order to ensure}} participants fall within the standard curve, a step not required with EKS- 715.

However, {{a growing body}} of work has indicated an increasing cause of downtime may stem from transient errors in computer system hardware due to external factors, such as cosmic rays. This work indicates that moving to denser semiconductor technologies at lower voltages has the potential to increase these transient errors. In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility of commodity operating systems and applications on commodity PC processors to these soft-errors and we introduce ideas regarding the improved recovery from these transient errors in software. Our results indicate that, for the Linux kernel and a Java virtual machine <b>running</b> <b>sample</b> workloads, many errors are not activated, mostly due to overwriting. In addition, given current and upcoming microprocessor support, our results indicate that those errors activated, which would normally lead to system reboot, need not be fatal to the system if software knowledge is used for simple software recovery. Together, they indicate the benefits of simple memory soft error recovery handling in commodity processors and software.
