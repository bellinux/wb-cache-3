50|$|The Audi Pikes Peak was {{developed}} in a short five-month period after the initial conceptualization and design. The car employs several parts from fellow Volkswagen Group vehicles, {{including the use of}} the front and <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies</b> from the Touareg, as well as the air-suspension technology also taken from the Touareg and Audi’s A8. The suspension settings can be set to the driver’s preference through a four-level adjustable system.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that many organisations are facing constantly increasing complexity, a complexity that has many different causes. This paper {{is about the}} relation between product complexity and organizational complexity in manufacturing. To investigate this relation a case study has been done at Volvo Truck Corporation (VTC). For {{the purpose of the}} paper it was suitable to select one of the major parts/modules in the truck, namely the <b>rear</b> <b>axle.</b> The <b>assembly</b> of the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> starts at a system supplier, and then continuing at Volvo Trucks in a pre-assembly and ending when it is finally assembled to the chassis of the truck. The organizational complexity for the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> was studied in these three assembly stages. Our investigation shows that different kinds of product complexity have different influence and impact in the three assembly stages. It also shows that product modularity has a big potential to reduce the organizational complexity in all of these three assembly stages...|$|R
2500|$|Only 200 regular {{production}} 1965 Z16 Chevelles {{were built}} at the Kansas City plant.

50|$|At high mileages, this {{is prone}} to wear of the axle {{mounting}} bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement <b>axle</b> <b>assembly.</b> The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R
50|$|Rigid axles {{front and}} back were {{suspended}} using leaf springs. The drive shaft was enclosed in a steel tube and featured only a single universal joint, positioned just behind the gearbox. The rear wheel bearings were positioned directly on the rear axle.

50|$|The VR6 uses {{suspension}} components {{from the}} A3 model range, including the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> and {{some parts of}} the A3's 'plus' type front axle assembly. The subsequent wider front wheel-track of the Corrado VR6 necessitated the fitting of new front wings with wider wheel arches and liners along with a new front bumper assembly. Together with a new raised-style bonnet to accommodate the VR6 engine, these body improvements were carried across the model range.|$|E

40|$|PMC Harvesters Ltd is an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) for the pea {{and bean}} market. Their primary product {{line is a}} self {{propelled}} harvester known as the 979 CT harvester. The 979 CT is of considerable proportions being 4 m x 4 m x 12 m in overall dimensions, six wheel drive and weighs 29, 620 kg GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) when fully laden. The aim of this work was to identify and outline possible solutions for the support system (tyre or track and undercarriage), quantify the performance of each system, produce a design and evaluation method to determine an optimal structural specification and to produce a design recommendation for the application. Analysis of the current 979 CT harvester wheel configuration highlighted many constraining factors in tyre choice. The most pertinent of these was that the wheels have a very limited operating space and following {{a study of the}} possible tyre options it became apparent only two manufactures, Michelin and Trelleborg, could provide tyres which met the vehicle parameters. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of the three chosen tyre options. From the findings of these tests {{it was clear that the}} optimal tyre for the PMC configuration was the Trelleborg Twin Radial tyre, operating at minimum road inflation pressure (1. 6 bar) as designated by Trelleborg. When operating the harvester in its normal working environment the tyre pressure should be set at minimum road inflation for in-field conditions with a DBD (Dry Bulk Density) of > 1. 3 g/cm 3, as excess damage caused by operating above minimum field operating pressure is superficial. The use of low compaction equipment such as CTIS (Central Tyre Inflation System) or tracks would not be beneficial to the PMC application. The track tested created a hardened track pan, thus requiring more effort to rectify post harvest. A CTIS increases the consumption of diesel and offered no reduction in soil compaction below plough depth as shown by the findings from operating the optimal tyre at minimum field inflation pressure (1. 2 bar). The primary objective of this project was to offer solutions to reduce the effects of the PMC harvester’s weight on its operating medium. The first natural step was to assess the vehicles main structure in order to improve its performance to weight ratio. The initial phase of this process was to validate the modelling and analyses techniques used to assess the structure. This was done within a controlled test environment at CU@S and from this work a factor of safety of 10 % was designated to be applied to all analysis in order to authenticate results and generate a “worst case” answer. Revisions of the main chassis, main pivot and <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies</b> were created and analysed. Test metrics were defined which represented operating patterns of the harvester. The findings from these tests saw a 22. 6 % weight reduction, 43. 1 % increase in life expectancy and 10. 2 % reduction in peak stress in the main chassis and main pivot. Unlike the other two key <b>assemblies,</b> the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> was deemed fit for purpose and would not benefit from any further design changes...|$|R
40|$|Differential is {{used when}} a vehicle takes a turn, the outer wheel on a longer radius than the inner wheel. The outer wheel turns {{faster than the}} inner wheel that is {{when there is a}} {{relative}} movement between the two rear wheels. If the two rear wheels are rigidly fixed to a <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> the inner wheel will slip which cause rapid tire wear, steering difficulties and poor load holding. Differential is a part of inner <b>axle</b> housing <b>assembly,</b> which includes the differential <b>rear</b> <b>axles,</b> wheels and bearings. The differential consists of a system of gears arranged {{in such a way that}} connects the propeller shaft with the <b>rear</b> <b>axles.</b> The analysis is conducted to verify the best material for the gears in the gear box at higher speeds by analyzing stress, displacement and also by considering weight reduction.

5000|$|The {{four-wheel drive}} system {{used in the}} Passat Variant Syncro shared the {{mechanics}} of the Audi 80 quattro rather than the Volkswagen Golf Syncro. When first shown, at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show, the car was meant to be called the [...] "Passat Tetra". The Syncro's bottomplate was almost entirely different, requiring a transmission tunnel, a relocated gas tank, and no spare tire well (to make room for the complex <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> <b>assembly).</b> Unlike the related Audi 80 quattro which used a reversed front wheel setup, the rear-axle was an adapted Volkswagen Transporter unit so as to retain a flat loading floor. Only the more popular estate was deemed worthy of reengineering, so as to not offer direct competition with the sedan-only Audi 80 quattro. Syncro was also available in the North American market, only with the five-cylinder engine.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{improvements}} in load handling {{can be made}} to light trucks with the application of a tandem rear suspension. Most current concepts involve two complete <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies</b> with all the associated drive components.

This research effort resulted in a preliminary design for a drive box that will allow the driver to disengage the <b>rear</b> most <b>axle</b> when extra traction is not required. By disengaging part of the drive-line, there is an increase in system efficiency versus the current methods. The resulting design is mechanically sound, but as will be discussed, may not be an economically and weight feasible idea...|$|R
