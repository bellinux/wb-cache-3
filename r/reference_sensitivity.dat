Intracranial CT angiography was performed in 73 consecutive patients with nontraumatic SAH diagnosed at nonenhanced CT. Image quality was evaluated by two observers using two criteria: degree of arterial enhancement and venous contamination. The two independent readers evaluated diagnostic performance (lesion detection and correct therapeutic decision-making process) by using rotational angiographic findings as the standard of <b>reference.</b> <b>Sensitivity,</b> specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for patients who underwent CT angiography and three-dimensional rotational angiography.

METHODS: 134 patients with systemic reactions after a yellow jacket wasp and/or honey bee sting and 44 healthy controls underwent skin tests, as well as determination of sIgE (CAP-FEIA), leukocyte sulfidoleukotriene release (CAST-ELISA) and basophil CD 63 expression (Flow-CAST) upon insect venom stimulation. The clinical diagnosis based on the history alone served as <b>reference.</b> <b>Sensitivity,</b> specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of all methods were compared. Concordance and correlations among methods were calculated. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of all in vitro tests were consistently high. The combination of all tests (skin tests, sIgE, combined cellular assays) yielded a positive predictive value of 100 % for both venoms, if all 3 were positive, and a negative predictive value of 100 %, if at least 1 test was positive. Relative specificities were considerably higher for the cellular assays (honey bee: CAST 91. 1 %, Flow-CAST 85. 7 %; yellow jacket wasp: CAST 98. 4 %, Flow-CAST 92. 1 %) and allow the detection of the culprit insect in patients with reactivity to both insects. The concordance between methods was good. There is no correlation between severity of clinical reaction and cellular assays.

The inclusion was consecutive {{and based on the}} availability of the electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring equipment. Patients were included irrespective of pupil size, pupil reaction, or level of consciousness as long as their first measured cerebral perfusion pressure was > 10 mm Hg. The patients were treated in a protocol-guided manner with an ICP-targeted treatment based on the Lund concept. The patients were continuously sedated with midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, or thiopental, or combinations thereof. Five-lead continuous EEG monitoring was performed with the electrodes at F 3, F 4, P 3, P 4, and a midline <b>reference.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> was set at 100 muV per cm and filter settings 0. 5 - 70 Hz.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} articular cartilage lesions in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome and to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography in detecting such cartilage abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR arthrographic images obtained in 52 consecutive patients (mean age, 45. 8 years; age range, 17 - 73 years; 26 male and 26 female patients) were retrospectively evaluated for glenohumeral cartilage lesions. Two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists who were blinded to the arthroscopy report independently analyzed the articular cartilage. Humeral and glenoidal cartilage were assessed separately. The lesions were graded as either subtle or marked. Arthroscopic findings were the standard of <b>reference.</b> <b>Sensitivity,</b> specificity, accuracy, and interobserver agreement were calculated. RESULTS: At arthroscopy, humeral cartilage lesions were found in 15 patients (frequency, 29 %). Four lesions were subtle, and 11 were marked. Cartilage lesions of the glenoid were less frequent (eight patients; frequency, 15 %) : Three were subtle, and five were marked. For reader 1 and reader 2, respectively, sensitivity of MR arthrography for humeral cartilage lesions was 53 % and 100 %, specificity was 87 % and 51 %, and accuracy was 77 % and 65 %; sensitivity for glenoidal cartilage lesions was 75 % and 75 %, specificity was 66 % and 63 %, and accuracy was 67 % and 65 %.

H 28 and PG were fully concordant at the genotypic level on 228 (73. 8 %) out of 309 samples: 27 HPV negative and 201 HPV positive. The 201 fully concordant positive samples corresponded to single infections (n = 145) and to multiple infections (2 genotypes, n = 38; 3 to 5 genotypes, n = 18). The remaining 81 samples (26. 2 %) were either partially concordant (n = 64, 20. 7 %) or fully discordant (n = 17, 5. 5 %).

Considering H 28 as a <b>reference,</b> the <b>sensitivity</b> and specificity of PG were 83. 8 % and 99. 6 %, respectively. H 28 is a very sensitive and specific HPV genotyping assay suitable for research and clinical use {{as an adjunct to}} a clinically validated test. H 28 semiquantitative readout ought to be evaluated for primary cervical cancer screening...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Proton beam {{therapy is}} a {{commonly}} accepted treatment for intraocular melanomas, but {{the literature is}} lacking in descriptions of patient preferences of clinical outcomes and economic impact. In addition, no economic evaluations have been published regarding the incremen-tal cost-effectiveness of proton beam therapy compared with enucleation or plaque brachy-therapy, typical alternative treatments. We, therefore, conducted a cost-utility analysis of these three approaches {{for the treatment of}} intraocular melanomas. Materials and Methods AMarkov model was constructed. Model parameters were identified from the published lit-erature and publicly available data sources. Cost-effectiveness of each treatment was cal-culated in 2011 US Dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated assuming enucleation as <b>reference.</b> One-way <b>sensitivity</b> analyses were conducted on all model parameters. A decision threshold of $ 50, 000 /quality-adjusted life-year was used to determine cost-effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Diagnostic {{sensitivity}} of bone histomorphometry was assessed in different metabolic bone diseases, after fixing the specificity at 75 %, 90 % and 95 % <b>reference</b> levels. <b>Sensitivity</b> was particularly high in cases with greatly increased osteoid and/or resorption features, as in renal osteodystrophy (ROD). All the remodeling indicators were highly sensitive toward advanced or severe forms of mixed ROD (mROD). Osteoid indicators {{were the most}} sensitive parameters in ROD with predominant osteomalacia (oROD). Osteoclastic and several osteoid indicators were very sensitive in all grades of ROD with predominant hyperparathyroidism (hROD). Sensitivity was generally low in uremic patients without bone changes (wROD) and also in patients with idiopathic osteoporosis (OP). It is our recommendation, however, that for each individual patient the definite diagnosis {{should be based on}} both morphological, clinical and metabolic parameters...|$|R
