5|$|Alt Clut (named {{after the}} Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, the Medieval {{capital of the}} Strathclyde region) may have had its origins with the Damnonii people of Ptolemy's Geographia. Two kings are known from near {{contemporary}} sources in this early period. The first is Coroticus or Ceretic (Ceredig), known as the <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> letter from Saint Patrick, and stated by a 7th-century biographer to have been king of the Height of the Clyde, Dumbarton Rock, placing him {{in the second half}} of the 5th century. From Patrick's letter it is clear that Ceretic was a Christian, and it is likely that the ruling class of the area were also Christians, at least in name. His descendant Rhydderch Hael is named in Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert was the <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{long letter}} from Boniface who {{complained about the}} lax morals of the clergy in the British Isles, and too much {{drinking}} of alcohol by the Anglo-Saxon bishops. Cuthbert also sent letters to Lull who was Archbishop of Mainz and a native of England. During Cuthbert's time as archbishop he no longer claimed authority over all of Britain, like his predecessor Theodore. Pope Gregory III in 735 had sent a pallium to the bishop of York, raising the see of York {{to the status of}} an archbishopric. As a sign of the enhanced status of York, Cuthbert only consecrated bishops south of the Humber and his synods were attended only by bishops from the south of England.|$|E

Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able {{to zero in on}} him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E

5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus (died 24 April 624) was {{the first}} Bishop of London in the Saxon period, the third Archbishop of Canterbury, {{and a member of}} the Gregorian mission sent to England to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity. He arrived in 601 AD with a group of clergy sent to augment the mission, and was consecrated as Bishop of London in 604. Mellitus was the <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> famous letter from Pope Gregory I known as the Epistola ad Mellitum, {{preserved}} in a later work by the medieval chronicler Bede, which suggested the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons be undertaken gradually, integrating pagan rituals and customs. In 610, Mellitus returned to Italy to attend a council of bishops, and returned to England bearing papal letters to some of the missionaries.|$|E

5|$|The first {{successful}} heart transplantation {{was performed in}} 1967 by the South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. This marked an important milestone in cardiac surgery, capturing the attention of both the medical profession and the world at large. However, long-term survival rates of patients were initially very low. Louis Washkansky, the first <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> donated heart, died 18 days after the operation while other patients did not survive {{for more than a}} few weeks. The American surgeon Norman Shumway has been credited for his efforts to improve transplantation techniques, along with pioneers Richard Lower, Vladimir Demikhov and Adrian Kantrowitz. As of March 2000, more than 55,000 heart transplantations have been performed worldwide.|$|E
