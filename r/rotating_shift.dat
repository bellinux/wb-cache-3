50|$|Though {{shift work}} itself remains {{necessary}} in many occupations, employers can alleviate {{some of the}} negative health consequences of shift work. The United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends employers avoid quick shift changes and any <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> schedules should rotate forward. Employers should also attempt to minimize the number of consecutive night shifts, long work shifts and overtime work. A poor work environment can exacerbate the strain of shift work. Adequate lighting, clean air, proper heat and air conditioning, and reduced noise can all make shift work more bearable for workers.|$|E

40|$|Aim and objective. To {{assess the}} {{association}} between work in a <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> schedule and menstruation characteristics among nurse staff in a prospective study. Background. Rotating shifts {{have been linked to}} alterations in the reproductive cycle. In the case of menstrual alterations, the conclusions are not clear. Design. Prospective epidemiological study with follow-up over four months. Method. All the female nurse staff (< 40 years) in a hospital were interviewed, collecting sociodemographic and employment information. They were given a menstrual diary to keep a record of their shifts and characteristics of their menstruation (duration, amount of blood, dysmenorrhoea). They had two types of shifts: (1) <b>Rotating</b> <b>shift</b> schedule (two mornings, two afternoons, one night and two days off) including morning shifts (8 : 00 – 15 : 00), afternoon/evening shifts (15 : 00 – 22 : 00) and night shifts (22 : 00 – 8 : 00), and (2) Day shift schedule including morning shifts (8 : 00 – 15 : 00) and/or afternoon/evening shifts (15 : 00 – 22 : 00). The crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95 % confidence interval were calculated using logistic generalised estimating equations (GEE) taking into account the correlations of multiple cycles per worker. Results. One hundred and thirteen workers on the <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> and 75 on the day shift participated, and information from 730 menstrual cycles were obtained. There were no differences in prolonged duration, dysmenorrhoea, prolonged duration dysmenorrhoea and excessive bleeding among nurses on <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> compared to those on the day shift. For prolonged duration of menstruation, workers with more than five years on the <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> showed a slightly lower (nonsignificant) risk compared with those with < 5 years. Conclusions. Nurse staff on the <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> did not show increased risk of having menstrual disorders comparing with day staff. Relevance to clinical practice. Shifts with short rotation cycles and a progressive sequence do not appear to cause menstrual disorders in nurse staff who work rotating shifts...|$|E
40|$|Background Several {{studies have}} {{documented}} on the elevated cardiovascular risk among shift workers. In order to further explore this relation, we aimed at assessing {{the association between}} <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> work and the incidence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods In this population-based prospective study, 1529 employees from several large Belgian companies were followed for a median observation period of 6. 6 years {{with respect to the}} onset of the MetS and its separate components. Results At baseline, 309 men (20. 2 %) were <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> workers. The MetS incidence rate in these shift workers (60. 6 per 1000 person-years) was increased in comparison with day workers (37. 2 per 1000 person-years) with an odds ratio (95 % CI) of 1. 77 (1. 34 – 2. 32). Multivariate adjustment for potential lifestyle and work-related confounders did only marginally affect the strength of the association.

Measurement included exposure variables: <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> work and night-only shift work; outcome variables: overweight and obesity; and potential confounding and associated variables: modifiable lifestyle factors, general health status, menopausal status, and work pattern. Results: Among the 2086 participants, almost 60 % were overweight/obese (31. 7 % overweight; 27. 1 % obese).

40|$|Objectives Shift {{work that}} {{involves}} circadian disruption {{has been associated}} with a higher cancer risk. Most epidemiological studies to date have focused on breast cancer risk and evidence for other common tumors is limited. We evaluated the risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) in relation to shift work history in a population-based case-control study in Spain. Methods This analysis included 1626 incident CRC cases and 3378 randomly selected population controls of both sexes, enrolled in 11 regions of Spain. Sociodemographic and lifestyle information was assessed in face-to-face interviews. Shift work was assessed in detail throughout lifetime occupational history. We estimated the risk of colon and rectal cancer associated with rotating and permanent shift work (ever, cumulative duration, age of first exposure) using unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. Results Having ever performed <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> work (morning, evening and/or night) was associated with an increased risk for CRC [odds ratio (OR) 1. 22, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 04 - 1. 43], as compared to day workers. Having ever worked permanent night shifts (? 3 nights/month) was not associated with CRC risk (OR 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 62 - 1. 00). OR increased with increasing lifetime cumulative duration of <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> work (P-value for trend 0. 005) and were highest among subjects in the top quartiles of exposure (3 rdquartile, 20 - 34 years, OR 1. 38, 95 %CI 1. 06 - 1. 81; 4 thquartile, ? 35 years, OR 1. 36, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 79).

40|$|Introduction: While {{some studies}} have {{suggested}} associations between shift work and obesity, few have been population-based or considered multiple shift schedules. Since obesity is linked with several chronic health conditions, understanding which types of shift work influence obesity is important and additional work with more detailed exposure assessment of shift work is warranted. Methods: Using multivariate polytomous logistic regression, we investigated the associations between shift work (evening/night, rotating and other shift schedules) and overweight and obesity as measured by body mass index cross-sectionally among 1561 men. These men had previously participated as population controls in a prostate cancer case-control study conducted in northeastern Ontario from 1995 to 1999. We obtained information on work history (including shift work), height and weight from the existing self-reported questionnaire data. Results: We observed an association for ever (vs. never) having been employed in <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> work for both the overweight (OR [odds ratio] = 1. 34; 95 % CI [confidence interval]: 1. 05 – 1. 73) and obese (OR = 1. 57; 95 % CI: 1. 12 – 2. 21) groups. We also observed nonsignificant associations for ever (vs. never) having been employed in permanent evening/night shifts. In addition, we found a significant trend of increased risk for both overweight and obesity with increasing duration of <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> work. Conclusion: Both the positive association between <b>rotating</b> <b>shift</b> work and obesity and the suggested positive association for permanent evening/night shift work {{in this study are}} consistent with previous findings. Future population-based research that is able to build on our results while examining additional shift work characteristics will further clarify whether some shift patterns have a greater impact on obesity than others...|$|E
