40|$|Abstract. When {{the frame}} <b>shield</b> <b>support</b> was {{applied in the}} fully {{mechanized}} driving process of the seam gateway, {{there would be some}} incongruous problems. Aimed at the problems, mainly was discordance between the fully mechanized driving and the gateway support, we put forward the requirements of the multi-function platform and made the design scheme clear. By applying the finite element software, the simulation of the dynamics response was conducted on the multi-function platform. On this basis, an analysis was conducted on the stress of each loading part, the simulation results and mechanics calculations have shown the design of the multifunction platform could fully meet each technical index. The on-site applications have revealed that the platforms match with the fully mechanized driving machinery rationally; provide a safety standing basis for the construction of the frame <b>shield</b> <b>support.</b> Further, the platform has improved the mechanization of the frame <b>shield</b> <b>support</b> and increased the support operation efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a study that}} examined load transfer mechanics in longwall <b>shield</b> <b>supports</b> {{as part of the}} Bureau of Mines research program to optimize support design and utilization. The objectives of this study were to determine the contribution of the leg cylinders and the caving shield-lemniscate assembly towards full shield vertical and hor-izontal load resistance capability and to determine how the interaction of these members affect overall shield response. Load-displacement characteristics of the leg cylinders and the caving shield-lemniscate assembly, independent of the full shield, were evaluated from controlled displacement tests in the Bureau's mine roof simulator and responses were compared with full shield responses to identify load transfer mechanics. It is concluded from this research that the participation of the caving shield-lemniscate assembly significantly affects the response of the <b>shield</b> <b>support.</b> It is likely that the caving shield-lemniscate assembly is not participating fully in current shield designs because of translational freedom in the numerous pin joints. It is also concluded that the shield will respond differently to different boundary condi-tions resulting from interaction with the strata. This report describes load transfer mechanics of <b>shield</b> <b>supports</b> and the implication of these research findings on shield design and utilization...|$|R

50|$|The blade was {{sharpened}} only on {{the inside}} and was reputed to be devastatingly effective. However, it left its user vulnerable because, being a two-handed weapon, the warrior could not also make use of a shield. It may be imagined that the length of the two-handed falx allowed it to be wielded with great force, the point piercing helmets and the blade splitting shields - it was said to be capable of splitting a shield in two at a single blow. Alternatively, it might be used as a hook, pulling away shields and cutting at vulnerable limbs, or striking the edge of a strong shield. The inward curving point was still able to pierce the armour or flesh of the target behind the shield, rendering even the most <b>reinforced</b> <b>shields</b> much less effective defensively against a falx wielder.|$|R
40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the Bureau of Mines geomechanics research program {{is to develop a}} better understanding of support behavior and interaction of supports with the strata so that supports can be more closely engineered to the geological conditions in which they are employed. Four longwall <b>shield</b> <b>supports</b> were instrumented with an eight-transducer instrumentation array to measure leg, canopy capsule, and compression lemniscate link forces from which resultant shield loading was determined. The instrumented supports were monitored over a 4 -month period, producing over 75 shield cycles of resultant shield loading. Resultant loading is the true measure of support resistance, providing both roof-to-floor and face-to-waste support reactions as well as the location of the reaction on the shield canopy. Observed roof support reactions were analyzed, with particular emphasis on horizontal shield loading, since it is the least understood design parameter. Average, peak, and change in shield loading during the mining cycle are discussed. Correlations among data parameters are examined, as is the distribution of support loading at the headgate and midface. Conclusions are drawn as to the effectiveness of the <b>shield</b> <b>support</b> at this installation. Recommendations are made for further research needs...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{longwall}} mining can largely {{be traced to}} the development of powered roof support systems. The most significant improvement in powered support design has been the <b>shield</b> <b>support,</b> which improved kinematic stability and promoted the application of longwall mining in difficult-to- control caving conditions where chock and frame supports were inadequate. The most obvious trend in shield design has been an increase in shield size and capacity. This U. S. Bureau of Mines report examines shield design and operation practices and their consequences for the utilization of high-capacity <b>shield</b> <b>support</b> systems. An optimization goal is to minimize support loading by selecting an active shield setting force that is compatible with strata behavior and shield loading characteristics. Shield stiffness is an important design parameter that is often overlooked. A consequence of increasing shield capacity by incorporating larger diameter leg cylinders is a proportional increase in shield stiffness. Setting forces have also increased in direct proportion to the increase in shield capacity. The increased stiffness and higher setting force cause the available capacity to be consumed more quickly, severely limiting the ability of high-capacity supports to last longer and provide reserve capacity for difficult mining conditions...|$|R
40|$|This Bureau of Mines report investigates shield {{mechanics}} {{by describing}} the elastic response and interaction of shield components to applied {{vertical and horizontal}} displacements for various canopy and base contact configurations. This research provides information on generalized shield mechanics, which is applicable in describing the behavior of all two-leg <b>shield</b> <b>supports.</b> Utilizing mechanics of materials concepts and known kinematic relationships for two-leg <b>shield</b> <b>supports,</b> free-body diagrams are constructed for each shield component illustrating internal axial, shear, and bending moment responses required to maintain equilibrium for each load case evaluated. Predicted shield (component) responses are verified by controlled displacement of instrumented longwall shields in the Bureau's mine roof simulator (MRS). Conclusions drawn from these analyses include shield structural responses are significantly dependent upon canopy and base contact configurations. Applied displacements also significantly affect shield responses. Horizontal displacement produces different responses than those produced by vertical displacements. The direction of horizontal displacement is also significant in evaluating shield response. Applications of shield mechanics to in situ support monitoring are also discussed. An objective of this research program is to establish unique shield responses to identify in situ load conditions...|$|R

40|$|Advancements {{in support}} {{technology}} {{have occurred to}} a large extent because of the demands of the mine operators. <b>Shield</b> <b>supports</b> are no exception. The most notable changes in shield technology in the past decade have been increases in shield capacity and life expectancy, which have increased by a factor of 4 and 7 respectively since the inception of the <b>shield</b> <b>support</b> 25 years ago. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to set goals for the future generations of longwall shields. These goals include: (1) 100, 000 cycle life expectancy, (2) improved hydraulic diagnostic capability, (3) smart load control with adjustable setting pressure algorithms, (4) composite material design to reduce weight and increase shield width, (5) constant set leg cylinder design, (6) improved joint design to reduce wear and stress, (7) advancements in leg cylinder socket design, and (8) an instrumented shield to measure in-service structural component loading. These design issues will continue to push the envelope in longwall shield technology that has provided the safest and most productive mining system employed in the history of mining. In preparation for this, a historical examination of shield failures is made and recent trends in shield design are evaluated. Design practices to improve structural margins of current designs are also addressed...|$|R

The underground observations have been correlated to Rock Mass Classification, to stress calculations and to the angle between the direction of the fissures and the direction of longwall mining. The analysis work yielded the following two sets of results: 1. There is a critical distance between the canopy tip and the coal face Tip to Face (TFcrit). The TFcrit is predictable and relates to: • the thickness of the first roof layer and • its uniaxial compressive strength. The face support should have a Tip to Face (TF) that is less than the TFcrit in every underground longwall situation. Exceeding the TFcrit can immediately result in a roof fall. 2.
