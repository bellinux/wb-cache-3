5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the mismanagement behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> company’s reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E
5|$|Crucible {{steel is}} steel {{that has been}} melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} British politics, the {{declaration}} <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coming into power of Lloyd George and his Cabinet, which {{had replaced the}} H. H.

5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird's mimicry {{is likely}} {{to serve as a}} form of sexual selection through which competition between males and female choice influence a bird's song repertoire size. A 2013 study attempted to determine model selection in vocal mimics, and the data suggested that mimicry in the mockingbird <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bird being genetically predisposed to learning vocalizations with acoustic characteristics such as an enlarged auditory template.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, {{like those of}} Uranus, {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, like those of Uranus, Neptune's rings probably <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E

5000|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> {{point of}} view of animal and plant breeders, there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a species, such as between {{different}} breeds.Single cross hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cross between two true-breeding organisms which produces an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.Double cross hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cross between two different F1 hybrids (i.e., there are four unrelated grandparents).Three-way cross hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cross between an F1 hybrid and an inbred line.Triple cross hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crossing of two different three-way cross hybrids.Top cross (or [...] "topcross") hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crossing of a top quality or pure-bred male and a lower quality female, intended {{to improve the quality of}} the offspring, on average.|$|R
