40|$|In {{this paper}} the biomechanical {{interaction}} between osseointegrated dental implants and bone is investigated by numerical simulations. The influence of some mechanical and geometrical parameters on bone stress distributions is highlighted and some risk-measures relevant to critical overloading are furnished. Load transfer mechanisms of several dental implants are analyzed {{by means of}} linearly elastic finite-element analyses, when static functional loads occur. For a given implant the variation of its performance with the placement is investigated, considering insertions both in mandibular and maxillary molar segments. The mechanical properties of the bone regions (cortical and cancellous) are approximated with those of a type II bone and the geometry of crestal bone loss after an healing period is modelled. Five commercially-available dental implants are analyzed, demonstrating as the optimal choice of an endosseous implant is strongly affected {{by a number of}} shape parameters as well as by anatomy and mechanical properties of the site of placement. Numerical results clearly proof as a given implant device exhibits very different performance on mandibular or maxillary bone segments, resulting in higher compressive stresses when maxillary placement is experienced. Finally, the effectiveness of several multiple-implant restorative applications is investigated. The first one is related to a partially edentulous arch restoration, based on a double-implant device involving a <b>retaining</b> <b>bar.</b> Other applications regard single-tooth restorations based on non-conventional devices consisting in a mini-bar supported by two mini endosteal implants, possibly reproducing the natural roots orientation of a multiple-root tooth...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) is slowly conquering its {{space in the}} manufacturing industry for dimensional metrology and quality control purposes. The main advantage is its non-invasive and non-destructive character. Currently, CT is the only measurement technique that allows full 3 D visualization of both inner and outer features of an object through a contactless probing system. Using hundreds of radiographs, acquired while rotating the object, a 3 D representation is generated and dimensions can be verified. In this research, this non-contact technique {{was used for the}} inspection of assembled components. A dental cast model with 8 implants, connected by a screwed <b>retained</b> <b>bar</b> made of titanium. The <b>retained</b> <b>bar</b> includes a mating interface connection that should ensure a perfect fitting without residual stresses when the connection is fixed with screws. CT was used to inspect the mating interfaces between these two components. Gaps at the connections can lead to bacterial growth and potential inconvenience for the patient who would have to face a new surgery to replace his/hers prosthesis. With the aid of CT, flaws in the design or manufacturing process that could lead to gaps at the connections could be assessed. status: publishe...|$|R

The black cap extends below the eye, usually separated from it by a white crescent, and the rear edge of the cap is neatly defined.

50|$|In October 1847, the {{congregation}} relocated {{to a former}} Methodist church at 56 Chrystie Street. The congregation commissioned architect Leopold Eidlitz to draw up plans for renovation of the church into a synagogue. Radical departures from Orthodox religious practice were soon introduced to Temple Emanu-El, setting precedents which proclaimed the principles of 'classical' Reform Judaism in America. In 1848, the German vernacular spoken by the congregants replaced the traditional liturgical language of Hebrew in prayer books. Instrumental music, formerly banished from synagogues, was first played during services in 1849, when an organ was installed. In 1853, the tradition of calling congregants for aliyot was abolished (but <b>retained</b> for <b>bar</b> mitzvah ceremonies), leaving {{the reading of the}} Torah exclusively to the presiding rabbi. By 1869 the Chrystie Street building became the home of Congregation Beth Israel Bikur Cholim.|$|R

New product launches fell off significantly in the following years, as did interest in the high-protein diet fad.

A variant of these revenue-sharing arrangements occurs in cases where the bar also gives the band a share of the bar's alcohol sales receipts.

METHODS: Two 3 D finite element models were constructed, that models components were modeled on commercial CAD/CAM software then assembled into finite element package. Vertical loads were applied simulating the masticatory forces unilaterally in the resected site and bilaterally in the central fossa of the lower first molar as 100 N (tension and compression). Analysis {{was based on the}} assumption full osseointegration between different types of bones, and between implants and fibula while fixing the top surface of the TMJ in place. RESULTS: The metallic bar connecting the three implants is insensitive to the clips material. Its supporting implants showed typical behavior with maximum stress values at the neck region. Fibula and jaw bone showed stresses within physiologic, while clips material effect seems to be very small due to its relatively small size. CONCLUSION: Switching loading force direction from tensile to compression did-not change the stresses and deformations distribution, but reversed their sign from positive to negative...|$|R

Plots of the molar absorption intensity against molar concentration are observed to be located on a single curve irrespective of the temperature.
