40|$|ABSTRACT-A <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the humoral immune response of baboons (Papio cyno-cephalus) to their endogenous, xenotropic, type C (M 7) virus. Using 1251 or [3 H]leucine-labeled intact virus preparation, we dem-onstrated that baboons possess naturally occurring virus-binding antibodies to this virus. Antibody appeared directed against en-velope and not internal viral proteins. Immunoglobulins responsi-ble for virus-binding were predominant in the IgG and IgA serum fractions, whereas IgM participated to a minor degree. The bio-logic activities of these immunoglobulins were investigated by means of a focus reduction assay for virus neutralization with a murine sarcoma virus (M 7) pseudotype. We determined that, despite the presence of considerable virus binding, none of the normal baboon sera tested possessed neutralizing activity for M 7 virus. -J Natl Cancer Inst 57 : 561 - 565, 1976. Autogenous humoral immunity to endogenous mouse ecotropic (or as we prefer, H-tropic) and X-tropic viruses has been demonstrated (1 - 6). In addition, a recent report suggests that autogenous CMI in the form of lymphocytes cytotoxic for virus-infected cells may also be present in some mouse strains (7). This "natural " immunity has been demonstrated by radioim-mune precipitation, neutralization of the X-tropic var-iant, and, for CMI, by cell culture techniques. The existence of this immunity is surprising, for one would think that at least a partial state of "tolerance " or immu-nologic unresponsiveness should exist if these endoge-nous viruses were truly verticallv transmitted and con-sidered self-antigens. The baboon endogenous, X-tropic, type C virus was originally observed (8) in and isolated (9) from a full-term placenta. In addition, type C viruses have been observed by electron microscopy in baboon tubal ova (10). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the primate, endogenous, X-tropic virus is vertically transmitted. In this paper, a <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> is used to demonstrate that, despite exposure to overt virus replication in utero, baboons are not tolerant to their endogenous type C virus, responding with hu-moral immunity at least to virus envelope antigens...|$|E
40|$|Three linear {{antigenic}} regions on the P protein {{from human}} {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) subgroup A (strain A 2) were represented by peptides that reacted with monoclonal antibodies and with sera from humans with recent or previous RSV infection. The determinants were localized within three hydrophilic regions of the P protein: Prog ~ to AspH 0, Ser 16 ~ to LySls 0 and Glu 221 to Phe 241. The role of individual amino acids in the epitopes defined by monoclonal antibodies was determined. Two monoclonal antibodies reacting with the same antigenic site were found to detect epitopes that had different amino acid dependencies. Rabbit hyperimmune sera raised against selected peptides specifically precipitated different forms of the P protein from RSV-infected 35 S-labelled cell extracts in a <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay.</b> These findings have implications for forthcoming structural-functional studies of RSV capsid component interactions and also for serological diagnosis of RSV infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{naturally}} immune mouse sera to neutralize ecotropic AKR {{murine leukemia virus}} (MuLV) was examined by using unfrozen virus preparations harvested for 1 h. In this assay several mouse sera significantly and consistently neutralized MuLV infectivity. The ability of these sera to neutralize was correlated {{with the presence of}} antibodies against MuLV detectable in a <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> using radioactively labeled intact virions. This neutralization was specific, in that either N- or B-tropic viruses, but not Friend MuLV, were neutralized. In addition, neutralization could be abrogated with purified AKR MuLV gp 71 at concentrations that do not interfere with virus infectivity but could not be abrogated with Rauscher MuLV gp 71. Neutralizing activity could be removed by absorption with intact AKR MuLV, but not by absorption with Friend MuLV, a BALB/c xenotropic virus, or with NZB xenotropic virus. All the neutralizing activity of (B 6 C 3) F 1 mouse sera was associated with the immunoglobulin G fraction...|$|E
40|$|Normal sera from {{a variety}} of strains of inbred mice have precipitating {{antibodies}} to murine type C viruses that are detected by <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays.</b> The results demonostrate that this humoral immune response is primarily directed against the AKR strain of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) proteins gp 71, gp 43, and p 15 (E). These sera also react with Friend- or Rauscher-MuLV in <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays.</b> This reaction is not due to a separate immune response, but rather is primarily a consequence of the cross-reactivity of antibodies to the AKR strain of MuLV p 15 (E) with the p 15 (E) of these viruses. These data, using autogenous immune sera, emphasize the serological differences of the virion glycoproteins and the serological similarity of the p 15 (E) virion component of the viruses. Furthermore, based on the serological reactivities to the glycoproteins, the results suggest that the AKR strain of MuLV is endogenous to and expressed in mice, but that the Friend-Moloney-Rauscher virus group is not...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{were produced}} against two distinct Thai dengue- 2 (DEN- 2) virus strains isolated in 1980 from {{dengue haemorrhagic fever}} patients. Nine of 36 hybridomas produced monoclonal IgG antibodies which reacted in <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays</b> with the NS 1 non-structural protein (42000 mol. wt.) from DEN- 2 -infected C 6 / 36 (Aedes albopictus) cells. The virus specificity of NS 1 -reactive monoclonal antibodies was determined by indirect immunofluorescence assays using LLC-MK 2 cells infected with either the Thai 1980 DEN- 2 isolates, prototype DEN viruses (four serotypes), Japanese encephalitis (JE), Murray Valley encephalitis, West Nile, Wesselbron or Tembusu viruses. Eight of the monoclonal ntibody preparations were DEN- 2 -serotype specific. One preparation defined a special serological relationship between DEN- 2 and JE viruses.

40|$|The humoral immune {{responses}} of NIH Swiss and SWR/J mice immunized with formalin-inactivated AKR or Gross murine leukemia virus, respectively, were examined. Both immune sera had high titers of antibodies detectable in <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays</b> using [3 H]leucine-labeled AKR virus and in radioimmunoassays using purified virion components. The predominant antibody titers were directed against gp 71 and pl 15 (E). The immune response against gp 71 was predominantly type-specific, whereas the reactivity with pl 15 (E) was predominantly group-specific. A weak immune response against p 15 was also detected. Both sera were cytotoxic against cells replicating the AKR-Gross virus type but not against cells replicating Friend murine leukemia virus. This cytotoxicity could be specifically blocked with purified gp 71 of AKR murine leukemia virus. Sera from immune NIH Swiss mice neutralized AKR virus, {{but did not}} neutralize Rauscher, Scripps, or wild mouse leukemia virus...|$|R
40|$|The major {{envelope}} glycoprotein (gp 71) from AKR {{murine leukemia virus}} (MuLV) was purified and its serological reactivity with heterologous and autogenous immune mouse sera was examined. Homologous and interspecies competition radioimmunoassays using antisera to Rauscher-MulV gp 69 / 71 or Friend-MuLV gp 71 or antisera to feline leukemia virus to precipitate 125 I-labeled gp 71 from various MuLV showed that distinct differences exist between Rauscher- or Friend-MuLV and AKR-MuLV glycoproteins. Characteristically the AKR-MuLV gp 71, in contrast to FLV or RLV gp 71, does not compete fully in homologous or interspecies radioimmunoassays with iodinated Friend of Rauscher glycoproteins. Purified 125 I-labeled AKR-MuLV gp 71, {{in contrast to the}} Rauscher- or Friend-MuLV glycoproteins, reacts with normal (autogenous immune) mouse sera in direct radioimmune precipitation assays. Competition experiments further demonstrate that this is a predominant immunological reactivity of normal mouse sera which had previously been detected by <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> against intact virions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> using 3 H-labeled AKR leukemia {{virus was}} applied to the {{detection}} and quantitation of natural serum antibodies directed against endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV) envelope antigens B 6 C 3 F 1 and BALB/c mice, which have low natural incidences of leukemia and lymphoma, and AKR mice, which have a high incidence, were used in this study. Sera from mice of various age groups were assayed. A marked difference in age-associated levels of the autogenous immune response to endogenous murine leukemia virus was detected, and the quantitative differences among these strains were inversely related to the incidence of lymphoma. The radioimmune precipitation test as applied was 500 times more sensitive than virus neutralization. That the reactions we have observed are specific is suggested by several lines of evidence, including the nonreactivity of normal hamster and absorbed rat serum, the positive reaction of absorbed rat anti-AKR serum, the inhibition of precipitation of labeled virus by purified unlabeled virus, and isopycnic gradient analysis of the reactive products...|$|E
40|$|Variations in epitopes on {{structural}} proteins of four isolates of {{parainfluenza virus}} type 4 (PIV- 4) and the Mr ofpolypeptides in these isolates were d termined by <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> with monoclonal antibodies to parainfluenza virus type 4 A (PIV- 4 A) and type 4 B (PIV- 4 B). Three isolates antigenically resembled the prototype PIV- 4 A and {{the sizes of}} their structural proteins were 72 K (HN protein), 61 K (Fo protein), 61 K (NP protein) and 40 K (M protein). However, one virus isolate showed marked antigenic differences from both the 4 A and 4 B prototype viruses, {{particularly with regard to}} properties of the HN and F proteins. In addition, both the NP and Fo proteins of this isolate had a slightly increased Mr of 63 K. Human parainfluenza virus type 4 (PIV- 4), which belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, is an important respiratory tract pathogen in infants and children. PIV- 4 was first isolated and characterized by Johnson et al. (1960). Subsequently, antigenic heterogeneity in PIV- 4 has been observed by use of polyclonal antisera in haemadsorption inhibition tests with different strains of PIV- 4 (Chanchola et al., 1964). This finding led to a subdivision of PIV- 4 into two serotypes, 4 A and 4 B. Recently we have generated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to PIV- 4 A and PIV- 4 B and identified their structural proteins (Komada et al., 1989 a, b). Th...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{distemper}} virus attachment (hemagglutinin [H] equivalent) and fusion (F) antigens were purified by {{affinity chromatography}} with monoclonal antibodies. The purified antigens {{were used to}} immunize groups of three dogs. <b>Radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays</b> with sera from these animals showed that the F antigen preparation was pure and induced only an F polypeptide-specific antibody response but that the H antigen preparation had a slight contamination by the F antigen. Immunized animals were challenged with virulent canine distemper virus. Two animals in each group developed pronounced humoral and cellular immune responses after challenge. Among these infected animals, only the dogs immunized with H antigen developed symptoms, albeit mild. In contrast, three nonimmunized control animals developed severe disease, with a fatal outcome in two cases. The complete resistance against challenge in two dogs was interpreted to reflect in one case anti-F immunity {{and in the other}} case most likely a high level of anti-H immunity. It is suggested that the F antigen may be of particular interest for the development of morbillivirus and possibly other paramyxovirus subunit or synthetic vaccines, because it can induce immunity capable of blocking virus infection and in situations of virus replication prevent the emergence of symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The viral {{antigenic}} determinants {{recognized in}} an autogenous immune response in mice against their endogenous C-type virus {{have been identified}} by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immune precipitates between various sera and H 3 -labeled intact or disrupted AKR leukemia virus. Normal B 6 C 3 F 1 [(C 57 BL/ 6 x C 3 H/Anf) F 1] serum reacts with viral envelope antigens having mol wt of approximately 68, 000, 43, 000, and 17, 000. In addition, minor reactions with viral antigens having mol wts of approximately 19, 000 and 15, 000 are demonstrable. The 68, 000 and 43, 000 mol wt antigens can be labeled with [3 H]glucosamine and may correspond to the major viral envelope antigens M 2 and M 1, respectively. The antigens recognized by autogenous immune sera do not differ with respect to age of the animal, nor are they significantly different in sera from various strains of mice (BALB/c, C 57 BL/ 6, and C 3 H/Anf). These {{results suggest that the}} age-asociated and strain variations in the autogenous immune response, as determined by <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays</b> against intact virus, are due to quantitative and qualitative alterations of antibody levels against common antigens...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of antibodies to the nucleoprotein and matrix (M) antigens of measles virus was determined in {{early and late}} measles convalescent sera and in sera from patients with multiple sclerosis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, chronic active hepatitis, and atypical measles. Antibodies to the two components were identified separately in serially diluted samples both by <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays</b> and by complement fixation tests employing purified nucleoprotein and M components as antigens. The antibody response to M antigen in connection with acute infections was weak, and with time titers of antibodies to M antigen were reduced below detectable levels in most cases. A different situation was seen in patients with atypical measles. A pronounced antibody response to M antigen was {{shown to be a}} part of the generally accentuated immune response in these patients. Confirming results of others, it was shown that in spite of the increased antibody titers against most measles components in sera from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, no or only low titers of antibodies to M antigen were present. However, a similar representation of antibodies to measles virus components was also seen in sera from patients with active chronic hepatitis. The significance of this finding for the interpretation of a weak antibody response to M antigen in the presence of a pronounced antibody response to other components is discussed...|$|R
40|$|During {{epidemiologic}} {{surveillance of}} children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in Huntington, W. Va., we identified seven strains of a new variant subgroup A RSV (subgroup A-Var) by their reactions in an enzyme immunoassay with two anti-F monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for two epitopes, F 1 and F 4, generated against the subgroup B RSV. The prototype strain of subgroup A and all other subgroup A field strains from that epidemiologic year failed to react with these two subgroup B MAbs. Additional enzyme immunoassays with 18 subgroup B anti-F MAbs specific for 14 epitopes showed that subgroup A-Var strains also reacted with a MAb specific for the subgroup B F 2 epitope. In a <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay,</b> the molecular size of the subgroup A-Var F 2 subunit of the fusion (F) protein clearly differed from those of both prototype strains of subgroup A and subgroup B RSV. The molecular size of the F 2 subunit of subgroup A-Var (24 kDa) was intermediate between {{the size of the}} F 2 subunit of subgroup A (25 kDa) and that of subgroup B (23 kDa). However, the molecular sizes of the F 1 subunits of both subgroup A and subgroup A-Var were identical (54 kDa) and slightly larger than those of the F 1 subunits of both subgroups B 1 and B 2 (53 kDa). These data suggest that subgroup A-Var may represent a distinct RSV A subgroup, analogous to subgroup B 1 and B 2 RSV, and it is the first-identified naturally occurring subgroup A RSV with an F protein {{different from that of the}} prototype A RSV...|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that certain strains of mice characterized by a low incidence of spontaneous lymphoma produce significant levels of natural antibody specific for routine leukemia virus (MuLV) ~ (1 - 3). A <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> utilizing 3 H-labeled AKR leukemia virus (2) was used to show an age-associated modulation of the levels of this autogenous humoral immune response to endogenous MuLV. Virus-precipitating antibody levels increased as the mice developed immunologic competence and then decreased {{as a function of}} senescence. The specificity of this natural antibody for MuLV envelope antigens was demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy (3), and was also associated with the chronic development of glomerulonephritis (1, 3). Furthermore, in a population of RFM mice we have shown an inverse correlation between spontaneous lymphoid neoplasia and the severity of glomerulonephritis, which has been demonstrated in part to be caused by deposition of MuLV immune complexes (1). These data provide a basis for the consideration of host immunologic mechanisms in the control of endogenous virus burden and of leukemogenesis. Additional evidence for the significance of autogenous immunity to leukemia virus is provided {{by the fact that the}} Rgv- 1 locus, which causes resistance to leukemogenesis induced by Gross-passaged A virus in neonatal mice, may be closely associated with or identical to the Ir-i gene, which determines immune responsiveness to certain antigens (4), and thus may function in immune control of MuLV antigens (4, 5). The possibility must be considered that while the viral genome is ubiquitous in mouse cells and can be activated, and although cell susceptibility to virus infection is controlled by genetic factors (Fvl, Fv 2, etc.), an additional level of immunological control may be sginificant in preventing the intercellular spread of endogenous leukemia virus, which may play a major role in leukemogenesis. Therefore, the immunological factors that may limit endogenous virus burden should be characterized...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of each of the}} two surface glycoproteins of measles virus in active and passive immunization was examined in mice. Infected-cell lysates were depleted of either the hemagglutinin (H) or fusion (F) glycoprotein by using multiple cycles of immunoaffinity chromatography. The products were used to prepare immune-stimulating complexes (iscoms) containing either F or H glycoprotein. Such complexes are highly immunogenic, possibly as a result of effective presentation of viral proteins to the immune system [B. Morein, B. Sundquist, S. Höglund, K. Dalsgaard, and A. Osterhaus, Nature (London) 308 : 457 - 460, 1984]. Groups of 3 -week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with the iscom preparations. All animals developed hemolysis-inhibiting antibodies, whereas only sera of animals immunized with the iscoms containing the H glycoprotein had hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies. Sera from animals immunized with the H or F preparation only precipitated the homologous glycoprotein in <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays.</b> The immunized animals were challenged with a lethal dose of the hamster neurotropic variant of measles virus. Of the 7 -week-old animals in the nonimmunized control group, 50 % died within 10 days after challenge. No animals in the immunized groups showed symptoms of disease throughout the observation period of 3 months. Passive administration of anti-H monoclonal antibodies gave full protection against the 100 % lethal acute infection with the hamster neurotropic variant of measles virus in newborn mice, whereas anti-F monoclonal antibodies failed to protect the animals. This study emphasizes that both H and F glycoproteins need to be considered in the development of measles virus subunit vaccines...|$|R
40|$|The {{autogenous}} humoral {{immune response}} of mice to their endogenous leukemia virus has been examined {{in terms of the}} reactivities of individual classes of antibody present in normal B 6 C 3 F 1 serum. Whole serum and the immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG fractions of serum from animals of different age groups were compared by <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays</b> and viral infectivity neutralization assays. Both IgM and IgG fractions were able to precipitate virus, although not as effectively as whole serum. Virus-specific antibody levels, as well as total antibody concentrations in whole serum, appeared to increase with age. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis analysis was performed with immune precipitates obtained when whole serum or 19 or 7 S fractions from animals of different age groups were reacted with disrupted virus. The 19 S antibody fraction reacted with three antigenic determinants on the viral envelope. These antigens have apparent molecular weights of 17, 000, 43, 000, and 68, 000. The last two appear to be glycoproteins and may correspond to the M 2 and M 1 antigens. In contrast, the 7 S component reacted only with the 17, 000 -molecular-weight protein. Neutralization assays against BALB:virus- 2, a xenotropic endogenous mouse type C virus, revealed that 19 S and whole serum but not the 7 S fraction possessed neutralizing activity. These findings indicate that there are differential reactivities of IgM and IgG antibodies in normal serum of B 6 C 3 F 1 mice, with respect to both recognition of viral envelope antigens and neutralization of endogenous MuLV. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the autogenous {{humoral immune response}} is a systemic host function that may be important in the regulation of endogenous type C virus expression in vivo...|$|R

An arrest of further synthesis (accumulation) was observed at 10 to 11 h postinfection, coinciding {{with the onset of}} synthesis of late virion proteins. In contrast, when the infected cells were treated with 25 mug of arabinosyl cytosine per ml to block viral DNA replication, the synthesis of 75 K protein did not cease but continue for up to 36 h postinfection. The synthesis of 75 K protein in cells after release from a cycloheximide block (2 to 9 h postinfection) was analyzed. Increased amounts of early adenovirus-specific mRNA accumulate in infected cells during a cycloheximide block (Parsons and Green, 1971). However, cycloheximide treatment did not produce increased levels of 75 K protein, and an abrupt arrest of 75 K protein formation was again observed at the time of synthesis of late virion proteins. Partition of the 75 K protein between the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions during the course of infection was studied.

The heat-inactivation and WGA <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays</b> showed rela-tive recoveries of 91 - 100 % and 16 - 32 %, respectively, for skeletal ALP with complete specificity (no cross-reactivity with hepatic or intestinal ALP); the IRMA showed a rela-five recovery of 86 - 100 % and 11 - 14 % cross-reactivity with hepatic ALP. There was a closer correlation between the heat-inactivation assay and IRMA (r = 0. 833) than between the WGA <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> and IRMA (r 0. 673) or between the heat-inactivation and WGA-precip-itation assays (r = 0. 568). The WGA <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> failed to detect skeletal ALP in three serum samples that contained significant amounts {{as determined by the}} heat-inactivation assay and the IRMA.

40|$|Serum {{antibody}} against polyribosylribitol phosphate, the capsular antigen of Haemophilus influenzae type b, confers {{protection against}} experimental Haemophilus infection. Antibodies against noncapsular antigens are also protective, but the antigenic specificity of the protective antibodies remains unknown. Antilipopolysaccharide antibody was prepared by immunization of rabbits with boiled H. influenzae type b cells. Antilipopolysaccharide antibodies present in these sera did not protect against experimental Haemophilus bacteremia in infant rats. Antisera were also prepared by immunization of rabbits with live H. influenzae type b bacteria. After absorption of anticapsular and antilipopolysaccharide antibodies, these sera contained antibody to several outer membrane proteins which were accessible on the intact bacterial surface as detected by <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation.</b> These absorbed sera prevented experimental Haemophilus bacteremia in infant rats. Thus, antibodies against noncapsular, non-lipopolysaccharide determinants, possibly against {{one or more}} outer membrane proteins, confer protection against experimental H. influenzae type b disease. In contrast, antibodies against lipopolysaccharide are ineffective...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between serotype specificity and protein structure was studied by polyacrylamide g l electrophoresis, peptide mapping and <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> (RIP) of structural and non-structural proteins {{of the five}} U. S. serotypes of bluetongue virus (BTV). The surface proteins, VP 2 and VP 5, showed the most variation in size among the serotypes. Peptide mapping of the proteins howed that VP 2 is unique {{for each of the}} U. S. serotypes. The nucleocapsid and non-structural proteins howed ahigh degree of conservation, whereas the other surface protein, VP 5, showed intermediate conservation among the serotypes. Monospecific neutralizing antiserum produced in rabbits against each serotype was used in cross-RIP against cytoplasmic extracts prepared from cells infected with each BTV serotype. There were extensive cross-reactions among those proteins which showed ahigh degree of structural conservation, whereas VP 2 was immunoprecipitated best in the homologous RIP system. Thus, a correlation between serotype specificity and protein structure was shown among the five U. S. serotypes of BTV...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing a {{combination}} of preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-hydroxylapatite column chromatography, we have separated and purified the gA and gB glycoproteins of the major virus-specific glycoprotein region from herpes simplex virus type 1 -infected cells. By using purified antigen preparations, antisera specific {{to each of these}} glycoproteins were produced. Immunoprecipitation from detergent extracts of infected cells and <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> of the purified antigens have shown that the anti-gA and anti-gB sera each recognize both the gA and the gB glycoproteins. The anti-gA serum was also shown to neutralize virus despite the presence of only minute quantities of the gA glycoprotein in virions. Pulse-chase studies have indicated that the gA and gB glycoproteins are synthesized from a common precursor polypeptide. Together, these data demonstrate that the gA and gB glycoproteins of herpes simplex virus type 1 are antigenically similar but not identical and probably represent two different forms of the same polypeptide which differ in their degree of glycosylation...|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli DNA {{polymerase}} III holoenzyme 71. 1 kDa tau subunit is a 643 {{amino acid}} protein encoded by the dnaX gene. This gene also encodes the holoenzyme 56. 5 kDa gamma subunit. The tau factor (as a tau'-LacZ' fusion protein) has been isolated and {{shown to be}} cleaved in vitro to form gamma and a 135 kda C-terminal cleavage product. The tau'-LacZ' fusion protein, gamma, and the C-terminal cleavage product have been isolated. N-terminal sequencing has demonstrated that tau and gamma share the same N-terminal sequences and that tau is proteolytically cleaved in vitro between residues 498 and 499 to form gamma. In addition, residues 420 - 440 were shown {{to be present in}} both tau and gamma by use of antibody specific for a synthetic peptide corresponding to that sequence. Some mechanism functions in vivo to ensure that tau and gamma are synthesized in a ratio of about one-to-one, as shown by <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> of tau and gamma from cellular extracts...|$|R

Equal amounts of protein from the tissue lysates {{as determined by}} the BCA protein assay were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The residual binding sites on the membrane were blocked by incubating with 5 % (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST (10  mM Tris, pH 8.0; 150  mM NaCl; 0.05 % Tween 20) for 1  h at room temperature. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method, as described by Fazal et al. [19]. Polyclonal antibody to β-actin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and rabbit polyclonal antibody for BiP/GRP 78 was from Abcam. The nitrocellulose membranes were from Bio-Rad.

40|$|ABSTRACT Thrombospondin, a high {{molecular}} weight glycoprotein secreted by platelets in response to activation by thrombin, has been identified by immunofluorescence in bovine aortic endothelial cells, human foreskin fibroblasts, and human aortic smooth muscle cells. Immunofluorescence patterns {{were found to be}} similar using antisera raised to thrombospondins purified either from bovine aortic endothelial cells or from human platelets. <b>Radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> of pulse-labeled cellular proteins confirmed the presence of thrombospondin in positively stained cells. A sensitive quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed and used to determine that the accumulation of secreted thrombospondin was similar for endothelial cells and fibroblasts but was higher for smooth muscle cells. The presence of thrombospondin in a variety of cells suggests that its function may not be limited to an involvement in platelet interactions. Thrombospondin (TS), a {{high molecular}} weight glycoprotein, is released from a-granules after activation of platelets by thrombin (1, 2). After release, the protein binds to the activated platelet surface in a calcium-dependent fashion (3) and may participate in platelet-platelet interactions (4). Earlier work i...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} using vaccinia virus (VAC) recombinants containing large multigene fragments of orf virus DNA to identify protective antigens of orf virus (OV). Sixteen OV strain NZ 2 DNA fragments with an average size of 11. 4 kb were recombined into VAC strain Lister. Each fragment was mapped relative to OV restriction endonuclease maps but was otherwise uncharacterized. Together the recombinants represent 95 % of the OV genome in an overlapping manner. Immunofluorescence showed all 16 constructs expressed products recognized by OV antiserum and <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> with the same antiserum allowed the localization of the major antigens of OV to specific recombinants. These data indicated the approximate genomic locations of the genes encoding the OV major antigens and showed that their expression was authentic rather than resulting from read through from VAC sequences adjacent {{to the site of}} recombination. Vaccination of OV-naive sheep with the recombinant library provided protection against a subsequent challenge with virulent OV. These data confirm the feasibility of the proposed strategy...|$|R
40|$|The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation {{produces}} most of {{the yellow}} fever (YF) vaccine prepared world wide. As {{part of a broader}} approach to determine the genetic variability in YF l 7 D seeds and vaccines and its relevance to viral attenuation the 17 DD virus was purifed directly from chick embryo homogenates which is the source of virus used for vaccination of millions of people in Brazil and other countries for half a century. Neutralization and hemagglutination tests showed that the purified virus is similar to the original stock. Furthermore, <b>radioimmune</b> <b>precipitation</b> of 35 S-methionine-labeled viral proteins using mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluid revealed identical patterns for the purified 17 DD virus and the YF l 7 D- 204 strain except for the 17 DD E protein which migrated slower on SDS-PAGE. This difference is likely to be due to N-linked glycosylation. Finally, comparison by northern blot nybridization of virion RNAs of purified 17 DD with two other strains of YF virus only fenome-sized molecules for all three viruses. These observations suggest that vaccine phenotype is primarily associated with the accumulation of mutations...|$|R
