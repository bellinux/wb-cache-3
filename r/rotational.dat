5|$|<b>Rotational</b> motions move a {{structure}} in a <b>rotational</b> motion along a longitudinal axis, such as turning {{the head to}} look to either side.|$|E
5|$|Some {{states of}} matter exhibit {{symmetry}} breaking, where the relevant {{laws of physics}} possess some symmetry that is broken. A common example is crystalline solids, which break continuous translational symmetry. Other examples include magnetized ferromagnets, which break <b>rotational</b> symmetry, and more exotic states such as the ground state of a BCS superconductor, that breaks U(1) phase <b>rotational</b> symmetry.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rotational</b> {{period of}} each star can be {{measured}} by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute <b>rotational</b> velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial <b>rotational</b> velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected <b>rotational</b> velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. <b>Rotational</b> braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E
5|$|A Sudoku with 24 clues, {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° <b>rotational</b> symmetry, 180° <b>rotational</b> symmetry, and diagonal symmetry) {{is known}} to exist, and is also automorphic. Again here, {{it is not known}} if this number of clues is minimal for this class of Sudoku. The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry is believed to be 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rotational</b> {{transitions}} {{of various}} isotopic forms {{of carbon monoxide}} (for example, CO, CO, and CO) are detectable in the submillimeter wavelength range, and {{are used in the}} study of newly forming stars in molecular clouds.|$|E
5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. <b>Rotational</b> symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and <b>rotational</b> symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E
5|$|The {{midpoint}} of the eclipse being {{very close to the}} earth's equator, where the <b>rotational</b> velocity is greatest.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rotational</b> {{velocity}} of Beta Pictoris has been measured {{to be at}} least 130km/s. Since this value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true <b>rotational</b> velocity: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's axis of rotation to the line-of-sight. If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).|$|E
5|$|The tidal {{effect of}} the planets is weak and does not {{significantly}} affect {{the shape of the}} Sun. The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the <b>rotational</b> period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent <b>rotational</b> period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.|$|E
5|$|The type, direction, intensity, and {{duration}} of forces all contribute to the characteristics and severity TBI. Forces that may contribute to TBI include angular, <b>rotational,</b> shear, and translational forces.|$|E
5|$|Tidal heating occurs {{through the}} tidal {{friction}} and tidal flexing processes caused by tidal acceleration: orbital and <b>rotational</b> energy are dissipated as {{heat in the}} core of the moon, the internal ocean, and the ice crust.|$|E
5|$|When Backer et al. {{reported}} their finding in November 1982, {{they found that}} the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as the energy that they emit is ultimately drawn from the <b>rotational</b> energy of the pulsar. Using the initially observed values for the period and spin down rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the maximum age for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the <b>rotational</b> period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of the pulsar are equal. The value of the minimum <b>rotational</b> period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with different models giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 kilohertz. There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep the pulsar from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster.|$|E
5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold <b>rotational</b> symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a <b>rotational</b> centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E
5|$|Big Bang lattice model, {{states that}} the {{universe}} {{at the moment of}} the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of fermions, which is smeared over the fundamental domain so it has <b>rotational,</b> translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.|$|E
5|$|He {{articulated}} {{the principle of}} relativity. This was understood by Hermann Minkowski to be a generalization of <b>rotational</b> invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence, general covariance and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two examples, notice that if the Sudoku is rotated 180 degrees, and the clues relabeled with the {{permutation}} (123456789) -> (987654321), it returns to the same Sudoku. Expressed another way, these Sudokus have the property that every 180 degree <b>rotational</b> pair of clues (a, b) follows the rule (a) + (b) = 10.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the first}} {{discovered}} millisecond pulsar, with a <b>rotational</b> period of 1.557708 milliseconds, meaning it completes almost 642 rotations per second. This period was far shorter than astronomers considered pulsars capable of reaching, {{and led to the}} suggestion that pulsars can be spun-up by accreting mass from a companion.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} ejects {{streams of}} high-energy electrons and ions (energy up to tens megaelectronvolts), which travel {{as far as}} Earth's orbit. These streams are highly collimated and vary with the <b>rotational</b> period of the planet like the radio emissions. In this respect as well, Jupiter shows similarity to a pulsar.|$|E
5|$|Most main-sequence {{stars with}} a {{spectral}} class between O5 and F5 {{have been found}} to rotate rapidly. For stars in this range, the measured rotation velocity increases with mass. This increase in rotation peaks among young, massive B-class stars. As the expected life span of a star decreases with increasing mass, this can be explained as a decline in <b>rotational</b> velocity with age.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs {{from that of a}} diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) <b>rotational</b> energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into <b>rotational</b> motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E
5|$|Some astronomers had {{suggested}} that the impacts might have a noticeable effect on the Io torus, a torus of high-energy particles connecting Jupiter with the highly volcanic moon Io. High resolution spectroscopic studies found that variations in the ion density, <b>rotational</b> velocity, and temperatures {{at the time of}} impact and afterwards were within the normal limits.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry is {{pervasive}} in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or mirror symmetry, {{as do the}} leaves of plants and some flowers such as orchids. Plants often have radial or <b>rotational</b> symmetry, as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as sea anemones. Fivefold symmetry {{is found in the}} echinoderms, the group that includes starfish, sea urchins, and sea lilies.|$|E
5|$|The {{break-up}} {{velocity of}} a star is an expression {{that is used to}} describe the case where the centrifugal force at the equator is equal to the gravitational force. For a star to be stable the <b>rotational</b> velocity must be below this value.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known clock with a water-powered escapement mechanism, which transferred <b>rotational</b> {{energy into}} intermittent motions, {{dates back to}} 3rd century in ancient Greece; Chinese engineers later invented clocks incorporating mercury-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century, followed by Iranian engineers inventing water clocks driven by gears and weights in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{molecules}} {{listed below}} were detected by spectroscopy. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component electrons between different energy levels, or by <b>rotational</b> or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in radio, microwave, or infrared {{portions of the}} spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{uncertainty}} of the models {{is tied to the}} error margin in hitherto measured parameters: one of the <b>rotational</b> coefficients (J6) used to describe the planet's gravitational moment, Jupiter's equatorial radius, and its temperature at 1 bar pressure. The Juno mission, which arrived in July 2016, is expected to further constrain the values of these parameters for better models of the core.|$|E
5|$|This {{provides}} a definition {{for the moment}} of inertia, which is the <b>rotational</b> equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be substituted by the tensor that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including precession and nutation.|$|E
5|$|This tiling has four-way <b>rotational</b> {{symmetry}} {{around each}} of its squares. When {{the ratio of the}} side lengths of the two squares is an irrational number such as the golden ratio, its cross-sections form aperiodic sequences with a similar recursive structure to the Fibonacci word. Generalizations of this tiling to three dimensions have also been studied.|$|E
5|$|Truchet tiles are square tiles {{decorated}} with patterns {{so they do}} not have <b>rotational</b> symmetry; in 1704, Sébastien Truchet used a square tile split into two triangles of contrasting colours. These can tile the plane either periodically or randomly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rotational</b> latency is {{incurred}} {{because the}} desired disk sector {{may not be}} directly under the head when data transfer is requested. Average <b>rotational</b> latency {{is shown in the}} table, based on the statistical relation that the average latency is one-half the <b>rotational</b> period.|$|E
25|$|A common {{situation}} in which noninertial reference frames are useful is when the reference frame is rotating. Because such <b>rotational</b> motion is non-inertial, due to the acceleration present in any <b>rotational</b> motion, a fictitious force can always be invoked by using a <b>rotational</b> frame of reference. Despite this complication, the use of fictitious forces often simplifies the calculations involved.|$|E
25|$|Laws {{of physics}} are SO(3)-invariant {{if they do}} not {{distinguish}} different directions in space. Because of Noether's theorem, <b>rotational</b> symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation law. See also <b>rotational</b> invariance.|$|E
25|$|The {{standards}} {{are intended to}} reduce acceleration to (and within) the head due to impact, as a stiff liner made of expanded polystyrene is crushed against the head. However, both the CPSC and the EN 1078 standards only look at linear accelerations and ignore <b>rotational</b> accelerations. The <b>rotational</b> accelerations that arise in bicycle accidents can {{be large enough to}} cause concussions, diffuse axonal injury and subdural haematoma. A few new helmets are designed to reduce <b>rotational</b> accelerations in accidents.|$|E
25|$|Vertigo—Spinning dizziness, {{which must}} have a <b>rotational</b> component.|$|E
25|$|In physics, angular {{momentum}} (rarely, {{moment of momentum}} or <b>rotational</b> momentum) is the <b>rotational</b> equivalent of linear momentum. It is an important quantity in physics {{because it is a}} conserved quantity – the total {{angular momentum}} of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torque.|$|E
25|$|A {{rigid body}} has {{six degrees of}} freedom in the case of general spatial motion, three of them {{translational}} degrees of freedom and three <b>rotational</b> degrees of freedom. In the case of planar motion, a body has only three degrees of freedom with only one <b>rotational</b> and two translational degrees of freedom.|$|E
