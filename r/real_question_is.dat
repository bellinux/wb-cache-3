[...] Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five [...] "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: [...] "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures.

Others have said that the logical and philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God miss the point. The word God has a meaning in human culture and history that does not correspond to the beings whose existence is supported by such arguments, assuming they are valid. The <b>real</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not whether a [...] "most perfect being" [...] or an [...] "uncaused first cause" [...] exist. The <b>real</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether Jehovah, Zeus, Ra, Krishna, or any gods of any religion exist, and if so, which gods? On the other hand, many theists equate all monotheistic or henotheistic [...] "most perfect Beings", no matter what name is assigned to them/him, as the one monotheistic God (one example would be understanding the Muslim Allah, Christian Yhwh, and Chinese Shangdi as different names for the same Being). Most of these arguments do not resolve the issue of which of these figures is more likely to exist. These arguments fail to make the distinction between immanent gods and a Transcendent God.|$|E

Jacobin Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne outlined a program for the next insurrection: exile the King, dismiss the generals, elect a National Convention, transfer the royal veto to the people, deport all public enemies, and exempt the poor from taxation. This program was repeated, almost unchanged, in a strongly worded manifesto drawn up by Maximilien François Marie Isidore de Robespierre, and proclaimed by a federal orator before the House.

[...] The temptation {{in the wilderness}} and again in Gethsemane exemplifies this arena of temptation. [...] Regarding the temptation of performing a sign that would affirm his sonship by throwing himself from the pinnacle of the temple, MacLeod observes, [...] "The sign was for himself: a temptation to seek reassurance, as if to say, ‘the <b>real</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> my own sonship.

(Ellis, 2004, p. 126) Art argues that the <b>real</b> <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> what narratives do, what consequences they have, to what uses they can be put. Narrative is the way we remember the past, turn life into language, and disclose to ourselves and others the truth of our experiences (Bochner, 2001). In moving from concern with the inner veridicality to outer pragmatics of evaluating stories, Plummer also looks at uses, functions, and roles of stories, and adds that they ‘need to have rhetorical power enhanced by aesthetic delight (Plummer, 2001, p. 401).|$|R
2500|$|Mark Dunn, a {{spokesman}} for Dion, accused the Tories of making fun of the Liberal leader's hearing issues. Dion responded to Harper's comments, saying Harper had [...] "no class", saying [...] "I {{did not understand the}} question", and [...] "Maybe it's because I have a hearing problem, maybe because [...] my second language, but I did not understand the question". Both the Conservatives and the CTV have come under criticism for their handling of the footage, but they have stated they stand by their actions. Duceppe has called Harper's comments a [...] "double standard", saying that many English-speaking politicians have little or no ability to speak French, yet francophones are somehow always expected to be perfect, and that the attack was an attempted [...] "low blow". [...] But Duceppe also took the opportunity to criticise Dion, suggesting he understood the question. [...] "The <b>real</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> that I think Dion understood the question.

2500|$|The {{primitive}} {{attempt in}} dealing with differential equations had in view a reduction to quadratures. As {{it had been the}} hope of eighteenth-century algebraists to find a method for solving the general equation of the nth degree, so it was the hope of analysts to find a general method for integrating any differential equation. Gauss (1799) showed, however, that the differential equation meets its limitations very soon unless complex numbers are introduced. Hence, analysts began to substitute the study of functions, thus opening a new and fertile field. Cauchy was the first to appreciate the importance of this view. [...] Thereafter, the <b>real</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> to be not whether a solution is possible by means of known functions or their integrals but whether a given differential equation suffices for the definition of a function of the independent variable or variables, and, if so, what are the characteristic properties of this function.|$|R
