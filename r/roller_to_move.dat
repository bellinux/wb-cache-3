5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the sprocket shaft, the drive chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front sprocket drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the <b>roller</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that {{the weight of the}} operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{not known}} whether the species is {{distinct}} from Jubaea, {{but there is no}} evidence that it was Jubaea either, as the soft tissues used for identification of cocoid genera have not been preserved. All that remain are pollen from lake beds, hollow endocarps (nuts) found in a cave, and casts of root bosses. Partly to avoid giving credence to the common but speculative assumption that the palms were Jubaea chilensis and used as <b>rollers</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the moai statues of Easter Island, John Dransfield assigned the species to a new genus. The assignment is not accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, which does not list the genus Paschalococos, nor by The Plant List which regards the name as [...] "unresolved".|$|R
5000|$|Casler, {{following}} Dickson's proposal, {{invented the}} [...] "Mutoscope", which displayed short films through flip-cards rotated by a hand crank {{that could be}} slowed at the operator's will, unlike Edison's motorized Kinetoscope, in which films were viewed through actual 35 mm film. The prototype of the [...] "Mutograph" [...] camera was completed in November 1894, first tested with film in June 1895, and the first official Mutoscope films were made in August 1895. To avoire infringement on Edison's motion photo patents, the Mutograph camera used continuous movement friction <b>rollers</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> 68 mm film into the camera, instead of intermittent movement by sprockets as Edison's 35 mm camera did. Casler's patents, which he assigned to American Mutoscope in January 1896, were used as security for financing the new company.|$|R

50|$|By that time, 21 {{species of}} trees and all species of land birds became extinct through some {{combination}} of overharvesting/overhunting, rat predation, and climate change. The island was largely deforested, {{and it did not}} have any trees more than 3 metres (10 feet) tall. Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities. One theory regarding the deforestation that caused such ecological and social damage was that the trees were used as <b>rollers</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the statues <b>to</b> their place of erection from the quarry at Rano Raraku. Deforestation also affected agricultural production on Rapa Nui. At first, the native tropical forests provided ideal shade cover for soil. But with many of the native forest being destroyed, the topsoil became eroded causing a sharp decline in agricultural production. This was further exacerbated by the loss of land birds and the collapse in seabird populations as a potential source of food. By the 18th century, residents of the island were largely sustained by farming, with domestic chickens as the primary source of protein.|$|R
50|$|The roller-locked recoil {{operation}} {{functions as}} follows: two cylindrical rollers, positioned in tracks on the bolt head, are pushed outwards into matching {{tracks in the}} barrel extension by the striker sleeve and lock the bolt in place against the breech. Upon firing, rearward force from the recoil of the cartridge ignition pushes the striker assembly back and allows the <b>rollers</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> inwards, back <b>to</b> their previous position, unlocking the bolt head and allowing the bolt assembly to recoil, extracting the spent cartridge and ejecting it down. The return spring then pushes the bolt assembly forwards again, pushing a new cartridge out of the belt into the breech, and the sequence repeats {{as long as the}} trigger is depressed. The MG 42 is only capable of fully automatic fire. Single shots are difficult, even for experienced operators, due to the weapon's rate of fire. The usual training objective {{is to be able to}} fire a burst of no more than three rounds. The weapon features a recoil booster at the muzzle to increase rearwards force due to recoil, therefore improving functional reliability and rate of fire.|$|R
50|$|Water is fed to the Steffturbine {{through an}} inlet channel. The {{inflow of water}} loads the paddles. The power thus exerted onto the paddles causes the chain, which is mounted <b>to</b> run on <b>roller</b> bearings, <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> In turn, the {{circulating}} chain imparts a rotational motion to the drive wheels. A generator {{is connected to the}} rotating drive wheels via an overdrive transmission. The generator converts the rotational mechanical power into an electrical output. The resultant electrical power is modulated by means of the electronic control system and adapted to the different operating modes.|$|R
50|$|As {{the tallest}} shed, Ruth has her work cut out, {{as she is}} 20 in too tall. As part of the redesign, though, Ruth had asked for a three-foot {{increase}} in height, which was accommodated by the experts by adding a 3 ft pony wall. Ruth, after tearing off the exterior sheeting, resolves to cut the shed where the main wall meets the pony wall and move the two pieces (each of which is easily under the height restriction), and reassemble it later. However, instead of adopting Jaime's approach (as Jaime had a similar problem and was successful at it), Ruth instead uses pipes as <b>rollers</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{the top half of}} the shed onto scaffolding, freeing the bottom half. However, she is stuck with what to do about getting the top half off the scaffolding. Resolving to weaken the scaffolding so that the top half easily drops onto the floor, the top of Ruth's shed collapses instead, crushing the pony wall and flattening her peaked roof. Ruth's shed is the last shed to make it out of the Handyman Rehabilitation Centre, but is now in three (incomplete) pieces (the bottom half of her shed and the two halves of what was her roof).|$|R
40|$|The instant {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a peristaltic pump for critical laboratory or hospital applications requiring precise flow rates {{over an extended period}} of time. Within the cylindrical barrel pump housing is a single-piece, molded, elastometric, cylindrical liner with a multiplicity of flattened helical channels created therein from one end of the liner to the other. Three cylindrical rollers rotate about the center axis of the pump around the inside surface of the liner selectively compressing the liner, and hence the helical channels between the rollers and the barrel housing, creating a pumping action by forcing trapped fluid in the helical channels axially from one end of the liner to the opposite end. The novelty of the invention appears to lie in the provision of the special liner with multiple helical channels as the pumping chamber, rather than the standard single elastomeric tubing which is squeezed repeatedly by <b>rollers</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the liquid through a typical peristaltic pump. Large, repeated deflections on the standard tubing causes a permanent set in the tubing, thus either changing the flow rate, or requiring a new section of tubing to be positioned in the pump head. Further, this configuration minimizes the amount of outflow pulsation which is characteristic of a typical single tubing peristaltic pump...|$|R

There is also an area themed to Disney's 1991 film Beauty and the Beast, featuring the Beast's Castle with the new dining experience Be Our Guest Restaurant (offering quick-service lunches and table service dinners), as well as Gaston's Tavern and Belle's cottage. This portion of the New Fantasyland officially opened on December 6, 2012. Snow White's Scary Adventures was removed to build Princess Fairytale Hall, a meet-n-greet. Opened on May 28, 2014, {{another part of the}} New Fantasyland featuring an attraction themed to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which features Snow White's cottage and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train roller coaster ride, the first <b>roller</b> coaster <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in a wobbling motion on track.|$|R
50|$|MyCoke Coaster was {{a roller}} coaster race between two teams of players {{involving}} memory and speed. Each team would be given a combination of colored levers to pull and pulling them in the right order caused the <b>roller</b> coaster car <b>to</b> <b>move</b> up the hill. The combination gradually got more complex each round, requiring both memorization skills and speed in order to beat the other team. The team that completed each round and {{got to the top}} of the incline first would win the game and be awarded decibels. Jairo Fula was a major contributor to the art and design of this game.|$|R
50|$|The central {{feature in}} the coat of arms is a {{building}} which still exists {{in the center of}} the old part of the village. The two-storey building was used originally as a storehouse for food and equipment and is the oldest building in the village. It is not absolutely certain when it was built but 1603 is generally accepted. In 1902 a nearby main farmhouse was set on fire by lightning.

40|$|This {{demonstration}} {{illustrates the}} concept of action and reaction. A radio-controlled car moves along a board that lies {{on a series of}} <b>rollers</b> <b>to</b> reduce friction between the board and the table. When the car accelerates in one direction, the board accelerates in the opposite direction, due to the action-reaction force pair between the tires and the board. The car wheels apply a force on the board, causing it <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> The board applies a reaction force on the car wheels, causing the car <b>to</b> <b>move</b> along the board. This situation is illustrated with graphics in Figure 1. Ideally, the momentum of the car and the board would remain equal and opposite at all times. However, frictional losses limit this symmetry in the actual experiment...|$|R
