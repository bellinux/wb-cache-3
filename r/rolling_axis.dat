For example, a cone having an apex angle of 120 degrees, while being rolled on a flat surface, will perform exactly two full rotations around its axis of symmetry before returning to its original position.|$|R

Its potential in building physical meaningful graphs that represent equivalent mathematical models of classic analytical approaches is shown.

A rotorcraft in hover flight is simulated and perturbed on its <b>rolling</b> motion <b>axis.</b> Depending on the rotorcraft characteristics air resonance may occur, and the pilot may involuntarily excite the cyclic lever, increasing the rolling motion of the fuselage to an unstable point.

Inside the tube, the binding energy of liquid 4 He is approximately three times larger than on planar graphite. At low linear densities, 4 He in a nanotube is an experimental realization of a one-dimensional quantum fluid. However, when the density increases the structural and energetic properties of both systems differ. At high density, a quasi-continuous liquid-solid phase transition is observed in both cases.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of the {{calculation}} of the longitudinal location of a wheel rail contact point on the wheelset’s motion in a vehicle dynamic simulation. All current vehicle dynamic software programs assume that the contact between wheel and rail takes place in the vertical plane through the wheelset’s <b>rolling</b> <b>axis.</b> However, when the yaw angle of the wheelset is nonzero, the contact point is situated up to 10 ?mm from that plane. This difference causes a difference in the yaw moment on the wheelset which is used in the vehicle dynamic simulation. To such an end, an existing analytical method to determine the longitudinal method was validated using a numerical approach. Then vehicle dynamic simulations with both the classic and the new contact location were performed, concluding that using a more accurate contact point location results in a smaller wheelset yaw angle in a vehicle dynamic simulation, although the effect is small.

40|$|The microstructures of {{extruded}} and hot-rolled 2124 Al- 15 percent (by weight) SiC whisker composites {{have been}} investigated, experimentally. Among the specific factors studied were: {{the strength of}} the whisker-matrix interfaces; (2) the presence of oxides; (3) the presence of defective whiskers; (4) and the presence of distribution of intermetallic compounds, impurities in the SiC(w) powder, and microstructural inhomogeneities. Modifications in the microstructure of the SiC/AL composites due to hot rolling and extrusion are illustrated in a series of microphotographs. It was found that hot <b>rolling</b> along the <b>axis</b> of extrusion was associated with some types of whisker damage, while the whiskers still retain their original orientation. Hot-rolling perpendicular to the axis of extrusion, however, tended to rotate the whiskers and produced a nearly isotropic material. Whisker free zones were virtually eliminated or reduced in size by hot rolling. In situ Auger fractography of the composite showed that the interfacial bonding between the SiC and the Al matrix was good and that Al 2 O 2 had no significant influence on the fracture mechanics of the composite...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} a {{cylinder}} of mass m and radius r, with its center of mass out of the cylinder <b>axis,</b> <b>rolling</b> on an incline that makes an angle {{with respect to the}} horizontal is analyzed. The equation of motion is partially solved to obtain the site where the cylinder loses contact with the incline (jumps). Several simplifications are made: the analyzed system consists of an homogeneous disc with a one dimensional straight line of mass parallel to the disc axis at a distance y < r of the center of the cylinder. To compare our results with experimental data, we use a Styrofoam cylinder to which a long brass rod was imbibed parallel to the disc axis at a distance y < r from it, so the center of mass lies at a distance d {{from the center of the}} cylinder. Then the disc rolls without slipping on a long wooden ramp inclined at 15, 30 and 45 degrees with respect to the horizontal. To determine the jumping site, the motion was recorded with a high-speed video camera (Casio EX ZR 100) at 200 and 480 frames per second. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions...|$|R
40|$|Although {{at present}} {{legislation}} {{does not allow}} drivers in a Level 3 autonomous vehicle {{to engage in a}} secondary task, there may become a time when it does. Monitoring the behaviour of drivers engaging in various non-driving activities (NDAs) is crucial to decide how well the driver {{will be able to take}} over control of the vehicle. One limitation of the commonly used face-based head tracking system, using cameras, is that sufficient features of the face must be visible, which limits the detectable angle of head movement and thereby measurable NDAs, unless multiple cameras are used. This paper proposes a novel orientation sensor based head tracking system that includes twin devices, one of which measures the movement of the vehicle while the other measures the absolute movement of the head. Measurement error in the shaking and nodding axes were less than 0. 4 °, while error in the <b>rolling</b> <b>axis</b> was less than 2 °. Comparison with a camera-based system, through in-house tests and on-road tests, showed that the main advantage of the proposed system is the ability to detect angles larger than 20 ° in the shaking and nodding axes. Finally, a case study demonstrated that the measurement of the shaking and nodding angles, produced from the proposed system, can effectively characterise the drivers’ behaviour while engaged in the NDAs of chatting to a passenger and playing on a smartphone...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{examining}} {{of the effect of}} microstructure on the Bauschinger effect and the relation between the Bauschinger effect and the work hardening, experiments were carried out on a mild steel in tension-compression and reverse torsion tests. 　The annealed steel is composed of the alternate layers of ferrites and pearlites along the <b>rolling</b> <b>axis,</b> which is called the ferrite band structure. The pearlites of specimen are spheroidized and dispersed uniformiy in the ferrite matrix by tempering. The influence of the distribution of second phase particles {{on the development of the}} Bauschinger effect was examined on comparing the reverse loading curves of the annealed and the spheroidized. The transient softening of the Bauschinger effect in the annealed steel is larger in reverse torsion than in tension-compression. On the other hand, the Bauschinger effect in the spheroidized steel is much the same in both cases. Hence the ferrite band structure has an effect on the development of the Bauschinger effect. 　As it can be considered that the work hardening of spheroidized steel depends on the dispersed cementites, the dispersion hardening theory proposed by Fisher et. al. applies to the experimental results and the quantitative relation between the Bauschinger effect and the work hardening is obtained. It was shown that the permanent softening of the Bauschinger effect corresponds to the work hardening...|$|E
40|$|Some {{characteristics}} of the process zone developed around the tips of cracks {{as well as the}} fractography of the fracture surfaces constitute the subject of the present paper. The study was carried out using Scanning Electron Microscopy for the determination of the Crack Tip Opening Displacement, while numerical analysis and experimental results were combined for the determination of the. J-integral. A modern particulate Metal Matrix Composite and its matrix alloy were used for the fabrication of relatively thin tensile specimens of two different types, i. e. single- and double-edge-notched. Dependence of the above quantities on the thickness of the specimen is detected: both the critical Crack Tip Opening Displacement and the critical J-integral are found to increase in an almost linear manner with thickness. For comparison, intact prismatic specimens were considered, in 'order to study the dependence of ductility and fracture on the thickness of the specimen. It is observed that they depend also on the specimen thickness in a similar manner. Variation of these two properties with the direction of the specimen with respect to the <b>rolling</b> <b>axis</b> is also detected, indicating the importance of the plastically induced anisotropy due to the manufacturing process. Concerning the mechanisms leading to failure, it is concluded that void coalescence is active although void nucleation due to the presence of particles appears to be unavoidable...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{yawing moment}} asymmetries were {{encountered}} during the high-angle-of-attack envelope {{expansion of the}} two X- 31 aircraft. These asymmetries led to position saturations of the thrust vector vanes and trailing-edge flaps during some of the dynamic stability <b>axis</b> <b>rolling</b> maneuvers at high angles of attack. This slowed the high-angle-of-attack envelope expansion and resulted in maneuver restrictions. Several aerodynamic modifications {{were made to the}} X- 31 forebody with the goal of minimizing the asymmetry. A method for determining the yawing moment asymmetry from flight data was developed and an analysis of the various configuration changes completed. The baseline aircraft were found to have significant asymmetries above 45 deg angle of attack with the largest asymmetry typically occurring around 60 deg angle of attack. Applying symmetrical boundary layer transition strips along the forebody sides increased the magnitude of the asymmetry and widened the angle-of-attack range over which the largest asymmetry acted. Installing longitudinal forebody strakes and rounding the sharp nose of the aircraft caused the yawing moment asymmetry magnitude to be reduced. The transition strips and strakes made the asymmetry characteristic of the aircraft more repeatable than the clean forebody configuration. Although no geometric differences between the aircraft were known, ship 2 consistently had larger yawing moment asymmetries than ship 1...|$|R
60|$|In structure, {{however, the}} Peronospora {{is as much}} a mould as the common Penicillium; and just as the Penicillium multiplies by the {{breaking}} up of its hyphoe into separate rounded bodies, the spores; so, in the Peronospora, certain of the hyphoe grow out into the air through the interstices of the superficial cells of the potato plant, and develop spores. Each of these hyphoe usually gives off several branches. The ends of the branches dilate and become closed sacs, which eventually drop off as spores. The spores falling on some part of the same potato plant, or carried by the wind to another, may at once germinate, throwing out tubular prolongations which become hyphoe, and burrow into the substance of the plant attacked. But, more commonly, the contents of the spore divide into six or eight separate portions. The coat of the spore gives way, and each portion then emerges as an independent organism, which has the shape of a bean, rather narrower at one end than the other, convex on one side, and depressed or concave on the opposite. From the depression, two long and delicate cilia proceed, one shorter than the other, and directed forwards. Close to the origin of these cilia, in the substance of the body, is a regularly pulsating, contractile vacuole. The shorter cilium vibrates actively, and effects the locomotion of the organism, while the other trails behind; the whole body <b>rolling</b> on its <b>axis</b> with its pointed end forwards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this study, cold {{reduction}} {{process of the}} tubular metal is applied to manufacture the drive shaft for the rear wheel drive system. With this method during forming process, chip forming such as hobbing and broaching method is not involved. The manufacturing process is as follows; the tube which the sheet is formed and welded to by roll forming machine, is mounted on a suitable mandrel. This mandrel has an external toothing which corresponds to internal toothing of the final product. During axial moving and rotating of the workpiece, forming operation is carried out in lengthwise direction of the toothing. This forming rolls is positioned on the roll head and have a <b>rolling</b> <b>axis</b> vertical with the one of a mandrel. The total forming load needed in the {{cold reduction}} process is separated into numerous forming steps along the entire cylindrical length of the zone to be formed. In the process of cold forming on the profiled mandrel during the impact forming operation, material is pushed into depression of toothing of a mandrel mainly in a radial direction. Finally splines can be generated {{on the surface of}} components and overall elongated. If the process parameter such as the length of forming per 1 rotation of 1 roll is not optimized, the impact force from the rolls of the forming process causes geometrical defects. So the optimal parameters such as feeding and rotating speed of workpiece and the forming length should be properly determined. And the effects of the weld line positioning on the formability of the forming process is analyzed to minimize the generation of the defects such as crack on the surface of splined zone...|$|E
40|$|The use of in-situ {{propulsion}} {{is considered}} enabling technology for long duration planetary surface missions. Most {{studies have focused}} on stored energy from chemicals extracted from the soil or the use of soil chemicals to produce photovoltaic arrays. An older form of in-situ propulsion is the use of wind power. Recent studies have shown potential for wind driven craft for exploration of Mars, Titan and Venus. The power of the wind, used for centuries to power wind mills and sailing ships, is now being applied to modern land craft. Efforts are now underway to use the wind to push exploration vehicles on other planets and moons in extended survey missions. Tumbleweed rovers are emerging as a new type of wind-driven science platform concept. Recent investigations by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) indicate that these light-weight, mostly spherical or quasi-spherical devices have potential for long distance surface exploration missions. As a power boat has unique capabilities, but relies on stored energy (fuel) to move the vessel, the Tumbleweed, like the sailing ships of the early explorers on earth, uses an unlimited resource the wind to move around the surface of Mars. This has the potential to reduce the major mass drivers of robotic rovers as well as the power generation and storage systems. Jacques Blamont of JPL and the University of Paris conceived the first documented Mars wind-blown ball in 1977, shortly after the Viking landers discovered that Mars has a thin CO 2 atmosphere with relatively strong winds. In 1995, Jack Jones, et al, of JPL conceived of a large wind-blown inflated ball for Mars that could also be driven and steered by means of a motorized mass hanging beneath the <b>rolling</b> <b>axis</b> of the ball. A team at NASA Langley Research Center started a biomimetic Tumbleweed design study in 1998. Wind tunnel and CFD analysis were applied to a variety of concepts to optimize the aerodynamic characteristics of the Tumbleweed Rovers. Bare structures, structures carrying sails and a tumbleweed plant (of the Salsola genus) were tested in Langley's wind tunnels. Thomas Estier of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology developed a memory metal collapsible structure, the Windball. Numerous other researchers have also suggested spherical rovers...|$|E
