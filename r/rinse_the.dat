Cation exchange is widely used to remove ions such as Na+ and Ca2+ from aqueous solutions, producing demineralized water. The acid is used to <b>rinse</b> <b>the</b> cations from the resins.

30|$|Although {{there is}} no {{corresponding}} study, it is generally agreed that the circuit should be rinsed with isotonic saline solution and that arterial and venous lines should be connected simultaneously to avoid volume depletion induced by <b>rinsing.</b> Heparinization of <b>the</b> <b>rinsing</b> fluid is debated because no study has tested its usefulness. In hemodialysis, {{it is not necessary}} to add heparin when <b>rinsing</b> <b>the</b> circuit. In hemofiltration, usual practice is to use 5000  IU of heparin in the second liter of fluid when <b>rinsing</b> <b>the</b> circuit so as to extend filter lifespan and increase adsorption capacity (no study). This approach, however, has not been validated by scientific evaluation.|$|R

25|$|On May 14, 1990, Dahmer {{moved out}} of his grandmother's house and into 924 North 25th Street, Apartment 213, taking Anthony Sears' skull, scalp, and painted {{genitals}} with him. Within one week of his moving into his new apartment, Dahmer had killed his sixth victim, Raymond Smith. Smith was a 32-year-old male prostitute whom Dahmer lured to Apartment 213 {{with the promise of}} $50 for sex. At Dahmer's apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills and manually strangled him. The following day, Dahmer purchased a Polaroid camera with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilex, which enabled him to then <b>rinse</b> <b>the</b> bones in his sink; he dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton—excluding the skull—in a container he filled with acid. He spray-painted Smith's skull and placed it alongside the skull of Anthony Sears.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than three}} months after the murder of Smith, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed: [...] "That'll cost you extra," [...] whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills. On this occasion, however, he had had only two sleeping pills to give his victim; therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his carotid artery with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes. Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body. He wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the fridge for later consumption. Dahmer boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a [...] "jelly-like substance" [...] using Soilex, which again enabled him to <b>rinse</b> <b>the</b> flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, he placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the fridge before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.|$|E

40|$|Background. Significant {{increases}} in intracranial pressure (ICP) may occur during neuroendoscopic procedures. To detect and prevent serious and sustained increases, ICP should be monitored. At present, controversy {{exists on the}} optimal location of the monitoring sensor. Therefore, we conducted an in vitro study to estimate the pressure gradients between the ventricle, the 'gold standard' site, and <b>the</b> <b>rinsing</b> inlet and outlet. Methods. A head model and a standard endoscope were used. Rinsing was enforced by using a pressurized infusion bag. Using clinically relevant flow rates, pressure was measured at <b>the</b> <b>rinsing</b> inlet and outlet, in the ventricle, and at the distal end of <b>the</b> <b>rinsing</b> channel using a tip sensor or a capillary tube. Results. At a flow of 61 ml min(- 1), the steady-state pressures measured at <b>the</b> <b>rinsing</b> inlet, in <b>the</b> ventricle, and at <b>the</b> <b>rinsing</b> outlet were 38, 26, and 12 mm Hg, respectively. At 135 ml min(- 1), these increased to 136, 89, and 42 mm Hg. Transendoscopic pressure measurements were always within 1 mm Hg of the ventricular pressure. Conclusions. During endoscopy, measurements at <b>the</b> <b>rinsing</b> inlet overestimated <b>the</b> ventricular pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg during heavy rinsing, whereas measurements at <b>the</b> <b>rinsing</b> outlet underestimated <b>the</b> pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg. An electronic tip sensor or a pressure capillary tube placed at the distal end of the lumen of <b>the</b> <b>rinsing</b> channel of <b>the</b> endoscope did not interfere with rinsing flow and produced measurements that were equal to ventricular pressures...|$|R

40|$|Electrokinetic {{remediation}} is an in-situ {{technique in}} which a direct current is applied across a water-saturated contaminated soil. As a result, metal ions are transported through the soil from the anode toward the cathode by electromigration, electroosmosis and diffusion. Electrokinetic remediation experiments were performed with Bentonite clay contaminated with Pb and/or Zn under a constant current. The clay bed was cylindrical with a diameter of 5 cm and a length of 15 cm. The electroosmotic flowrate decreased with time due to {{a significant increase in}} the concentration of H+ ions in the bed. Without cathode <b>rinsing</b> <b>the</b> clay bed cracked and <b>the</b> voltage increased. <b>Rinsing</b> <b>the</b> cathode prevented cracking and decreased the voltage applied across the bed. The acid front generated at the anode advanced across the clay bed at a speed of approximately 1. 4 mm/hr. When there was no <b>rinsing,</b> most of <b>the</b> metals precipitated in the cathode region. With <b>rinsing,</b> <b>the</b> metals which reached the cathode compartment were removed by the effluent at constant rates over four days. For clay contaminated with Zn, the rate of removal was 15 mg/hr; for clay contaminated with Pb, the rate of removal was 54 mg/hr. For clays with single contaminants and cathode <b>rinsing,</b> <b>the</b> energy consumption was approximately 1. 3 x 106 kJ/m 3 of clean soil for zinc removal and 1. 8 x 106 kJ/m 3 for lead removal. For clays contaminated with both metals, the rates of removal were 11 mg/hr for Zn and 26 mg/hr for Pb. After four days, 23 % of Pb and 67 % of Zn was removed. The efficiency of current utilization was 32 % for removal of Zn alone and 40 % for removal of Pb alone. For removal of mixed contaminants the efficiency was 40 %. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
