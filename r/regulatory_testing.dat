40|$|A range or arsenic {{containing}} compounds, including arsenic trioxide, pentoxide and a {{lead arsenate}} insecticide have been stabilized using formulations of cement alone, cement + lime and cement + ferrous sulfate and subsequently {{exposed to a}} range of leaching regimes in order to compare their effectiveness for metal stabilization. Leaching tests used were two <b>regulatory</b> <b>tests,</b> the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and the Australian Bottle Leaching Procedure (ABLP), as well as column leaching. Arsenic leachate concentrations from cement-stabilized lead arsenate insecticide were similar when subjected to either the TCLP or ABLP using the same leachant. Lead, known to be immobilized by means different to that of arsenic, yielded varying leachate concentrations when using either of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>tests,</b> even though the leachant was of the same type. The leaching of calcium influences the filtered arsenic leachate, whereas the leaching of lead is greatly affected by leachate pH. As expected, both <b>regulatory</b> <b>tests</b> generally proved to be very severe in terms of the masses of the hazardous constituents leached when compared to conceptually more realistic column leaching scenarios. Sodium arsenate-containing formulations behaved anomalously, with column leaching tests resulting in larger arsenic masses being leached than the <b>regulatory</b> <b>tests.</b> Sodium arsenate, known to inhibit cementation reactions, serves as a reminder of the perils that can be faced when generalizing the results obtained from leaching tests...|$|R

40|$|The {{replacement}} of in vivo methods by {{in vitro methods}} in <b>regulatory</b> drug <b>testing</b> is rare. The aim {{of this research is}} to identify barriers and drivers of the {{replacement of}} in vivo methods by in vitro methods in Europe. We studied two cases. The first case is the Draize eye test. Since 2009, the in vivo test is partly replaced by in vitro methods. The second case concerns EPO potency testing. Since the eighties, financial and scientific efforts have been made to replace the in vivo EPO potency test with in vitro methods; however the efforts failed to deliver expected outcomes. The innovation systems approach is used to identify the drivers and barriers regarding replacement of in vivo methods by in vitro methods in <b>regulatory</b> drug <b>testing</b> in Europe, such as {{the presence or absence of}} legislative pressure, legitimacy, and funding. Combining and comparing the outcomes resulted in an overview of potential barriers and drivers, and an indication of which of these factors are critical for replacement of in vivo methods by in vitro methods in <b>regulatory</b> drug <b>testing.</b> Policy makers could use these results to formulate policies that enable the replacement of in vivo methods by in vitro methods in <b>regulatory</b> drug <b>testing...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} predict the fate of {{chemicals}} in the environment, a range of <b>regulatory</b> <b>tests</b> are performed with microbial inocula collected from environmental compartments to investigate the potential for biodegradation. The abundance and distribution of microbes in the environment is affected by a range of variables, hence diversity and biomass of inocula used in biodegradation tests can be highly variable in space and time. The use of artificial or natural biofilms in <b>regulatory</b> <b>tests</b> could enable more consistent microbial communities be used as inocula, {{in order to increase}} test consistency. We investigated spatial and temporal variation in composition, biomass and chemical biodegradation potential of bacterial biofilms formed in river water. Sampling time and sampling location impacted the capacity of biofilms to degrade p-nitrophenol (PNP). Biofilm bacterial community structure varied across sampling times, but was not affected by sampling location. Degradation of PNP was associated with increased relative abundance of Pseudomonas syringae. Partitioning of the bacterial metacommunity into core and satellite taxa revealed that the P. syringae could be either a satellite or core member of the community across sampling times, but this had no impact on PNP degradation. Quantitative PCR analysis of the pnpA gene showed that it was present in all samples irrespective of their ability to degrade PNP. River biofilms showed seasonal variation in biomass, microbial community composition and PNP biodegradation potential, which resulted in inconsistent biodegradation test results. We discuss the results {{in the context of the}} mechanisms underlying variation in <b>regulatory</b> chemical degradation <b>tests.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Many are {{critical}} of how <b>regulatory</b> <b>testing</b> practices have evolved and become established—critical both of the sci-entific rational and the animal welfare costs. The test of whether we are more enlightened than our predecessors will be whether, armed with more powerful scientific insights and {{a better understanding of}} animal welfare, we can ensure that the best animal welfare and the best science drive and shape future developments in <b>regulatory</b> <b>testing.</b> Conduct-ing the most humane animal-based <b>regulatory</b> <b>testing</b> re-quires establishing and maintaining a constructive dialogue between stakeholders and acknowledging the common ground that unites. Inclusive processes with stakeholders prepared to offer public, rational justifications for their poli-cies and processes are essential if best practice is to be identified and implemented. There is general agreement that the best animal welfare results in the best science; that regu-latory requirements based on an understanding of mecha-nisms and early relevant biomarkers result in elegant and valid science. Thus, "alternative " methods enabling replace-ment, reduction, or refinement (the 3 Rs) are in reality often more scientifically "advanced " and scientifically valid methods. These principles provided the incentive and framework for recent initiatives in the United Kingdom to enhance the quality of the data prepared for regulatory sub-mission while better protecting the welfare of the animals used. Some remaining 3 R opportunities are explored in this paper, and some of the commonly encountered myths about <b>regulatory</b> <b>testing</b> and perceived barriers to change are chal-lenged.

40|$|Approaches and {{challenges}} to refining and reducing animal use in <b>regulatory</b> <b>testing</b> are reviewed. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>testing</b> {{accounts for the}} majority of animals reported in the most painful and/or distressful categories in the United States and Canada. Refinements in testing, including the use of hu-mane endpoints, are of increasing concern. Traditional ap-proaches to reduction (e. g., improving experimental design) are being supplemented with complementary approaches, {{such as the use of}} tier testing to eliminate some chemicals prior to in vivo testing. Technological advances in telemetry and noninvasive techniques will help decrease either the demand for animals in testing or animal suffering. Further decreases in animal use will stem from international har-monization and coordination of testing programs. Progress in refinement and reduction faces a variety of broad chal-lenges, including limited funding for research. In the spe-cific area of refinement, a key challenge is the issue of distress (as distinct from pain). In the area of reduction, the practice of using unjustifiably high numbers of animals from small species (e. g., rodents) should be challenged. One case study of the use of carbon dioxide as a euthanasia agent illustrates the need for further analysis and research. Notwithstanding the complexities {{and challenges}}, the po-tential for refinement and reduction in <b>regulatory</b> <b>testing</b> is encouraging.
