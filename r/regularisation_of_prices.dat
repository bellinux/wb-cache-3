40|$|We {{implement}} a proper-time UV <b>regularisation</b> <b>of</b> the Nambu-Goto string, introducing an independent metric tensor {{and the corresponding}} Lagrange multiplier, and treating them in the mean-field approximation justified for long strings and/or when the dimensions of space-time is large. We compute the regularised determinant of the 2 d Laplacian for the closed string winding around a compact dimension, obtaining {{in this way the}} effective action, whose minimisation determines the energy of the string ground state in the mean-field approximation. We discuss the existence of two scaling limits when the cutoff is taken to infinity. One scaling limit reproduces the results obtained by the hypercubic <b>regularisation</b> <b>of</b> the Nambu-Goto string {{as well as by the}} use of the dynamical triangulation <b>regularisation</b> <b>of</b> the Polyakov string.

40|$|Abstract. Soft wavelet {{shrinkage}} {{and total}} variation (TV) denoising are two frequently used techniques for denoising signals and images, while preserving their discontinuities. In this paper {{we show that}} – under specific circumstances – both methods are equivalent. First we prove that 1 -D Haar wavelet shrinkage on a single scale is equivalent to a single step of TV diffusion or <b>regularisation</b> <b>of</b> two-pixel pairs. Afterwards we show that wavelet shrinkage on multiple scales {{can be regarded as}} a single step diffusion filtering or <b>regularisation</b> <b>of</b> the Laplacian pyramid of the signal. ...|$|R

40|$|Strong {{gravitational}} lens systems with extended sources are {{of special interest}} because they provide additional constraints on the models of the lens systems. To use a {{gravitational lens}} system for measuring the Hubble constant, one would need to determine the lens potential and the source intensity distribution simultaneously. A linear inversion method to reconstruct a pixellated source brightness distribution of a given lens potential model was introduced by Warren & Dye. In the inversion process, a regularisation on the source intensity is often needed {{to ensure a successful}} inversion with a faithful resulting source. In this paper, we use Bayesian analysis to determine the optimal <b>regularisation</b> constant (strength <b>of</b> <b>regularisation)</b> <b>of</b> a given form <b>of</b> <b>regularisation</b> and to objectively choose the optimal form <b>of</b> <b>regularisation</b> given a selection <b>of</b> <b>regularisations.</b> We consider and compare quantitatively three different forms <b>of</b> <b>regularisation</b> previously described in the literature for source inversions in gravitational lensing: zeroth-order, gradient and curvature. We use simulated data with the exact lens potential to demonstrate the method. We find that the preferred form <b>of</b> <b>regularisation</b> depends {{on the nature of the}} source distribution.

40|$|Inspired by the {{question}} of identifying the start time τ of financial bubbles, we address the calibration of time series in which {{the inception of the}} latest regime of interest is unknown. By taking into account the tendency of a given model to overfit data, we introduce the Lagrange <b>regularisation</b> <b>of</b> the normalised sum of the squared residuals, χ^ 2 _np(Φ), to endogenously detect the optimal fitting window size := w^* ∈ [τ:t̅_ 2] that should be used for calibration purposes for a fixed pseudo present time t̅_ 2. The performance <b>of</b> the Lagrange <b>regularisation</b> <b>of</b> χ^ 2 _np(Φ) defined as χ^ 2 _λ (Φ) is exemplified on a simple Linear Regression problem with a change point and compared against the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) := χ^ 2 (Φ) and RSS/(N-p) := χ^ 2 _np(Φ), where N is the sample size and p is the number of degrees of freedom. Applied to synthetic models of financial bubbles with a well-defined transition regime and to a number of financial time series (US S&P 500, Brazil IBovespa and China SSEC Indices), the Lagrange <b>regularisation</b> <b>of</b> χ^ 2 _λ(Φ) is found to provide well-defined reasonable determinations of the starting times for major bubbles such as the bubbles ending with the 1987 Black-Monday, the 2008 Sub-prime crisis and minor speculative bubbles on other Indexes, without any further exogenous information. It thus allows one to endogenise the determination of the beginning time of bubbles, a problem that had not received previously a systematic objective solution. Comment: 14 pages, 6 Figure...|$|R
