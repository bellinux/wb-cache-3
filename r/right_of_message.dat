3000|$|... [*]The {{overhead}} <b>of</b> <b>message</b> delivered - The {{number of}} the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> reflects the network resource consumption <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> in the transfer process. Firstly, the copy <b>of</b> <b>message</b> needs {{to take up the}} corresponding cache space to consume the storage resource. Secondly, the message needs energy when transferred to consume energy resource. Lastly, the message takes up the corresponding communication channel when transferred to consume the network bandwidth. So, the number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> can reflect the network resource overhead. The cost cannot be estimated directly, but it is usually related to the {{number of the}} copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network. If there are more copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network, the link cost will be higher. Conversely, the link cost is lower. So, the number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> can reflect the link cost <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> in the transfer process.|$|R

It can improve the later spread speed of the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> by choosing the nodes whose willing forwarding domain has a higher credibility to inject. If the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> are injected to the nodes which have lower credibility, in the later injection stage, the nodes cannot meet with the nodes injected for a long time to make the injected delay of the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> large. The worst case is that the node injects the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> to the node with credibility value 0 to result in the copy <b>of</b> <b>message</b> turning into invalid. This is because the copied message cannot be injected out through the node.To improve the injected efficiency of the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network, we set up an injection threshold R 0 to make the node with copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> inject according to the threshold value. Thus, it only injects the corresponding copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> to the nodes whose credibility exceed the threshold value R 0 in its willing forwarding domain.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Some Embedded systems involve {{multiple}} processors {{connected by}} a communication medium. These processors {{communicate with each other}} exchanging short messages using some message based communication protocols such as Controller Area Network (CAN), SAE J 1939 etc. With the induction of new features inside such networks, the number <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> will increase. The increase <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> may affect the network performance for a given network characteristics. Performance evaluation <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> based networks is therefore desired with increasing message load.

30|$|From Figure  9, {{the number}} of copies of all {{algorithms}} is increasing {{with the passage of}} time, but for Epidemic algorithm, its copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> spread the fastest, presenting exponential growth. For Spray and Wait algorithm and Spray and Focus algorithm, they have the limit for the maximum number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network. With the number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> growing to a certain stage, the value will be a constant. For DTSNS routing protocol, its number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> is controlled by the delay constraints to self adapt to have the smallest number of copies. More copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> consume more network resource seriously. This is because the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> take up the node cache and need a large amount of energy and network bandwidth at the forwarding process. For DTSN which has limited network resource, the overhead is unbearable. So, though Epidemic algorithm has good performance, it is rarely used in practical application.|$|R
