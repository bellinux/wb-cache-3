40|$|An {{essential}} part of problem-based learning (PBL) is group learning. Thus, an in depth understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of group learning in PBL allows educators to bridge theory and practice more effectively thus providing ideas and tools to enhance PBL practices and research. The theory-driven applications examined in this article establish grounds for future research in PBL. The {{purpose of this article}} is to describe and examine two theoretical perspectives of group learning in PBL and their potential applications to improve educational practice. They include: (1) social interdependence theory and the meaning of positive interdependence, (2) socio cognitive theory of <b>networked</b> <b>expertise</b> and the concept of knowledge creation in innovative knowledge communities (IKC). Potential applications include the following: development of instructional material to foster positive interdependency using concept maps; formal and structured use of peer feedback throughout PBL courses to promote individual and group accountability; creation and sharing of new knowledge about different topics within and across IKC; and use of rotating students with hybrid abilities across PBL groups to foster distributed cognition...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCritical infrastructure systems, {{such as water}} and electricity, are important for society and national defense. There {{is a need for}} network analysis tools that allow analysts to study potential scenarios to discover vulnerabilities, assess consequences, and evaluate effective solutions to overcome network weaknesses. In order to be useful, models of critical infrastructure systems need to be realistic, both geospatially and functionally. The objective of this thesis is {{to bridge the gap between}} geospatial and functional network analysis by developing a software tool that allows users to create and edit networks in a Graphical Information System (GIS) visual environment, and then also run and view the results of functional network models. Our primary contribution is to provide an easy-to-use, graphical interface in the form of a plugin that allows users, regardless of their <b>network</b> <b>expertise,</b> to create <b>networks</b> and exercise network flow models on them. We demonstrate the usefulness of our plugin through the analysis of a fictional case study with a realistic Internet infrastructure. We run several minimum cost flow models with simulated network attacks to assess the robustness of the network. Ensign, United States Nav...|$|R
