40|$|In {{recent years}} much {{work has been}} carried out to design and analyse online {{investment}} strategies based on constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolios. A constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio is a sequential investment strategy that maintains fixed through time, trading period by trading period, the wealth distribution among a set of assets. In this framework, Cover proposed the universal portfolio, which is competitive with the best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio determined in hindsight, i. e. the constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio obtained by assuming perfect knowledge of future stock prices. However, the constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio is designed to deal with the portfolio selection problem in the case where no additional information concerning the stock market, is available. To overcome this limitation, Cover and Ordentlich proposed the state constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio, which is capable of appropriately exploiting the available side-information concerning the stock market. In this paper we study and analyse the topic introduced by Cover and Ordentlich and focus our attention on the interplay between constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolios and side-information. We introduce a mathematical framework to deal with the constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio in the case where side-information, concerning the stock market, is available. The mathematical framework defines and analyses the mixture best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio, which we propose as the investment benchmark to be considered in the case where side-information, concerning the stock market, is available. The mixture best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio outperforms the best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio by an exponential factor in terms of the achieved wealth and therefore offers an interesting opportunity for side-information specialized online investment algorithms. We describe a new online investment algorithm that exploits the definition of the mixture best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio and the available side-information. The performance of the proposed online investment algorithm is investigated through a set of numerical experiments concerning four major stock market data sets, namely DJIA, S&P 500, TSE and NYSE. The results emphasize the relevance of the proposed online investment strategy and underline the central role {{of the quality of the}} side-information in outperforming the best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio.

40|$|In {{a dynamic}} {{investment}} situation, the right timing of portfolio revisions and adjustments {{is essential to}} sustain long-term growth. A high <b>rebalancing</b> frequency reduces the portfolio performance {{in the presence of}} transaction costs, whereas a low <b>rebalancing</b> frequency entails a static investment strategy that hardly reacts to changing market conditions. This article studies a family of portfolio problems in a Black-Scholes type economy which depend parametrically on the <b>rebalancing</b> frequency. As an objective criterion we use log-utility, which has strong theoretical appeal and represents a natural choice if the primary goal is long-term performance. We argue that continuous <b>rebalancing</b> only slightly outperforms discrete <b>rebalancing</b> if there are no transaction costs and if the <b>rebalancing</b> intervals are shorter than about one year. Our analysis also reveals that diversification has a dual effect on the mean and variance of the portfolio growth rate as well as on their sensitivities with respect to the <b>rebalancing</b> frequency.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} portfolio {{risk and}} volatility {{in the presence}} of constraints on portfolio <b>rebalancing</b> frequency. This investigation is motivated by the incremental risk charge (IRC) introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In contrast to the standard market risk measure based on a 10 -day value-at-risk calculated at 99 % confidence, the IRC considers more extreme losses and is measured over a 1 -year horizon. More importantly, whereas 10 -day VaR is ordinarily calculated with a portfolio’s holdings held fixed, the IRC assumes a portfolio is managed dynamically to a target level of risk, with constraints on <b>rebalancing</b> frequency. The IRC uses discrete <b>rebalancing</b> intervals (e. g., monthly or quarterly) as a rough measure of potential illiquidity in underlying assets. We analyze the effect of these <b>rebalancing</b> intervals on the portfolio’s profit and loss distribution over a risk-measurement horizon. We derive limiting results, as the <b>rebalancing</b> frequency increases, for the difference between discretely and continuously <b>rebalanced</b> portfolios; we use these to approximate the loss distribution for the discretely <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio relative to the continuously <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio. Our analysis leads to explicit measures of the impact of discrete <b>rebalancing</b> under a simple model of asset dynamics.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} error between a {{discretely}} <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio and its continuously <b>rebalanced</b> counterpart {{in the presence}} of jumps or mean-reversion in the underlying asset dynamics. With discrete <b>rebalancing,</b> the portfolio’s composition is restored to a set of fixed target weights at discrete intervals; with continuous <b>rebalancing,</b> the target weights are maintained at all times. We examine the differ-ence between the two portfolios as the number of discrete rebalanc-ing dates increases. With either mean reversion or jumps, we derive the limiting variance of the relative error between the two portfolios. With mean reversion and no jumps, we show that the scaled limiting error is asymptotically normal and independent of the level of the continuously <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio. With jumps, the scaled relative error converges in distribution to the sum of a normal random vari-able and a compound Poisson random variable. For both the mean-reverting and jump-diffusion cases, we derive “volatility adjustments” to improve the approximation of the discretely <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio by the continuously <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio, based on on the limiting covariance between the relative <b>rebalancing</b> error and the level of the continuously <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio. These results are based on strong approximation results for jump-diffusion processes. 1. Introduction. Th...|$|R

25|$|In 2013 Holden {{published}} a novel, Mr. Big Maus, a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture run amok and one iconoclast's mission to <b>rebalance</b> an unjust world. Mr. Big Maus is {{a blend of}} late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational. This is countered by a narrative that is ironic, characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction. Its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. The plot presents universal themes within the context of everyday life and features evolution in its character’s lives. It offers the audience a moral resolution. Substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting. Among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. This is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). A second theme is the changing America landscape—reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants—as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. A final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of technological determinism and independent creative expression.|$|E
