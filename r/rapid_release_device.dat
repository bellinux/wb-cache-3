40|$|In small spacecraft, the {{proximity}} of sensitive components to release systems {{has led to the}} need for lowshock spacecraft release systems. Marmon band systems are often desirable for their flight history, structural capability, and reliability. Until recently, only pyrotechnically released clamp bands were readily available. The clamp band system described in ths paper reduces shock in two ways: it eliminates shock typically associated with pyrotechnic <b>release</b> <b>devices</b> as well as utilizing a <b>release</b> <b>device</b> that reduces the shock associated with the <b>rapid</b> <b>release</b> of the preload strain energy. Patented Fast Acting Shockless Separation Nut (FASSN) technology is utilized to convert strain energy stored in the system into rotational energy of a flywheel. Early FASSN devices were designed for discrete point applications and were somewhat large and massive. Additional development of the FASSN device has reduced the size and weight to enable the use of the technology in a medium sized (12 to 24 inch diameter) clamp band system. This paper describes the overall design, performance, and initial test results for the FASSN-based, non-pyrotechnic, low-shock clamp band release system...|$|R

40|$|Small {{satellites}} {{require a}} variety of <b>release</b> <b>devices</b> to accomplish mission-related functions such as separation from the launch vehicle, separation from each other, and deployment of instruments. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) {{has been working with}} several private companies to develop low shock, nonpyrotechnic spacecraft <b>release</b> <b>devices</b> to mitigate problems with traditional pyrotechnic <b>release</b> <b>devices.</b> Pyrotechnic devices produce high shock, contamination, and have costly handling requirements due to their hazardous nature. Small satellites are particularly susceptible to shock-related failure because of the close proximity of sensors and instruments to the shock source. In addition, small satellites deployed as constellations may experience multiple release shocks from adjoining satellites prior to their own deployment. AFRL has arranged two successful flights for low shock separation devices: the Shape Memory Alloy <b>Release</b> <b>Device</b> (SMARD) experiment on MightySat I in May 1999, and the deployment of the Air Force Academy FalconSat spacecraft from the Orbital Sub-Orbital Program Space Launch Vehicle (OSP-I) in January 00.

The increasingly popular <b>Rapid</b> <b>Release</b> Cycle (RRC) development methodology and easy network software distribution have enabled rapid feature introduc-tion. RRC’s defining characteristic of frequent software re-visions would seem to conflict with traditional software en-gineering wisdom regarding code maturity, reliability and reuse, as well as security. Our investigation of the consequences of <b>rapid</b> <b>release</b> comprises a quantitative, data-driven study of the impact of rapid-release methodology on {{the security of}} the Mozilla Firefox browser. We correlate reported vulnerabilities in multiple <b>rapid</b> <b>release</b> versions of Firefox code against those in corresponding extended release versions of the same system; using a common software base with different release cycles eliminates many causes other than RRC for the observables. Surprisingly, the resulting data show that Firefox RRC does not result in higher vulnerability rates and, further, that it is exactly the unfamiliar, newly released software (the “moving targets”) that requires time to exploit. These provocative results suggest that a rethinking of the consequences of software engineering practices for security may be warranted. 1...|$|R
