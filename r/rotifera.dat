5|$|While {{analyses}} by {{molecular phylogeny}} {{are confident that}} members of Lophotrochozoa are {{more closely related to}} each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. The Lophotrochozoa are generally divided into: Lophophorata (animals that have lophophores), including Phoronida and Brachiopoda; Trochozoa (animals many of which have trochophore larvae), including molluscs, annelids, echiurans, sipunculans and nemerteans; and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and <b>Rotifera).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Rotifera</b> (wheel animalcules) – In the Brachionus genus, {{the male}} pierces the syncytial {{integument}} (equivalent to skin) and injects sperm; in Asplanchna brightwelli the male secretes an enzyme which {{breaks down the}} female integument and injects sperm through the hole.|$|E
25|$|Lagoons or ponds provide {{settlement}} and further biological improvement through storage in large man-made ponds or lagoons. These lagoons are highly aerobic and colonization by native macrophytes, especially reeds, is often encouraged. Small filter-feeding invertebrates such as Daphnia and species of <b>Rotifera</b> greatly assist in treatment by removing fine particulates.|$|E
25|$|Cenotes, sinkholes on the Yucatan {{peninsula}} {{that are}} filled with groundwater, host a number of unique species from bacteria, algae and protozoa (i.e. copepoda, cladocera and <b>rotifera)</b> to vertebrates (i.e.lepisosteus). Cenotes are the main water source for many ancient and contemporary Maya people, as there are no rivers and very few lakes on the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|The marine {{invertebrate}} collection {{is composed of}} specimens from taxa other than crustaceans and molluscs. It includes Annelida, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Cestoda, Cephalochordata, Hemichordata, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Echinodermata, Echiura, Entoprocta, Nematoda, Foraminifera, Phoronida, <b>Rotifera,</b> Turbellaria, Trematoda, Urochordata, Porifera, Priapulida and Sipuncula. Specimens are mostly marine (Western Atlantic and Antarctic Ocean), but some are neotropical freshwater and terrestrial. Containing nearly 200,000 lots and 200 type specimens, the collection was built with the efforts of late-19th-century researchers including Ernst and Eveline Marcus, Gilberto Righi, Luis Roberto Tommasi, Antonio Sérgio Ferreira Ditadi, Jeanete Maron Ramos, Gertrude Rita Kloss and Sérgio de Almeida Rodrigues.|$|E
25|$|The Platyzoa {{include the}} phylum Platyhelminthes, the flatworms. These were {{originally}} considered {{some of the}} most primitive Bilateria, but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors. A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the flukes and tapeworms. Flatworms are acoelomates, lacking a body cavity, as are their closest relatives, the microscopic Gastrotricha. The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate. The most prominent are the <b>Rotifera</b> or rotifers, which are common in aqueous environments. They also include the Acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms, the Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and possibly the Cycliophora. These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are called the Gnathifera.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} of gastrotrichs to other phyla is unclear. Morphology {{suggests that they}} {{are close to the}} Gnathostomulida, the <b>Rotifera,</b> or the Nematoda. On the other hand, genetic studies place them as close relatives of the Platyhelminthes, the Ecdysozoa or the Lophotrochozoa. [...] As of 2011, around 790 species have been described. The phylum contains a single class, divided into two orders: the Macrodasyida and the Chaetonotida. Edward Ruppert et al. report that the Macrodasyida are wholly marine, but two rare and poorly known species, Marinellina flagellata and Redudasys fornerise, are known from fresh water. The Chaetonotida comprises both marine and freshwater species.|$|E
500|$|Nemerteans' affinities with Annelida (including Echiura, Pogonophora, Vestimentifera {{and perhaps}} Sipuncula) and Mollusca make the ribbon-worms members of Lophotrochozoa, which [...] include {{about half of}} the extant animal phyla. Lophotrochozoa groups: those animals that feed using a lophophore (Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Phoronida, Entoprocta); phyla in which most members' embryos develop into trochophore larvae (for example Annelida and Mollusca); and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Sipuncula, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Nemertea, Phoronida, Platyhelminthes and <b>Rotifera).</b> These groupings are based on {{molecular}} phylogeny, which compares sections of organisms DNA and RNA. While analyses by molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{the ever}} active Gosse {{had taken up}} the study of orchids and {{exchanged}} a number of letters on the subject with Darwin, though he never published on it himself. [...] His penultimate enthusiasm was with the genitalia of butterflies about which he published a paper in the Transactions of the Linnean Society But before his death he returned to <b>rotifera,</b> much of his research appearing in a two-volume study with another zoologist, Charles Thomas Hudson.|$|E
2500|$|Gosse {{opened a}} [...] "Classical and Commercial School for Young Gentlemen" [...] while keeping {{detailed}} records of his microscopic investigations of pond life, especially cyclopidae and <b>rotifera.</b> He {{also began to}} preach to the Wesleyan Methodists and lead a Bible class. Nevertheless, in 1842, he became so captivated by {{the doctrine of the}} Second Coming of Christ that he severed his connection with the Methodists and joined the Plymouth Brethren. These dissenters emphasized the Second Coming while rejecting liturgy and an ordained ministry—although they otherwise endorsed the traditional doctrines of Christianity as represented by the creeds of the Methodist and the Anglican Church.|$|E
60|$|In {{looking for}} analogies {{to the facts}} here described, I have already {{referred}} to the minute male Lerneidæ which cling to their females,--to the worm-like males of certain Cephalopoda, parasitic on the females,--and to certain Entozoons, in which the sexes cohere, or even are organically blended by one extremity of their bodies. The females in certain insects depart in structure, nearly or quite as widely from the Order to which they belong, as do these male parasitic Cirripedes; some of these females, like the males {{of the first three}} species of Scalpellum, do not feed, and some, I believe, have their mouths in a rudimentary condition; but in this latter respect, we have, amongst the <b>Rotifera,</b> a closely analogous case in the male of the Asplanchna of Gosse, which was discovered by Mr. Brightwell[62] to be entirely destitute of mouth and stomach, exactly as I find to be the case with the parasitic male of S. vulgare, and doubtless with its two close allies. For any analogy to the existence of males, complemental to hermaphrodites, we must look to the vegetable kingdom.|$|E

A list of these papers is given in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society for 1904, page 49.|$|E
