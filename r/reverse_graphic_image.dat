40|$|The Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) is a {{computer}} network connecting scientific institutions throughout the United States. This network provides an avenue for timely, correlative research between investigators, in a multidisciplinary approach to space physics studies. An objective {{in the development of}} SPAN is to make available direct and simplified procedures that scientists can use, without specialized training, to exchange information over the network. Information exchanges include raw and processes data, analysis programs, correspondence, documents, and graphite images. This handbook details procedures {{that can be used to}} exchange <b>graphic</b> <b>images</b> over SPAN. The intent is to periodically update this handbook to reflect the constantly changing facilities available on SPAN. The utilities described within reflect an earnest attempt to provide useful descriptions of working utilities that can be used to transfer <b>graphic</b> <b>images</b> across the network. Whether <b>graphic</b> <b>images</b> are representative of satellite servations or theoretical modeling and whether <b>graphics</b> <b>images</b> are of device dependent or independent type, the SPAN graphics display utilities handbook will be the users guide to <b>graphic</b> <b>image</b> exchange...|$|R

40|$|The {{new image}} {{compression}} standard JPEG 2000, provides high compression {{rates for the}} same visual quality for gray and color images than JPEG. JPEG 2000 is being adopted for image compression and transmission in mobile phones, PDA and computers. An image may contain the formatted text and graphics data. The compression performance of the JPEG 2000 behaves poorly when compressing an image with low color depth such as <b>graphics</b> <b>images.</b> In this paper, we propose a technique to distinguish the true color <b>images</b> from <b>graphics</b> <b>images</b> and to compress <b>graphics</b> <b>images</b> using a wavelet transform extension under JPEG 2000 standard that will improve the compression performance. This method can be easily adapted in image compression applications without changing the syntax of compressed stream of JPEG 2000...|$|R
