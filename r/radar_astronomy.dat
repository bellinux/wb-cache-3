2500|$|The {{observatory}} {{was built}} between mid-1960 and November 1963 and designed by William E. Gordon of Cornell University, who {{intended to use}} it to study Earth's ionosphere. He was attracted to the sinkholes in the karst regions of Puerto Rico that offered perfect cavities for a very large dish. Originally, a fixed parabolic reflector was envisioned, pointing in a fixed direction with a [...] tower to hold equipment at the focus. This design would have limited its use in other research areas, such as <b>radar</b> <b>astronomy,</b> radio astronomy and atmospheric science, which require the ability to point at different positions in the sky and track those positions for an extended time as Earth rotates. Ward Low of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) pointed out this flaw and put Gordon in touch with the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory (AFCRL) in Boston, Massachusetts, where one group headed by Phil Blacksmith was working on spherical reflectors and another group was studying the propagation of radio waves in and through the upper atmosphere. Cornell University proposed the project to ARPA in mid-1958 and a contract was signed between the AFCRL and the University in November 1959. Cornell University and Zachary Sears published a request for proposals (RFP) asking for a design to support a feed moving along a spherical surface [...] above the stationary reflector. The RFP suggested a tripod or a tower in the center to support the feed. On the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna was announced at Cornell University, Gordon had also envisioned a [...] tower centered in the [...] reflector to support the feed.|$|E

It is well known, however, that the digital beamformers are sensitive to error in the estimated signal steering vector. Any errors in the steering vector will lead to signal distortions and degrade the beamforming performance severely. The causes of steering vector error in practical applications include improper array modeling, pointing error, miscalibration, and source motion {{as well as other}} effects [6 – 10].

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for AOA estimation in colored noise fields and harsh application scenarios. By modeling the unknown noise covariance as a linear combination of known weighting matrices, a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion is established, and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) paradigm is designed to optimize the cost function. Simulation results demonstrate that the paired estimator PSO-ML significantly outperforms other popular techniques and produces superior AOA estimates...|$|R

40|$|A {{measure of}} {{the ability of a}} sensor array to resolve two closely spaced point sources in angle is {{proposed}} here based on the framework of information geometry. The consideration of the geometric structure of a measurement model leads to the concept of information resolution which serves as a new metric to measure intrinsic similarities and differences between signal distributions that generate the manifold geometry. The statistical divergence between two sources is characterized in terms of the geodesic distance induced by the Fisher information metric. An analytical expression of the angular information resolution limit (AIRL) is derived using the constraints on the probability of error for a binary hypothesis test associated with the resolution of two sources. The influence of the detection error as well as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNK) on resolvability are demonstrated.
