5000|$|<b>Private</b> <b>operating</b> {{foundations}} are <b>private</b> foundations {{that use}} {{the bulk of their}} income to provide charitable services or to run charitable programs of their own. They make few, if any, grants to outside organizations. Thus, a <b>private</b> <b>operating</b> foundation sponsors and manages its own programs. A typical example of this would be a day camp for underprivileged children. Rather than providing grants to another organization to administer such a camp, which a standard private foundation would do, the <b>private</b> <b>operating</b> foundation will “operate” the camp. The <b>private</b> <b>operating</b> foundation will maintain a qualified staff as well as other personnel needed to carry out the program on a continuing basis. To qualify as a <b>private</b> <b>operating</b> foundation, specific rules, in addition to the applicable rules for private foundations, must be followed. A private foundation qualifies as a <b>private</b> <b>operating</b> foundation by satisfying two numerical tests. These tests ensure that the <b>private</b> <b>operating</b> foundation is conducting its exempt activities directly and not simply making grants to other organizations. The first of the two tests is an income test, which requires a specific amount of income to be spent on direct charitable activities. The second test is actually made up of three different tests: an asset test, an endowment test and a support test. However, the <b>private</b> <b>operating</b> foundation only has to satisfy one of these three tests, in addition to the income test, to qualify. Similar to the income test, these other three tests help to ensure that the <b>private</b> <b>operating</b> foundation is using its funds to meet the requirement of conducting direct charitable activities. In contrast, a private foundation that principally provides grants to other entities or to individuals for charitable or other exempt purposes would not qualify as an operating foundation, and instead would be called a [...] "nonoperating foundation". The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Getty Trust are examples of operating foundations.|$|R
