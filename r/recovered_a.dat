Westerman and Foster were uninjured while Hyman required two stitches in his forehead. On September 29, against South Florida, Westerman sacked quarterback Matt Grothe for a five-yard loss. After the month of September, Westerman had eight tackles and two and a half sacks. Through eight games, Westerman was the team leader in sacks with six.

5|$|His successor, Tanutamun, {{also made}} a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia. He {{successfully}} defeated Necho, the native Egyptian puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards. Tantamani (Tanutamun) was heavily routed and fled back to Nubia. The Assyrian army sacked Thebes {{to such an extent}} it never truly <b>recovered.</b> <b>A</b> native ruler, Psammetichus I was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, and the Nubians were never again to pose a threat to either Assyria or Egypt.|$|E

5|$|This {{debate is}} still ongoing; at this time, Scelidosaurus is {{considered}} to be either more closely related to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur, or basal to the ankylosaur-stegosaur split. The stegosaur classification has fallen out of favor, but is seen in older dinosaur books. Cladistic analyses have invariably <b>recovered</b> <b>a</b> basal position for Scelidosaurus, outside of the Eurypoda.|$|E

5|$|Alipate {{practice}}d {{with both}} the Los Angeles Raiders and the New York Jets in 1993, but he {{failed to make the}} active rosters for either team. In 1994, Alipate was again among the Jets' final cuts {{before the start of the}} regular season, but he was offered a spot on the team's practice squad. The Jets frequently moved Alipate back and forth from the practice squad and the active roster throughout the season. On November 14, Alipate <b>recovered</b> <b>a</b> botched punt in a 17–10 loss to the Green Bay Packers. Alipate also forced a fumble in a November 27 game against the Miami Dolphins. He finished the season with eight games played for the Jets. When active, Alipate was used mostly on special teams. He was signed to the Green Bay Packers' practice squad in January 1995. He re-signed with the Packers on February 21 and was waived on June 12, 1995.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{played as}} an inside linebacker {{throughout}} the preseason in 1993, {{but he was}} again cut to the practice squad {{before the start of}} the regular season. He was quickly brought back to the active roster and recorded five tackles in the Lions' season-opening win against the Toronto Argonauts. Allen saw regular playing time for the first time in his career, playing in fifteen regular season games for the Lions. He played mostly as a middle linebacker, but he briefly replaced Tyrone Jones twice at the outside linebacker position while he was recovering illness and injury. Allen finished the regular season with 67 tackles, two interceptions, and a fumble recovery. He also <b>recovered</b> <b>a</b> fumble in the Western Semi-Final, but the Lions went on to lose 9–17 to the Stampeders.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{continued}} to be hailed as a relevant writer during the ten years following his death, and his wors went through new critical editions. Pajere was published in spring 1936, having been edited by Marica Caragiale-Sion and Alexandru Rosetti. Later in the year, a volume of collected works, Opere, was published by Rosetti and featured prints made by Mateiu Caragiale at various moments during his lifetime. Large portions of the diaries kept by Mateiu Caragiale are lost. The transcript made by Perpessicius was criticized for having selectively discarded much content, while originals kept by Rosetti were mysteriously lost during the Legionnaires' Rebellion of 1941. Additional notes, which notably featured Caragiale's criticism of his father, were preserved for a while by Șerban Cioculescu, before being borrowed to Ecaterina Logadi, Ion Luca's daughter, and never <b>recovered.</b> <b>A</b> significant number of his drawings and paintings, which Vianu assumed had survived by 1936, have also been misplaced.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Maryland {{was able}} to hold the nation's third-ranked rushing offense to just 114yards on the ground. Nevada quarterback Kaepernick, who ran for 1,115yards, was held to just 19rushing yards, 15of which were gained during a {{touchdown}} run. Two players made their first career interceptions: true freshman safety Kenny Tate and senior defensive back Jeff Allen. Tate's interception in the Maryland end zone prevented a Nevada score, while Allen's interception with 4:54remaining helped seal the victory for Maryland. Offensive lineman Scott Burley forced a fumble against Nevada linebacker Brandon Marshall, who had <b>recovered</b> <b>a</b> third-down fumble by Turner. Burley subsequently recovered the forced fumble and gave Maryland a first down.|$|E
