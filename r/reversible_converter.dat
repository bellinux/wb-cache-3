40|$|The most {{difficult}} problem in constructing the anti-parallel-connected <b>reversible</b> <b>converter</b> {{is how to}} deal with the circulating current. Converter 1 and 2, which operates as a rectifier and an inverter, are often kept conductive simultanously in order to respond quickly to the reversing load current. In this case, a circulating current flows through the two converters because the voltage waveform of converter 1 is different from that of converter 2. Although the circulating current reduces voltage fluctuations caused by the load current variation, it worsens the power factor and efficiency and lowers the utility factor of thyristor elements. In this paper, we have developed the simplified model of the anti-parallel-connected, three phase <b>reversible</b> <b>converter</b> system and used this model to study the effect of gate signal waveforms on the steady-state and transient characteristics of the circulating current...|$|E

40|$|Quantum dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is an {{attractive}} field of nano-technology which offers the various advantages over existing CMOS technology {{for the development of}} logic circuits. Contradictory to other technologies which use the voltage levels for logic representation, QCA utilizes the polarization of electrons for representing the binary states in the QCA Cell. Conventional logic circuits are not energy efficient as they are not reversible in nature and hence lead to energy dissipation. Thus there is a need of a serious effort that will provide an efficient paradigm for designing the circuits which does not dissipation the energy and hence will preserve the information.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel hybrid direct power converter (HDPC) which overcomes {{the two main}} disadvantages of matrix converters: limited voltage transfer ratio and low immunity to grid disturbance. The proposed converter is formed by integrating a <b>reversible</b> auxiliary boost <b>converter</b> in the dc link of the two-stage matrix converter.
