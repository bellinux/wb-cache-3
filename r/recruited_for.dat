5|$|In 1880, Sunday {{relocated}} to Marshalltown, Iowa, where, {{because of his}} athleticism, he had been <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> a fire brigade team. In Marshalltown, Sunday worked at odd jobs, competed in fire brigade tournaments, and played for the town baseball team. In 1882, with Sunday in left field, the Marshalltown team defeated the state champion Des Moines team 13–4.|$|E

5|$|On the {{geographical}} division level, the Delegation had local offices, dividing Polish territories into 16 voivodeships, each under an underground voivode, further divided into powiats headed by starostas, and with separate municipal bodies. In early 1944, the Delegation employed some 15,000 people in its administration; those were primarily older people, as {{the younger ones}} were <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> the military side of the operations.|$|E

5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> force production, as the wings are much more powerful than the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|After a first {{interruption}} in development, {{the project}} was redefined as a short interactive demo for Windows-based personal computers.

In 2004, {{the project was}} publicly closed after Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games for trademark and copyright infringement. Despite its closure, the project has received critical and popular praise.|$|E

5|$|At the war's outset, FRELIMO {{had little}} {{hope for a}} {{conventional}} military victory, with a mere 7000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order to force a negotiated independence from Lisbon. Portugal fought {{its own version of}} protracted warfare, and a large military force was sent by the Portuguese government to quell the unrest, with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967. The number of local soldiers <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> the Portuguese cause rose to 23,000 in the same period. 860 Special Forces operatives were also being trained in Commando Instruction Centres by 1969.|$|E
5|$|By June 1863, Ohio {{had not yet}} fielded an African American combat unit, but Ohio {{blacks were}} being <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> service in the regiments of other states. Beaty enlisted from Cincinnati on June 7, 1863 for a three-year term of service in the Union Army; he was {{among a group of}} men <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> a Massachusetts regiment. He joined as a private but was {{promoted}} to sergeant only two days later. He was placed in charge of a squad of forty-seven other recruits and ordered to report to Columbus, Ohio, from where they would be sent to Boston. Upon arriving in Columbus on June 15, however, they learned that the Massachusetts regiments were full and unable to accept their service. The Governor of Ohio, David Tod, immediately requested permission from the Department of War to form an Ohio regiment of African Americans. Permission was granted, and on June 17, Beaty and his squad became the first members of the 127th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, later re-designated the 5th United States Colored Troops. After three months of recruitment and organization in Camp Delaware, on the Olentangy River outside of Delaware, Ohio, the unit set out for Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, General António Augusto dos Santos was {{relieved}} of command, with General Kaúlza de Arriaga taking over officially in March 1970. Kaúlza de Arriaga favoured {{a more direct}} method of fighting the insurgents, and the established policy of using African counter-insurgency forces was rejected in favour of the deployment of regular Portuguese forces accompanied by {{a small number of}} African fighters. Indigenous personnel were still <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> special operations, such as the Special Groups of Parachutists in 1973, though their role less significant under the new commander. His tactics were partially influenced by a meeting with United States General William Westmoreland.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1450s, Stafford {{might have been}} in the service of his distant {{relative}} John Stafford, Earl of Wiltshire, son of Humphrey Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. His association with James Touchet, Baron Audleyone of Wiltshire's menimplies so. If so, this represent a short episode of loyalty to the House of Lancaster over the House of York in the ongoing civil war. In 1460 the two were sent to Guînes to relieve the English garrison there. Bad weather forced them into the harbour of Calais, which was held by the Yorkist leader Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. Here they were both <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> the Yorkist cause.|$|E

Dann Huff of the melodic hard rock band Giant contributed his lead guitar work to the album. New band members Michael Tyrrell on guitar, Jeff Bruno on guitar and keyboards, and Tony Mac on drums were <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> the following European tour.|$|E
5|$|With {{the team}} in the Premier League, {{there was a need}} to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> a fee of £1.2 million. Shortly after {{arriving}} at the club, however, he became unhappy, citing homesickness from his native Oxford as the reason. Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds' further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player. Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000 which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000 in the deal.|$|E

5|$|After {{fulfilling}} her one-year {{commitment to}} the University of Louisville, Collins was named {{a fellow of the}} Harvard Institute of Politics' John F. Kennedy School of Government, teaching non-credit classes on leadership styles once a week. Concurrent with her position at Harvard, Collins was named to the board of regents for Midway College in 1989; the following year, she was removed from the board of regents of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Her removal was automatically triggered after she missed three consecutive board meetings between 1986 and 1989. In 1990, Collins accepted the presidency of Saint Catharine College in Springfield, Kentucky, becoming the first president of the small, Catholic college who was not a Dominican nun. College officials stated that Collins was <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> the presidency to raise the college's profile.|$|E
5|$|From 1788 until 1870 {{the defence}} of the Australian colonies was mostly {{provided}} by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> colonial service, {{known as the}} New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office {{of the need for}} a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in 1808. As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units.|$|E
5|$|From the 1860s Cornish mines faced {{competition}} from cheap metal imports, and legislation {{introduced in the}} 1870s limited the use of child labour. The Cornish mining system went into terminal decline, leading to a collapse of the local economy and mass emigration both overseas and {{to other parts of}} the United Kingdom. In 1891 the number of bal maidens had fallen to half its peak, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few remained in employment. In 1921 Dolcoath mine, the last employer of bal maidens, ceased operations, bringing the tradition to an end. Other than women <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> ore processing at Geevor as a result of labour shortages during the Second World War, and a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 banned the practice of recruiting only male mineworkers, women never again performed manual labour in Cornish mines. The last surviving bal maiden died in 1968, and with the closure of South Crofty tin mine in 1998, Cornish metals mining came to an end.|$|E

5|$|The Russian–Saxon–Polish allies {{assembled}} their armies in Lithuania for a joint {{offensive against}} the Swedes. Their troops consisted of four contingents; the main Russian army of 50,000 men under Georg Benedict Ogilvy near Polotsk, another 8,000 Russians and 10,000 Lithuanians loyal to Augustus close to Vilnius, about 6,000 Poles and 3,500 Saxons under Otto Arnold von Paykull at Brest-Litovsk and 20,000 Cossacks under Ivan Mazepa in Volhynia. In Saxony close to 20,000 men were <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> the main Saxon army under Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg. In all, {{the allied forces}} enjoyed a massive advantage as their forces counted almost 120,000 men against the 35,000 Swedes and 10,000 Poles and Lithuanians in Poland under Charles and the 6,000 men in Courland under Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt.|$|E
5|$|With Hagrid's help, Harry {{prepares for}} and {{undertakes}} {{his first year}} of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced {{to many of the}} primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: Ron Weasley, a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a gifted, bright, and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage. Harry also encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him, the rich brat Draco Malfoy whom he quickly makes enemies with, and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who later turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. He also discovers a talent of flying on broomsticks and is <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> his house's Quidditch team, a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks. The first book concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite these}} difficulties, by mid1941 the fledgling {{airborne}} establishment {{was able to}} form the first British airborne unit. This was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, which numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks, and had been formed by converting and retraining No. 2 Commando. On 10 February 1941 thirtyeight men from the battalion conducted the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, a raid against an aqueduct in southern Italy; {{it was hoped that}} the destruction of the aqueduct would deprive Italian civilian and military installations of their water supply, damage Italian morale and the Italian war effort in North Africa. The raid was a failure, with {{all but one of the}} airborne troops being captured by Italian military forces, but it did help provide the British airborne establishment with vital lessons for future operations. Shortly after the operation had been conducted, a memorandum was circulated through the War Office by the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Royal Air Force requiring that No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion be expanded into a Parachute Brigade. In July, after a period of discussion about the problems of creating such a formation, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff authorised the raising of a brigade headquarters, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Parachute Battalions and an air troop of sappers from the Royal Engineers. Given the title of 1st Parachute Brigade, volunteers from infantry units were <b>recruited</b> <b>for</b> the new formation from 31 August. Initially commanded by Brigadier Richard Nelson Gale, who was replaced in mid1942 by Brigadier Edwin Flavell, the brigade began an extensive training regime, which included conducting trials and tests of new airborne equipment. On 10 October it was joined by 1 Airlanding Brigade, which had been formed from 31 Independent Brigade Group, a formation recently returned from India. This was shortly followed, on 29 October, by the formation of Headquarters 1st Airborne Division under the command of Brigadier F.A.M. Browning, who would have under his control 1st Parachute Brigade, 1st Airlanding Brigade, and the glider units currently training with the two brigades.|$|E
