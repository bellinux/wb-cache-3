5000|$|The codicology, or {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} manuscript, has been studied by researchers. The manuscript measures 23.5 by 16.2 by 5 cm, with hundreds of vellum pages collected into eighteen quires (units of 25 pages). The total number of pages is around 240, but the exact number depends on how the manuscript's unusual foldouts are counted. The quires have been numbered from 1 to 20 in various locations, using numerals consistent with the 1400s, and the top righthand corner of each recto (<b>righthand)</b> <b>page</b> has been numbered from 1 to 116, using numerals of a later date. From the various numbering gaps in the quires and pages, {{it seems likely that}} in the past the manuscript had at least 272 pages in 20 quires, some of which were already missing when Wilfrid Voynich acquired the manuscript in 1912. There is strong evidence that many of the book's [...] were reordered at various points in its history, and that the original page order may well have been quite different from what it is today.|$|E
50|$|A {{generalized}} calendar (not {{specific to}} any year) of church feasts and saints' days, often illuminated with {{representations of the}} Labours of the Months, is a usual {{part of a book}} of hours, but the illustrations of the months in the Très Riches Heures are exceptional and innovative in their size, and the best known element of the decoration of the manuscript. Up to this point any scenes of the labours had been smaller images on the same page as the calendar text, though later 15th-century calendars often adopted the Limbourg's innovation of a full-page miniature, though most had smaller pages than here. They were also unprecedented in mostly showing one of the duke's castles in the background. They are filled with details of the delights and labors of the months, from the Duke's court to his peasants, a counterpart to the prayers of the hours. Each illustration is surmounted with its appropriate hemisphere showing a solar chariot, the signs and degrees of the zodiac, and numbering the days of the month and the martyrological letters for the ecclesiastic lunar calendar. Each month of the calendar is allotted an opening of two pages, on the <b>righthand</b> <b>page</b> the calendar listing notable feast days and on the left the miniature. January is the largest miniature in the calendar and includes the Duke of Berry at a New Year’s Day feast (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969).|$|E
