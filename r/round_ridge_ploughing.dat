25|$|A <b>ridging</b> <b>plough</b> is {{used for}} crops, such as {{potatoes}} or scallions, which are grown buried in ridges of soil using a technique called ridging or hilling. A <b>ridging</b> <b>plough</b> has two mouldboards facing away from each other, cutting a deep furrow on each pass, with high ridges either side. The same plough {{may be used to}} split the ridges to harvest the crop.|$|R

50|$|These plains are crossed by many streams, {{separated}} by low, <b>rounded</b> <b>ridges,</b> and dotted with small gneiss hills, outliers {{of the main}} mountain range.|$|R
25|$|This is {{a variety}} of <b>ridge</b> <b>plough</b> notable in that the blade points towards the operator. It is used solely by human effort rather than with animal or machine assistance, and is pulled {{backwards}} by the operator, requiring great physical effort. It is particularly used for second breaking of ground, and for potato planting. It is found in Shetland, some western crofts and more rarely Central Scotland. The tool is typically found on small holdings too small or poor to merit use of animals.|$|R

2500|$|From {{the top of}} Great Rigg {{the main}} <b>ridge</b> <b>ploughs</b> on due south, {{descending}} {{over the tops of}} Heron Pike and Nab Scar and carrying the ever popular Fairfield horseshoe walk. A second shorter ridge descends steadily to the south west over gradually roughening ground, until after three quarters of a mile a rock outcrop is thrust up. This is Arthur's Chair and the ridge upon which it stands is Stone Arthur. Prominence is negligible, and other than the low outcrop itself, the [...] "summit" [...] is merely {{the point at which the}} gradient steepens markedly.|$|R

50|$|The outer rim of Casatus is old and worn, {{with many}} tiny impacts along {{the rim and}} inner wall. The small {{satellite}} crater Casatus J lies across the south-southeastern rim.

5000|$|The park protects {{an area of}} the Taiga Shield Ecozone (CEC), {{including}} boreal forest, {{rivers and}} lakes, and low-lying wetlands forming extensive peatlands (bogs and fens). The park has a fairly rolling terrain with many rocky outcrops.

25|$|The summit area of Great Dodd {{is a short}} <b>rounded</b> <b>ridge,</b> {{covered with}} grass but with many stones lying among it, and with the highest point at the north-west end {{where there is a}} cairn. This was not present in 1955 when Alfred Wainwright {{published}} his Pictorial Guide. The original cairn is a substantial affair, about 100metres south of the highest point, and it incorporates a wind shelter.|$|R
5|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical to ellipsoidal, {{measuring}} 7.9–9.5 by 8.0–8.8µm. They feature surface ornamentations up to 0.8µm high {{and an almost}} complete reticulum comprising broad, <b>rounded</b> <b>ridges.</b> The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are somewhat cylindrical, four-spored, and measure 50–70 by 9–11µm.

50|$|The Ziama Massif extends northeast-southwest, {{continuing}} {{south into}} Liberia as the Kpo Range. The eastern slopes are drained by the St. Paul River, {{and the western}} slopes by the Lofa River; both rivers drain southwest through Liberia to empty into the Atlantic Ocean. The highest points of the massif reach to almost 1,400 meters above sea level. The forested landscape includes valleys, plateaus, <b>rounded</b> <b>ridges,</b> rocky peaks, sheer cliffs and granite outcrops.|$|R
50|$|Phyllidiella zeylanica is characterised by its numerous, very tuberculate, pink ridges which curve to join {{anteriorly}} and posteriorly (but may be interrupted), its pale foot sole, and {{its dark}} triangular oral tentacles. It differs from Phyllidiella pustulosa {{which does not}} possess ridges, and from Phyllidiella rosans, which possesses relatively smooth <b>rounded</b> <b>ridges</b> (very tuberculate in P. zeylanica). For specimens of similar size, the rhinophoral clavus of P. zeylanica possesses fewer lamellae than P. rosans.|$|R

5000|$|The parish, {{is intimately}} {{associated}} with the region's soils. The {{southern part of the}} parish, south of the EN 270, is based in limestone, characterized by superficial deposits that extend from the sub-soils. To the north, and parallel the limestone areas, is a narrow strip of red sandstone, known as the grés de Silves, locally referred to as arneiro or pedra amoladeira. To the north of this zone is a mountainous schist zone, with heavily carved valleys and <b>rounded</b> <b>ridges.</b>|$|R

These plains are crossed by many streams, separated by low, <b>rounded</b> <b>ridges,</b> and dotted with small gneiss hills, outliers of the main mountain range.The mountains are sharply faulted and {{are the source of}} many year-round rivers.|$|R

50|$|Isoetes hieroglyphica is {{a species}} of quillwort in the Isoetaceae family. It {{can be found in}} lakes of Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine, and Wisconsin, though {{relatively}} few of these species have been found and the distribution is poorly understood. It bears 7 to 15 leaves, each 5 to 11 centimeters long. Sporangium can be 5 millimeters long and 3 millimeters wide, covered about one third by the velum. White, spherical megaspores are 580 to 700 micrometers in diameter, their <b>rounded</b> <b>ridges</b> forming a network. The relatively smooth kidney-shaped microspores are 37 to 45 micrometers long.|$|R

There was a <b>ridge</b> of <b>ploughed</b> land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still {{remained}} upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.|$|R

Exteriorly, towards the bottom of the valve, from the overlapping of the scuta, of the latera, and of the carina, only a narrow <b>rounded</b> <b>ridge</b> is exposed, which runs down to the basal angle at about one third of the entire width of the valve, from the scutal margin. Internally the valve is slightly concave.|$|R
50|$|September 14, 1974 on ABC's Wide World of Entertainment {{promoter}} Mike Anderson introduced PKA 'full-contact' karate. In the bouts, competitors wore foam {{hand and}} foot protection and fought to the knockout (Kickboxing rules allowed for leg kicks: full-contact karate rules did not permit kicks to the legs). Lewis, the retired US Heavyweight Kickboxing champion was accustomed to full contact fighting. In 1974 he beat his only opponent in the new sport of full contact karate with a 2nd <b>round</b> <b>ridge</b> hand knockout over Yugoslavia's Frank Brodar in Los Angeles, California to win the Professional Karate Association (PKA) Heavyweight full-contact karate title.|$|R
50|$|The 27,500-acre Fort Ross-Seaview American viticultural area {{is located}} {{in the western part of}} Sonoma County and {{contains}} 18 commercial vineyards on 506 acres. It lies entirely within the Sonoma Coast AVA and does not overlap other AVAs. Vineyards within this area are generally located on <b>rounded</b> <b>ridges</b> with summits extending above 1,200 feet consisting of steep, mountainous terrain made up of canyons, narrow valleys, ridges, and 800- to 1,800-foot peaks. Areas above 900 feet in elevation, the climate is influenced by longer periods of sunlight and is warmer than that in the surrounding land below.|$|R

50|$|Traces of {{traditional}} <b>ridge</b> and furrow <b>ploughing</b> survive {{in much of}} the parish, and particularly in the south. They are evidence of the open field system of farming that prevailed in the parish until 1758, when Parliament passed the Inclosure Act for Helmdon.|$|R
50|$|Growth {{lamellae}} are evident; {{like the}} machaeridians, they overlap along {{the axis of}} symmetry.Overall, Tumulduria consists of a central, slightly <b>rounded</b> <b>ridge,</b> with two lateral 'flaps', giving it an appearance superficially resembling a trilobite's head-shield.; indeed, {{it has been in}} considered in the past to be a trilobite (Federov et al. 1977). However, it is probably phosphatic, unlike trilobites, and it the details of its morphology do not conform to that of trilobites. As such it excited considerable interest and controversy as suggesting the presence of trilobites in the Tommotian, purportedly a pre-trilobite period. However, this has not been borne up by subsequent study.|$|R
