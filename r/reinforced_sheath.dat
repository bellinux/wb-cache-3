40|$|Iron-based superconductors {{have been}} {{considered}} to be very promising in high-field applications, for which multifilamentary wire and tape conductors with high mechanical strength are essential. In this work, 7 -, 19 - and 114 -filament Sr 0. 6 K 0. 4 Fe 2 As 2 (Sr- 122) superconducting wires and tapes with silver as matrix and iron as outer <b>reinforcing</b> <b>sheath</b> were produced by the ex situ powder-in-tube method. The mass densities of Sr- 122 phase in 7 - and 19 -filament conductors were investigated by microhardness characterization, which revealed {{a positive correlation between}} hardness and transport critical current density (Jc) in round wires and flat tapes with various thicknesses. For Sr- 122 /Ag/Fe 114 -filament conductors, in which an average cross-sectional filament size smaller than 50 microns was achieved by drawing into round wires of 2. 0 mm in diameter, the transport Jc can be significantly enhanced by flat rolling, as for the 7 - and 19 -filament conductors. The highest transport Jc of the 7 -, 19 - and 114 -filament Sr- 122 /Ag/Fe tapes reached 1. 4 x 10 ^ 4, 8. 4 x 10 ^ 3 and 6. 3 x 10 ^ 3 A cm- 2 (4. 2 K, 10 T), respectively, showing a Jc degradation with the increase of filament number. This Jc degradation can be ascribed to the sausage effect for filaments in longitudinal direction and the grain refinement in these very fine filaments. Comment: 27 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{prepared}} and characterized monofilamentary MgB 2 wires with a mechanically <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>sheath</b> of Ta(Nb) /Cu/steel, {{which leads to}} dense filaments and correspondingly high transport currents up to Jc = 10 ^ 5 A/cm^ 2 at 4. 2 K, self field. The reproducibility of the measured transport currents was excellent and not depending on the wire diameter. Using different precursors, commercial reacted powder or an unreacted Mg/B powder mixture, a strong influence on the pinning behaviour and the irreversibility field was observed. The critical transport current density showed a nearly linear temperature dependency for all wires being still 52 kA/cm^ 2 at 20 K and 23 kA/cm^ 2 at 30 K. Detailed data for Jc(B,T) and Tc(B) were measured. Comment: 21 pages, 13 figures, revised version, {{to be published in}} Supercond. Sci. Techno...|$|R
40|$|Monofilamentary MgB 2 -wires with a 2 - or 3 -component <b>sheath</b> {{containing}} mechanical <b>reinforcing</b> {{stainless steel}} (SS) were prepared and characterized. In direct contact to the superconductor Nb, Ta or Fe was used. For {{a selection of}} samples with a Fe and Fe/SS sheath, we investigated the transport critical current behaviour in magnetic fields changing systematically the geometrical shape from a round wire to a flat tape. A strong increase of the current densities in flat tapes was observed and possible reasons for this are discussed. <b>Reinforcing</b> the <b>sheath</b> in the outer layer with different amounts of stainless steel leads to a systematic field dependent decrease of the transport critical current density with increasing steel amount. This is an indication for a pre-stress induced degradation of the critical currents in MgB 2 wires and first Ic-stress-strain experiments seem to confirm this observation and interpretation.

40|$|Natural fiber {{composites}} (NFC) {{being one}} of the new interventions in the composite industry, is given less importance for tribological applications. In the current research, an in-depth study is made to understand the influence of normal force and speed, affecting the tribological characteristics. Various forms of lignocellulosic fibers exist, out of which coconut fibers are advantageous due to its naturally woven state. Tribological characterization was performed using a ball on disc configuration. Online measurements of friction force elucidate that the friction characteristics of naturally woven coconut <b>sheath</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer (CSRP) composite stabilize at increased speed. Moreover, the orientation of the fiber strongly influences mode of wear...|$|R
50|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been <b>reinforced,</b> because the <b>sheath</b> would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The genus Hymenaea is {{characterized}} by a great diversity of secretory structures, but there are no reports of colleters yet. The objectives of this study are to report the occurrence and describe the origin and structure of colleters in Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne. Shoot apex samples were collected, fixed, and processed for light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy as per usual methods. Colleters occur predominantly on the stipule’s adaxial side. These structures are found at the base on a narrow strip, corresponding to the median vein up to half the length of the stipule. When present on the abaxial side, they are concentrated at the base and restricted to the margins. Colleters develop from the protoderm; they are elongate and club-shaped. Their body has no stratification; their surface cells differ from the inner cells only in position and presence of cuticle. Colleter cells have thin walls, dense cytoplasm, large nuclei, many mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and abundant dictyosomes. Histochemical tests with Ruthenium red showed pectic compounds in the cytosol. In H. stigonocarpa, colleter arrangement is compatible with the hypothesis that they protect shoot apex. In this species, protection is <b>reinforced</b> by the <b>sheath</b> forme...|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, a {{study was}} {{published}} on the soft parts visible with the [...] "Victoria" [...] specimen. It preserves both true impressions of the skin into the surrounding sediment, and natural casts, where the spaces {{left behind by the}} rotting of the soft body parts have been filled in with sediment. Additionally on some areas a black layer is present, possibly consisting of organic remains or bacterial mats. A part of the lower trunk flank shows rows of small hexagonal, non-overlapping, convex scales, two to seven millimetres in diameter. Higher on the flank two rosette structures are visible with larger central scales, one being twenty by ten millimetres in size, the other ten by eight millimetres. Apart from the scales, an impression of the lower side of a back plate has been found, covering about two hundred square centimetres. This shows no scales but a smooth surface with low parallel vertical ridges. As it is a true impression, with the life animal grooves would have been present. These grooves would have been about half a millimetre deep and stood about two millimetres apart. The impression probably represented the horn sheath of the plate, as would be confirmed by vertical traces of veins. It is the first direct proof of such sheaths with any stegosaurian. The study considered the presence of a sheath to be a strong indication that the plate had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate as a whole and provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been <b>reinforced,</b> because the <b>sheath</b> would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly coloured. Thermoregulation, on the other hand — another often assumed rôle of the plates — would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the horn covering.|$|R
