5|$|Salford is {{credited}} as {{the birthplace of}} the Bush <b>Roller</b> <b>Chain.</b> Hans Renold, a Swiss-born engineer, came to Salford in the late 19th century. In 1879 he purchased a small textile-chain making business in Ordsall from James Slater and founded the Hans Renold Company, what is now Renold, a firm which still produces chains. Renold invented the bush <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> shortly after and began producing it. It is the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles, motorbikes, to industrial and agricultural machinery to uses as varied as rollercoasters and escalators.|$|E
25|$|The X-ring {{chain is}} a {{specialized}} type of sealed <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> used to transfer mechanical power. Like the O-ring chain {{it is used}} in high performance motorcycles. It uses X-ring seal to keep lubricant(usually grease) in place.|$|E
25|$|The X-ring {{chain is}} {{developed}} from O-ring chain {{which in turn}} is developed from non O-ring chain. While the regular O-ring chain has high durability, it also has more friction(compared to other types of <b>roller</b> <b>chain)</b> due to distortion of the O-ring due to pressure from the inner and outer chain plates. This results in loss of power in the transmission. Therefore, X-ring chain was developed by replacing O-ring seal with X-ring seal which increased durability and greatly reduced friction.|$|E
5000|$|In older {{automobile}} engines <b>roller</b> <b>chains</b> would traditionally {{drive the}} camshaft(s) off the crankshaft, generating less noise than a gear drive {{as used in}} very high performance engines, and offering more durability than the timing belt frequently used on more modern engines. Many modern automobile engines still use <b>roller</b> <b>chains,</b> which are more durable than timing belts.|$|R

5000|$|Chainsaw cutting <b>chains</b> superficially {{resemble}} <b>roller</b> <b>chains</b> but {{are more}} closely related to leaf chains. They are driven by projecting drive links which also serve to locate the chain onto the bar.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the medal}} could be won {{multiple}} times, each subsequent award {{is indicated by}} the award of a clasp which is inscribed with the ship's name, year, gun bore and gun type. The clasp {{was designed to be}} attached to the suspender with rivets, in <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> fashion. Only 53 men ever won a clasp to the medal. The clasp depicted alongside was awarded to 208318 Able Seaman H. Croton of the HMS Warrior who had won his medal in 1907, as the 1908 champion on the 7½ inch 50-calibre breech loading naval gun.|$|E
25|$|On chain timpani, {{the tension}} rods are {{connected}} by a <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> {{much like the one}} found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including steel cable. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it with his foot. Professionals may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.|$|E
25|$|The medal can be won {{multiple}} times. Each subsequent {{award is}} indicated by the award of another clasp, which displays {{the year of the}} subsequent award. The clasps are designed to be attached to the suspender and to each other with rivets, in <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> fashion. When medals are not worn, the award of second and subsequent clasps are denoted by silver rosettes on the ribbon bar. Since it is impossible to sew more than four rosettes onto a single ribbon bar and since several champions have won the award more than five times, gold rosettes were introduced to cover situations where more than five championships have been won.|$|E
5000|$|Chains {{are also}} used in forklifts using {{hydraulic}} rams as a pulley to raise and lower the carriage; however, these chains are not considered <b>roller</b> <b>chains,</b> but are classified as lift or leaf chains.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>chains</b> {{are used}} in low- to mid-speed drives at around 600 to 800 feet per minute; however, at higher speeds, around 2,000 to 3,000 feet per minute, V-belts are {{normally}} used due to wear and noise issues.|$|R
5000|$|Those {{designed}} for transferring power in machines have links designed {{to mesh with}} {{the teeth of the}} sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. They are known as <b>roller</b> <b>chains,</b> though there are also non-roller chains such as block chain.|$|R

When medals are not worn, the award of second and subsequent clasps are denoted by silver rosettes on the ribbon bar. Since it is impossible to sew more than four rosettes onto a single ribbon bar, gold rosettes were introduced to provide for situations where more than five championships have been won. One champion, Warrant Officer T.A. Sands of the Royal Marines, has already won the award six times.|$|E
2500|$|The clasps were {{attached}} to the suspender and {{to each other in}} <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> fashion with rivets. The [...] date clasps, in a pair or singly, were often issued to an eligible recipient after the medal, with the result that clasps were frequently attached with unofficial rivets, or worn loose on the ribbon if the recipient didn't bother to have them attached.|$|E
2500|$|Commencing around July 1956, in a {{back room}} at the Meadows factory, a {{prototype}} vehicle, nicknamed The Bug was constructed and developed. This small, four-wheeled, two-seater, utilized a moulded fibreglass shell with gull-wing doors and a Villiers air-cooled [...] two-cylinder engine fitted to a brazed ladder-type chassis. To make a differential unnecessary, the car used a very narrow rear track, with drive to the solid rear axle by <b>roller</b> <b>chain.</b> The car was fitted with a four-speed motorcycle manual gearbox, with reverse obtained by running the engine backwards through the Dynastart unit.|$|E
25|$|The four-cylinder Miller {{fan engine}} drove two wooden two-blade {{counter-rotating}} propellers {{by means of}} two <b>roller</b> <b>chains.</b> A safety device would block both propellers in case {{of the failure of}} one of the chains. The blade pitch could be adjusted while the aircraft was on the ground.|$|R

2500|$|The Radley-England Waterplane was a four-bay biplane with ailerons {{fitted to}} the top wing only. [...] A single {{horizontal}} stabiliser and elevator with twin balanced rudders mounted below it were carried on four wire-braced booms behind the wing. The crew and passengers were carried {{in a pair of}} flat-bottomed floats suspended on struts underneath the lower wing. [...] It was powered by three 50hp (37kW) Gnome Omega rotary engines arranged in line above the wing centre section, each connected by a <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> to a long shaft at the rear of which was a four-bladed propeller 9ft 10in (3m) diameter. [...] To protect the occupants from the oil thrown out, the front engine was partially enclosed by an aluminium cowling.|$|E
2500|$|The M242 Bushmaster is a 25 mm (25×137mm) chain-fed autocannon. It is used {{extensively}} by the United States and NATO forces in ground combat vehicles and watercraft. Originally, the weapon {{was designed and}} manufactured by McDonnell Douglas. it is now produced by ATK at its Mesa, Arizona facility. It is an externally powered, chain driven, single-barrel weapon which may be fired in semi-automatic, burst, or automatic modes. It is fed by a metallic link belt and has dual-feed capability. The term [...] "chain gun" [...] derives {{from the use of}} a <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> that drives the bolt back and forth. The gun can destroy lightly armored vehicles and aerial targets, such as helicopters and slow-flying aircraft. It can also suppress enemy positions such as exposed troops, dug-in positions, and occupied built-up areas. The standard rate of fire is 200 rounds per minute. The weapon has an effective range of , {{depending on the type of}} ammunition used.|$|E
2500|$|The Friskysprint was a {{prototype}} sports racing car {{built at the}} Meadows factory and said {{to be capable of}} [...] Press reports stated that on production versions the front suspension and probably the chassis and running gear would be made at the Vickers–Armstrongs (Aircraft) factory at South Marston. The prototype was finished in the American national racing colours of white with a blue stripe. It featured two bucket seats and a three-cylinder air-cooled [...] Excelsior engine mounted transversely in the frame with final drive by <b>roller</b> <b>chain.</b> Unlike all other Friskys, the rear axle was full width and fitted with a differential. The car was also independently sprung using a swing axle layout. It was expected to sell for between £675 and £750 including purchase tax. The Friskysprint never reached production and Gordon Bedson who designed and built the prototype left to join Lightburn in Australia the following spring to produce the Zeta Sports. The Friskysprint and Zeta Sports had some similarities in styling but were otherwise unconnected and despite Lightburn advertising to the contrary, Giovanni Michelotti was not involved in the design of either car.|$|E

2500|$|Powertrain {{detail of}} the Audi V8 {{featured}} one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed timing belt, driven {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timing belt. This method reduced the complexity of the timing belt layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the timing belt and associated components. [...] The intervals for changing the timing belts varied; the 3.6V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at [...] A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. [...] This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller engine oil cooler.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{embedded}} {{system can be}} defined as a computing device that does a specific focused job. Appliances such as the air-conditioner, VCD player, DVD player, printer, fax machine, mobile phone etc. are examples of {{embedded system}}s. Each of these appliances will have a processor and special hardware to meet the specific requirement of the application along with the embedded software that is executed by the processor for meeting that specific requirement. Some of the mobile robots are designed to operate only on natural terrains, but some other also for rough terrains and artificial environments including stairways. In the age of ubiquitous systems it is necessary to be able to monitor the robots from everywhere. Although many methods to remotely control robots have been devised, the methods have the problems such as the need for special devices or software to control the robots. This paper suggests an advanced method for robotic control using the DTMF technology. Until recent years, the stair climbing robots are designed with vast hardware and robots are equipped with wheels to climb stairs or to move on a flat surface. The controlling mechanism has been advanced with the development of mobile robots. This paper addresses the design and implementation of DTMF controlled stair climbing robot. This climbing robot is operated with ARM 7 TDMI (LPC 2148) controller. The mechanical design of the robot contains the <b>roller</b> <b>chains</b> instead of wheels and rubber blocks are attached to the <b>roller</b> <b>chains</b> to generate high friction with ground. Experimental trials showed that the implementation of the behaviour control systems was successful. Keywords—Control, mobile Robot, PIC LPC 2148, DTMF technology, <b>roller</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R
