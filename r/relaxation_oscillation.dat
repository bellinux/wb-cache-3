40|$|Two {{different}} oscillation modes in microdischarge with parallel-plate geometry {{has been}} observed: <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillations</b> with frequency range between 1. 23 and 2. 1 kHz and free-running oscillations with 7 kHz frequency. The oscillation modes are induced by increasing {{power supply voltage}} or discharge current. For a given power supply voltage, there is a spontaneous transition from one to other oscillation mode and vice versa. Before the transition from <b>relaxation</b> to free-running <b>oscillations,</b> the spontaneous increase of <b>oscillation</b> frequency of <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillations</b> form 1. 3 kHz to 2. 1 kHz is measured.

50|$|Relative {{intensity}} noise can {{be generated}} from cavity vibration, fluctuations in the laser gain medium or simply from transferred intensity noise from a pump source. Since intensity noise typically {{is proportional to the}} intensity, the relative intensity noise is typically independent of laser power. Hence, when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is limited by RIN, it does not depend on laser power. In contrast, when SNR is limited by shot noise, it improves with increasing laser power. RIN typically peaks at the <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillation</b> frequency of the laser then falls off at higher frequencies until it converges to the shot noise level. The roll off frequency sets what is specified as the RIN bandwidth. RIN is sometimes referred to as a kind of 1/f noise otherwise known as pink noise.|$|E

40|$|A chaos-based {{communication}} scheme allowing simultaneous bidirectional message transmission (Opt. Lett. 32, 403, 2007) is investigated numerically. Incoherent feedback and coupling case is analyzed, {{which is expected}} in real long-distance optical communication systems. It is shown that identical synchronization of chaotic laser waveforms and bidirectional message transmission are possible as in the coherent coupling case. However, the chaotic regime at incoherent feedback and coupling is quite different. It is regular destabilized <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillations</b> with the chaotic envelope. Such dynamics leads to restriction of the transmitting signal bit rate by a portion of <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillations</b> frequency. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility to}} suppress noise-induced intensity pulsations (<b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillations)</b> in semiconductor lasers {{by means of a}} time-delayed feedback control scheme. This idea is first studied in a generic normal form model, where we derive an analytic expression for the mean amplitude of the oscillations and demonstrate that it can be strongly modulated by varying the delay time. We then {{investigate the}} control scheme analytically and numerically in a laser model of Lang-Kobayashi type and show that <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillations</b> excited by noise can be very efficiently suppressed via feedback from a Fabry-Perot resonator.

40|$|Measurement of {{the laser}} relaxation-oscillation {{frequency}} {{as a function of}} pump rate allows one to determine parameters {{of the laser}} medium or cavity.

In the equations describing the <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillations,</b> we replace the lifetime of the upper laser level by an effective lifetime that takes the luminescence quenching into account. In an Al 2 O 3 :Yb 3 + distributed-feedback laser we observe significant quenching, with the effective lifetime being ~ 18 times shorter than the intrinsic upper-laser-level lifetime...|$|R
