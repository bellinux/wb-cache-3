25|$|However, {{the time}} average of a {{function}} of the form cos(ωt+k) is zero provided that ω is nonzero. Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match. In other words, it is possible to calculate active (average) power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers. Furthermore, if we assume the voltage of the mains supply is a single frequency (which it usually is), this shows that harmonic currents are a bad thing. They will increase the <b>rms</b> <b>current</b> (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the active power transferred. Hence, harmonic currents will reduce the power factor. Harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device. Typically this will consist of either just a capacitor (relying on parasitic resistance and inductance in the supply) or a capacitor-inductor network. An active power factor correction circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity.|$|E

The {{need for}} efficient, power dense, high {{frequency}} DC-DC converters {{is becoming more}} important in applications such as on board voltage regulation modules for low voltage microprocessors {{as well as the}} interconnection system of the two parallel DC-busses present in future automobiles. These applications have a few basic criteria in common, namely, that they exhibit a low voltage conversion ratio, demand a high power capability as well as a high power density and have no explicit need for galvanic isolation. For applications that fit this description, a new innovative conversion system is presented and critically evaluated against similar converters on the bases of efficiency and component <b>rms</b> <b>currents.</b> The comparison involves four such DC-DC converters, from which two are new topologies brought about by the new innovative system configuration.
