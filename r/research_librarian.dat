40|$|Copyright law {{affects the}} work of {{academic}} and <b>research</b> <b>librarians</b> pervasively and in complex ways, because the great bulk of these librarians’ work deals with accessing, storing, exhibiting, or providing access to copyrighted material. The rights of copyright holders create incentives for the publication of important work that forms the core of library collections, {{while at the same}} time constraining academic and <b>research</b> <b>librarians</b> in the exercise of their mission. Similarly, limitations on and exceptions to copyright rights enable academic and <b>research</b> <b>librarians</b> to use copyrighted materials in important ways, but impose limits and responsibilities of their own. In addition to specific exceptions for libraries and educators, academic and <b>research</b> <b>librarians</b> use the important general exemption of fair use to accomplish their mission. Fair use is the right to use copyrighted material without permission or payment under some circumstances, especially when the cultural or social benefits of the use are predominant.  ...|$|R

40|$|Academic and {{research}} libraries are {{key players in}} the generation and propagation of knowledge in the U. S., and their interpretation of the balancing features of copyright is critical to the quality of research, teaching, and learning they support. Approaches and methods for research, teaching, and learning are changing rapidly with opportunities presented by digitization and Internet communication. Academic and <b>research</b> <b>librarians</b> need and use the balancing features of copyright—including exemptions listed in Sections 108 and 110 of the Copyright Act, as well as fair use (codified in Section 107) —in order to accomplish the routine tasks of their profession. This report investigates how academic and <b>research</b> <b>librarians</b> today are interpreting fair use to meet the missions of U. S. academic {{and research}} libraries. The authors conclude that academic and <b>research</b> <b>librarians</b> would benefit from a code of best practices in fair use for their community and from greater access to legal counsel who are well-versed in copyright, as well as closer scrutiny and negotiation of licensing terms...|$|R
