40|$|We {{consider}} here a {{class of}} Impulse Radiating Antenna that uses two surfaces to direct the aperture field rays into a plane wave. Such designs can {{have a number of}} advantages over classical reflector or lens IRAs which use only a single surface. These new designs can reduce the total volume of an antenna, for a given level of high-frequency performance. These designs {{can also be used to}} achieve better and/or more flexible impedance matching to a source. The designs discussed here include the <b>Reflector</b> <b>Lens</b> IRA (ReLIRA), the Split IRA (SPIRA) and the Cassegrain IRA (CasIRA). The ReLIRA is discussed for reflectors of planar, paraboloidal and hyperboloidal shapes, and for lenses of planar and prolate spheroidal shapes. The SPIRA is a technique for combining two half IRAs (HIRAs) into a transmit/receive pair. The CasIRA is a technique for combining a hyperboloidal subreflector with a large paraboloidal main reflector. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{luminescence}} system of Siphamia versicolor (Perciformes: Apogonidae) identified a ventral light organ, <b>reflector,</b> <b>lens,</b> duct, and a ventral diffuser extending from the throat to the caudal peduncle. The control and function of luminescence in this and other species of Siphamia, however, have not been defined. Morphological examination of fresh and preserved specimens identified additional components of the luminescence system involved in control and ventral emission of luminescence, including a retractable shutter over the ventral face of the light organ, contiguity of the ventral diffuser from the caudal peduncle to near the chin, and transparency of the bones and other tissues of the lower jaw. The shutter halves retract laterally, allowing the ventral release of light, and relax medially, blocking ventral light emission; topical application of norepinephrine to the exposed light organ resulted in retraction of the shutter halves, which suggests that operation of the shutter is under neuromuscular control. The extension of the diffuser to near the chin and transparency of the lower jaw allow a uniform emission of luminescence over the entire ventrum of the fish. The live aquarium‐held fish were found to readily and consistently display ventral luminescence. At twilight, the fish left the protective association with their longspine sea urchin, Diadema setosum, and began to emit ventral luminescence and to feed on zooplankton. Ventral luminescence illuminated a zone below and around the fish, which typically swam close to the substrate. Shortly after complete darkness, the fish stopped feeding and emitting luminescence. These observations suggest that S. versicolor uses ventral luminescence to attract and feed on zooplankton from the reef benthos at twilight. Ventral luminescence may allow S. versicolor to exploit for feeding the gap at twilight {{in the presence of}} potential predators as the reef transitions from diurnally active to nocturnally active organisms.

40|$|Abstract — A solar {{tracking}} {{system is a}} generic term used to describe devices that orient various payloads toward the sun. Payloads can be photovoltaic panels, <b>reflectors,</b> <b>lenses</b> or other optical devices. This paper describes a potential solar system using two stepper motors, light sensor and a concave mirror. This method not only improves power collection efficiency by about 65 % by developing a system that tracks the sun to keep the solar panel at perpendicular to its rays but also decreases the overall cost of production. This solar {{tracking system}} is designed, practically implemented and experimentally tested. The design details and the experimental results are shown...|$|R

25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall {{amount of light}} within the low beam, since the entire <b>reflector</b> and <b>lens</b> area is used, {{but at the same}} time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different low and high beam light distributions. The high beam is usually a rough copy of the low beam, shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the low beam. However, low beam focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the <b>reflector</b> and <b>lens</b> are reserved for high beam formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and high beams.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to place in {{perspective}} various broad classes of microwave antenna types and to discuss key functional and qualitative limitations. The goal is to assist the user and program manager groups in matching applications with anticipated performance capabilities of large microwave space antenna con figurations with apertures generally from 100 wavelengths upwards. The microwave spectrum of interest is taken from 500 MHz to perhaps 1000 GHz. The types of antennas discussed are phased arrays, <b>lenses,</b> <b>reflectors,</b> and hybrid combinations of phased arrays with <b>reflectors</b> or <b>lenses.</b> The performance characteristics of these broad classes of antennnas are examined and compared. Given that large antennas in space are required in the 50 -dB-gain category, the passive reflector type antenna remains the only demonstrated approach, albeit the available demonstrations are using ground-based reflectors. When high-gain systems are considered {{in the context of}} low-noise-level reception, the reflector antennas class is found virtually lossless and therefore desirable; further, the reflecto...|$|R

Furthermore, the light organ contains a network of unique <b>reflector</b> and <b>lens</b> tissues that help reflect and focus the light ventrally through the mantle.|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{clusters}} of LEDs {{have started to}} be used in place of the incandescent lamps, <b>reflectors</b> and <b>lenses.</b> These use less power and have a purported working life of ten years, but this may not in reality be the case. These are often arranged so that the same aperture is used for whichever colour light is required, but again only for medium- or short-range use as the number per colour of discrete LEDs is much less than found on high signals intended for long-range application.|$|R
50|$|White-light LED lamps have {{longer life}} {{expectancy}} and higher efficiency (more light {{for the same}} electricity) than most other lighting when used at the proper temperature. LED sources are compact, which gives flexibility in designing lighting fixtures and good control over the distribution of light with small <b>reflectors</b> or <b>lenses.</b> Because of {{the small size of}} LEDs, control of the spatial distribution of illumination is extremely flexible, and the light output and spatial distribution of an LED array can be controlled with no efficiency loss.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reflector}} {{may have}} a flat transparent cover to keep out dirt and moisture, but some designs have a plastic or glass [...] "bulls-eye" [...] lens to form a concentrated beam.
