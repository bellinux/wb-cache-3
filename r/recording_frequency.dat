30|$|In addition, {{the overall}} {{available}} TCD CBFV signal <b>recording</b> <b>frequency</b> should be commented on. Currently the signal <b>recording</b> <b>frequency</b> is at 100  Hz. This is adequate for basic waveform analysis techniques. However, {{if one were}} to use this signal for more complex heart rate variability analysis, {{it could be argued that}} higher recording frequencies of 200  Hz or higher would be ideal. Thus, this might be considered a limitation of the current signal recording. However, pressure signals (as well as TCD-based CFBV) do not necessarily require as high of frequencies, and their content extends to 10 – 20 pulse harmonics at best. Therefore, a sampling frequency of 100  Hz may be entirely sufficient for recording those signals and this is what the majority of bedside and NCCU monitors currently offer.|$|E

Methods : A cross-sectional study was performed of 29 individuals {{divided into three}} groups: young persons (n= 10); falling elderly individuals (n= 7) and non-falling individuals (n= 12). Gait analysis was performed based on the recording of three walking gait cycles along an 8 meter platform, which was attached to a force plate with a <b>recording</b> <b>frequency</b> of 200 Hz. Gait cycles were also recorded by three video cameras positioned perpendicular to the force plate with a <b>recording</b> <b>frequency</b> of 60 Hz. The data analyzed was: average step velocity, stance time, Froude number and anteroposterior ground reaction force. Results : The average step velocity was higher among young persons {{and there was no}} difference in the Froude number among the three groups. During the stance and impulse phase, anterior and posterior force was higher among young persons than in the non-falling elderly group. The foot stance time of young individuals was also lower than the non-falling elderly group (p= 0. 000) and the foot stance time of the falling elderly group was lower than that of the non-falling elderly group (p= 0. 004).

40|$|The {{effect of}} induced {{vibration}} on velocity {{distribution for the}} blood flow in the bileaflet mechanical heart valves conveying blood was investigated in this study.

This analysis is based on the non-linear numerical solution by using a finite-element method, for the system of governing partial differential equations (continuity, momentum) of Navier - Stokes equation of blood flow through the orifice. It has been found that as the flow through the orifice increased, the vibration at the orifice inlet increased.

30|$|Since {{this method}} is applied at the {{beginning}} of the heating curve, the incoming power should be fully applied in a short time and the <b>recording</b> <b>frequency</b> of the probe temperature should be sufficiently high to minimize uncertainties for the determination of the slope (dT_p/dt)_heat. For higher energy influxes the time, where the probe temperature is close to the equilibrium temperature, becomes very short and it is not always possible to apply the full power to the probe in the time available. This may be attributed to a starting phase of the source plasma or moving it over the probe if it was started elsewhere to account for the starting phase. There will always be a short time where the probe is exposed only to a fraction of the total energy flux of the source and where it is already heated up.|$|E

It is then possible to record thermal signal variations related to high frequencies at the standard frame rate of classical IR cameras.
