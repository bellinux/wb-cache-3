40|$|Prostaglandin E 1, in {{concentrations}} {{as low as}} 1 ng/ml., relaxed isolated tracheal muscle from cat, monkey, rabbit, guinea-pig and ferret. Tracheal muscle {{from the}} cat, monkey and rabbit did not exhibit inherent tone {{and the effect of}} prostaglandin E 1 on these preparations was seen only after a sustained contraction had been produced by a previous dose of acetylcholine or of another agonist. Prostaglandins E 2, E 3 and F 1 α also relaxed isolated cat tracheal muscle which had been stimulated by acetylcholine: their activities relative to that of prostaglandin E 1 were, respectively, 1. 0, 0. 2 and 0. 002. In the anaesthetized cat prostaglandin E 1 increased lung “resistance to inflation” (presumably comparable to bronchial resistance) and the heart rate. In the anaesthetized rabbit and guinea-pig, prostaglandin E 1 antagonized the rise in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> of the lungs obtained after vagal stimulation or after the intravenous injection of histamine; it sometimes lowered the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> in these species. The possibility that prostaglandin may have a local physiological role in the control of bronchial smooth muscle tone is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The decapeptide kallidin- 10, {{substance}} P and angiotensin {{increased the}} resistance of guinea-pig lungs to inflation; lysine- or arginine-vasopressin and oxytocin were inactive. Acetylsalicylate antagonized this action of kallidin- 10, as it does that of bradykinin, but it failed to antagonize substance P or angiotensin. Bradykinin also increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> of rabbit lungs and, to a lesser extent, rat lungs. It caused a relatively slow contraction of guinea-pig tracheal and bronchial muscle in vitro, {{but it did not}} contract isolated rabbit, dog or human bronchus.

The paper concentrates {{on the fact that}} the outside country is likely to be small relative to the existing monetary union, and lack the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> which comes with market power in trade.

40|$|Rolling loss or rolling {{resistance}} is an ever important property for the tyre and automotive industries {{because of its}} practical implication. Fuel consumption and tyre rolling loss in all types of automobiles have become increasingly important because of adverse environmental effects (air pollution and global warming) and economic costs (high petroleum price). In this thesis, the effect of {{rolling resistance}} and overload on fuel consumption of automobile car tyres is discussed. The investigations are made on two tyre models of automobile cars Skoda Rapid and Ford Classic. Theoretical calculations are also done to determine the rolling <b>resistance</b> due <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure.

40|$|The {{atherosclerotic}} lesion <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> balloon <b>inflation</b> {{was assessed}} prospectively in 200 patients undergoing primary single-site balloon {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA) {{by using an}} identical inflation protocol. This resistance was evaluated by the stenosis resolution pressure, which is the pressure at which the lesion mark is no longer visible on the inflated balloon. The stenosis resolution pressure distribution was normal with a mean value of 4. 4 +/- 2. 3 atmospheres. Multivariate analysis revealed 4 factors related to the stenosis resolution pressure: stable angina pectoris (p < 10 (- 6)), the presence of calcifications (p = 0. 016), the occurrence of vessel wall dissection after balloon angioplasty (p = 0. 005), and the absence of a branch arising {{in the middle of the}} stenosis (p = 0. 047). It is concluded that the mechanical resistance of the coronary lesion is related to the anginal status, the presence of calcifications, and the occurrence of vessel wall dissection after balloon angioplasty, probably on the basis of the plaque composition...|$|R

40|$|Effects of hydrocolloids (arabic gum, guar gum, and xanthan gum) on the {{physicochemical}} and {{rheological properties}} of whole-barley fortified cracker flour were determined using solvent retention capacity, alveograph, and Mixolab profiles. Results {{showed that the}} water absorption of whole-barley fortified cracker flour was reduced by the additional arabic gum. Besides, arabic gum was more effective in reducing the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> and improving the extensibility of whole-barley fortified dough. Mixolab parameters indicated that the weakening of gluten proteins {{and the rate of}} starch retrogradation in whole-barley fortified cracker dough were reduced by the presence of arabic gum. Guar gum and xanthan gum promoted the rate of protein breakdown, but slowed down the starch gelatinization and retrogradation rate during the Mixolab heating-cooling cycle. In conclusion, involved arabic gum rather than guar gum or xanthan gum is benefit to improve the baking quality of wholebarley fortified saltine crackers...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the reasons}} for joining a {{monetary}} union, attention has fallen on the potential for improving a nation's monetary policy credibility. In this paper, we examine the decision problem faced by an outside country deciding {{whether or not to}} join an existing monetary union. Our analysis demonstrates that enhanced credibility stemming from differences in country characteristics along are unlikely to lead to a mutually-desirable union expansion. The intuition is that any country which finds the characteristics of the existing monetary union members relatively desirable must be relatively undesirable itself. To motivate mutually desirable entry, other potential gains must be considered. We concentrate on the fact that an outside country is likely to be quite small relative to an existing monetary union, and lack the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> which comes with market power in trade. Consideration of this "market power effect" raises the potential for mutually-desirable union expansion. Monetary unions - European Union countries...|$|E
40|$|Fibrosis of {{lung tissue}} {{is a disease}} where a chronic {{inflammatory}} process determines a pathological remodelling of lung parenchyma. The animal model obtained by intra-tracheal administration of bleomycin in C 57 BL/ 6 mice {{is one of the}} most validated murine model. Bleomycin stimulates oxidative stress and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Histamine H 4 R have recently been implicated in inflammation and immune diseases. This study was focused to investigate the effects of H 4 R ligands in the modulation of inflammation and in the reduction of lung fibrosis in C 57 BL/ 6 mice treated with bleomycin. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were treated with vehicle, JNJ 7777120 (JNJ, selective H 4 R antagonist) or ST- 1006 (partial H 4 R agonist), ST- 994 (H 4 R neutral antagonist) and ST- 1012 (inverse H 4 R agonist) at equimolar doses, released by micro-osmotic pumps for 21 days. Airway <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> was assayed and lung samples were processed to measure malondialdehyde (TBARS); 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG); myeloperoxidase (MPO); COX- 2 expression and activity as markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Fibrosis and airway remodelling were evaluated throughout transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), percentage of positive Goblet cells, smooth muscle layer thickness determination. Our results indicated that JNJ, ST- 994 and ST- 1012 decreased inflammation and oxidative stress markers, i. e. the number of infiltrating leukocytes evaluated as lung tissue MPO, COX- 2 expression and activity, TBARS and 8 OHdG production. They also reduced the level of TGF-β, a pro-fibrotic cytokine, collagen deposition, thickness of smooth muscle layer, Goblet cells hyperplasia; resulting in a decrease of airway functional impairment. The results here reported clearly demonstrated that H 4 R ligands have a beneficial effect in a model of lung fibrosis in the mouse, thus indicating that H 4 R antagonists or inverse agonists could be a novel therapeutic strategy for lung inflammatory diseases...|$|E

5000|$|The {{primary reason}} for AMT growth {{is the fact that}} the AMT exemption, unlike regular income tax items, was not indexed <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> before 2013.
