50|$|Reading used a {{different}} process. Unlike core, twistor {{did not have}} a sense/inhibit line. Instead, it used a larger current in the solenoid, large enough to flip all of the bits in that loop, and then used the twistor wires as the <b>read</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} this system is that other cores on the same lines (X or Y) will give off a very small signal as well, {{potentially}} masking the signal being looked for. The conventional solution was to wire the <b>read</b> <b>line</b> diagonally {{back and forth through}} the plane, so that these smaller signals would cancel outâ€”the positive signal from one would be a negative signal from the next as the wire passed through it in the opposite direction. However this solution also made wiring the core fairly difficult, and considerable amounts of research went into various ways to improve the cost of wiring core.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{improvement}} {{introduced in}} their core design involved {{the handling of}} the read wire. Reading a location in core works by powering the address in question, as if you wanted to write a [...] "1" [...] to that location. If the core was already holding a [...] "1" [...] nothing will happen. However, if the core was holding a [...] "0", the power will cause the core to [...] "flip" [...] polarity to a [...] "1". The small amount of energy used to do this causes a pulse to be output on a different wire, the <b>read</b> <b>line.</b> So to read data, you write [...] "1" [...] {{and if there is a}} pulse the memory held [...] "0", and no pulse means [...] "1".|$|E

Subshells are simply child programs that run a few commands for the shell and then exit.

5000|$|The Speak & Read {{was very}} {{minutely}} redesigned in 1986, {{under the same}} name, with the new version representing nothing more substantial than a redesign of the faceplate graphics. In 1988 the Super Speak & Read was released as a major redesign to feature a suitcase-like flip-open appearance. Cartridges were redesigned to be thinner and of a different shape, bearing some resemblance to the cartridges of TI's Touch & Discover line. Additionally, the keyboard was removed completely and a matrix of membrane buttons took its place similarly to the position sensitive [...] "keyboard" [...] of the Touch & Discover consoles. Each cartridge came with a work-booklet that would be laid out in an open position {{in the center of}} the Super Speak & Read and as questions were asked of the player he would press the appropriate portion of the work-booklet to depress the membrane button beneath. This was the last member of the Speak & <b>Read</b> <b>line</b> under this name; however, the Ready... Set... Read! (sharing a highly similar design layout) and later Magic Reading Desk (featuring a modified Ready... Set... Read! layout) are considered the Speak & Read's spiritual successors. Both Ready... Set...

50|$|Word {{line core}} memory was {{often used to}} provide {{register}} memory. Other names for this type are linear select and 2-D. This form of core memory typically wove three wires through each core on the plane, word read, word write, and bit sense/write. To read or clear words, the full current is applied {{to one or more}} word read lines; this clears the selected cores and any that flip induce voltage pulses in their bit sense/write lines. For read, normally only one word <b>read</b> <b>line</b> would be selected; but for clear, multiple word read lines could be selected while the bit sense/write lines ignored. To write words, the half current is applied to one or more word write lines, and half current is applied to each bit sense/write line for a bit to be set. In some designs, the word read and word write lines were combined into a single wire, resulting in a memory array with just two wires per bit. For write, multiple word write lines could be selected. This offered a performance advantage over X/Y line coincident-current in that multiple words could be cleared or written with the same value in a single cycle. A typical machine's register set usually used only one small plane of this form of core memory. Some very large memories were built with this technology, for example the Extended Core Storage (ECS) auxiliary memory in the CDC 6600, which was up to 2 million 60-bit words.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Dyslexia {{represents}} a significant pediatric problem requiring prompt and appropriate treatment. Objective. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the significance of integral rehabilitation approach in treating dyslexia of children. Methods. Objectives of the study were accomplished on a sample of 300 children, aged 11 - 15 years, with etiologically variable dyslexia. Results. The results gained from the integral treatment of children with dyslexia were more successful than those obtained from isolated logaoedic treatment, when compared in 10 - 15 examined variables; replacement of graphically similar letters (p= 0. 000), replacement of syllables (p= 0. 010), replacement of words - guessing (p= 0. 019), structural errors - displacement or insertion (p= 0. 038), adding letters and syllables (p= 0. 001), repeating of word parts (p= 0. 001), reading of a word in several wrong ways (p= 0. 001), omission of words and whole lines (p= 0. 000), returning to already <b>read</b> <b>line</b> (p= 0. 000), level of dyslexia (p= 0. 000). Conclusion. Dyslexia requires a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in which integral rehabilitation treatment has an exceptionally large significance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} low memory wavelet image compression. While wavelet or subband coding of images {{has been shown to}} be superior to more traditional transform coding techniques, little attention has been paid until recently to the important issue of whether both the wavelet transforms and the subsequent coding can be implemented in low memory without signi cant loss in performance. We present a complete system to perform low memory wavelet image coding. Our approach is -based &quot; in that the images are <b>read</b> <b>line</b> by line and only the minimum required number of lines is kept in memory. The main contributions of our work are two. First, we introduce a line-based approach for the implementation of the wavelet transform, which yields the same results as a &quot; implementation, but where, unlike prior work, we address memory issues arising from the need to synchronize encoder and decoder. Second, we propose a novel context-based encoder which requires no global information and stores only a local set of wavelet coe cients. This low memory coder achieves performance comparable to state of the art coders at a fraction of their memory utilization. ...|$|E
40|$|Background This study {{aimed to}} explore women's {{experiences}} {{of the impact of}} endometriosis and whether there are differences across three age groups. Methods A qualitative descriptive design was conducted using semi-structured focus group discussions with 35 Australian women with endometriosis, in three age groups. All tape-recorded discussions were transcribed verbatim and <b>read</b> <b>line</b> by line to extract meaningful codes and categories using NVivo 9 software through a thematic analysis approach. Categories were then clustered into meaningful themes. Results Participants' ages ranged from 17 to 53 years and had a history of 2 to 40 years living with endometriosis, with an average delay time to diagnosis of 8. 1 years. Two main themes emerged: (1) experiences of living with endometriosis, and (2) impact of endometriosis on women's lives, with 14 discrete categories. The results showed similarities and differences of the impact between the three age groups. The most highlighted impacts were on marital/sexual relationships, social life, and on physical and psychological aspects in all three age groups, but with different orders of priority. Education was the second most highlighted for the 16 - 24 years, life opportunities and employment for the 25 - 34 years; and financial impact for those 35 years and above. Conclusions Our findings show that endometriosis impacts negatively on different aspects of women's lives. A better understanding of these findings could help to decrease the negative impact of endometriosis by guiding service delivery and future research to meet more effectively the needs of women and teenagers with this condition.
