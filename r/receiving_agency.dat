5000|$|This {{regulation}} {{enables a}} somewhat simplified route by establishing transmitting and receiving agencies {{in each of}} the member states. Some member states have a de-centralised system with many transmitting and receiving agencies, whereas others have a single centralised agency. The transmitting agency in one member state sends the judicial documents to the <b>receiving</b> <b>agency</b> who is then responsible for service. A Letter Rogatory is not necessary, as a standardised request form included in the annex to the regulation must be used. This aids the process by being widely recognised by the relevant authorities. In addition to service through the recipient member state's <b>receiving</b> <b>agency</b> or agencies, Article 14 of the regulation permits service on defendants directly by mail. Article 15 of the regulation allows for [...] "direct service" [...] through competent judicial officials in the member state, although some member states have opted out of that article.|$|E

5000|$|PostalWatch Incorporated is a Virginia not-for-profit {{organization}} {{formed to}} [...] "protect {{individuals and the}} small business community from" [...] United States Postal Service actions and regulations which they deem [...] "intrusive and burdensome." [...] It fought against an initiative by the postal service to forbid people and companies who receive mail through a commercial mail <b>receiving</b> <b>agency</b> such as Mailboxes Etc. from listing their private mail box number as a suite rather than a PMB in their mailing address. PostalWatch was founded in 1999.|$|E

5000|$|An online {{post office}} is a {{commercial}} mail <b>receiving</b> <b>agency</b> that implements the concept of hybrid mail, enabling conventional mail to become electronic, or electronic correspondence to be printed and mailed at a remote location. As paper correspondence becomes inconvenient for businesses that are evolving to maintain a paperless office, services have emerged to outsource the task of scanning snail mail as it arrives. Some online post offices will scan envelopes for subscribing customers, and offer handling options (E.g. whether to scan the contents, store, or shred them). Some providers will systematically scan and make the contents immediately available.|$|E
5000|$|Some private {{companies}} (e.g., United Parcel Service (UPS) and commercial mail <b>receiving</b> <b>agencies)</b> also offer similar services of renting a mailbox {{in a public}} location.

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has expressed an interest in obtaining some of this off-spec surplus highly enriched uranium (HEU) for the purpose of making fuel for its reactors. Discussions between DOE and TVA over the past two years have resulted in a framework between DOE and TVA within which to develop a program for the utilization of HEU blended to off-spec low-enriched uranium (LEU) for use in TVA commercial nuclear power reactors. A minimum of 30 metric tons uranium (t) of HEU has been designated for this program. DOE has identified material amounting to approximately 35 t that potentially will be transferred to TVA.

40|$|Traditionally, {{public records}} {{have been handled}} and {{preserved}} by each creating or <b>receiving</b> <b>agency</b> separately. The existing legal framework in Sweden is still based on this principle. However, recent developments – digital technologies paired with new ways of working – create a more dispersed and complex body of archives. What this means for the practical records management can be discussed. This paper explores the potential consequences of implementing an outsourcing policy at a public agency, by focusing on issues actualized and seen as important by employees. The aim is {{to understand how the}} creation of public archives may be affected. The chosen research approach, phenomenography, aims to capture variation in perceptions and describe the range of possible interpretations on a particular topic. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 15 representatives from the agency. The result identified seven matters of particular importance, including effects on information governance, knowledge transfer, and the role of a public agency.

40|$|Phase I of {{the project}} {{summarizes}} the SD EMS data from the geographic (e. g. counties in SD) and temporal (e. g. time of day, day of week, and month of year) perspectives and concentrates on several time- and distance-dependent variables such as response time, en-route time, on-scene time, and transporting {{time as well as}} the distance to and from the incident scene. The macroscopic-level of analysis did not find apparent outstanding issues with the service. The 911 call volume does not display a strong pattern of spatial clusters. Each of the three EMS regions (East, Center, and West) seems to have a mixture of counties with high, intermediate, and low demand. After accounting for the county population, the demand per capita by county changes moderately, as East region which includes Minnehaha County and Lincoln County has a relatively low EMS demand per capita. It is noteworthy that the average distance between the EMS station and incident scene is only 5. 51 miles and the median distance is less than 2 miles. On the other hand, the average distance between the incident scene and <b>receiving</b> <b>agency</b> is 13. 74 mile and the median distance is 6 miles. The comparison suggests an excellent EMS coverage and confirms a relatively low density of receiving hospitals.
