40|$|How {{does the}} nature of firms' {{alliance}} portfolio in terms of exploration versus exploitation affect performance? Building on prior research grounded in the resource-based view and the relational perspective, we expand firms' boundary to include their inter-firm relationships and their immediate environment, and develop an extended resource-based framework centering {{on the concept of}} fit. Specifically, we propose that whether the exploration versus exploitation orientation of an alliance portfolio may benefit firm performance depends on how such an orientation fits the firm's internal organizational characteristics, strategic orientations, and the industry environment. Data from five U. S. industries over eight years largely support our thesis. Overall, our study calls for a holistic approach to consider the importance of organizational, strategic, and environmental fit in understanding the performance implications of alliance-formation <b>choices.</b> <b>Alliance</b> portfolio Exploration and exploitation Performance consequences...|$|R
40|$|This note {{develops}} theory {{regarding how}} attributes of corporate knowledge influence {{the selection of}} alliance governance mode. Different types of corporate knowledge are placed on a spectrum between a classic public good and deeply embedded knowledge. Hypotheses are developed regarding knowledge characteristics such as transfer costs, consequences of appropriation, observability, information asymmetry between negotiating partners, the difficulty of valuing knowledge, and the "disclosure dilemma. " Next, hypotheses are presented on the <b>choice</b> of <b>alliance</b> governance mode as determined by knowledge attributes (codification, newness, complexity, and teachability) and partner characteristics (such as knowledge absorptive capacity). These testable propositions should make for fruitful empirical studies on the relatively little researched area of <b>alliance</b> governance modal <b>choice.</b> Knowledge management <b>Alliance</b> modal <b>choice...</b>|$|R

40|$|Key presses of 1 monkey (called the {{performer}}) {{became the}} basis upon which a 2 nd monkey (called the judge) solved conditional-discrimination tasks. First, the performer was trained to press one of two colored <b>choice</b> keys (<b>red</b> or green) depending on {{the location of a}} white light in her chamber. The performer's key-pressing behavior was brought {{under the control of the}} experimenter by this procedure. Subsequently, the judge was trained to discriminate the performer's key-pressing behavior. In Experiment 1, the judge had to press Key 1 when the performer pressed the <b>red</b> <b>choice</b> key and Key 2 when the performer pressed the green choice key. In Experiment 2, a sample key was introduced. The judge had to press Key 1 when the performer pressed the same colored choice key as the sample; the judge had to press Key 2 when the performer pressed the different colored choice key. In both experiments, the judge was required to attend to the behavior of the performer. It was shown that the performer's behavior served as a discriminative stimulus for the judge's responses in a conditional-discrimination task...|$|R

40|$|The differential-outcomes {{effect is}} {{manifest}} as more accurate {{performance of a}} delayed conditional discrimination when alternative choice responses are followed by different reinforcers than when they are followed by the same reinforcer. In Experiment 1, a differential-outcomes effect was demonstrated within sessions by signaling the duration of food access for correct responses with stimuli appearing {{in conjunction with the}} sample stimuli. The delayed matching-to-sample performance of 5 pigeons was more accurate when green choice responses (matching a green sample) were followed by 3. 5 -s food access and <b>red</b> <b>choice</b> responses (matching a red sample) were followed by 0. 5 -s food access (different-outcome trials) than when the correct choice responses were both followed by 1. 5 -s reinforcers (same-outcome trials). In Experiment 2, the acquisition of this differential-outcomes effect was characterized by a progressive decrease in rate of forgetting on different-outcome trials and no change in rate of forgetting on same-outcome trials. In addition, accuracy at the shortest delay intervals for both different-outcome and same-outcome trials increased over acquisition, but to a greater extent for different-outcome trials. These data suggest that both memorial and attentional (time-dependent and time-independent) factors contribute to the differential-outcomes effect...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a multimethod modeling approach to evaluate strategic alternatives for GM’s OnStar communications system. We used dynamic modeling {{to address some}} decisions GM faced in 1997, such as the company’s choice between incremental and aggressive marketing strategies for OnStar. We used an integrated simulation model for analyzing the new telematics industry, consisting of six sectors: customer acquisition, customer <b>choice,</b> <b>alliances,</b> customer service, financial dynamics, and dealer behavior. The modeling effort had important financial, organizational, and societal results. The OnStar business now has two million subscribers, an 80 percent market share of the emerging telematics market, and has been valued at between $ 4 and $ 10 billion. The OnStar project {{set the stage for}} a broader GM initiative in service businesses that ultimately could yield billions in incremental earnings. Most important, OnStar has saved many lives that otherwise would have been lost in vehicle accidents. (Industries: communications. Transportation: automotive.) General Motors (GM) assembled a project team consisting of the authors of this paper to develop its OnStar telematics business. Telematics is the provision of communications services to cars, including crash notification, navigation, Internet access, and traffic information.

50|$|The Cypriot kings who, so far, {{had managed}} largely to {{maintain}} their kingdoms' independence, {{found themselves in a}} new and difficult position. This was because, as Cyprus became the focus of discord between Ptolemy and Antigonus, the kings of the island now had to make new <b>choices</b> and <b>alliances.</b> Some Cypriot kingdoms chose alliance with Ptolemy, others sided with the Antigonus, yet others tried to remain neutral, leading to inevitable controversy and confrontation. The largest city and kingdom of Cyprus then appears to have been Salamis, whose king was Nicocreon. Nicocreon strongly supported Ptolemy. According to Arrian, he had the support of Pasikratis of Solon, Nikoklis of Paphos and Androcles of Amathus. Other kings of Cyprus, however, including Praxippos of Lapithos and Kyrenia, the Poumiaton (Pygmalion) of Kition and Stasioikos of Marion, allied themselves with Antigonus.|$|R

40|$|Interfirm {{collaboration}} among knowledge intensive firms is increasing {{as a result}} of accelerating competition, falling regulatory barriers, and rising customer expectations. Resource dependency theory is used to position knowledge as the key resource for the knowledge-based enterprise (KBE) and to examine the suitability of alliances as a mode of knowledge acquisition and exchange, contrasted particularly with merger and acquisition. The alliance and knowledge literatures are reviewed and particular attention is paid to the critical alliance formation stage. This stage is reviewed against a research model that posits firm performance in knowledge creation arises from a number of factors, including the motivation for an alliance, partner firm characteristics (the ability to develop and sustain valuable resources; absorptive capacity; combinative capability; experience with alliances; and appropriate design for knowledge exchange), the development of operating structures and norms, and the <b>choice</b> of <b>alliance</b> structure.

40|$|Background: Self-determination within {{mental health}} {{services}} is increasingly recognized as an ethical imperative, but we still know little {{about the impact of}} choice on outcomes among people with severe mental illnesses. This study examines whether choice predicts outcomes and whether this relationship is mediated by therapeutic alliance. Method: The study sample of 396 participants completed a survey measuring <b>choice,</b> therapeutic <b>alliance,</b> recovery, quality of life and functioning. Multivariate analyses examined choice as a predictor of outcomes, and Sobel tests assessed alliance as a mediator. Results: Choice variables predicted recovery, quality of life and perceived outcomes. Sobel tests indicated that the relationship between choice and outcome variables was mediated by therapeutic alliance. Implications: The study demonstrates that providing more choice and opportunities for collaboration within services does improve consumer outcomes. The results also show that collaboration is dependent {{on the quality of the}} relationship between the provider and consumer...|$|R
40|$|Capacity {{building}} {{is often described}} as fundamental to the success of health alliances, yet there are few evaluations that provide alliances with clear guidance on the challenges related to capacity building. This article attempts to identify potential challenges of capacity building in multistakeholder health alliances. The study uses a multiple case study design to identify potential challenges and trade-offs associated with capacity build-ing in four community health alliances in the United States. Multiple challenges were found to be common across the four alliances, including specifying appropriate governance structures and decision-making frame-works, aligning stakeholder interests with the vision of the alliance, balancing short-term objectives with long-term goals, and securing resources to sustain the effort without compromising it. These challenges often involved trade-offs and <b>choices</b> that <b>alliances</b> need to prepare for if they are to approach capacity building in a planful rather than a reactive manner...|$|R
