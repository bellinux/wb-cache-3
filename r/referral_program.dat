40|$|Winer, Ezra Zuckerman, the reviewers, and {{the editor}} for {{providing}} comments on earlier drafts. <b>Referral</b> <b>Programs</b> and Customer Value <b>Referral</b> <b>programs</b> have become a popular way to acquire customers. Yet, {{there is no evidence}} to date that customers acquired through such programs, referred customers for short, are more valuable than other customers. We address this gap and investigate to what extent referred customers are more profitable and more loyal. Tracking approximately 10, 000 customers of a leading German bank for almost three years, we find that referred customers (i) have a higher contribution margin, though this difference erodes over time, (ii) have a higher retention rate, and this difference persists over time, and (iii) are more valuable both in the short and long run. The average value of a referred customer is at least 16 % higher than that of a non-referred customer with similar demographics and time of acquisition. However, the size of the value differential varies across customer segments; therefore, firms should use a selective approach for their <b>referral</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{and coordinated}} health care {{responses}} to intimate partner violence (IPV) are essential, given {{that health care}} settings are a major entry point for abused women who seek professional services. However, {{there is a lack}} of evidence on how IPV referrals are effectively made within health care settings. In order to help program planners and providers across sectors to address the complex and chronic issue of IPV, a greater understanding of the post-IPV identification referral process is essential. A scoping review of the evidence on IPV <b>referral</b> <b>programs</b> and processes in health care settings was undertaken to provide an overview of the state of evidence and identify pertinent gaps in existing research. The scoping review identified 13 evaluative studies and 6 qualitative, primarily nonevaluative studies that examined IPV <b>referral</b> <b>programs</b> and processes. Evaluative studies involved a variety of designs and IPV referral outcomes. Rich descriptions of barriers and facilitators to seeking referrals by victims and making referrals by health care providers emerged from the evaluative and qualitative studies, but were explored more in depth in the qualitative studies. This scoping review provides guidance on what is currently known about IPV <b>referral</b> <b>programs</b> in health care settings and provides a starting point for further research on effectiveness of referral processes.

40|$|<b>Referral</b> reward <b>programs</b> {{have been}} shown in past {{research}} to stimulate referrals and also to contribute positively to customer lifetime value and firms’ profitability. In this paper we examine whether, how, and under what conditions providing a reward for a referral affects receivers’ responses to the referral. Based on a multiple motives inference framework, we propose that rewards adversely affect responses because they lead receiving consumers to infer ulterior motives for the referral. Using experiments and a survey, we find support for this hypothesis and show that this effect is stronger for unsolicited and weak tie referrals. We also demonstrate that rewarding both the referral provider and receiver or providing symbolic rewards can eliminate the negative effect of rewarded referrals. The paper makes conceptual contributions to the literature on <b>referral</b> reward <b>programs,</b> word-of-mouth, and motive inferences. The work has implications for managers considering ways to construct <b>referral</b> <b>programs</b> and design marketing activities to increase referrals...|$|R
