50|$|The Long Beach Peninsula {{has become}} one of the most popular tourism {{destinations}} in the State of Washington and has attracted visitors from all over North America. As one of the final destinations of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, several television specials have brought publicity to this area. A multitude of events and festivals are held throughout the year including the Washington State International Kite Festival, the Sandsations sandcastle sculpting competition, and the annual The <b>Rod</b> <b>Run</b> to the End of the World, which attracts thousands of visitors on the weekend following Labor Day.|$|E
50|$|Murrieta has a Mulligan Family Fun Center, with {{miniature}} golf, go kart racing, laser tag, and an arcade. A {{movie theater}} and additional go kart track, Pole Position, and additional entertainment options. As of 2012, Murrieta gained a comedy club, Aces, and a trampoline park. In late 2013, a roller rink, EPIC Rollertainment, was opened. Annually, both Murrieta and neighboring Temecula share the <b>Rod</b> <b>Run,</b> a classic car event where classic car owners and enthusiasts can showcase and enjoy hundreds of classic cars. Murrieta has several sport parks.|$|E
50|$|To ensure {{adequate}} {{bearing surface}} {{at the big}} ends Coatalen retained the articulated connecting rods, where one <b>rod</b> <b>runs</b> on the crankshaft journal, but the other acts indirectly, through a journal on the other rod. The difficulty is that this gives a slightly different piston stroke and journal rotation centres for each bank, {{which can lead to}} unbalance and possible vibration problems. Stroke was thus 135 mm on one bank and 142 mm on the other.|$|R

5000|$|The AUG has a {{rotating}} bolt that features 7 radial locking lugs and is unlocked {{by means of}} a pin on the bolt body and a recessed camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt carrier itself is guided by two guide rods brazed to it and these <b>rods</b> <b>run</b> inside steel bearings in the receiver. The guide rods are hollow and contain the return springs. The bolt also contains a claw extractor that forms the eighth locking lug and a spring-loaded [...] "bump"-type casing ejector.|$|R

50|$|Its {{simplest}} {{and later}} form consists of five rods. A central iron <b>rod</b> <b>runs</b> {{up from the}} bob to a point immediately below the suspension. At that point a cross-piece (middle bridge) extends from the central rod and connects to two zinc rods, {{one on each side}} of the central rod, which reach down to, and are fixed to, the bottom bridge just above the bob. The bottom bridge clears the central rod and connects to two further iron <b>rods</b> which <b>run</b> back up to the top bridge attached to the suspension. As the iron rods expand in heat, the bottom bridge drops relative to the suspension, and the bob drops relative to the middle bridge. However, the middle bridge rises relative to the bottom one because the greater expansion of the zinc rods pushes the middle bridge, and therefore the bob, upwards to match the combined drop caused by the expanding iron.|$|R
25|$|Another change {{affected}} the stroke, also a technique from the Arab, {{where it had}} been responsible for the engine's failure. A multi-cylinder V engine offers little length for connecting rods. Coatalen's usual solution was to use articulated connecting rods, where one <b>rod</b> <b>runs</b> on the crankshaft journal, but the other acts indirectly, through a journal on the other rod. The difficulty is that this gives a slightly different piston stroke for each bank, leading to unbalance and possible vibration problems, as for the Arab. Stroke was thus 135mm on one bank and 142mm on the other.|$|R
5000|$|Wand-a devise {{fitted to}} a foiling yacht to give {{control over the}} ride height and [...] "z" [...] factor(foil rise and fall). Consists of a carbon tube that pivots from the bow {{attached}} to an internal wire or rod that is attached to arod in the centre (main) foil. The <b>rod</b> <b>runs</b> to the main foil blades (wings)to control their angle. The wand can be set fixed but since about 2009 a dial is fitted that allow the skipper to adjust the foil blade angles/wand height. Some craft are fitted with dual wands for more precise control.|$|R

25|$|West Islip {{was built}} in 1919 for the United States Shipping Board. She was {{launched}} on 24 June, and the United States Official Number 218782 was allocated. She was in service by October, arriving at Shanghai, China on 20 October from Seattle. In 1928, she was sold to the Oceanic & Oriental Steam Navigation Co, San Francisco, California and was renamed Golden Rod. The Code Letters LSNC were allocated and her port of registry was San Francisco. On 6 February 1931, Golden <b>Rod</b> <b>ran</b> aground {{at the mouth of}} the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. She was refloated the next day and sailed to Seattle.|$|R
50|$|On {{both the}} Sniper and Autococker, a pump <b>rod</b> <b>runs</b> {{from the front}} of the marker to the back block and serves as the means by which the back block moves forward and back. On the Sniper (and {{converted}} Autocockers), a pump handle is located on the front of the marker and attaches to the pump rod. After the player has pulled the trigger to fire a paintball, he/she then pulls back on the pump arm, pushing the back block rearward. This opens the bolt, allowing the next ball to be fed into the breech, and simultaneously pulls the hammer back until it is caught by the sear.|$|R

5000|$|In British oval racing, {{the term}} [...] "production car racing" [...] {{has been used}} as an {{alternative}} for hot <b>rods,</b> as <b>run</b> in the West Country during the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, and a production car world championship race was held twice in the 1970s, won by Spence Morgan in 1974 and Ralph Sanders in 1975, both driving Ford Anglias. The West Country production cars were later reclassified as hot rods to come in line with the country's other promoters although this causes some confusion with the history of the West country racing as there was another class called hot <b>rods</b> that <b>ran</b> on those tracks.|$|R
5000|$|A {{day or two}} later, <b>Rod</b> <b>runs</b> into Matt and confronts him. As {{they start}} to talk it out (with Rod {{implying}} that he knows Matt is gay) they're suddenly confronted by an armed robber who inexplicably forces them to strip before running off. Shaken, the guys go to Matt's place and have some drinks. They talk and Rod, noticing that Matt is bruised and sore, offers him a back rub. The massage becomes more sensual until Rod becomes ill. Suddenly Janet shows up. Rod hides while Janet tries to seduce Matt again, but Matt comes out to her instead and she leaves, but only after Matt agrees to remain friends with her. Rod, blaming the alcohol, also leaves.|$|R
50|$|The Valentine was of {{conventional}} layout, divided internally into three compartments; {{from front to}} back the driver's position, the fighting compartment with the turret and then the engine and transmission driving the tracks through rear sprockets. The driver's area contained only the driver and the driving controls. The driver sat on hull centre line, entering through either of two angled hatches over the seat, though there was an emergency exit hatch beneath his seat. The driver had a direct vision port—cut in what was one of the hull's cross members—in front of him and two periscopes in the roof over his head. Driving was by clutch and brake steering through levers, whose control <b>rods</b> <b>ran</b> the length of the hull to the transmission at the rear.|$|R
50|$|Water {{from the}} {{surrounding}} area - including a number of local springs and streams - is collected in a cistern, which is above {{the level of the}} top of the wheel. A closed pipe connects the cistern {{to the top of the}} wheel; thus the water flows up the tower as an inverted syphon. The water falls from the pipe into the buckets (formed from wooden slats on the circumference) and makes the wheel rotate in what is described as the 'reverse' direction - it is a pitchback wheel. The crank has a throw of 4 ft and connects to a counterweight and to a very long <b>rod.</b> This <b>rod</b> <b>runs</b> along the <b>rod</b> viaduct to the pumping shaft where the 8 ft stroke is converted by T-rockers into a pumping action.|$|R

While Rusty Nails ran Three Stooges shorts, Ramblin' <b>Rod</b> <b>ran</b> Popeye cartoons. Ramblin' Rod was the longest-running kid's show in Portland TV history, airing from 1964 to 1997. Other KPTV children's hosts included longtime KPTV personality Gene Brendler who played [...] "Bent Nails" [...] (Rusty's [...] "brother"), and George Ross, who played [...] "Dr. Zoom." [...] Bob Adkins, better known as [...] "Addie Bobkins," [...] brought his show to KPTV from Eugene's KVAL-TV in 1961.
