50|$|For diodes {{operated}} in <b>reverse</b> <b>bias,</b> CD is zero and the term corner frequency often {{is replaced by}} cutoff frequency. In any event, in <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> the diode resistance becomes quite large, although not infinite as the ideal diode law suggests, and the assumption that it {{is less than the}} Norton resistance of the driver may not be accurate. The junction capacitance is small and depends upon the <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> vR. The cutoff frequency is then: and varies with <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> because the width w(vR) of the insulating region depleted of mobile carriers increases with increasing diode <b>reverse</b> <b>bias,</b> reducing the capacitance.|$|R

5000|$|The {{depletion}} layer between the n- and p-sides of a p-n-diode {{serves as an}} insulating region that separates the two diode contacts. Thus, the diode in <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> exhibits a depletion-layer capacitance, sometimes more vaguely called a junction capacitance, analogous to a parallel plate capacitor with a dielectric spacer between the contacts. In <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> {{the width of the}} {{depletion layer}} is widened with increasing <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> vR, and the capacitance is accordingly decreased. Thus, the junction serves as a voltage-controllable capacitor. In a simplified one-dimensional model, the junction capacitance is: ...|$|R
25|$|In typical operation, the base–emitter {{junction}} is forward biased, {{which means}} that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base–collector junction is <b>reverse</b> <b>biased.</b> In an NPN transistor, when positive bias is applied to the base–emitter junction, the equilibrium is disturbed between the thermally generated carriers and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter depletion region. This allows thermally excited electrons to inject from the emitter into the base region. These electrons diffuse through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter towards the region of low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called minority carriers because the base is doped p-type, which makes holes the majority carrier in the base.|$|E
25|$|The bipolar {{junction}} transistor, {{unlike other}} transistors, {{is usually not}} a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down. The collector–base junction is <b>reverse</b> <b>biased</b> in normal operation. The reason the emitter is heavily doped {{is to increase the}} emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter–base junction must come from the emitter.|$|E

Since occasional shadows are unavoidable in most applications, most solar arrays include shadow protection to prevent damage. In current practice, shadow protection is done with a "bypass diode" on each cell, to shunt the <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> current if a cell is shadowed. A new method of <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> protection is to use an Integral thin-film battery to provide voltage {{in the case of}} a shadowed cell.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{electric}} field enhancement on Pt/nanostructured ZnO Schottky diode based hydrogen sensors under <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> condition has been investigated. Current–voltage characteristics of these diodes have been studied at temperatures from 25 to 620 ◦C and their free carrier density con- centration was estimated by exposing the sensors to hydrogen gas. The experimental results show a significantly lower breakdown voltage in <b>reversed</b> <b>bias</b> current–voltage characteristics than the conven- tional Schottky diodes and also greater lateral voltage shift in <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> operation than the forward bias. This can be ascribed to the increased localized electric fields emanating from the {{sharp edges and corners}} of the nanostructured morphologies. At 620 ◦C, voltage shifts of 114 and 325 mV for 0. 06 % and 1 % hydrogen have been recorded from dynamic response under the <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} surface {{preparation}} and substrate temperature during sputter deposition of Schottky contacts have been investigated. For the Ti Schottky, the substrate temperature of 100 oC during the sputtering demonstrates the minimum series resistance with Rs about 0. 04 Ωcm 2, while temperatures greater than 3000 C increased <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> leakage. The Mott-Schottky plot reveals a barrier height of 1. 2 V for this Ti Schottky contact. Results for sputtered Ni contacts using different substrate temperatures demonstrate the some <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> leakages.

2500|$|In {{this mode}} the diode is often <b>reverse</b> <b>biased</b> (with the cathode driven {{positive}} {{with respect to}} the anode). [...] This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction's capacitance. The reverse bias also increases the dark current without much change in the photocurrent. For a given spectral distribution, the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the illuminance (and to the irradiance).|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect can}} be {{significant}} when switching large currents very quickly. A certain amount of [...] "reverse recovery time" [...] tr (on the order of tens of nanoseconds to a few microseconds) {{may be required to}} remove the reverse recovery charge Qr from the diode. During this recovery time, the diode can actually conduct in the reverse direction. This might give rise to a large constant current in the reverse direction for a short time while the diode is <b>reverse</b> <b>biased.</b> The magnitude of such a reverse current is determined by the operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is said to be in the storage-phase. [...] In certain real-world cases {{it is important to consider}} the losses that are incurred by this non-ideal diode effect. However, when the slew rate of the current is not so severe (e.g. Line frequency) the {{effect can be}} safely ignored. For most applications, the effect is also negligible for Schottky diodes.|$|E

40|$|A high {{frequency}} rectangular alternating voltage {{was applied to}} {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) with the structure ITO/TPD/Alq 3 /Al and ITO/CoPc/Alq 3 /Al, where ITO is indium-tin-oxide, TPD is 4, 4 ′-bis[N-phenyl-N-(m-tolyl) amino]biphenyl, CoPc is cobalt phthalocyanine, and Alq 3 is Tris(8 -quinolinolato) aluminum, and the effect on emission of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> was examined. The results reveal that the emission intensity under an alternating reverse-forward bias is greater than that under an alternating zero-forward bias. The difference in the emission intensity (∆I) increased both for decreasing frequency and increasing voltage level of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bias.</b> In particular, the change in emission intensity was proportional to the voltage level of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bias</b> given the same frequency. To understand ΔI, this paper proposes a model in which an OLED works as a capacitor under <b>reverse</b> <b>bias,</b> where positive and negative charges accumulate on the metal/organic interfaces. In this model, the emission enhancement that occurs during the alternating reverse-forward bias is rationalized {{as a result of the}} charge accumulation at the organic/metal interfaces during the <b>reverse</b> <b>bias,</b> which possibly modulates the vacuum level shifts at the organic/metal interfaces to reduce both the hole injection barrier at the organic/ITO interface and the electron injection barrier at the organic/Al interface under forward bias...|$|R
