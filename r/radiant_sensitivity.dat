40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the design {{as well as}} laboratory/performance tests results taken {{by means of the}} fast scintillation probes. The design of each scintillation probe is based on photomultiplier tube hybrid assembly, which- besides photomultiplier itself- also includes high-voltage divider optimized for recording of fast radiation bursts. Plastic scintillators with short-time response are applied as hard X-ray and neutron radiation detectors. Heavy-duty probe’s housing provides efficient shielding against electromagnetic interference and allows carrying out pulsed neutron measurements in a harsh electromagnetic environment. The crucial parameters of scintillation probes have been examined during laboratory tests in which our investigations have been aimed mainly to determine: a time response, an anode <b>radiant</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and an electron transit time dependence on high-voltage supply. During the performance tests, the relative calibration of probes set has been done. It allowed to carry out very accurate measurements of neutron emission anisotropy and investigations of neutron radiation scattering by different materials. The usefulness of presented scintillation probes – embedded in the neutron time-of-flight diagnostic system was proven during experimental campaigns conducted on the plasma-focus PF 1000 device...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{to determine the}} most accurate and repeatable method for generating instrument inter-calibration functions (ICFs) is described, based upon data collected with a dual-beam GER 1500 spectroradiometer system. The quality of reflectance data collected using a dual-beam spectroradiometer system is reliant upon accurate inter-calibration of the sensor pairs {{to take into account}} differences in their <b>radiant</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and spectral characteristics. A cos-conical field-based method for inter-calibrating dual-beam spectroradiometers was tested alongside laboratory inter-calibration procedures. The field-based method produced the most accurate results when a field-derived ICF collected close in time was used to correct the spectral scan. A regression model to predict the ICF at a range of wavelengths was tested, using inputs of solar zenith angle, cosine of solar zenith angle and broadband diffuse-to-global irradiance ratios. The linear multiple regression model described up to 78 % of the variability in ICF; the remainder of the variability was most likely due to complexities of instrumental behaviour in response to warm-up time, ambient temperature and environmental conditions at the time of measurement. Collection of ICFs using a stable laboratory source was shown to provide unsatisfactory results due to differences between lamp outputs and the field-measured solar spectrum. Consequently, the most practical and accurate method of deriving inter-calibration functions is to use field-derived ICFs, collected close in time and space to the data requiring correction...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{sensitivity}} characteristics of CMOS image sensors and scaling trends. We address the sensitivity characteristics of CMOS image sensor in advanced processes. Sensitivity characteristics, espacially spectral sensitivity and quantum efficiency, is measured. We scaled the sensitivity trends in advanced processes, also. In this paper, we show the sensitivity of CMOS image sensor using standard CMOS 0. 35 μm, 0. 6 μm, 90 nm process technologies. Particularly, the spectral sensitivity and the quantum efficiency are measured. The spectral sensitivity exhibits {{the relation between the}} <b>radiant</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and the wave length of the incident light. The quantum efficiency chracterizes the transformation of the incident light on the photodiode sensor into electrical charges. These sensitivity characteristics represent the performance of an image sensor using a standard CMOS process technology. We scaled the trends of sensitivity with advanced processes, also. The sensitivity characteristic of below a 90 nm CMOS process technology is scaled by the relationship between the process technology generation and the junction depth. In advanced process, CMOS process technology is hardly use only for image sensor. However, recognization of sensitivity characteristics of image sensor in advanced processes is helpful for technical chip, not for just image sensor. We can also show the roadmap for optimum pixel configuration of image sensor with downscaled processes by modeling the trends of sensitivity. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2006 - 09 - 28; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電子工学専...|$|E
40|$|By {{actively}} {{cooling down}} {{one or more}} surfaces in a space, water-based embedded surface cooling (radiant) systems remove heat both by convection and radiation. Therefore, unlike the case of well-mixed air distribution systems where the cooling load is purely convective, the cooling load for radiant systems is comprised of both convective and radiant components. However, in current practice, the same design cooling load calculation methods for the radiant systems are used as the convection based air systems. The purpose of this energy simulation {{study was to investigate}} if there are differences in peak zone cooling load and 24 -hour total zone cooling energy generated by all-air distribution systems in comparison to <b>radiant</b> cooling systems. <b>Sensitivity</b> studies were performed for different load and boundary conditions. Simulation results show that total zone cooling energy for the radiant cooling systems studied can be 2. 7 - 6. 5 % higher than the all-air systems, and peak zone cooling load can be in the range of 10 - 40 % higher depending on the load conditions. Future research is needed to assess the implications for design guidelines. In general, even if the total zone level cooling energy may be slightly higher for the radiant systems, there are verified advantages of using hydronic-based radiant systems such as improved plant side equipment efficiency with warmer cold water temperature, possibility of night pre-cooling and utilization of natural cooling resource, and energy efficiency in transporting heat with water compared to air. All of these factors combine to produce better overall energy performance in radiant cooling systems...|$|R
