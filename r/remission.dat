5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} phase is to reach a complete <b>remission.</b> Complete <b>remission</b> {{does not mean the}} disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete <b>remission</b> is obtained in about 50%–75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of <b>remission</b> depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E
5|$|Even after {{complete}} <b>remission</b> is achieved, leukemic cells likely {{remain in}} numbers {{too small to}} be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all people with AML will eventually relapse. Therefore, more therapy is necessary to eliminate nondetectable disease and prevent relapse— that is, to achieve a cure.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} are not {{eligible}} for a stem cell transplant, immunotherapy with a combination of histamine dihydrochloride (Ceplene) and interleukin 2 (Proleukin) after the completion of consolidation has been shown to reduce the absolute relapse risk by 14%, translating to a 50% increase in the likelihood of maintained <b>remission.</b>|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{progressive}} MS {{occurs in}} around 65% {{of those with}} initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of <b>remission.</b> Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear. The most common length of time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19years.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{treatment}} of IIH is {{the prevention of}} visual loss and blindness, as well as symptom control. IIH is treated mainly through the reduction of CSF pressure and, where applicable, weight loss.

5|$|A second Overmind {{is created}} in Brood War, formed from {{the merging of}} several cerebrates. This second Overmind never reaches full maturity, and thus lacks the power and {{intelligence}} of the original and is much weaker; attacks that were superficial to the first Overmind send the second into <b>remission,</b> although dark templar energies are still needed to kill it. The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E
5|$|Flogging was {{discontinued}} in the 1940s, {{with the}} last incident occurring in 1943. From that decade, punishments were decided by the superintendent after hearing the case against a prisoner, or by a magistrate for grievous violations. Lesser transgressions could result in solitary confinement, or restriction from visitors, education, and concerts; serious offences were punishable by the cancellation of any <b>remission</b> earned and a bread-and-water diet, normally over a two-week period.|$|E

5|$|Hormonal {{factors are}} capable of {{altering}} the mucosal barrier. In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences <b>remission</b> during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Scott had an {{appendectomy}} {{and learned}} that his appendix was cancerous. After going into <b>remission,</b> he was again diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and 2013.

5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{the sacrament}} of {{initiation}} into the visible church, or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and <b>remission</b> of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized.

50|$|After <b>remissions</b> were abolished, Eastwood's {{application}} for a re-determination of his sentence was granted, and after allowing for 17 months of <b>remissions</b> forfeited {{as a result of}} the 1976 escape, he was re-sentenced to 20 years and 4 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 years and 4 months. He was officially released in 1993 after choosing to decline parole offered in 1991, and now works as a truck driver.|$|R

40|$|Heritable and nonheritable factors {{play a role}} in {{multiple}} sclerosis, but their effect size appears too small, explaining relatively little about disease etiology. Assuming that the factors that trigger the onset of the disease are, to some extent, also those that generate its <b>remissions</b> and relapses, we attempted to model the erratic behaviour of the disease course as observed on a dataset containing the time series of relapses and <b>remissions</b> of 70 patients free of disease-modifying therapies. We show that relapses and <b>remissions</b> follow exponential decaying distributions, excluding periodic recurrences and confirming that relapses manifest randomly in time. It is found that a mechanistic model with a random forcing describes in a satisfactory manner the occurrence of relapses and <b>remissions,</b> and the differences in the length of time spent in each one of the two states. This model may describe how interactions between "soft" etiologic factors occasionally reach the disease threshold thanks to comparably small external random perturbations. The model offers a new context to rethink key problems such as "missing heritability" and "hidden environmental structure" in the etiology of complex traits...|$|R
5|$|Primary {{progressive}} MS {{occurs in}} approximately 10–20% of individuals, with no <b>remission</b> {{after the initial}} symptoms. It is characterized by progression of disability from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements. The usual age of onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than of the relapsing-remitting subtype. It {{is similar to the}} age that secondary progressive usually begins in relapsing-remitting MS, around 40 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in <b>remission,</b> and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur.

5|$|The {{band was}} formed in 2000 by guitarists Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher, bassist and vocalist Troy Sanders, and drummer Brann Dailor, in Atlanta, Georgia. Mastodon {{released}} their debut extended play, Lifesblood, in 2001, followed by the band's first studio album in 2002, <b>Remission.</b> Both recordings were issued through Relapse Records. After a tour promoting the album <b>Remission,</b> Mastodon released their second studio album, Leviathan, in August 2004. In February 2006, Mastodon released two records — first, a compilation of early recordings, titled Call of the Mastodon, and shortly after, the video album, The Workhorse Chronicles. This same year marked the band's debut on a major label. They released Blood Mountain through Reprise Records, peaking at number 32 on the Billboard 200 chart. Mastodon then released Crack the Skye in 2009, The Hunter in 2011, and Once More 'Round the Sun in 2014, which entered the Billboard 200 at number 11, number 10, and number 6 respectively.|$|E

The nephrotic syndrome persisted in 20 of these 32 patients; <b>remissions</b> occurred in 11, 9 spontaneously and 2 with corticoid therapy. <b>Remissions</b> were sustained up to 9 years in 8 patients.

40|$|Active {{non-specific}} immunotherapy {{has been}} used to prolong <b>remissions</b> in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Further work is needed to establish the role of immunotherapy in general, and the use of B. pertussis vaccine in particular, in the treatment of acute leukaemia...|$|R

5|$|Though {{initially}} {{given only}} {{three to five}} years to live, by virtue of several new drug therapies and a bone marrow transplant in 2005, she would beat the disease's Stage1 survival mean of 62months by over a factor of two.
