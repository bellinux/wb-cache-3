50|$|The <b>Russian</b> <b>{{sturgeon}}</b> (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), {{also known}} as the diamond sturgeon or Danube sturgeon, is a species of fish in the Acipenseridae family. It is found in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. It is also found in the Caspian Sea. This fish can grow up to about 235 cm and weigh 115 kg. <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> mature and reproduce slowly, making them highly vulnerable to fishing. It is distinguished from other Acipenser species by its short snout with a rounded tip as well as its lower lip which is interrupted at its center.|$|E
40|$|Legally {{certified}} sturgeon fisheries require population {{protection and}} conserva-tion methods, including DNA tests {{to identify the}} source of valuable sturgeon roe. However, the available genetic data are insufficient to distinguish between different sturgeon populations, and are even unable to distinguish between some species. We performed high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -genotyping analysis on different populations of Russian (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), Persian (A. persicus), and Siberian (A. baerii) sturgeon species from the Caspian Sea region (Volga and Ural Rivers), the Azov Sea, and two Siberian rivers. We found that <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeons</b> from the Volga and Ural Riv-ers were essentially indistinguishable, but they differed from <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeons</b> in the Azov Sea, and from Persian and Siberian sturgeons. We identified eight SNPs that were sufficient to distinguish these sturgeon populations with 80 % confidence, and allowed the development of markers to distinguish sturgeon species.

40|$|This study investigates bio-accumulation {{of heavy}} metals in tissues of {{sturgeons}} of the North-Western Black Sea and Lower Danube River (LDR). Samples (10 – 30 gr) of liver, muscle, fat, gonads and skin tissues collected in October 2003 from 21 adult specimens of three sturgeon species: Acipenser stellatus (10), A. gueldenstaedtii (2), and Huso huso (9) were analysed for content in Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, Mn, Fe and Ni, using VARIAN Spectra A 100. The highest concentrations of Zn, Cu and Cd {{were found in}} liver and the smallest in muscles of sturgeons. The highest heavy metal content was detected in tissues of stellate <b>sturgeons,</b> followed by <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeons.</b> In all three species Cd and Cu content of the liver {{as well as of}} the stellate sturgeon muscle surpassed the admitted limits for human consumption (Cd – 0. 05; Zn - 50; Cu – 5. 0; Pb – 0. 3 [mg / kg wet weight]). In view of a future re-opening of the commercial fishing of wild sturgeons it is strongly recommended testing the heavy metal level prior delivering sturgeon products to the market. Avoiding human consumption of liver of sturgeons captured in the LDR is strongly recommended as well. In the case of Cd a bio-accumulation with age of sturgeons was visible. In all species males seem to accumulate more heavy metals in their tissues. We explain this as effect of more frequent spawning migration of males in the LDR, the major contamination source. Beluga sturgeons show less heavy metal bio-accumulation of tissues...|$|R

Studying their swimming behaviour {{is essential for}} understanding (i) the impact of construction works aiming to improve conditions for navigation; (ii) sturgeon behaviour in relation to Iron Gate hydropower and navigation systems; (iii) behaviour of young sturgeons during downstream migration towards the Black Sea. A significant number of wild adult sturgeons (N= 103; 39 beluga, 1 Russian and 63 stellate) was implanted with acoustic transmitters, with depth and temperature sensors, and their movements were tracked using arrays of submerged automatic receivers installed in the LDR (R Km 60 – 863) during 2009 – 2014. For some of these fish additional swimming depth data were obtained by manual tracking. Wild born young of the year (YOY) beluga sturgeons (N= 27) were captured in the LDR (R Km 123), implanted with acoustic transmitters and released during routine monitoring (June 2010). YOY beluga sturgeons of hatchery origin (N= 33) were implanted with acoustic transmitters and stocked in the LDR at R Km 300 and R Km 102 (August 2010). Their movements were tracked and recorded by arrays of submerged acoustic receivers installed on the main Danube (R Km 101) and the three branches of the delta. This paper analyses {{for the first time}} on the LDR consistent data (over 70, 000 recordings) on swimming speed (upstream and downstream) and swimming depth behaviour of adult sturgeons (beluga and stellate), during spring and autumn migration season, and YOY beluga sturgeons of wild and hatchery origin...|$|R

40|$|Caviar-producing {{sturgeon}} {{belonging to}} the genus Acipenser {{are considered to be}} one of the most endangered species groups in the world. Continued over-fishing in spite of increasing legislation, zero catch quotas and extensive aquaculture production, have led to the collapse of wild stocks across Europe and Asia. The evolutionary relationships among Adriatic, Russian, Persian and Siberian sturgeon are complex because of past introgression events and remain poorly understood. Conservation management, traceability and enforcement suffer a lack of appropriate DNA markers for the genetic identification of sturgeon at the species, population and individual level. This study employed RAD sequencing to discover and characterise SNP DNA markers for use in sturgeon conservation in these four tetraploid species over three biological levels, using a single sequencing lane. Four population meta-samples and eight individuals from one family were barcoded separately before sequencing. Analysis of 14. 4 Gb of paired-end RAD data focused on the identification of SNPs in the paired-end contig, with subsequent in silico and empirical validation of candidate markers.

40|$|Sturgeons (order Acipenseriformes) are {{supposed}} {{to be one of the}} oldest groups of vertebrates still living on our planet. Moreover, their polyploid ancestry makes them very susceptible for interspecifc hybridization. These interspecific and intergeneric hybrids have been already described in nature as well as in captivity. Nevertheless, the fitness of sturgeon hybrids in comparison with pure species has not been studied yet even though it can have significant impact on sturgeon aquaculture production. The main goal of this study was to investigate and compare reproductive features (fertilization rate and hatching rate), survival rate and growth rate of artificially produced hybrids of Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) and <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (A. gueldenstaedtii) with their pure parental species. The experiment was performed till 262 day after hatching. It was supposed that these observed features could have significant impact on fitness of analyzed individual/groups. The highest reproductive features had hybrid between Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) females and <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (A. gueldenstaedtii) males while purebred group of <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> displayed the lowest values of fertilization and hatching rate. At the beginning of the experiment, the highest survival rate was shown by purebred groups of Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) and <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (A. gueldenstaedtii), but this trend were slightly changed after 37 th day post hatching. At the end of the experiment, the lowest value of survival rate was shown by purebred group of <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (A. gueldenstaedtii).

The role of eosinophils in binding free oxygenic radicals is discussed. Ceruloplasmine level in plasma did not change in summer (0. 930. 24 mol/l) but increased about 42, 5 % in the period of temperature downfall. The levels of -globulins in the plasma gradually increased (from 62. 4 to 10. 43. 4 g/l), while total protein content decreased and this correlated with the growth of b. w. (r =- 0. 9825). Our data suggest that dynamic of non-specific immune mechanisms in <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> was caused by the change of the environmental impetus and somatic growth. The study points to the future research needs and directions...|$|E
40|$|The work {{covers the}} white and spotted thick-forehead fish, {{sturgeon}} x white sturgeon hybrid and also the larvae and fry of <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon.</b> The aim is to reveal the special adaptive features of chemoreceptions in the larvae of white and spotted thick-forehead fishes and sturgeon fishes for determination of the possible way to correct the sensory-active properties of the starting mixed feeds increasing their efficiency for larvae of these fishes. The dynamics of behaviour reactions in the larvae of the thick-forehead fishes and <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> to the extracts of starting mixed feeds at growing-up has been characterized firstly. The behaviour applicabiluty aspects of the early adaptation method to the chemical background of starting mixed feed in the early ontogenesis of the larvae of investigated fish species have been determined. The applicability of the early adaptation methods developed on the carp to the mixed feed relatively to the surgeon fishes has been shown firstly. The application of the method permits to improve the fish-breeding indices of growing-up larvae and fry of the sturgeon fishes on the starting mixed feeds, to reduce the growing-up periods and to increase the fry vitality.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the impact on growth performance and muscle fatty acid composition, of replacement of 50 % fish oil (FO) with canola oil (CO) and safflower oil (SFO) in the diets of <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii). Two isoproteic (48 %) and isolipidic (12 %) diets were formulated combining two oil sources (50 % fish oil + 50 % canola oil or 50 % fish oil + 50 % safflower oil). The diets were fed to apparent satiation to triplicate groups for 15 weeks, twice a day. No significant differences were observed between the experimental groups fed CO and SFO diets in terms of weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, and protein efficiency ratio. The experimental groups fed CO and SFO diets did not show significant differences in terms of protein, lipid, ash, and moisture content in their muscle. There were no significant differences in muscle between total n- 3 fatty acids but total n- 6 fatty acids were significantly higher in SFO group (24. 90 %) than in CO group (21. 30 %). Total n- 6 fatty acids were also higher than (20. 43 %) at the start. In conclusion, 50 % replacement of FO by CO or SFO in <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> diets had no negative effect on growth performance, feed efficiency and fatty acid composition in the muscle of this species...|$|E
40|$|The NW Black Sea basin {{supports}} sympatric {{population of}} beluga (Huso huso), stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus) and <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (A. gueldenstadetii). These ecologically similar fish exhibit varying life strategies during their extended juvenile period andappear to overlap at some stages within the marine coastal waters. The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the distribution and genetic diversityof sturgeons feeding in the Black Sea coastal area of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (DDBR) during 2012. A total number of 76 sturgeons (70 stellate, 5 beluga and 1 <b>Russian</b> <b>sturgeon)</b> were captured during three fishing expeditions along the Romanian Black Sea coast of the DDBR using two fishing methods: active (pelagic trawling) and passive fishing (bottom set trammel nets). A high number of stellate sturgeonswere captured in Sahalin and Zatoane areas highlighting their importance as feeding sites for all life stages of this species. Capturing of only 5 beluga sturgeon specimens suggested that coastal waters are less important feeding areas for this species. Genetic diversity of stellate and beluga sturgeons was assessed by PCR-RFLP of mtDNA D-loopregion. Six out of ten composite haplotypes were detected in stellate sturgeons and twocomposite haplotypes in beluga sturgeons. Further studies on the dynamics of sturgeon population, on behavioural and ecological factors influencing the seasonal distribution are prerequisite for improved management and sustainable use of these resources of the Black Sea. ...|$|E
