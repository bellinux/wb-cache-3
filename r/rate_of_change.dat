5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E

He discovered that the Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>change.</b> Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's celestial model. When he became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most accurate astronomical tables available up to that time.|$|E

5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E
5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
40|$|The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> a {{wide variety}} of MIMO metrics are {{evaluated}} by differentiating the relevant random processes. Moments, distributions and simplified representations are derived where possible for the resulting derivatives. Fundamental metrics such as the channel coefficients, channel correlation matrices and eigenvalues are considered in addition to performance metrics such as bit-error-rate and the condition number. The analysis presents a comprehensive framework for studying the time-varying nature of MIMO systems in independent Rayleigh fading and leads to insights into the relative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the various metrics. For example, we show that there is a difference of several orders of magnitude between the moderate <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> channel elements and eigenvalues and the extremely rapid variations of the channel condition number. The channel eigenvectors are also shown to experience rapid fluctuations. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognized that evolution may occur in ecological time. It is not clear, however, how fast evolution – or phenotypic change more generally – {{may be in}} comparison with the associated ecology, or whether systems with fast ecological dynamics generally have relatively fast <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> phenotypic <b>change.</b> We developed a new dataset on standardized <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in population size and phenotypic traits {{for a wide range of}} species and taxonomic groups. We show that <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in phenotypes are generally no more than 2 / 3, and on average about 1 / 4, the concurrent <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in population size. There was no relationship between <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> population <b>change</b> and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> phenotypic <b>change</b> across systems. We also found that the variance of both phenotypic and ecological rates increased with the mean across studies following a power law with an exponent of two, while temporal variation in phenotypic rates was lower than in ecological rates. Our results are consistent with the view that ecology and evolution may occur at similar time scales, but clarify that only rarely do populations change as fast in traits as they do in abundance...|$|R
40|$|Satellite laser ranging (SLR) {{observed}} baseline <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> {{were measured}} and compared with rates determined from sea floor spreading rates and directions, and earth-quake solutions. With {{the number of}} years of observation now over six for many of the baselines, the inaccuracy <b>of</b> determining baseline <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> has diminished so that in some cases it is less than a few mm per year. Thus, a direct comparison between baseline <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> established using geophysical information (called geological rates) is now feasible. In most cases, there is good agreement between the rates determined from SLR and geological rates, but in some cases there appear to be discrepancies. These discrepancies involve many of the data for which one end of the baseline is either Quincy (California), Huahine (French Polynesia), or Simosato (Japan). A method for looking at the discrepancies for these SLR observatories has been devised which makes it possible to calculate the motion not modeled by the geologic information...|$|R
5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E
5|$|Patagonia, in the south, {{is mostly}} arid or semi–arid {{except in the}} extreme west where {{abundant}} precipitation supports dense forest coverage, glaciers, and permanent snowfields. Its climate is classified as temperate to cool temperate with the surrounding oceans moderating temperatures on the coast. Away from the coast, areas on the plateaus have large daily and annual temperature ranges. The influence of the Andes, in conjunction with general circulation patterns, generates {{one of the strongest}} precipitation gradients (<b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in mean annual precipitation in relation to a particular location) in the world, decreasing rapidly to the east. In much of Patagonia precipitation is concentrated in winter with snowfall occurring occasionally, particularly in the mountainous west and south; precipitation is more evenly distributed in the east and south. One defining characteristic is the strong winds from the west which blow year-round, lowering the perception of temperature (wind chill), while being a factor in keeping the region arid by favouring evaporation.|$|E

5|$|Models are {{initialized}} {{using this}} observed data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid). The data are then {{used in the}} model {{as the starting point}} for a forecast. Commonly, the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations. These equations are initialized from the analysis data and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> are determined. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future. The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> and these new <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. This time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. The length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid.|$|R
