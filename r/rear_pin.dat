5000|$|This {{style of}} rifle {{is made by}} {{combining}} an AR-15 upper receiver with an AR-15 lower receiver {{which has not been}} banned by specific name, and which has a fixed, non-detachable 10-round (maximum, anything above 10 is a felony) magazine. In such a configuration, otherwise prohibited features such as a telescoping stock, pistol grip, and flash hider may be present. While formerly prohibited under the now-expired federal assault weapon ban of 1994-2004, the presence of a bayonet lug is not prohibited by California state law and can be present on firearms without violation. However, the magazine cannot be detachable, so to load the rifle the shooter must either [...] "top load" [...] or use a tool to release the magazine lock (such as the tip of a bullet in [...] "bullet button" [...] equipped rifles). To top-load, the shooter pulls the <b>rear</b> takedown <b>pin,</b> hinges the upper receiver on the front pivot pin, and loads the now exposed magazine. Alternatively, several [...] "magazine lock" [...] devices are available which replace the magazine release button with an inset pin that requires the use of a special tool to release the magazine, thereby, disallowing a readily [...] "detachable magazine", to be compliant with California state firearms law.|$|R
25|$|Improvised {{firearms}} are {{not solely}} {{the province of}} the criminal element. They are also used by insurgents. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, the paliuntod, a type of improvised shotgun, was commonly used by guerrillas and the joint American and Filipino soldiers who remained behind after Douglas MacArthur's withdrawal. Made of two pieces of pipe that fit snugly together, the paliuntod was a simple, single shot open-bolt design. The shell was placed in the breech of the barrel, which was then fitted into the larger-diameter receiver. The receiver was capped at the breech end, and had a fixed firing pin placed to strike the primer of the shell. When the barrel was pulled sharply to the <b>rear,</b> the firing <b>pin</b> would strike the primer and fire the gun.

50|$|The fibula is a {{multilayered}} structure. Its face {{consists of}} a very thin fire gilded and contoured silver disc, having a diameter of 58 mm. This is fixed by three silver rivet pins to an identically sized, 3 mm thick copper plate and together with this on a stronger silver plate. The rear plate, 78 mm in diameter, is significantly larger. On its <b>rear,</b> the <b>pin</b> was mounted. The reverse of the front plate {{was filled with a}} now whitish green mix of tin, lead and traces of copper in order to support the sensitive friction work and to prevent the pressing of the driven ornaments. But the tin components of the filler have damaged some of the metal parts of the decoration due to allotropic processes forced by low temperatures during long term storage in the soil (tin pest). The decoration {{consists of a}} quadrupedal animal walking to the right, with the animals head facing backwards. It has two ears and a protruding tongue. Around its neck it wears a collar shaped ornament. The legs are positioned under the body to accommodate the round shape of the disc. The background is decorated with irregularly distributed impressions, imitating a granulation. The scene is framed by two ribbed bands, which are enclosed by an ornamental wreath and another ribbed band. Around the body of the animal there are three rosette shaped rivet heads. The body of the animal has a large defect caused by the degenerated tin filling. Some of the protruding edges of the rear mounting plate are broken away. Beneath the copper plate, residual amounts of organic material were found, which were interpreted as ivory. Due to typological comparisons of the ornaments, the fibula was dated to circa 300 AD.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSurface {{striations}} with spacing {{equal to}} feed rate per rotation and banded {{structures in the}} weld nugget {{are some of the}} striking features of friction stir welding. However, their formation is still subject to some debate. This study contributes to comprehend their formation by evaluating the possible role played by the eccentricity of the tool during the welding of an aluminium alloy and using a plasticine as its analogue. The eccentric movement is visualized to generate both surface and bulk striations in plasticine. By voluntarily using non optimized welding conditions on aluminium, the material flow has been deduced and confronted with direct visual observations through high speed camera on plasticine. In the non closed section of the weld, two lobes each with thickness equal to feed rate per rotation were observed. First lobe corresponds to flow induced by the pin and tests on plasticine showed constant volume displacement per rotation for a given tool eccentricity. The second lobe is generated by material flow from under the shoulder back to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>pin.</b> The assembling or not of these two lobs behind the pin can explain some of the characteristic patterns observed in the weld nugget such as onion rings, oxide dispersions and cavities...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of tree stump extraction on the diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce Picea abies roots. I tested if the density of saproxylic beetles was {{the same in the}} interior layer of the stump storage piles as in the exterior layer. I also tested if the beetle density was as high or higher in piles as in remaining stumps at extraction clear-cuts and to test if they could be ecological traps. I tested if species at higher trophic level as well as red-listed species could be impacted negatively by stump extraction. A total of 110 root wood samples were collected from 6 clear-cuts and 6 extraction clear-cuts and 4 different piles in central Sweden near Uppsala, Lindesberg and Fågelfors. The clear-cuts were dominated by Norway spruce and were sampled 1 to 2 years after clear felling. Norway spruce is the most common tree species used in tree stump extraction. Insect were reared from the sampled roots in rearing boxes for 8 weeks. Insects were also sampled after the rearing box period by pealing the bark of the roots and putting the bark in Tullgren-funnels to sample the last insects inside the bark. The sampled Coleoptera were determined to species level. A total of 1379 beetles of 35 species were collected from the roots. Higher species richness was found inside the piles (PIN) than {{on the outside of the}} piles (POUT). Hardly any difference was found between the clear-cut (C) and extraction clear-cut (EC) in species-richness per root-sample, but a significant difference was found between the pile habitats. Common saproxylic species, like Dryocetes autographus and Hylastes cunicularius, showed increased abundance in C and EC but a decrease in the storage piles. The pest species Pityogenes chalcographus was only <b>reared</b> in <b>PIN.</b> Predatory species higher up in the trophic levels, like the staphylinid Nudobius lentus, were found in low abundance in C, EC and in POUT but not in PIN. This could mean that the piles can be an ecological trap to species at higher trophic levels as well as for some pest species. The results of this study indicates that tree stump extraction can cause a lower diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce roots and a decreased species richness if the stump piles constitutes an ecological trap. As a consequence, this can decrease the diversity and species richness in the surrounding area...|$|R

The exterminators are toyed with at every turn; The ghost knocks Mickey on the head and puts his fingers in his gun and it explodes. Mickey is driven upstairs and tries to open a door, which falls down and the ghosts (forming a marching band) come out of the fallen door and go into another.
