The high temperature Fischer-Tropsch process also uses mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide to generate synthetic fuels from non-fossil precursors. As the Fischer-Tropsch process depends upon particular gas mixtures to generate various fuels, a sensor which can determine the proper ratio of reactants is needed. To this end, gallium nitride (GaN) {{has been used to}} fabricate a <b>resistive</b> gas <b>sensor.</b> GaN is a suitable semiconductor to be used in hydrogen because of a wide, direct bandgap and greater stability than many other semiconductors. Additionally, <b>resistive</b> <b>sensors</b> offer several advantages in design compared to other types of sensors. Response time of <b>resistive</b> <b>sensors</b> is faster than those of other semiconductor sensors because catalytic and diffusion steps {{are not part of the}} response mechanism.

40|$|<b>Resistive</b> <b>sensor</b> arrays {{have been}} {{increasingly}} adopted in wearable electronic applications, which require low-complexity and low-energy circuits. However, current readout strategies for <b>resistive</b> <b>sensor</b> arrays require additional electrical components, such as transistors, diodes, multiplexers, op-amps, switches, current sources, and A/D converters, {{leading to a}} considerable increase in circuit complexity, power consumption, system instability, and crosstalk error. To address the problem, this paper proposes a new approach, which determines sensor resistance values by establishing and solving resistance matrix equations of sensor arrays. Unlike conventional approaches, it allows crosstalk currents in arrays to avoid additional components that are originally used for eliminating crosstalk currents and minimizing crosstalk error. Meanwhile, it takes advantage of on-chip resources of wearable platforms, thereby reducing redundant chips. It was implemented on a prototype of 10 × 10 textile <b>resistive</b> <b>sensor</b> array, which was taken in a sensing cushion for sitting pressure monitoring of chair bound people. Experimental results on this array platform showed the new approach achieved a satisfactory accuracy (0. 61 % ± 0. 41 %), {{as well as a}} low crosstalk error (2. 77 % ± 0. 61 %).
