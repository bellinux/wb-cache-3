40|$|We show a {{hitherto}} unexplored {{consequence of}} the property of identicity in quantum mechanics. If two identical objects, distinguished by a dynamical variable A, are in certain entangled states of another dynamical variable B, then, for such states, they are also entangled in variable A when distinguished from each other by variable B. This dualism is independent of quantum statistics. Departures from identicity of the objects due to arbitrarily small differences in their innate attributes destroy this dualism. A system independent scheme to test the dualism is formulated which is <b>readily</b> <b>realizable</b> with photons.

It was found that the optimum wall properties for locally reducing the growth of disturbances depend quite strongly on the Reynolds number. This suggests that it would be advantageous to use multiple-panel walls with each compliant panel optimized for a particular Reynolds number range. Accordingly, the optimization procedure is extended to two-panel compliant walls, and the optimum wall properties are determined that correspond to the greatest transition delay. It is found that, based on a conservative value of n = 7, the e(n) method predicts that the greatest transitional Reynolds number achievable using single- and two-panel compliant walls is respectively 4. 6 and 6. 05 times the rigid-wall value.

40|$|A single Dirac cone on {{the surface}} is the {{hallmark}} of three-dimensional (3 D) topological insulators, where the double degeneracy at the Dirac point is protected by time-reversal symmetry and the spin-splitting away from the point is provided by the spin-orbital coupling. Here we predict a single Dirac-cone surface state in a 3 D photonic crystal, where the degeneracy at the Dirac point is protected by a nonsymmorphic glide reflection and the linear splitting away from it is enabled by breaking time-reversal symmetry. Such a gapless surface state is fully robust against random disorder of any type. This bosonic topological band structure is achieved by applying alternating magnetization to gap out the 3 D "generalized Dirac points" discovered in the bulk of our crystal.

The strong spin-orbit coupling and two-dimensional nature of these surface states make them ideal platforms for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions. In this paper we further develop a proposal to realize Majorana fermions {{at the ends of}} quasi-one-dimensional metallic wires. We show how superconductivity can be induced on the metallic surface states by a combination of proximity effect, disorder, and interactions. Applying a magnetic field along the wire can drive the wire into a topologically nontrivial state with Majorana end states. Unlike the case of a perpendicular field, where the chemical potential must be fine-tuned near the Rashba band crossing, the parallel field allows one to realize Majorana fermions for an arbitrarily large chemical potential. We then show that, despite the presence of a large carrier density from the bulk metal, it is still possible to effectively control the chemical potential of the surface states by gating.

40|$|The symmetries that {{dictate the}} {{existence}} of relativistic Dirac quasiparticles in condensed-matter systems have been exploited in the realization of a plethora of artificial Dirac materials. In these artificial systems, the ability to design and manipulate the lattice structure has enabled the exploration of Dirac physics in new regimes. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to the effect of the surrounding environment on the nature of the Dirac quasiparticles. Here we theoretically investigate honeycomb arrays of meta-atoms embedded inside a planar photonic cavity. Massless Dirac polaritons emerge near the conventional Dirac points located at the corners of the Brillouin zone, in analogy with graphene. However, this analogy breaks down as the interaction with the photonic environment generates additional satellite Dirac points with ∓π Berry flux. Reducing the cavity height induces the merging of the satellite Dirac points with the conventional ones, forming a quadratic band-degeneracy with combined ∓ 2 π Berry flux. As a result, the massless Dirac polaritons with a linear spectrum morph into massive ones with a parabolic spectrum. Remarkably, this merging is not followed by Dirac point annihilation, but instead, massless Dirac polaritons re-emerge with an unprecedented inversion of chirality which has no analog in real or artificial graphene systems.

This thesis presents the design, implementation and analysis of a system for educating undergraduate students about manufacturability considerations; groups of students were given training in a software package that provides visualizations of the turning process and trained on the operation of CNC machine tools. Knowledge assessments were given to the students to measure their understanding of a variety of topics in manufacturability. A control group, who also completed the knowledge assessments, was not provided with access to the visualization software and only completed manual machining training.

It is intended to serve as a guideline for the porting of the Taskmaster Operating system to hardware components of any microprocessor. Utilizing this analysis, the core of the Taskmaster Operating system was implemented on a new hardware environment, satisfying several system requirements. One particular condition was to keep components of the new Taskmaster system compatible to those of the old system. This was realized by preserving the lower communication layers and a particular communication protocol.

40|$|The {{need for}} fusion {{propulsion}} for interplanetary flights is discussed. For a propulsion system, {{there are three}} important system attributes: (1) The absolute amount of energy available, (2) the propellant exhaust velocity, and (3) the jet power per unit mass of the propulsion system (specific power). For human exploration {{and development of the}} solar system, propellant exhaust velocity in excess of 100 km/s and specific power in excess of 10 kW/kg are required. Chemical combustion cannot meet the requirement in propellant exhaust velocity. Nuclear fission processes typically result in producing energy in the form of heat that needs to be manipulated at temperatures limited by materials to about 2, 800 K. Using the energy to heat a low atomic weight propellant cannot overcome the problem. Alternatively the energy can be converted into electricity which is then used to accelerate particles to high exhaust velocity. The necessary power conversion and conditioning equipment, however, increases the mass of the propulsion system for the same jet power by more than two orders of magnitude over chemical system, thus greatly limits the thrust-to-weight ratio attainable. If fusion can be developed, fusion appears to have the best of all worlds in terms of propulsion - it can provide the absolute amount, the propellant exhaust velocity, and the high specific jet power. An intermediate step towards pure fusion propulsion is a bimodal system in which a fission reactor is used to provide some of the energy to drive a fusion propulsion unit. The technical issues related to fusion for space propulsion are discussed. There are similarities as well as differences at the system level between applying fusion to propulsion and to terrestrial electrical power generation. The differences potentially provide a wider window of opportunities for applying fusion to propulsion. For example, pulsed approaches to fusion may be attractive for the propulsion application.

40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that humans will attempt to explore and develop the solar system in this century. A large amount of energy will be {{required}} for accomplishing this. The need for fusion propulsion is discussed. For a propulsion system, there are three important thermodynamical attributes: (1) The absolute amount of energy available, (2) the propellant exhaust velocity, and (3) the jet power per unit mass of the propulsion system (specific power). For human exploration and development of the solar system, propellant exhaust velocity in excess of 100 km/s and specific power in excess of 10 kW/kg are required. Chemical combustion can produce exhaust velocity up to about 5 km/s. Nuclear fission processes typically result in producing energy in the form of heat that needs to be manipulated at temperatures limited by materials to about 2, 800 K. Using the energy to heat a hydrogen propellant increases the exhaust velocity by only a factor of about two. Alternatively the energy can be converted into electricity which is then used to accelerate particles to high exhaust velocity. The necessary power conversion and conditioning equipment, however, increases the mass of the propulsion system for the same jet power by more than two orders of magnitude over chemical system, thus greatly limits the thrust-to-weight ratio attainable. The principal advantage of the fission process is that its development is relatively mature and is available right now. If fusion can be developed, fusion appears to have the best of all worlds in terms of propulsion - it can provide the absolute amount, the propellant exhaust velocity, and the high specific jet power. An intermediate step towards pure fusion propulsion is a bimodal system in which a fission reactor is used to provide some of the energy to drive a fusion propulsion unit. The technical issues related to fusion for space propulsion are discussed. The technical priorities for developing and applying fusion for propulsion are somewhat different from those for terrestrial electrical power generation. Thus fusion schemes that are initially attractive for electrical power generation might not necessarily be attractive also for propulsion and vice versa, though the underlying fusion science and engineering enjoy much overlap. Parallel efforts to develop these qualitatively differently fusion schemes for the two applications could benefit greatly from each other due to the synergy in the underlying physics and engineering. Pulsed approaches to fusion have not been explored to the same degree as steady-state or long-pulse approaches to fusion in the fusion power research program. The concerns early on were several. One was that the pulsed power components might not have the service lifetimes meeting the requirements of a practical power generating plant. Another was that, for many pulsed fusion schemes, it was not clear whether the destruction of hardware per pulse could be minimized or eliminated or recycled to such an extent as to make economical electrical power generation feasible, Significant development of the underlying pulsed power component technologies have occurred {{in the last two decades}} because of defense and other energy requirements. The state of development of the pulsed power technologies are sufficiently advanced now to make it compelling to visit or re-visit pulsed fusion approaches for application to propulsion where the cost of energy is not so demanding a factor as in the case of terrestrial power application. For propulsion application, the overall mass of the fusion system is the critical factor. Producing fusion reactions require extreme states of matter. Conceptually, these extreme states of matter are more <b>readily</b> <b>realizable</b> in the pulsed states, at least within appropriate bounds, than in the steady states. Significant saving in system mass may result in such systems. Magnetic fields are effective in confining plasma energy, whereas inertial compression is an effective way of heating and containing the plasma. Intensive research in developing magnetic energy containment and inertial plasma compression are being pursued in distinctively different fusion experiments in the terrestrial fusion power program. Fusion schemes that attempt to combine the favorable attributes of these two aspects into one single integrated fusion scheme appear to have benefits that are worth exploring for propulsion application...|$|R
