5|$|M-142 begins just a {{few miles}} south of Bay Port at an {{intersection}} with M-25 near the Bay Port Cemetery, about two-thirds of a mile (1.1km) inland from Saginaw Bay. From there, the road travels eastward through farm country on Pigeon Road. The highway follows a direct course over the Pigeon River to the village of Pigeon, when M-142 turns south on Main Street to exit town. South of town, the Pigeon <b>Road</b> <b>name</b> resumes, and after about , M-142 turns back eastward near the Grand Lawn Cemetery. The road then continues eastward through more farms to Elkton, diverting off a direct course to cross a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway {{on the east side of}} town.|$|E

5|$|NY191 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY22 and Miner Farm Road (CR23) in the Clinton County hamlet of Sciota, {{located within the}} town of Chazy. The route headed to the northeast as a two-lane county-maintained, state-numbered highway, overlapping with CR23 and taking on the Miner Farm <b>Road</b> <b>name.</b> East of Sciota, the highway traversed lightly developed areas, serving several residences separated by patches of woodlands. The route eventually began {{to turn to the}} southeast, connecting with Angelville Road (unsigned CR20) in the process. A long stretch of dense forests followed the turn, with little to no development along the highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} place names in Chadderton {{suggests}} that the ancient Britons once inhabited the area. Remains of Roman roads have been discovered running through the town, and the local <b>road</b> <b>name</b> Streetbridge {{suggests that the}} Romans once marched along it on a path which {{may have led to}} Blackstone Edge. Relics found at a tumulus in Chadderton Fold date from the Early Middle Ages, probably from the early period of Anglo-Saxon England, when Angles settled in the area and Chadderton emerged as a manor of the hundred of Salford.|$|E
5|$|After NY18, NY93 curves to the southeast, serving another {{residential}} stretch {{ahead of}} a junction with YoungstownWilson Road (CR36) on {{the eastern edge of}} Towers Corners. After this intersection, the homes give way to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town. The route continues on a southeast track through Porter, passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of Porter Center, where NY93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road (CR57). Another southeastward stretch brings the route across Twelvemile Creek and into the hamlet of Ransomville, where NY93 becomes the community's main street. Through Ransomville, NY93 retains the YoungstownLockport <b>Road</b> <b>name,</b> intersecting with Ransomville Road (CR17) in the hamlet's business district.|$|E

5|$|M-102 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that {{runs along the}} northern boundary of Detroit following 8Mile Road. The highway follows the Michigan Baseline, {{a part of the}} land survey of the state, and the roadway is also called Base Line Road in places. As a county road or city street, 8Mile Road extends both east and west of the M-102 designation, which leaves 8Mile on the eastern end to follow Vernier Road. The western terminus of M-102 is at the junction of 8Mile Road and M-5 (Grand River Avenue) and the opposite end is at Vernier Road and Interstate94 (I-94). The 8Mile <b>Road</b> <b>name</b> extends west to Pontiac Trail near South Lyon with a discontinuous segment located west of US Highway23 (US23). The eastern end of 8Mile Road is in Grosse Pointe Woods near I-94.|$|E
5|$|One block {{north of}} CR100, Caleb's Path forks {{off to the}} {{northwest}} while NY111 splits to the northeast along Joshua's Path, serving {{a long stretch of}} homes {{in the northern part of}} Central Islip. Several blocks to the north, NY111 intersects with CR67 (Long Island Motor Parkway) at an at-grade intersection on the northern edge of the community. Now out of Central Islip, the route traverses industrialized areas surrounding a large Y intersection with CR17 (Wheeler Road) in Hauppauge. NY111 takes on the Wheeler <b>Road</b> <b>name,</b> and the route immediately enters an interchange (exit56) with the Long Island Expressway (I-495). From here, the route bends northeast along Wheeler Road, paralleling the Nissequogue River as it serves the northern part of the town of Islip.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} and ending of M-185 is marked {{at the intersection of}} Main and Fort streets next to the visitor center. That building is operated by the MISPC, but it was originally a US Coast Guard station. From its starting point, M-185 heads east between Marquette Park, at the base of Fort Mackinac, and the marina at Haldimand Bay. The roadway passes the Indian Dormitory (Mackinac Art Center), as well as various hotels, bed and breakfast establishments, private residences and landmarks such as Sainte Anne's Catholic Church, Mission Church and the Mission House. Main Street then turns northeasterly, passing Mission Point Resort (the former Mackinac College), after which the <b>road</b> <b>name</b> changes to Lake Shore Road. Along this section of the trunkline, Shoreline Trail departs to the south and follows the water's edge before returning to M-185 at the city's water filtration plant.|$|E

5|$|The final route used by M-70 {{followed}} Melita Road {{starting at}} M-76 northwest of Sterling. The highway ran north {{and crossed the}} Rifle River at a point between sections of the Ogemaw State Forest. The highway turned east on Main Street Road in Melita. From there, M-70 ran east on Main Street Road to the junction with Reed Road where it turned northward to Maple Ridge Road. The highway followed Maple Ridge Road east into Maple Ridge and turned north on Briggs Road. Crossing the Ogemaw–Arenac county line, the <b>road</b> <b>name</b> changed to Sage Lake Road into the village of Prescott. From there, it turned westerly on Greenwood Road through downtown Prescott, and north on Clark Road to end at M-55 one mile (1.6km) west of Nester Corners, which is the intersection of South Sage Lake Road and M-55.|$|E
5|$|The highway briefly {{parallels}} Fall Creek; however, it soon splits to {{the southeast}} at a junction with CR103 (Groton City Road). From here, NY222 continues on a generally southeasterly alignment along {{the base of a}} rural valley to the Tompkins–Cortland county line. Now in the town of Cortlandville, the route loses the Cortland <b>Road</b> <b>name</b> as it curves eastward to match similar turns {{in the course of the}} valley. The highway follows a winding course until the surrounding gully empties into the much wider Tioughnioga River valley, where the route straightens out and intersects with CR119 (Sears Road). East of this point, NY222 begins to run northeastward past homes as it approaches Cortland County–Chase Field Airport. The route provides direct access to the airport and subsequently meets NY281 (West Road) at the northeastern tip of the airport property.|$|E
5|$|Wagener County Park {{is located}} off M-25 in the {{community}} of Helena. M-25 begins to curve to the northwest in Sand Beach near the Rock Falls Cemetery. In the city of Harbor Beach, M-25 is called Huron Avenue and meets M-142 for the first of two occasions. Here is the Harbor Beach Golf Course {{on the south side of}} town as M-25 moves inland through town. North of town, the trunkline parallels an old routing of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway as it is once again renamed Lakeshore Road. The highway moves farther inland north of Rubicon and Port Hope as it begins to round the tip of the Thumb. In Grindstone City, M-25 loses the Lakeshore <b>Road</b> <b>name</b> in favor of Grindstone Road all the way to Port Austin.|$|E

5|$|When Ptolemy {{wrote his}} Geography around 150 AD, the Arun {{was called the}} Trisantonis, with later {{accounts}} using the same name. Trisantonis {{is thought to be}} a Brythonic word for 'the trespasser', indicating the river's tendency to flood land near to the river. Trisanto translates directly as 'one who goes across'. There is also a theory that the Arun may have been known as the Trisantonis in its lower reaches close to the sea, but known as the Arnus (from the Brythonic 'Arno' meaning run, go, or flow) in its upper reaches. It is possible that the town of Arundel may mean Arno-dell, or dell of the flowing river. By the Middle Ages the river was known as the river of Arundel, the Arundel river, or the high stream of Arundel. An alternative name, the Tarrant (derived from Trisantona), is, however, attested in 725 and 1270, and is reflected in the <b>road</b> <b>name</b> Tarrant Street, one of the main roads running through the town roughly parallel to the river. The first use of the modern name was recorded in 1577, but the alternative names of Arundel river or great river continued to be used for many years.|$|E
25|$|As {{there is}} little archaeological {{evidence}} to date the western Wansdyke, it may have marked a division between British Celtic kingdoms or have been a boundary with the Saxons.

In addition, one of the first Woolwich Free Ferry vessels was named Gordon in his memory.|$|E
25|$|Now {{split from}} NY384, NY265 crosses under the LaSalle, turning {{northwest}} into a junction with Cayuga Drive. Dropping the South Military <b>Road</b> <b>name,</b> NY265 runs northwest through Niagara Falls' east side as Cayuga Drive. Running {{along the west}} bank of Cayuga Creek, NY265 soon reaches a fork with Military Road, which continues northwest as NY265 while Cayuga Drive continues north along the creek. Military Road is a two-lane street through the east side of Niagara Falls, crossing an intersection with U.S. Route62 (US62; Niagara Falls Boulevard).|$|E
25|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} {{differences of}} a Melway-style map from other Australian street directories {{is in the}} rendering of roads. Rather than the traditional drawing of two lines with the <b>road</b> <b>name</b> printed in-between, (known as 'double casing') Melway maps show a single line with the name above or below the road, in many colours reflecting the identity or usage of the road. This allows for much more detail {{to fit into the}} same size map, as well as showing dual carriageways, slip lanes, service roads, speed bumps, roundabouts, and other useful information.|$|E
