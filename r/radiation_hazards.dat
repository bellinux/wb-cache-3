5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the <b>radiation</b> <b>hazards</b> and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hedley Marston's {{research}} into nuclear {{fallout from the}} Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the Australian government appointed Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. He was vindicated posthumously by the McClelland Royal Commission, which found that significant <b>radiation</b> <b>hazards</b> existed at many of the Maralinga test sites long after the tests. His project tracked fallout across the continent by examining the thyroids of sheep and cattle as well as devices that filtered radioactive elements from air. Later the results, which showed dramatic increases of certain radioactive elements after British Nuclear Tests, caused a further, controversial study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. These tests showed that the tests had increased the concentration of strontium-90 dramatically. As well as finding this after British tests a notable 50% increase was noticed one year {{when there were no}} tests and it was cited as evidence that the previous year's hydrogen bomb tests had contaminated the majority of the world.|$|E
