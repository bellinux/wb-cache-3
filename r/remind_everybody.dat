500|$|Like {{many other}} African hip hop groups {{including}} Positive Black Soul, Daara J takes an activist stance. Faada Freddy states: [...] "We tell {{of peace and}} how we can live together because there are lots of conflicts going on nowadays. We're here on behalf of the Africans to <b>remind</b> <b>everybody</b> that it shouldn't be like that. There's always a solution. Rather than fussing and fighting we'd better learn to live in peace and live together, because that's the only way to survive." [...] The group is especially focused on educating the world about Africa. Faada Freddy has also stressed the importance of understanding life on the continent: [...] "Nowadays people are tending to show the negative part of Africa but Africa is not only about AIDS, heartache, corruption and all that even though it exists just like everywhere else. But Africa has a lot to provide." [...] In the Senegalese election of 2000, Daara J were involved in editing speeches for political leaders and the promotion of that year's campaign against corruption.|$|E

[...] He also indicated that the lack of focus on post-invasion security was a mistake. He later stated that [...] "knowing what we know now, ...I would not have engaged". [...] "I would not have gone into Iraq", he said. [...] He also argued that the invasion—though perhaps inspired by faulty intelligence—had been beneficial, saying the world was [...] "significantly safer" [...] without Saddam Hussein in power.|$|E

50|$|As well as {{donating}} the Carthage Cottages Lord Llangattock donated £1000 in 1840 for {{a replacement}} to the Dispensary. It was not until 60 years later on the 6th November 1903, a new Cottage Hospital and Dispensary opened in Hereford Road. The work started in April 1902. The laying of the Memorial Stone took place on September 27, 1902. Lord Llangattock president of the hospital <b>reminded</b> <b>everybody</b> at the ceremony that {{it was for the}} suffering and afflicted poor. The ground was bought from the Duke of Beaufort for £250. It was designed by Richard Creed, built by Collins and Geoffrey and Furnished by George Edwards of Monmouth.|$|R

60|$|The {{articles}} {{brought up}} on the plain, at this first trip, comprised all that was necessary to prepare and to partake of a breakfast in comfort. A fire was soon blazing, the kettle on, and the bread-fruit baking. It was almost painful to destroy the reed-birds, or becca fichi so numerous were they, and so confiding. One discharge from each barrel of the fowling-piece had enabled Heaton to bring in enough for the whole party, and these were soon roasting. Mark had brought with him from the Reef a basket of fresh eggs, {{and they had been}} Bridget's load, in ascending the mountain. He had promised her an American breakfast, and these eggs, boiled, did serve to <b>remind</b> <b>everybody</b> of a distant home, that was still remembered with melancholy pleasure. A heartier, or a happier meal, notwithstanding, was never made than was that breakfast. The mountain air, invigorating though bland, the exercise, the absence of care, the excellence of the food, which comprised fresh figs, a tree or two of tolerable sweetness having been found, the milk of the cocoa-nut, the birds, the eggs, the bread-fruit, &c., all contributed their share to render the meal memorable.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1891, {{he first}} went to Alwar, where he was warmly welcomed by the Hindus and the Muslims. There he told a Muslim {{religion}} scholar that one significant feature of the Quran is, though it was written a thousand years ago, the book was free from [...] "interpolation" [...] and retained its original purity. When Narendra met the Mangal Singh, king of Alwar, whose outlook was Westernised, Singh challenged Narendra and ridiculed Hindu idol worship. Narendra attempted {{to explain to him}} that Hindu worship is symbolic worship, but failed to make the king understand. Then Narendra saw a painting hanging on the wall, it was the a painting of the Singh's deceased father and asked him to spit on it. Singh became angry and retorted how he could spit on his father. Narendra explained, though it was just a painting, not the king himself, it <b>reminds</b> <b>everybody</b> about the king, similarly an idol worshipped by a Hindu is actually a symbolic worship of the Supreme.|$|R
5000|$|Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars, saying [...] "He's too quick to reach for sexist clichés; cheap shots at groupies and gold diggers {{undercut}} moments of real emotion. What Wale lusts for most of all is respect. [...] "Fuck fame, fuck money," [...] he declares. [...] "I'm {{just trying to be}} legendary." [...] Someday, maybe, but not quite yet." [...] The A.V. Club gave the album a B, saying [...] "In its efforts to woo women listeners, Ambition softens some of the harder edges from Maybach’s other releases, but Ross’ rotund shadow looms large over the record nonetheless. The mogul gets feature credits on two songs, and even on a couple of tracks he isn’t billed on. He’s there in the background, grunting approvingly, <b>reminding</b> <b>everybody</b> who made this possible." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters gave the album a five out of ten, saying [...] "There’s also no risks taken here compared to his debut. Instead, Ambition gives us pretty much the same song over and over again with just a few variations on the template, and feels like the hip-hop equivalent of listening to some pop rock band’s album who you’d never have guessed was being bet on by a major unless you were told. The music’s efficient and there’s literally nothing to get annoyed or disgusted by (unless [...] "Illest Bitch" [...] weirds you out for his calling his sister in a bitch in a positive context) and so Ambition leaves listeners to answer the simple question of whether they want an exceptionally unchallenging album to listen to for an hour or not. I’ll just take the highlights." ...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, the ISC in Stockholm held {{a meeting}} at the office of the Stormklocken {{newspaper}} on July 3, with representatives of the Soviets to attempt to clarify the situation. Present at this meeting were Linstrom, Lindhagen and Hoglund for Sweden; Olausen for Norway; Otto Lang for Switzerland; Karl Kautsky, Hugo Haase, Lousie Zeitz, and Oskar Cohn for Germany; Sirola for Finland; Orlovsky, Radek and Hanecki for the Bolsheviks; Boris Reinstein for the US Socialist Labor Party; Kirkov for Bulgaria and Balabanoff in her capacity as secretary of the ISC. The representatives of the Soviet were Goldenberg, Vladimir Rozanov and [...] "Smirnov". At this meeting Balabanoff, Orlavsky and Reinstien stated their objections to the invitation of the majority Socialist parties to the proposed Stockholm conference. Goldberg replied that the proposed conference was open to socialist parties without conditions, and would include minorities as well as majorities. Radek re-emphasized the Bolshevik party's disapproval of the Stockholm Conference and the Party's determination to quit the Zimmerwald movement if the Third Zimmerwald Conference chose to participate. Haase, of the Independent Socialist Party of Germany, however, was for the Conference and stated that his party would attend. Again, Balabanoff <b>reminded</b> <b>everybody</b> that no single party could dictate the ISCs position, which would be decided by the third Zimmerwald Conference. On the next day the conclave resumed, this time without the Soviet delegates. A statement was adopted {{in the name of the}} [...] "Bureau of the International Socialist Commission" [...] to the effect that the Third Zimmerwald Conference would take place five days before the proposed general Stockholm Conference, but should the conference not meet by September 15, 1917 the commission was empowered to call a conference of affiliates anyway.|$|R

[...] Janet Mock of People magazine extolled her performance that [...] "Houston gave one of the most iconic interpretations of the National Anthem in history." [...] Writing for MTV.com in February 2009, Gil Kaufman said the song is a [...] "legendary take on the National Anthem."

[...] Jenny Mayo of The Washington Times, in her review of Houston's 2009 album I Look to You, praised the rendition highly: [...] "Miss Houston is an artist who can—or at least used to—make songs untouchable.

50|$|The {{ruler of}} Chembakaserry kingdom was a renowned Nambuthiri Brahmin who {{took pride in}} the {{prosperity}} of his own kingdom and Sri Krishna temple. Since temples were then considered keystones to a kingdom's spiritual and temporal well-being, the King decided to embarrass the rulers of Nanrulainattu (capital-Thrikodithanam) by making a deliberate, untimely visit to the famous Vishnu Temple.He arrived in Thrikodithanam after the Seiveli puja (the last ceremony of the day) and after the temple had closed. It is considered very inauspicious to open a temple after the gods are put to rest, but still, the King forced an entry by bribing a caretaker.When the rulers of Nanrulainattu discovered this indiscretion, they were furious. The caretaker was beheaded and, soon, the Chambakaserry king too fell ill and died. So this stone figure was installed near the temple entrance to deter any future offenders and to <b>remind</b> <b>everybody</b> {{of the consequences of}} disturbing the gods. Another version of the story lays the blame on the king of Ambalapuzha for this surreptitious Darshan.|$|E
