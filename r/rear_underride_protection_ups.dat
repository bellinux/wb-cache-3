40|$|A {{passenger}} car is severely damaged in car-to-truck underride accident which threatens the {{lives in the}} {{passenger car}} seriously. The objective {{of the study is}} to develop an energy-dissipating <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> <b>protection</b> device (RUPD) for diminishing the hazard imposed on the passenger car and the occupants. The new RUPD which has energy-dissipating structure is designed. It is modeled in virtual environment together with a moving barrier (MB) and a contrastive common RUPD. Finite element simulation is performed for comparative analysis on the performance of the two RUPDs in LS-DYNA. In the virtual test, the MB crashes into the two RUPDs respectively according to the national standard GB 11567. 2 - 2001. The conditions of 54 km/h crash speed and offset collision form are added to the virtual test for further test. The results show that under the national standard condition, the new RUPD dissipates 77 % of the total crash energy and the MB's acceleration peak in the test of the new RUPD is 22. 8 g, which is 40 % lower than that in the test of the common one. In the extension virtual tests, the new RUPD performs effectively in buffering, energy dissipating and underride protecting...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the lack of effective <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> guards attached to trucks, trailers and semi-trailers, <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> crashes are responsible for thousands of deaths every year throughout the world. In an attempt to reverse this situation, cooperative work was started between a Brazilian university and local car and truck industries, whose main goals were to design, construct and test reliable underride guards and to present solutions to government authorities. To meet these goals, to date two new retractile underride guards have been designed and three crash tests carried out. Based on the results obtained so far, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (ABNT) has elaborated a new Brazilian standard for <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> guards...|$|R
5000|$|Following the 1967 {{death of}} actress Jayne Mansfield in an auto/truck accident, the US {{government}} agency NHTSA recommended requiring a <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> guard, {{also known as}} a [...] "Mansfield bar", an [...] "ICC bar", or a [...] "DOT (Department of Transportation) bumper". They are required to be not more than 22 in from the road. The trucking industry has been slow to upgrade this safety feature, and there are no requirements to repair ICC bars damaged in service. However, in 1996 NHTSA upgraded the requirements for the <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> prevention structure on truck trailers, and Transport Canada went further with an even more stringent requirement for energy-absorbing <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> guards, and in July 2015 NHTSA issued a proposal to upgrade the US performance requirements for underride guards.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{results of}} a large research program intended to develop a draft <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> guard specification for heavy vehicles. Results {{of a series of}} laboratory and full-scale crash tests performed at the Transport Canada Research Center were used in the development of these specifications. A total of eleven full-scale crash tests was carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} different underride guards. The first ten of these tests were performed on a simulated trailer attached guard. Four different underride guard designs were used in these ten full-scale crash tests. Three different vehicle models traveling at 48, 56 and 65 km/h speeds were used to impact underride guards head on. Results of the first ten crash tests show that the currently used US FMVSS 223 standard is far from adequate in preventing the occurrance of <b>rear</b> <b>underride.</b> Based on findings obtained from these crash tests, an improved guard design was developed and tested using a 16 -meter trailer. This final crash test verified the effectiveness of improved guard design in reducing the undesirable effects of <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> crashes. Based on the results, a draft heavy vehicle <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> guard specification was developed...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> guards, truck tractor cabs may {{be equipped with}} a Front Underrun Protection System (FUPS) at the front bumper of the truck. The safest tractor-trailers are also equipped with side underride guards, also called Side Underrun Protection System (SUPS). These additional barriers prevent passenger cars from skidding underneath the trailer from the side, such as in an oblique or side collision, or if the trailer jackknifes across the road. In {{addition to}} safety benefits, these underride guards may improve fuel mileage by reducing air turbulence under the trailer at highway speeds.|$|R
50|$|Technically {{called a}} Rear Underrun Protection System (RUPS), {{this is a}} rigid {{assembly}} hanging down from the bottom rear of the trailer, which is intended to provide some protection for passenger cars which collide with {{the rear of the}} trailer. Public awareness of this safeguard was increased {{in the aftermath of the}} accident that killed actress Jayne Mansfield on 29 June 1967, when the car she was in hit the rear of a tractor-trailer, causing fatal head trauma. After her death, the NHTSA recommended requiring a <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> guard, also known as a Mansfield bar, an ICC bar, or a DOT bumper, but the trucking industry has been slow to upgrade this safety feature.|$|R
5000|$|An {{extremely}} dangerous situation occurs during [...] "underride collisions", {{in which a}} passenger vehicle collides with the rear of a tractor-trailer lacking a <b>rear</b> <b>underride</b> guard, or hits the side of such a trailer not equipped with a side underride guard. [...] The platform bed of a typical trailer is approximately at the head height of a seated adult occupant of a typical passenger car. This means that {{there may not be}} much between a head and the edge of the trailer platform, except a glass windshield. [...] In an underride collision, the car's crush zones designed to absorb collision energy are completely bypassed, and the airbags may not deploy in time because the car does not decelerate appreciably until the windshield and roof pillars have already impacted the trailer bed. [...] Even delayed inflation of airbags may be useless because of major intrusion into the passenger space, leaving occupants at high risk of major head trauma or decapitation in even low speed collisions. Western European standards for underride guards have been stricter than North American standards, which typically have allowed grandfathering of older equipment that may still be on the road for decades.|$|R
