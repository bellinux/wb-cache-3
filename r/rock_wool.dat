5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, <b>rock</b> <b>wool,</b> glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} tunnel water and frost tight, {{the walls were}} covered with {{polyethylene}} mats. Because they are highly flammable, they were then covered in a layer of gunite. Also installed were fire water pipes and ventilation systems to remove smoke. To sound-insulate the tunnel and avoid vibrations spreading to nearby housing, the entire tunnel was covered in a layer of <b>rock</b> <b>wool.</b> By December 2010, the ballast had been laid, and in January 2011 laying of the tracks and ties started. The work to build the tracks and overhead wires has been contracted to Baneservice. The contract for the electro-technical installations was awarded to YIT Building Systems for NOK120 million. As of 2006, the whole section from Lysaker to Sandvika was estimated to cost NOK2.7 billion.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>wool</b> (mineral wool) is {{the most}} widely used medium in hydroponics. <b>Rock</b> <b>wool</b> is an inert {{substrate}} suitable for both run-to-waste and recirculating systems. <b>Rock</b> <b>wool</b> is made from molten rock, basalt or 'slag' that is spun into bundles of single filament fibres, and bonded into a medium capable of capillary action, and is, in effect, protected from most common microbiological degradation. <b>Rock</b> <b>wool</b> has many advantages and some disadvantages. The latter being the possible skin irritancy (mechanical) whilst handling (1:1000). Flushing with cold water usually brings relief. Advantages include its proven efficiency and effectiveness as a commercial hydroponic substrate. Most of the <b>rock</b> <b>wool</b> sold to date is a non-hazardous, non-carcinogenic material, falling under Note Q of the European Union Classification Packaging and Labeling Regulation (CLP).|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} high sound {{absorption}} efficiency, <b>rock</b> and glass <b>wools</b> are largely used as sound absorber materials and {{particularly for the}} design of sound barrier panels. However, their fabrication is highly energy-consuming. Indeed, rock and glass used in the wool fabrication process required high temperatures (i. e. above 1, 000 oC), which are much higher than any polymer processing temperatures. In addition, centrifuges and burners, two energy-consuming equipments, are also required for fiber forming process [1]. Besides, the process is not over yet as wool has no mechanical strength. Accordingly, a thermoset resin, such as phenolic resin, is sprayed over fibers where it polymerizes and cross-links. Generally, the amount of resin used varies between 1 to 5 % and 4 to 14 % for <b>rock</b> and glass <b>wools</b> respectively [2]. It is important to highlight that cross-linking process is irreversible. Thus, if environmental concerns and sustainable development policies must be taking into account, the use of <b>rock</b> or glass <b>wool</b> as sound absorbent materials may be no longer adequate. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate on environmentally-friendly alternatives for <b>rock</b> and glass <b>wools</b> in sound barrier walls applications. To achieve this goal, various recycled fibers-based materials were characterized and compared to evaluate their sound absorption potential. Eventually, best materials will be incorporated in an experimental on-scale sound barrier wall and tested...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{conservation}} movement has promoted both {{greater use of}} insulating materials and the reduction of heat losses by sealing air leaks. The release of volatile or airborne materials from the installation of these building materials under these conditions has resulted in an exacerbated indoor air pollution {{with the potential for}} certain health and safety hazards. Consequently, a comparative review of the health and safety hazards, exposure standards, and regulatory action associated with the more commonly used insulating materials with particular respect to current {{energy conservation}} measures was undertaken. The materials reviewed included asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam, polyvinyl chloride, cellulosic insulations, fibrous glass, mineral wool, and vermiculite. Although no longer used, the past installation of asbestos in a friable form is the greatest potential health hazard. The exposure to formaldehyde gas from its release from urea-formaldehyde foam has elicited subjective complaints of sensory irritation and unresolved controversy and regulatory action regarding its toxicity to humans.

Parameters measured included number of fibres, diameter and length distribution of fibres retained in lung ash and leaching of various elements from fibres. The results of the half-time of fibre clearance of the fibre fraction longer than 5 mym has been most important. For a special type of glass microfibre and for ceramic wool, which both had a low alkaline earth content, the half-times of lung clearance were at a level similar to that of crocidolite. For another type of glass microfibre with a high alkaline earth content and a median diameter of about 0. 1 mym. a very low half-time was detected. The glass and <b>rock</b> <b>wools</b> studied, which were thicker than the other fibres, had a medium half-time.

40|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} synthetic vitreous fibers (SVFs) oil a mesothelial (MeT 5 A) and a fibroblast cell line (NIH 3 T 3), compared to those exerted by crocidolite asbestos fibers. SVFs (glass <b>wool,</b> <b>rock</b> <b>wools)</b> do not induce significant changes in cell mortality. whereas crocidolite asbestos fibers caused a close-dependent cytotoxicity. We investigated {{the correlation between the}} fiber-induced cytotoxicity and the extent and type of interaction of the fibers with the cell surface. and we observed that SVFs, unlike crocidolite asbestos fibers. establish few and weak interactions. Moreover. after internalization, crocidolite asbestos fibers are often found free in the cytoplasm. whereas glass wool fibers are mainly localized inside cytoplasmic vacuoles. After treatments. we also detected signs of oxidative stress. revealed by an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and by ail induction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The lipoperoxidative damage was characterized by a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), ail increase in the content of thiobarbituric reactive species (TBARS) and a consumption of vitamin E, as a lipophilic antioxidant. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of fiber exposure oil cell proliferation. and it was found that. unlike crocidolite asbestos fibers, SVFs did not induce a significant increase in DNA synthesis.

40|$|Building {{insulation}} {{is commonly}} realized using materials obtained from petrochemicals (mainly polystyrene) or from natural sources processed with high energy consumptions (glass and <b>rock</b> <b>wools).</b> These materials cause significant detrimental {{effects on the}} environment mainly due to the production stage, i. e. use of nonrenewable materials and fossil energy consumption, and to the disposal stage, i. e. problems in reusing or recycling the products {{at the end of their}} lives. The introduction of the concept of “sustainability” in building design process encouraged researches aimed at developing thermal and acoustic insulating materials using natural or recycled materials. Some of them, such as kenaf or wood fiber, are already commercialized but their diffusion could be further improved since their performance is similar to the synthetic ones.

Interspecies comparisons of the toxicity of asbestos and synthetic vitreous fibers: a weight-of-the-evidence approach. Regul. Toxicol.

However, their arguments are highly questionable. The explanations of the IARC working group for preferring the newer inhalation studies are not sufficiently supported by the published data. Having in mind the higher sensitivity of humans compared to rats after inhalation of asbestos, more emphasis should have been given to the carcinogenic response after intraperitoneal injection...|$|R

The aim of this work is to evaluate the exposure of installers of ceiling panels to glass fibers and to study the size distribution of airborne fibers during working day. Thirty two personal samplings were carried out during the installation of pressed mineral wool panels employed as false ceilings. The fibers collected on the filter were analyzed and measured by scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Four workers were investigated for eight working days. The mean exposure value was around 0. 006 fiber/cm 3 with a maximum value of 0. 036 fiber/cm 3. The worker exposure evaluated by EN 689 was always below the threshold limit value set by American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (1 fiber/cm 3). The experimental data were analyzed to calculate some statistical parameters and to verify the normality plots of fiber-length and fiber-diameter measurements using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The geometric mean diameter and length of airborne fibers were 1. 2 μm and 22. 8 μm, respectively.
