50|$|The {{shopping}} centre was originally constructed as Brand Depot, a factory outlet mall in 2006 {{at a cost}} of $12.5 million. Brand Depot was intended to be constructed in three stages, eventually housing up to 120 retail stores. Due to the building's proximity to Canberra Airport's main runway, the use of construction cranes was restricted. The challenge was overcome with an mobile <b>roll</b> <b>former</b> developed by Bluescope Lysaght. The company manufactured 82.7 m long interlocking steel roofing segments onsite which were slid directly into position from the semi trailer mounted roller, eliminating the need for an overhead crane. Faced with increasing competition from a new Direct Factory Outlets centre at Fyshwick which opened in 2008. Legal challenges by the management of Brand Depot under the Trade Practices Act and concerns about zoning of the DFO site, echoing the 2004 Orange Grove affair failed to stop the development from proceeding. By February 2011, one-third of its 75 stores were vacant and the centre was struggling to attract new tenants. By March, Brand Depot closed following the loss of four more tenant stores.|$|E
5000|$|... "It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)" [...] was edited {{down from}} an {{extended}} jam by producer George Young (older brother of guitarist Malcolm Young and Angus) and {{the inclusion of}} the bagpipes was his idea to add an extra dynamic to the track. Singer Bon Scott had played in a pipe band in his teens, so George suggested he play bagpipes on the song, not realizing that Scott had been a drummer, not a piper. Regardless, Scott - who knew how to play the recorder learned the instrument and went on to play them on stage with the band for several years. In Murray Engleheart's book AC/DC: Maximum Rock & <b>Roll,</b> <b>former</b> manager Michael Browning states that the bagpipes became the bane of Scott's existence: [...] "I think they probably put more pressure on him than anything I can think of! They invariably never worked. It's a hard instrument to time to guitars, because you're pumping them and they kind of kick in when the bag's full very difficult to time to guitars." [...] The chanting in [...] "T.N.T." [...] was also George Young's idea, added after he heard Angus ad-libbing the [...] "oi" [...] chant to himself, and suggested he record it.|$|E

They used to have a sort of tit-for-tat thing going, but nothing that I would have ever thought was going to be gig-threatening." [...] According to Browning, the Young brothers were seriously considering Colin Pattenden of Manfred Mann fame until Browning, who feared Pattenden was too old and did not fit their image, pushed Englishman Cliff Williams, who had played with Home and Bandit. Williams, who could also sing background vocals, passed the audition and would go on to record on Powerage, although Evans insists that the album also has bass by him, as the Powerage songs started being done during the recording of his last album Let There Be Rock, and producer George Young while Williams was having trouble getting his work visa.

40|$|The {{variations}} of #nal mat thickness #basis weight# {{in the machine}} direction #MD# and cross machine direction #CD# on a crescent former are examined using a two-dimensional dynamic model. This two-dimensional model is extended from a previous one-dimensional model by including viscosity and a cross #ow in the CD. The #uid velocity pro#les are parabolic in the MD and CD with no-slip conditions on the #ber mat and {{the surface of the}} <b>roll</b> <b>former.</b> In addition, a periodic boundary condition in the CD is applied. This study examines the CD variations due to the in#uences of major classes of steady disturbances, and the coupled MD and CD variations due to dynamic process disturbances in the #uid jet. Among the steady disturbances, the nonuniform #uid velocity in the CD generated at the entrance of a forming region signi#cantly ampli#es the CD variations in the #nal mat thickness. Unsteady disturbances lead to coupled MD and CD variations that are magni#ed near the fundamental natural frequency of a translating wire, and particularly so for disturbances with long wavelengths. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} roll formed {{products}} {{is known to}} be highly sensitive and dependent on the process parameters and thus the unavoidable variations of these parameters during mass production. To maintain a constant high product quality, a new <b>roll</b> <b>former</b> with an adjustable final roll forming stand is developed at Deakin University enabling the continuous compensation for possible shape defects. In this work, a numerical approach to robust in-line control of the roll forming of a V-section profile is presented, combining the aspects of robust process design and in-line compensation methods. A numerical study is performed to determine the relationship between controllable process settings and uncontrollable variation of incoming material properties with respect to the common product defects longitudinal bow and springback. The computationally expensive non-linear FE simulations used in this study are subsequently replaced by metamod-els based on efficient Single Response Surfaces. Using these metamodels, the optimal setting for the adjustable stand is determined with robust optimization techniques and the effect on product quality analyzed. It is shown that the subsequent adjustment of the final roll stand position leads to a significantly improved product quality by preventing product defects and minimizing the deteriorating effects of scattering variables...|$|E
40|$|The flow behaviour, and {{primarily}} the floc-floc interaction, of pulp paper suspensions {{have been studied}} visually. Analogy models based on these observations have been developed {{as well as the}} identification of important parameters of floc break-up in low shear rate flow fields. Floc compressions and the locations of voids (areas of lower fibre concentration) where found to influence the floc splitting mechanism. Based on this investigation an equipment for measuring the load carrying ability of fibre flocs and networks was designed, and the effect of measurement geometry, network structure and fibre suspension concentration was investigated. The load carrying ability with concentration increases rapidly when going from 1 % to 2 % in initial suspension concentration. A model handling the fibre floc behaviour during extension and compression has been developed, and some basic flocculated flow mechanisms are discussed on an analogy basis. A modified Voigt element is use, describing mainly the compressional behaviour and plastic behaviour of loose fibre network structures. Further the pos- sibility of stress chain formation is discussed on a fibre level as well as on a floc level. The effect of fibre flow (shear field) occurring in the forming zone of a <b>roll</b> <b>former</b> has been studied in detail. Basic forming mechanisms on floc scale has been investi- gated, and the effect of running parameters like dewatering pressure and jet-to-wire speed difference as well as the fibre type and concentration of the pulp suspension has been evaluated. It is evident that floc elongation increases with shear rate (jet-to-wire speed difference) and lower dewatering rate. The latter is because the fibre floc is subjected to the shear field longer due to slower immobilisation. Shorter fibre tends to create weaker networks, which promotes a higher elongation of the flocs. QC 2010090...|$|E
5000|$|Benjamin Obdyke Incorporated {{was started}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1868 by Benjamin P. Obdyke after he {{returned}} from serving the Union Army in the American Civil War. [...] Obdyke invented and patented the round corrugated downspout, beginning {{a long tradition of}} manufacturing innovative quality building products. The company and product line grew over the years to include a variety of rain carrying equipment, roof edging and trims. The manufacturing process included <b>roll</b> <b>formers</b> and various stamping dies. The products were manufactured from Galvanized steel, copper and later aluminum (both pre painted and mill finish). By 1997 the company was operating 26 <b>roll</b> <b>formers</b> in a 200,000 sq. ft. manufacturing and distribution facility located in Warminster, Pennsylvania. In 1988 BOI acquired the patent for a rolled ridge vent, which began a new era of innovative products such as Roll Vent, Rapid Ridge, Cedar Breather, and eventually Home Slicker. In the late nineties the company was approached by another old line gutter manufacturer, Berger Brothers located in Feasterville, Pennsylvania with interest to acquire the metal manufacturing portion of the business. Based on the growth of the newer innovative products, the company decided to sell the metal business to Berger and did so in December 1997. Today, the company actively markets its ridge ventilation and moisture management products under the Benjamin Obdyke brand to professional contractors all over North America through their diverse network of wholesale distributors.|$|R

40|$|The {{maintenance}} department at Electrolux cooking plant, Dudley Park, Adelaide, Australia has {{over the past}} thirty years evolved into a reactive rather than proactive department with respect to equipment reliability. Therefore ABB was engaged in a benchmarking study where 13 different areas were found in need for improvement. Implementation of Overall Equipment Effectiveness was found as one important area to change and is the scope for this Masters Thesis. Overall Equipment Effectiveness, OEE, is a key performance index for machine utilisation and takes into consideration three different factors: Availability, Performance, and Quality. There is also focus on removing the Six Big Losses in order to improve the OEE-numbers. As a method and help in finding the losses and remove those permanently Root Cause Failure Analysis have been used and a causal tree over the biggest problem area has been created. The area chosen as a pilot area where to try out OEE was the Side Panel Machine, SPM, which produces side panels for upright cookers which is {{regarded as one of the}} biggest future bottleneck. The biggest problem area with the SPM was the second station, Notch and Pierce and panels not leaving to the <b>roll</b> <b>former</b> station. OEE was implemented with cross functional meetings and meeting attendants from all departments involved in the Side Panel Machine: tooling, production, maintenance, and engineering. As a result from the meetings the machine was rebuilt and improved during the Christmas break. The OEE team also put in big efforts to try and mount a camera to record breakdowns at the Side Panel Machine. The collection of production data was improved with a new OEE- sheet for the operator to fill in time losses and a new scrap audit sheet to fill in quality losses. The recommendations for Electrolux are to continue working with OEE. To do this they need to find a new driving force, educate OEE teams about OEE and RCFA and focus on the collection of accurate production data. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
