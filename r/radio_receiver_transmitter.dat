50|$|A clock {{generator}} is an oscillator {{that provides a}} timing signal to synchronize operations in digital circuits. VCXO {{clock generator}}s are used in many areas such as digital TV, modems, transmitters and computers. Design parameters for a VCXO clock generator are tuning voltage range, center frequency, frequency tuning range and the timing jitter of the output signal. Jitter {{is a form of}} phase noise that must be minimised in applications such as <b>radio</b> <b>receivers,</b> <b>transmitters</b> and measuring equipment.|$|R
25|$|The modem would {{generate}} audio tones between 1200 and 2300Hz from picture signals, and picture signals from received audio tones. The audio would {{be attached to}} a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> and <b>transmitter.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{some early}} radios used {{some type of}} {{amplification}} through electric current or battery, through the mid-1920s {{the most common type}} of receiver was the crystal set. In the 1920s, amplifying vacuum tubes revolutionized both <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> and <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{variable}} frequency oscillator (VFO) in electronics is an oscillator whose frequency can be tuned (i.e., varied) over some range. It {{is a necessary}} component in any tunable <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> or <b>transmitter</b> that works by the superheterodyne principle, and controls the frequency to which the apparatus is tuned.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of repeaters; a telephone repeater is an amplifier in a telephone line, an optical repeater is an optoelectronic circuit that amplifies the light beam in an optical fiber cable; and a radio repeater is a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> and <b>transmitter</b> that retransmits a radio signal.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> and <b>transmitters</b> usually {{use some}} form of digital {{frequency}} synthesis to generate their VFO signal.The advantages including smaller designs, lack of moving parts, and {{the ease with which}} preset frequencies can be stored and manipulated in the digital computer that is usually embedded in the design for other purposes.|$|R

5000|$|Having {{assembled}} a crystal <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> and <b>transmitter,</b> he once transmitted his mother Gunnild playing Schumann on her grand piano. Rischel's transmission accidentally interfered {{with a national}} Radio Denmark (Statsradiofonien) broadcast. His biographers suggest that {{this may have been}} [...] "an early manifestation of what later became a serious research activity, namely the construction of the analog parallel synthesizer at the Institute of Phonetics in the late sixties." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{less common}} {{definition}} is <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> and <b>transmitter</b> implementations {{that are based}} on digital signal processing, but may transmit or receive analog radio transmission standards, for example FM radio. This may reduce noise and distortion induced in the electronics. It also allows software radio implementations, where the transmission technology is changed just by selecting another piece of software. In most cases, this would however increase the energy consumption of the receiver equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The AN/ARC-5 Command Radio Set is {{a series}} of <b>radio</b> <b>receivers,</b> <b>transmitters,</b> and {{accessories}} carried aboard U.S. Navy aircraft during World War II and for some years afterward. It is described as [...] "a complete multi-channel radio transmitting and receiving set providing communication and navigation facilities for aircraft. The LF-MF-HF components are designed to transmit and receive voice, tone-modulated, and continuous wave (cw) signals." [...] Its flexible design provided AM radiotelephone voice communication and MCW and CW Morse code modes, all of which are typical capabilities in other Navy aircraft communication sets of the period. It was an improvement of the Navy's ARA/ATA command set. Similar units designated SCR-274-N were used in U.S. Army aircraft. The Army set is based on the ARA/ATA, not the later AN/ARC-5. The ARA/ATA and SCR-274-N series are informally referred to as [...] "ARC-5", despite small differences that render all three series incompatible. Like the AN/ARC-5, the ARA/ATA and SCR-274-N had AM voice communication and two-way MCW and CW Morse code capability.|$|R

50|$|Diplexers are {{typically}} used with <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> or <b>transmitters</b> on different, widely separated, frequency bands. A single city radio tower {{might have a}} police department antenna on 460 MHz and a fire department antenna on 156 MHz. A diplexer at the top combines the two antenna signals to the single coaxial feedline, and a second identical diplexer inside the building separates the feedline signals to the two dispatch radios. Some diplexers support {{as many as four}} antennas or radios that work on different radio bands.|$|R
5|$|The AM-1Q was {{developed}} for electronic countermeasures (ECM) duties. The fuselage fuel tank was removed {{to make room for}} the ECM operator and his equipment in a windowless compartment. The aircraft carried several <b>radio</b> and radar <b>receivers,</b> <b>transmitters</b> and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of chaff through a chute to block radar signals.|$|R
50|$|On {{half-duplex}} channels the <b>radio</b> station: <b>receiver,</b> <b>transmitter,</b> and antenna or antennas {{are usually}} interconnected by so-called transmit/receive or (T/R) switches that effectively connect and disconnect the <b>receiver</b> and <b>transmitter</b> from the antenna or antennas {{as required by}} the radiotelegraph channel protocol in use. T/R switches may be controlled by a variety of techniques. Typical T/R switch control methods and protocols are: manual operation, automatic semi break-in operation and automatic full break-in operation. T/R switches are analog high power radio frequency or RF switch devices which may take many practical forms ranging all the way from simple mechanical manually operated knife switches to fully automated modern semiconductor devices.|$|R
50|$|A D battery (D cell or IEC R20) is a size of dry cell. A D cell is {{cylindrical}} with {{an electrical}} contact at each end; the positive end has a nub or bump. D cells are typically used in high current drain applications, {{such as in}} large flashlights, <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> and <b>transmitters,</b> boomboxes, products with electric motors, safety systems, Geiger counters, megaphones, or other applications that require an extended running time. A D cell may be either rechargeable or non-rechargeable. Its terminal voltage and capacity depend upon its cell chemistry.|$|R
50|$|Noise, distortion, {{spurious}} signals, and {{phase noise}} all degrade EVM, and therefore EVM provides a comprehensive {{measure of the}} quality of the <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> or <b>transmitter</b> for use in digital communications. Transmitter EVM can be measured by specialized equipment, which demodulates the received signal in a similar way to how a real radio demodulator does it. One of the stages in a typical phase-shift keying demodulation process produces a stream of I-Q points which can be used as a reasonably reliable estimate for the ideal transmitted signal in EVM calculation.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of <b>radio</b> <b>receivers,</b> <b>transmitters,</b> and components operating at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths utilize rectangular waveguides in some form. However, conventional machining techniques for waveguides operating above {{a few hundred}} GHz are complicated and costly. This paper reports {{on the development of}} silicon micromachining techniques to create silicon-based waveguide circuits which can operate at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. As a first step, rectangular WR- 10 waveguide structures have been fabricated from (110) silicon wafers using micromachining techniques. The waveguide is split along the broad wall. Each half is formed by first etching a channel completely through a wafer. Potassium hydroxide is used to etch smooth mirror-like vertical walls and LPCVD silicon nitride is used as a masking layer. This wafer is then bonded to another flat wafer using a polyimide bonding technique and diced into the U-shaped half wavelengths. Finally, a gold layer is applied to the waveguide walls. Insertion loss measurements show losses comparable to those of standard metal waveguides. It is suggested that active devices and planar circuits can be integrated with the waveguides, solving the traditional mounting problems. Potential applications in terahertz instrumentation technology are further discussed...|$|R

Laboratory efforts centered on aircraft communication systems, high-frequency and microwave radar systems, radar altimeter systems, identification, friend or foe (IFF) systems, and long-range navigation (LORAN) systems. In {{addition to the}} regular curriculum, there were special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight and the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), both highly classified at that time, and the Navy's first drone aircraft, the Target Drone Denny 1 (TDD-1).|$|R
5000|$|During the mid-1920s, amplifying {{vacuum tubes}} (or {{thermionic}} valves in the UK) revolutionized <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> and <b>transmitters.</b> John Ambrose Fleming developed a vacuum tube diode.

5000|$|The 74A4 and KWS-1 are {{an amateur}} <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> and <b>transmitter</b> pair {{made by the}} Collins Radio Company of Cedar Rapids, Iowa that were {{introduced}} in 1955. They were designed to operate using the then new single-sideband (SSB) voice modulation as well as CW and AM modes. They were influential in popularizing SSB. The KWS-1 transmitter along with the 75A-4 receiver, together, cost over $2500 when new (equivalent to over $20,000 in 2012 dollars). Collins products {{at the time were}} considered 'top of the line'. Ham radio enthusiasts nicknamed the pair [...] "The Gold Dust Twins," [...] as they were unaffordable to most amateur radio enthusiasts when first introduced.|$|R
5000|$|In radio terminology, a {{transceiver}} means a unit {{which contains}} both a <b>receiver</b> and a <b>transmitter.</b> From the beginning daysof <b>radio</b> the <b>receiver</b> and <b>transmitter</b> were separate units and remained so until around 1920. Amateur radio or [...] "ham" [...] radio operators can {{build their own}} equipment {{and it is now}} easier to design and build a simple unit containing both of the functions: transmitting and receiving. Almost all modern amateur radio equipment is now a transceiver but there is an active market for pure <b>radio</b> <b>receivers,</b> mainly for shortwave listening (SWL) operators. An example of a transceiver would be a walkie-talkie or a CB radio.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – voltage {{converter}} {{is a risky}} factor that to be operate in the very low power. That to operating it in the very low power is a tedious process.

40|$|International audienceA general {{overview}} of <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> and <b>transmitters</b> is presented. Introducing {{the principle of}} frequency translation, classical heterodyne and homodyne RX and TX architectures for analog telecommunications are discussed. Digital telecommunications are addressed and, with them, modern polyphased transceiver architectures and the insertion of an ADC within the receiver chain. First the ADC is considered at the baseband level, then at higher frequency stages, {{and up to the}} antenna yielding to the ultimate Software Defined Radio (SDR) principle. At each location of the ADC within the receiver chain, the converter characteristics are reviewed, leading to the choice of a possible architecture. Nonidealities are discussed in order to highlight problems that researchers will have to address in the future to fulfill the SDR concept...|$|R
50|$|On 27 August 1920, regular {{wireless}} broadcasts {{for entertainment}} began in Argentina, pioneered {{by the group}} around Enrique Telémaco Susini, and spark gap telegraphy stopped. On 31 August 1920 the first known radio news program was broadcast by station 8MK, the unlicensed predecessor of WWJ (AM) in Detroit, Michigan. In 1922 regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the UK from the Marconi Research Centre 2MT at Writtle near Chelmsford, England. Early radios ran the entire power of the transmitter through a carbon microphone. In the 1920s, the Westinghouse company bought Lee de Forest's and Edwin Armstrong's patent. During the mid-1920s, Amplifying vacuum tubes (US)/thermionic valves (UK) revolutionized <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> and <b>transmitters.</b> Westinghouse engineers developed a more modern vacuum tube.|$|R
50|$|Antennas are {{required}} by any <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> or <b>transmitter</b> to couple its electrical connection to the electromagnetic field. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves which carry signals through the air (or through space) {{at the speed of}} light with almost no transmission loss. <b>Radio</b> <b>transmitters</b> and <b>receivers</b> are used to convey signals (information) in systems including broadcast (audio) radio, television, mobile telephones, Wi-Fi (WLAN) data networks, trunk lines and point-to-point communications links (telephone, data networks), satellite links, many remote controlled devices such as garage door openers, and wireless remote sensors, among many others. Radio waves are also used directly for measurements in technologies including radar, GPS, and radio astronomy. In each and every case, the <b>transmitters</b> and <b>receivers</b> involved require antennas, although these are sometimes hidden (such as the antenna inside an AM radio or inside a laptop computer equipped with Wi-Fi).|$|R
40|$|A Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> and/or <b>transmitter,</b> whose {{characteristics}} can to a {{large extent}} be defined by software. Thus, an SDR can receive and/or transmit a wide variety of signals, supporting many different standards. In our research, we currently focus on a combined receiver for Bluetooth and HiperLAN/ 2 to help us identify problems associated with SDR. These two standards differ significantly in characteristics like frequency band, signal bandwidth and modulation type. Combining two different standards in one receiver appears to pose new design challenges. For example, in the wide frequency range that we want to receive, many strong signals may exist. This leads to severe linearity requirements. This paper describes some receiver architectures. One design has been selected. This receiver has been built, and some measurement results are included...|$|R
5000|$|The {{need to be}} able to {{identify}} aircraft more easily and reliably led to another wartime radar development, the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, which had been created as a means of positively identifying friendly aircraft from enemy. This system, which became known in civil use as secondary surveillance radar (SSR), or in the USA as the air traffic control radar beacon system (ATCRBS), relies on a piece of equipment aboard the aircraft known as a [...] "transponder." [...] The transponder is a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> and <b>transmitter</b> pair which receives on 1030 MHz and transmits on 1090 MHz. The target aircraft transponder replies to signals from an interrogator (usually, but not necessarily, a ground station co-located with a primary radar) by transmitting a coded reply signal containing the requested information.|$|R
5000|$|Large circuit {{temperature}} {{swings in}} on/off cycles. Massive stray heat from cathode heaters in common low power tubes means that adjoining circuits experience changes in temperature that can exceed 100 °C / 200 °F. This requires heat resistant components. In RF applications this {{also means that}} all frequency-determining components may have to heat to thermal equilibrium before frequency stability is reached. While at AM broadcast (medium wave) receivers and in loosely tuned TV sets {{this was not a}} problem, in typical <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> and <b>transmitters</b> with free-running oscillators at HF frequencies this thermal stabilization required about one hour. On the other hand, miniature ultra-low power direct-heated valves do not produce much heat in absolute terms, cause more modest temperature swings, and allow equipment that contains few of them to stabilize sooner.|$|R
