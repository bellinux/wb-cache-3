Insurance investigators later determined that the fire was caused by an electrical short in a power cord. Though the house was <b>reparable</b> and the couple's home insurance paid out on the damage and lost property, the couple decided to move on, and Green and the children moved into the apartment in which Farrar had been living during the separation while {{the purchase of the}} Prairie Village home was re-negotiated.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree to}} which a tendon is <b>reparable</b> depends on its {{quantity}} and quality. Degenerated tendons are often frail and retracted and may not be amenable to repair. Individuals that are elderly, smokers, or those having had cortisone injections often have weaker tendon tissue that fails without a significant injury. By contrast those whose tendon was torn by a substantial fall often have good quality tendon that can be repaired if surgery is performed promptly after the injury.|$|E
25|$|By about 4 p.m., {{all three}} Ottoman ships {{of the line}} and most of the large frigates of the first line had been despatched. This left the mass of smaller vessels {{in the second and third}} lines at the mercy of the Allied ships of the line, all of which were still operational. During the ensuing massacre, Codrington tried twice to order a ceasefire, but his signals were either {{invisible}} because of the thick smoke or ignored in the heat of the battle. Within the following two hours, virtually the entire Ottoman fleet was destroyed, despite the signal bravery of the Ottoman crews, which was praised by Codrington himself in his dispatches. Three quarters were sunk: many of them, dismasted but still afloat and <b>reparable,</b> were blown up or set on fire by their own crews to prevent them falling into Allied hands.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Marine Corps deploys Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTFs) by airlift or sealift to {{participate}} in numerous short-term exercises. These exercises are of such duration that resupply of the MAGTF by strategic airlift or sealift is not practical. Thus, only stocked spare parts are available for repairs during the exercise. A model is developed which provides the operational commander with a stockage policy for spare secondary <b>reparables</b> (e. g., tank engines, amtrack transmissions, etc.) that optimizes the probability of successful mission completion subject to weight or volume constraints imposed by the MAGTF's mode of deployment. Optimization of this stockage policy is stochastically modeled {{using data from the}} Marine Corps Integrated Maintenance Management System data base and then solved as an integer computer program. The integer program is coded using the Generalized Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) language and solved using the Zero/One Optimization Methods mixed integer program solver. Operational data for a Marine Amphibious Unit yields an integer program with 190 binary variables and 26 constraints.

60|$|We must resume our {{narrative}} at {{the period}} when Mary Avenel was conveyed to the apartment which had been formerly occupied by the two Glendinnings, and when her faithful attendant, Tibbie, had exhausted herself in useless attempts to compose and to comfort her. Father Eustace also dealt forth with well-meant kindness those apophthegms and dogmata of consolation, which friendship almost always offers to grief, though they are uniformly offered in vain. She was at length left to indulge in the desolation of her own sorrowful feelings. She felt as those who, loving for the first time, have lost what they loved, before time and repeated calamity have taught them that every loss is {{to a certain extent}} <b>reparable</b> or endurable.|$|E
60|$|Not {{that he ever}} wavered {{either in}} his desire or his {{determination}} to repair a wrong {{that had been done}} in his father's time, should a wrong come to light, and be <b>reparable.</b> The shadow of a supposed act of injustice, which had hung over him since his father's death, was so vague and formless that it might be the result of a reality widely remote from his idea of it. But, if his apprehensions should prove to be well founded, he was ready at any moment to lay down all he had, and begin the world anew. As the fierce dark teaching of his childhood had never sunk into his heart, so that first article in his code of morals was, that he must begin, in practical humility, with looking well to his feet on Earth, and that he could never mount on wings of words to Heaven. Duty on earth, restitution on earth, action on earth; these first, as the first steep steps upward. Strait was the gate and narrow was the way; far straiter and narrower than the broad high road paved with vain professions and vain repetitions, motes from other men's eyes and liberal delivery of others to the judgment--all cheap materials costing absolutely nothing.|$|E
60|$|It is {{difficult}} to say whether indifference and neglect are worse than false doctrine; but Heartbreak House and Horseback Hall unfortunately suffered from both. For half a century before the war civilization had been going to the devil very precipitately under the influence of a pseudo-science as disastrous as the blackest Calvinism. Calvinism taught that as we are predestinately saved or damned, nothing that we can do can alter our destiny. Still, as Calvinism gave the individual no clue as to whether he had drawn a lucky number or an unlucky one, it left him a fairly strong interest in encouraging his hopes of salvation and allaying his fear of damnation by behaving as one of the elect might be expected to behave rather than as one of the reprobate. But {{in the middle of the}} nineteenth century naturalists and physicists assured the world, in the name of Science, that salvation and damnation are all nonsense, and that predestination is the central truth of religion, inasmuch as human beings are produced by their environment, their sins and good deeds being only a series of chemical and mechanical reactions over which they have no control. Such figments as mind, choice, purpose, conscience, will, and so forth, are, they taught, mere illusions, produced because they are useful in the continual struggle of the human machine to maintain its environment in a favorable condition, a process incidentally involving the ruthless destruction or subjection of its competitors for the supply (assumed to be limited) of subsistence available. We taught Prussia this religion; and Prussia bettered our instruction so effectively that we presently found ourselves confronted with the necessity of destroying Prussia to prevent Prussia destroying us. And that has just ended in each destroying the other to an extent doubtfully <b>reparable</b> in our time.|$|E
60|$|In {{my journey}} with them through life, I met Mr. Fox in my road; and I {{travelled}} with him very cheerfully, {{as long as}} he appeared to me to pursue the same direction with those in whose company I set out. In the latter stage of our progress a new scheme of liberty and equality was produced in the world, which either dazzled his imagination, or was suited to some new walks of ambition which were then opened to his view. The whole frame and fashion of his politics appear to have suffered about that time a very material alteration. It is about three years since, in consequence of that extraordinary change, that, after a pretty long preceding period of distance, coolness, and want of confidence, if not total alienation on his part, a complete public separation has been made between that gentleman and me. Until lately the breach between us appeared <b>reparable.</b> I trusted that time and reflection, and a decisive experience of the mischiefs which have flowed from the proceedings and the system of France, on which our difference had arisen, as well as the known sentiments of the best and wisest of our common friends upon that subject, would have brought him to a safer way of thinking. Several of his friends saw no security for keeping things in a proper train after this excursion of his, but in the reunion of the party on its old grounds, under the Duke of Portland. Mr. Fox, if he pleased, might have been comprehended in that system, with the rank and consideration to which his great talents entitle him, and indeed must secure to him in any party arrangement that could be made. The Duke of Portland knows how much I wished for, and how earnestly I labored that reunion, and upon terms that might every way be honorable and advantageous to Mr. Fox. His conduct in the last session has extinguished these hopes forever.|$|E
6000|$|As once before, Sewell tacitly took a hint {{from his}} own experience, and {{enlarging}} to more serious facts from it, preached effort in the erring. He denounced mere remorse. Better not feel that at all, he taught; and he declared that what is ordinarily distinguished from remorse as repentance, was equally a mere corrosion of the spirit unless some attempt at reparation went with it. He maintained that though some mischiefs--perhaps most mischiefs--were irreparable so far as restoring the original status was concerned, yet every mischief was <b>reparable</b> in the good-will and the good deed of its perpetrator. Do what you could to retrieve yourself from error, and then, not leave the rest to Providence, but keep doing. The good, however small, must grow if tended and nurtured like a useful plant, as the evil would certainly grow, like a wild and poisonous weed, if left to itself. Sin, he said, was a terrible mystery; one scarcely knew {{how to deal with}} it or to attempt to determine its nature; but perhaps--he threw out the thought while warning those who heard him of its danger in some aspects--sin was not wholly an evil. We were so apt in this world of struggle and ambition to become centred solely in ourselves, that possibly the wrong done to another,--the wrong that turned our thoughts from ourselves, and kept them bent in agony and despair upon the suffering we had caused another, and knew not how to mitigate--possibly this wrong, nay, certainly this wrong, was good in disguise. But, returning to his original point, we were to beware how we rested in this despair. In the very extremity of our anguish, our fear, our shame, we were to gird ourselves up to reparation. Strive to do good, he preached; strive most of all to do good to those you have done harm to. His text was [...] "Cease to do evil." ...|$|E
