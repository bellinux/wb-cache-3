60|$|I vindicate {{the rights}} and dignity of Nature; {{and as long as}} I condemn nothing without {{assigning}} reasons not lightly given, I cannot suffer any individual, however highly and deservedly honoured by my countrymen, to stand in my way. If my notions are right, the epitaphs of Pope cannot well be too severely condemned; for not only are they almost wholly destitute of those universal feelings and simple movements of mind which we have called for as indispensible, but they are little better than a tissue of false thoughts, languid and vague expressions, unmeaning antithesis, and laborious attempts at discrimination. Pope's mind had been employed chiefly in observation upon the vices and follies of men. Now, vice and folly are in contradiction with the moral principle which can never be extinguished in the mind; and therefore, wanting the contrast, are irregular, capricious, and inconsistent with themselves. If a man has once said (see Friend, No......), 'Evil, be thou my good!' and has acted accordingly, however strenuous may have been his adherence to this principle, it will be well known by those who have had an opportunity of observing him narrowly that there have been perpetual obliquities in his course; evil passions thwarting each other in various ways; and now and then, revivals of his better nature, which check him for a short time or lead him to <b>remeasure</b> his steps:--not to speak of the various necessities of counterfeiting virtue, which the furtherance of his schemes will impose upon him, and the division which will be consequently introduced into his nature.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Using aMarx-oscillator standing-wave resonancemethod, we measuredthe {{internal}} friction & ' of sintered titanium containing up to 26 volume-percent voids (c). The surprising &I-versus-c curve shape, an exponential increase, {{lead us to}} <b>remeasure</b> &I-versus-c by acoustic-resonance spectroscopy, which gave similar results. We hypothesized that both void shape and void size change with c. For the void shape, we confirmed this hypothesis by measuring longitundinal and transverse sound velocities vl and v, and comparing them with Mori-Tanaka model predictions. As c increases from 0 to 0. 26, effective void shape changes from near spherical to oblate spheroidal with an aspect ratio near 0. 05. Optical microscopy confirmed the void-size change. We outline a model based on wave-scattering theory that explains the observed &'-c behavior. Increased particle size with increased c provides the dominant factor for the exponential increase.
