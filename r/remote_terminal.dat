5|$|Internally, the Green Line {{is known}} as the Greenbelt Route (E) and the Branch Avenue Route (F), which meet {{at the center of the}} lower level {{platform}} of Gallery Place-Chinatown station (whose <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> Unit (RTU) code is F01, the first station on the Branch Avenue Route).|$|E
5|$|Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 {{have their}} own parking garages. Each also has its own economy lot, which {{provides}} lower parking rates, and a separate lot for oversize vehicles. Complimentary shuttle transportation is provided between the terminals and the <b>remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> 1 economy and oversize vehicle lots. In March 2016, the airport opened a cellphone lot, which provides free parking to people waiting for passengers.|$|E
25|$|DLCs can be {{configured}} as universal (UDLCs) or integrated (IDLCs). Universal DLCs {{have two}} terminals, a central office terminal (COT) and a <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> (RT), that function similarly. Both terminals interface with analog signals, convert to digital signals, and transport {{to the other}} side where the reverse is performed.|$|E
5000|$|Controller to RT(s) Transfer. The Bus Controller sends one receive command {{word with}} a Terminal address of 31 {{signifying}} a broadcast type command, immediately followed by 0 to 32 data words. All <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminals</b> that implement broadcasts {{will accept the}} data but no <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminals</b> will respond.|$|R

25|$|Similar {{machines}} {{referred to}} as the IBM 1050 series were used as the console printers for many computers, such as the IBM 1130 and the IBM System/360 series. The IBM 1050 was also offered in a <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> configuration, similar in use to the 2741. These were designed and manufactured for this purpose, including the necessary electrical interfaces, and incorporated more rugged components than the office Selectric or even the 2741.|$|E
2500|$|Terminal 4 is {{exclusively}} used by American Airlines. American Eagle {{flights are}} operated {{out of a}} small <b>remote</b> <b>terminal,</b> {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Eagle's Nest," [...] with bus service to and from Terminal 4.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} {{generation}} <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> units (often {{in the form of}} Teleprinters like a Friden Flexowriter) saw greatly increased use. [...] Telephone connections provided sufficient speed for early remote terminals and allowed hundreds of kilometers separation between remote-terminals and the computing center. Eventually these stand-alone computer networks would be generalized into an interconnected network of networks—the Internet.|$|E

2500|$|The system’s {{rail lines}} run on eleven {{lettered}} [...] "routes". Within these routes, each station is also identified by {{a letter and}} number system based on the route letter and the station number in ascending order from the system’s geographic center. This {{is known as the}} <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> Unit (RTU) number. The RTU number identifies the station and nearby track controlled by the station’s wayside control room to Metro’s Central Control. Metro Center, Gallery Place, L'Enfant Plaza, and Fort Totten have two RTU numbers - one for each level.|$|E
2500|$|LAX {{has nine}} {{passenger}} terminals arranged {{in the shape}} of the letter U or a horseshoe. [...] The terminals are served by a shuttle bus. The Tom Bradley International Terminal and Terminals 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all connected airside via an overground passage between Terminal 4 and the Tom Bradley International Terminal, an underground tunnel between Terminals 4, 5 and 6 and above-ground walkways between Terminals 6, 7, and 8. [...] Additional airside shuttle buses operate among Terminals 4, 6, and the American Eagle <b>remote</b> <b>terminal,</b> as well as between Terminals 2, 3, and the Tom Bradley International Terminal. There are no physical airside connections between any of the other terminals.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have also}} {{referred}} to several clues in the code such as a concealed reference to the word [...] "MYRTUS", believed {{to refer to the}} Myrtle tree, or Hadassah in Hebrew. Hadassah was the birth name of the former Jewish queen of Persia, Queen Esther. However, {{it may be that the}} [...] "MYRTUS" [...] reference is simply a misinterpreted reference to SCADA components known as RTUs (<b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> Units) and that this reference is actually [...] "My RTUs"–a management feature of SCADA. Also, the number 19790509 appears once in the code and might refer to the date [...] "1979 May 09", the day Habib Elghanian, a Persian Jew, was executed in Tehran. Another date that appears in the code is [...] "24 September 2007", the day that Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke at Columbia University and made comments questioning the validity of the Holocaust. Such data is not conclusive, since, as noted by Symantec, [...] "...attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party".|$|E

5000|$|RT to Controller Transfer. The Bus Controller sends one {{transmit}} command word to a <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal.</b> The <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> then sends {{a single}} Status word, immediately followed by 1 to 32 words.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of text mode {{is that it}} has relatively low bandwidth requirements in <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> use. Thus, a text mode <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> can necessarily update the screen much faster than a graphics mode <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> linked to the same amount of bandwidth (and in turn will seem more responsive), since the remote server may only need to transmit a few dozen bytes for each screen update in text mode, as opposed to complex raster graphics remote procedure calls that may require the transmission and rendering of entire bitmaps.|$|E

5000|$|Versions of STANAG 3910 using {{optical media}} for the HS channel {{component}} require an additional passive component, {{in the form}} of an optical star coupler either reflective or transmissive, to interconnect the <b>remote</b> <b>terminals.</b> This limits the number of <b>remote</b> <b>terminals</b> that may be connected to the HS media, through the effect of the optical star on the optical power (determined by the number of [...] "ways" [...] of the star). Therefore, it may not be possible for all the (up to) 31 RTs (and 1 BC) that may be connected to the LS channel to have HS channel connections.|$|R
50|$|The RT Production Test Plan is a {{simplified}} {{subset of the}} validation test plan and is intended for production testing of <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminals.</b> This test plan is maintained by the SAE AS-1A Avionic Networks Subcommittee as AS4112.|$|R
50|$|A {{teleprocessing}} monitor (also, Transaction Processing Monitor or TP Monitor) is a control program that monitors {{the transfer of}} data between multiple local and <b>remote</b> <b>terminals</b> {{to ensure that the}} transaction processes completely or, if an error occurs, to take appropriate actions.|$|R

50|$|For example, in a tracked vehicle, a <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> might acquire {{data from}} an {{inertial}} navigational subsystem, and send that data over a 1553 data bus to another <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal,</b> for display on a crew instrument.

5000|$|Mode Command Without Data Word (Broadcast). The Bus Controller sends one command {{word with}} a Terminal address of 31 {{signifying}} a broadcast type command and a sub-address of 0 or 31 signifying a Mode Code type command. No <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminals</b> will respond.|$|R
5000|$|This type of {{arrangement}} {{does have}} some disadvantages. The central computer performs the computing functions and controls the <b>remote</b> <b>terminals.</b> This type of system relies totally on the central computer.

Instead, all remote interaction with the camera is carried out via the two-pin <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> {{on the front of}} the body.
