5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E

5|$|On {{most days}} of the week an average of 4,000 to 5,000 {{tourists}} visit the main valley. On the days that the Nile Cruises arrive, the number can <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> over 9,000. These levels are expected to <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> 25,000 by 2015. The West Valley is much less visited, as there is only one tomb that is open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing {{back and forth between}} the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one that gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> other social forms.

Durkheim saw the {{religion as}} a force {{that emerged in the}} early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
