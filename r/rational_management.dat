25|$|The International Year of the Salmon (IYS) is an {{international}} initiative to raise the capacity of collaborative outreach and research to meet the issues facing wild salmon, and the communities that benefit them, under the backdrop of increasing environmental variability. The IYS is a joint venture launched by the NPAFC, the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO), and other partners. The overall theme of the initiative is 'Salmon and People in a Changing World'. Through outreach efforts, the IYS will create awareness and advance understanding of challenges facing salmon populations and the communities {{that are associated with}} them. An investment in research will also be stimulated by the initiative, which will and leave behind a legacy of knowledge, data/information systems, tools, and a new generation of scientists better informed to provide effective advice on the <b>rational</b> <b>management</b> of salmon.|$|E

A wonderful era was possible for the human race. But the capitalist class failed. It made a shambles of civilization. Nor can the capitalist class plead not guilty. It knew of {{the opportunity}}. Its wise men told of the opportunity, its scholars and its scientists told it of the opportunity. All that they said is there to-day in the books, just so much damning evidence against it. It would not listen. It was too greedy. It rose up (as it rises up to-day), shamelessly, in our legislative halls, and declared that profits were impossible without the toil of children and babes. It lulled its conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and dear moralities, and allowed the suffering and misery of mankind to continue and to increase, in short, the capitalist class failed {{to take advantage of}} the opportunity.|$|E

5000|$|In {{terms of}} methods of {{motivating}} workers, differences between High Commitment Practices and strategies from the rational system of management are extreme. The rational system of management focuses on either punishments or incentives. For example, the earliest form of <b>rational</b> <b>management,</b> direct control, encourages employee productivity by having supervisors oversee {{the production process}} and punish workers who are not producing enough outputs. Another form of <b>rational</b> <b>management,</b> bureaucratic control, encourages productivity through career incentives like bonuses and promotions. However, High Commitment Practices, unlike any <b>rational</b> <b>management,</b> aim to stimulate productivity by encouraging employee commitment to the institution. [...] For example, Data General, a corporation which advocates High Commitment Practices, manages to make employees love their tasks and grow attached to the corporation so much that many employees elect to work twelve hours, four more than Data General prescribes. [...] Contrary to <b>rational</b> <b>management,</b> High Commitment Practices attempt to create scenarios in which employees aspire to deliver their best efforts.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the current state of}} the groundwater system monitoring in the Novgorod region. The groundwater monitoring observations serve as the basis for prediction assessment of water resources. The efficiency of water resource management largely depends on the comprehensiveness and reliability of information on the groundwater condition. The existing groundwater monitoring system has proven to be incapable of fully implementing its functions. It requires a fundamental reorganization and further development at the contemporary scientific and technical level, since groundwater resource management is impossible without a quantitative forecast of groundwater condition and properties. From the perspective of <b>rational</b> Nature <b>management,</b> the leading ecological function of underground hydrosphere is carried out by fresh underground waters. <b>Rational</b> Nature <b>management</b> underlies the sustainable development of the Northwest region, which is economically viable for the European territory of the country. ...|$|R

50|$|With {{respect to}} {{corporate}} structure, institutions employing <b>rational</b> <b>management</b> and institutions employing high commitment practices also differ. Institutions with <b>rational</b> <b>management</b> {{tend to have}} a steep hierarchy with many ranks between floor-workers and executives. For example, institutions employing bureaucratic control often have one entry level {{at the bottom of the}} hierarchy, and new recruits slowly work their ways up the seemingly endless ladder. Because these institutions have a steep hierarchy, those near the bottom of the chain are often alienated from higher ups Consequently, relationship between executives and workers are minimal. However, institutions which employ High Commitment Practices have fairly flat hierarchy and intra-firm networking is easy. As a result, most employees readily develop attachment to their on-job peers, bosses, and the institution, increasing their commitment. While the rational system of management maintains distance between executive and lower employees, High Commitment Practices foster good relationship between the two.|$|E

50|$|High Commitment Practices {{also differ}} from {{practices}} in the <b>rational</b> <b>management</b> system with regards to employee control. The rational system of management discourages job autonomy, believing that such freedom will only lower productivity because employees will elect not to work. For example, in scientific management and Fordism, employees are micro-managed- they are given specific {{instructions on how to}} perform certain tasks. However, High Commitment Practices encourage job autonomy, creativity, and innovation, all of which institutions with High Commitment Practices believe will increase job satisfaction and commitment leading to increased outputs. While the rational system of management attempts to micro-manage employees, High Commitment Practices greatly encourage independence.|$|E
