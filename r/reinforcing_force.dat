50|$|In {{the first}} phase of the war the Ottomans had been able to conquer most of the Caucasus. Özdemiroğlu Osman Pasha (Özdemir Pasha’s son) was {{appointed}} as the governor of the newly conquered territories. The capital of his province was Derbend at the Caspian coast. However, after the Ottoman army returned to its main base in Istanbul, the Persians under Imam Kulu began to regain some of their former territories. Although an army from the Crimean Khanate (which was an Ottoman vassal) under Adil Giray Khan was sent to the Caucasus in summer 1579 as a reinforcement, they were routed by Hamza Mirza and Mirza Salman, and Adil Giray Khan was taken prisoner, and put in Qazvin, where he was later executed. Consequently, Osman Pasha had to retreat to North Caucasus. In 1582, the Ottoman Porte sent a second <b>reinforcing</b> <b>force</b> under Cafer Pasha, the governor of Caffa, to restore Ottoman dominance in the area.|$|E
40|$|How is load sensed by receptors, {{and how is}} this sensory {{information}} used to guide locomotion? Many insights in this domain have evolved from comparative studies since it has been realized that basic principles concerning load sensing and regulation {{can be found in}} a wide variety of animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate. Feedback about load is not only derived from specific load receptors but also from other types of receptors that previously were thought to have other functions. In the central nervous system of many species, a convergence is found between specific and nonspecific load receptors. Furthermore, feedback from load receptors onto central circuits involved in the generation of rhythmic locomotor output is commonly found. During the stance phase, afferent activity from various load detectors can activate the extensor part in such circuits, thereby providing <b>reinforcing</b> <b>force</b> feedback. At the same time, the flexion is suppressed. The functional role of this arrangement is that activity in antigravity muscles is promoted while the onset of the next flexion is delayed as long as the limb is loaded. This type of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>force</b> feedback is present during gait but absent in the immoble resting animal. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In South Taiwan, staged open-cut {{mining method}} was adopted for {{industry}} of limestone mining. Such improper cutting method {{results in a}} large area of original plantation removal, creates a large volume of spoils, and consequently, causes serious impact on the ecological environment of the entire mining area. The vegetated hill slope always possesses a layer of topsoil for capable protection against soil erosion to stabilize the slope of a certain extent. To mitigate {{the influence of the}} improper mining activity, we improve the overall environment by vegetation with dominant plants in the local area. After vegetating treatment and succession, the important woody dominant plants are Dense-flowered False-nettle (Boehmeria densiflora Hook. & Arn.), Roxburgh sumac (Rhus javonica L. var. roxburghiana. DC.) and Pluchea (Pluchea carolinensis (Jacq.) G. Don) in South-Taiwan limestone spoil area. The roots of plants could be restraining the occurrence of shallow landslides because of mechanical <b>reinforcing</b> <b>force</b> of roots, and friction of roots-soil binding. These three plants were selected to obtain root-strength model from pulling resistance. The statistical regression analysis was performed to formulate the relationships of pulling resistance of root system (Pr), the growth characteristics of plants and field site environment with the testing results. Good regression relationships were obtained, thus, that served as an economical vegetation material at mining waste dumping area...|$|E
