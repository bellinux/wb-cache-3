5|$|The {{project was}} revived in 1993–4 by the {{initiative}} of Eric Herzl, an expert from Austrian Society of Memorials, who obtained the permission from Riga City Council to continue the construction work. Austria brought the project {{to the attention of}} the German War Graves Commission and more than a dozen German cities in 1999. On May 23, 2000, 13 German city representatives and the president of German War Graves Commission met in Berlin to form German Riga Committee. The chapter was formed to plan and build a war memorial in Bikernieki forest to commemorate the Jews deported and killed at the start of the 1940s. The project was funded by German War Graves Commission, the National Fund of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Austria,</b> the German government including Central Council of Jews in Germany, and donations from several German town municipalities. The work was carried out by The German Commission, Latvian Fraternal Cemeteries Commission, and the Riga City Council. The projected cost was DEM 900,000 and the actual project cost DEM 1M (or LVL 285,000).|$|E

25|$|In June 1995 Meissner-Blau has {{chaired the}} first International Human Rights Tribunal in Vienna. Her {{co-chair}} was Gerhard Oberschlick, {{editor of the}} journal FORVM. Christian Michelides served as attorney general. The tribunal was dedicated to the persecution of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender persons in Austria {{during the period from}} 1945 to 1995. An assembly of Austrian human rights activists condemned the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Austria</b> in all seven cases that were brought forward by the LGBT-community. As a consequence of this endeavour and other efforts all discriminating laws against LGBT-persons in Austria have been abolished between 1996 and 2005.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{any work}} of art that existed prior to 1945 has a {{potential}} provenance problem. This is a serious obstacle for anyone who currently collects pre-1945 European art. To avoid wasting thousands or even millions of dollars, they must verify (normally {{with the assistance of}} an art historian and a lawyer specializing in art law) that potential acquisitions were not stolen by the Nazis from a Holocaust victim. The highest-profile legal case arising from this problem is the U.S. Supreme Court decision of <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Austria</b> v. Altmann (2006), in which the Court held that U.S. courts could retroactively apply the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to Austria for torts that allegedly occurred before 1976.|$|E

25|$|In early 1919, {{following}} the Armistice of Villa Giusti, Pittoni protested as the Arditi and the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento {{took over in}} Trieste. The city was soon placed under the governorship of Carlo Petitti di Roreto, who tried to talk Pittoni into accepting the national unification and the Trieste Social Democratic League's integration with the PSI. Pittoni was also opposed to the PSI's revolutionary socialism, and, in April 1919, stood in the minority of Trieste socialists who voted against joining the PSI and the Comintern; he also defended Adler, Camille Huysmans, and the ISC against Bolshevik criticism. By mid 1919 many of Pittoni's followers, Callini included, had deserted to the irredentist camp. Pittoni himself radicalised his opposition to Italian integration, and from 1920 argued that Trieste should form a state within the new <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Austria.</b>|$|E

25|$|In March 2000 Altmann filed a {{civil claim}} against the Austrian {{government}} {{for the return of}} the paintings. She was informed that the cost of filing (consisting of 1.2% of the amount in question, plus a filing fee), would have meant a fee of €1.75 million. To avoid the prohibitively high costs, Altmann and Schoenberg sued the Austrian government and the Galerie Belvedere in the US courts. The Austrian government filed for dismissal, based on arguments around the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (1976). The Act granted immunity to sovereign nations except under certain conditions. Schoenberg showed that three of the conditions pertinent to the case were that Altmann's property had been taken in violation of international law; the property was owned by the state in question, or one of its agencies; and that the property had been used on a commercial basis in the US. Over four years of litigation followed as to whether the case could be brought against a sovereign state before it was brought before the Supreme Court in <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Austria</b> v. Altmann. In June 2004 the Supreme Court determined that the paintings had been stolen and that Austria was not immune from a claim from Altmann; the court made no comment on the current ownership of the paintings.|$|E
