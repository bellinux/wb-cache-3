Second, this dispute resolution system can create a kind of collusive agreement where there is a quasi vertical re integration which does not favor competition. The paper is organized as follows : First the various kinds of disputes are analyzed. They are presented according to the following categories : - access to the track - slots allocation; - timetable establishment; - adjustments to the initial timetable; - train circulation - delays - maintenance and renewal works - safety - estate - real estate sharing; - network minor changes - new lines Secondly, the methods by which those difficulties are dealt with are presented for two countries : UK and France. The British dispute resolution system relies heavily on cooperation and contracts within the railway industry whereas the French system is more hierarchy oriented, thus generating less conflicts but which are, maybe, more difficult to solve. But we can wonder whether the present British system, together with the Network Rail status doesn't lead to a more integrated railway industry trough long term co-operation. Conversely, the difficulties that the French railway industry is presently experiencing might lead to define a dispute resolution system more able to favor some forms of competition.

40|$|Benchmark {{analysis}} of railway networks and companies has been {{stimulated by the}} European policy of deregulation of transport markets, the opening of national railway networks and markets to new entrants and separation of infrastructure and train operation. Recent international railway benchmarking studies which are mostly based on statistical data compiled by UIC demonstrate a variety of performance measures, assessment methods and the results suggest no clear interdependence between the organisation model of the railway industry and its efficiency. Economic evidence suggests that vertical separation between infrastructure management and train operations increases costs athigher traffic densities, while at lower densities it reduces costs. At mean traffic densities a holding model reduces costs compared with vertical integration, while vertical separation does not change costs.

50|$|The branch had {{its origins}} in a much grander plan put forward in the early 1860s.

40|$|The induced {{liberalisation}} process {{within the}} European railway system severely affects the railway infrastructure capacity allocation procedure. In the past a single and often governmental owned integrated railway company planned, built and operated a national railway system. The liberalisation process {{led to a}} segregation of the integrated railway companies into railway infrastructure manager and railway undertaking in many European Countries. The open access paradigm for railway infrastructure capacity that grants any licensed railway undertaking access to the railway infrastructure capacity induces competition between different <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> trying to acquire railway infrastructure capacity. Recent figures indicate that more <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> emerge and do request railway infrastructure capacity. Their increasing share of uncoordinated request for railway infrastructure capacity increases {{the complexity of the}} coordination phase of the railway infrastructure capacity allocation process. In this phase the railway infrastructure manager needs to adjust train path requests in a way to resolve conflicting requests for railway infrastructure capacity. This work introduces an algorithmic framework that shall provide efficient measures to support the railway capacity allocation process and to analyse different allocation procedures. In order to make algorithmic approaches applicable in this domain of railway engineering a sophisticated modelling approach for railway infrastructure capacity is extended in order to account for the objectives of the <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> participating on the secondary railway market for railway infrastructure capacity. The objectives for railway capacity allocation are formulated {{from the point of view}} of the <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> submitting train path requests. These objectives account for the negative effects due to adjustments applied to their train path requests during the coordination phase of the railway capacity allocation process. The formalised railway capacity allocation process can be optimised globally, by taking into account standardised objectives with help of algorithmic approaches introduced in this work. However, due to the required confidentiality of information provided by the <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> to the railway infrastructure manager, a global optimisation, taking into account the real objectives of all <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> is not applicable. In order to allow for incorporating the real objectives of the <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> a game theoretical setting is formulated: the <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> are players acting on the secondary railway market for railway infrastructure capacity. Assuming that these players act rationally, such a game theoretical setting always leads to a result, where no player can further improve his situation. Such a solution of the game is a Nash Equilibrium. Comparing the obtained Nash Equilibria of the game theoretical setting to the optimal solution obtained by global optimisation techniques gives an indication of the negative effect of non-cooperative behaviour in such a competitive market for railway capacity allocation. Moreover, it will be shown how the algorithmic framework for railway capacity allocation can be used to determine the degree of congestion of a railway system, based on the submitted train path requests and standardised objectives...|$|E

40|$|The European {{transport}} market has confronted several changes {{during the last}} decade. Due to European Union legislative mandates, the railway freight market was deregulated in 2007. The market followed the trend started by other transport modes {{as well as other}} previously regulated industries such as banking, telecommunications and energy. Globally, the first country to deregulate the railway freight market was the United States, with the introduction of the Staggers Rail Act in 1980. Some European countries decided to follow suit already before regulation was mandated; among the forerunners were the United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany. The previous research has concentrated only on these countries, which has provided an interesting research gap for this thesis. The Baltic Sea Region consists of countries with different kinds of liberalization paths, including Sweden and Germany, which have been on the frontline, whereas Lithuania and Finland have only one active railway undertaking, the incumbent. The {{transport market}} of the European Union is facing further challenges in the near future, due to the Sulphur Directive, oil dependency and the changing structure of European rail networks. In order to improve the accessibility of this peripheral area, further action is required. This research focuses on topics such as the progression of deregulation, barriers to entry, country-specific features, cooperation and internationalization. Based on the research results, it can be stated that the Baltic Sea Region’s railway freight market is expected to change in the future. Further private <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> are anticipated, and these would change the market structure. The realization of European Union’s plans to increase the improved rail network to cover the Baltic States is strongly hoped for, and railway freight market counterparts inside and among countries are starting to enhance their level of cooperation. The Baltic Sea Region countries have several special national characteristics which influence the market and should be taken into account when companies evaluate possible market entry actions. According to thesis interviews, the Swedish market has a strong level of cooperation {{in the form of an}} old-boy network, and is supported by a positive attitude of the incumbent towards the private <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings.</b> This has facilitated the entry process of newcomers, and currently the market has numerous operating <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings.</b> A contrary example was found from Poland, where the incumbent sent old rolling stock to the scrap yard rather than sell it to private <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The importance of personal relations is highlighted in Russia, followed by the railway market’s strong political bond with politics. Nonetheless, some barriers to entry are shared by the Baltic Sea Region, the main ones being acquisition of rolling stock, bureaucracy and needed investments. The railway freight market is internationalizing, which is perceived via several alliances as well as the increased number of mergers and acquisitions. After deregulation, markets seem to increase the number of <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> at a rather fast pace, but with the passage of time, the larger operators tend to acquire smaller ones. Therefore, it is expected that in a decade’s time, the number of <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> will start to decrease in the deregulation pioneer countries, while the ones coming from behind might still experience an increase. The Russian market is expected to be totally liberalized, and further alliances between the Russian Railways and European <b>railway</b> <b>undertakings</b> are expected to occur. The Baltic Sea Region’s railway freight market is anticipated to improve, and, based on the interviewees’ comments, attract more cargoes from road to rail...|$|E
