40|$|Sudden {{increases}} in the background <b>gamma-radiation</b> <b>dose</b> may occur due to the removal of 222 Rn and 220 Rn progeny from the atmosphere by wet deposition mechanisms. This contribution has been measured using a Geiger–Muller detector at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (Aldermaston, UK) during July 2005 –April 2006. The results are approximated by a log-normal distribution and there were nine separate occurrences of the <b>gamma-radiation</b> <b>dose</b> exceeding 125 % of the geometric mean value. The increases were associated with periods of heavy rainfall, although no correlation was evident between the dose rate {{and the amount of}} rainfall, as increased rainfall dilutes the activity further rather than increasing its atmospheric removal. The events were preceded by periods of fine weather and atmospheric stability that allow for the build-up of 222 Rn and 220 Rn progeny. Similar {{increases in}} <b>gamma-radiation</b> <b>dose</b> have been measured at a nearby monitoring station situated approximately 11 miles from Aldermaston.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of different <b>gamma-radiation</b> <b>doses</b> on the growth of Alternaria alternata in artificially inoculated cereal samples. Seeds and grains were divided into four groups: Control Group (not irradiated), and Groups 1, 2 and 3, inoculated with an A. alternata spore suspension (1 x 10 (6) spores/mL) and exposed to 2, 5 and 10 kGy, respectively. Serial dilutions of the samples were prepared and seeded on DRBC (dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol agar) and DCMA (dichloran chloramphenicol malt extract agar) media, after which the number of colony-forming units per gram was determined in each group. In addition, fungal morphology after irradiation was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that ionizing radiation at a dose of 5 kGy was effective in reducing the growth of A. alternata. However, a dose of 10 kGy was necessary to inhibit fungal growth completely.

All the physicochemical properties were improved after irradiation and optimum result was found at (10 – 15) kGy <b>gamma-radiation</b> <b>doses.</b> Total nitrogen and ammonium content in the textile effluent has been increased after irradiation, which indicated {{the possibility of the}} textile effluent to be used as fertilizer-containing irrigation water. And it is also proved by the enhanced growth rate of spleen amaranth irrigated by gamma ray-irradiated textile effluent compared to that of the plant nourished with the raw textile effluent and only water. The elemental analysis revealed that the plants uptake trace amount of heavy metal and moreover contain satisfactory amount of mineral nutrients. At the dose rate of (10 – 15) kGy the psychochemical parameter as well as the plant production is satisfactory.

In addition to a developing a stable pre-packaged food supply, research is required {{to better understand the}} ability to convert edible biomass into safe, nutritious, {{and acceptable}} food products in a closed system with many restrictions (mass, volume, power, crew time, etc.). An understanding of how storage conditions encountered in a long-term space mission, such as elevated radiation, will impact food quality is also needed. The focus of this project was to {{contribute to the development of}} the highest quality food system possible for the duration of a mission, considering shelf-stable extended shelf-life foods, bulk ingredients, and crops to be grown in space. The impacts of space-relevant radiation doses on food, bulk ingredient, and select candidate crop quality and antioxidant capacity were determined. Interestingly, increasing <b>gamma-radiation</b> <b>doses</b> (0 to 1000 Gy) did not always increase dose-related effects in foods.

Ionizing radiation {{has been shown}} to decrease neointimal formation within stents in animal models and in initial clinical trials. We studied the effects of intracoronary gamma-radiation therapy versus placebo on the clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with in-stent restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients with in-stent restenosis underwent successful coronary intervention and were then blindly randomized to <b>receive</b> either intracoronary <b>gamma-radiation</b> with (192) Ir (15 Gy) or placebo. Four independent core laboratories blinded to the treatment protocol analyzed the angiographic and intravascular ultrasound end points of restenosis. Procedural success and in-hospital and 30 -day complications were similar among the groups. At 6 months, patients assigned to radiation therapy required less target lesion revascularization and target vessel revascularization (9 [13. 8 %] and 17 [26. 2 %], respectively) compared with patients assigned to placebo (41 [63. 1 %, P= 0. 0001] and 44 [67. 7 %, P= 0. 0001], respectively). Binary angiographic restenosis was lower in the irradiated group (19 % versus 58 % for placebo, P= 0. 001). Freedom from major cardiac events was lower in the radiation group (29. 2 % versus 67. 7 % for placebo, P< 0. 001).

The possible reason for the change of measured signatures of defect levels in high resistance Cd 0, 9 Zn 0, 1 Te:Al during gamma irradiation and 1 month later is the change in compensation degree of the material. The changes in the properties of Cd 0, 9 Zn 0, 1 Te:Al detector have been researched depending on the concentration and energy level of the deep donor for different concentrations of deep acceptors, {{as well as on the}} degree of alloying with aluminum. The negative factor for registering properties of Cd 0, 9 Zn 0, 1 Te:Al detector is increased concentration of zinc vacancies, which may arise at manufacturing stage and under influence of γ-irradiation during operation. The degradation of properties of irradiated detector may occur due to the offset dependence of the resistivity on the aluminum dopant concentration N(Al) towards to higher concentrations of Al when the value of doping is not enough large.

40|$|Radiation {{encountered}} on {{an extended}} duration space mission (estimates of 3 Sieverts for {{a mission to}} Mars) poses a threat not only to human health, {{but also to the}} quality, nutritional value, and palatability of the food system. Free radicals generated by radiation interaction with foods may initiate many unwanted reactions including: 1) autoxidation in lipids that alters flavor, odor, and concentrations of essential fatty acids, and 2) depletion of antioxidants food products and dietary supplements. Studies have shown that antioxidants may provide long term health protection from oxidative stress caused by radiation exposure; therefore, consumption of antioxidants will be important. Stability of essential fatty acids is also important for astronauts long-term health status. The objectives of this study were to characterize the effects of low <b>dose</b> <b>gamma-radiation</b> on lipids and antioxidants by monitoring oxidation and reducing power, respectively, in model systems. Select oils and antioxidants were exposed to levels of gamma-radiation ranging from 0 to 1000 Gy (1 Gy = 1 Sv) using a Gammacell 220 and stored at ambient or elevated temperatures (65 C) for up to 3 months prior to analysis. A Fricke dosimeter was used to verify differences between the radiation doses administered. Primary and secondary products of lipid oxidation in soybean and peanut oils were monitored using conjugated diene and 2 -thiobarbituric acid (TBARs) assays. Changes in fatty acid composition and formation and vitamin E levels were also measured. The reducing power of antioxidant compounds, including vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, was determined using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Significant differences (alpha = 0. 05) were present between all radiation doses tested using the Fricke dosimeter. Increasing radiation doses above 3 Sv resulted in significantly (alpha = 0. 05) elevated levels of oxidation and free fatty acids in soybean and peanut oils. Decreases in concentrations of essential fatty acids upon increasing radiation doses were also observed. Increasing radiation doses caused significant (alpha = 0. 05) decreases in reducing power and hence the effectiveness of vitamins C and E as well as beta-carotene. This work establishes a need for quantifying the effects of space relevant radiation doses {{in the development of a}} food system for an extended duration mission and for identifying threshold radiation levels that will impact the useful shelf-life of the variety of foods that will be sent.

40|$|Polyethylene {{microencapsulation}} physically homogenizes and incorporates mixed waste particles {{within a}} molten polymer matrix, forming a solidified final waste form upon cooling. Each individual particle of waste is embedded within the polymer block and {{is surrounded by}} a durable, leach-resistant coating. The process has been successfully applied for the treatment of a broad range of mixed wastes, including evaporator concentrate salts, soil, sludges, incinerator ash, off-gas blowdown solutions, decontamination solutions, molten salt oxidation process residuals, ion exchange resins, granular activated carbon, shredded dry active waste, spill clean-up residuals, depleted uranium powders, and failed grout waste forms. For waste streams containing high concentrations of soluble toxic metal contaminants, additives can be used to further reduce leachability, thus improving waste loadings while meeting or exceeding regulatory disposal criteria. In this configuration, contaminants are both chemically stabilized and physically solidified, making the process a true stabilization/solidification (S/S) technology. Unlike conventional hydraulic cement grouts or thermosetting polymers, thermoplastic polymers such as polyethylene require no chemical. reaction for solidification. Thus, a stable, solid, final waste form product is assured on cooling. Variations in waste chemistry over time do not affect processing parameters and do not require reformulation of the recipe. Incorporation of waste particles within the polymer matrix serves as an aggregate and improves the mechanical strength and integrity of the waste form. The compressive strength of polyethylene microencapsulated waste forms varies based on the type and quantity of waste encapsulated, but is typically between 7 and 17. 2 MPa (1000 and 2500 psi), well above the minimum strength of 0. 4 MPa (160 psi) recommended by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for low-level radioactive waste forms in support of 10 CFR 61 (NRC, 1991; 1983) Because polyethylene is a relatively new material, it is difficult to predict its long-term durability. However, prior to scale-up of the microencapsulation process, a study was conducted to evaluate potential degradation mechanisms. The study examined potential effects on mechanical integrity from exposure to chemicals and solvents, thermal cycling, saturated environments, microbial attack, and high gamma-radiation fields (Kalb et al., 1991). At ambient temperatures, polyethylene is relatively inert to most chemicals, including organic solvents, acids, and alkaline solutions. Exposure to changes in temperature or saturated soil conditions have been shown to degrade the mechanical integrity of some waste forms, but had little or no measurable impact on polyethylene waste forms. Low-density polyethylene is not susceptible to growth of microbial organisms, a fact that is evidenced by the lack of plastics decomposition in municipal waste landfills. When exposed to <b>gamma-radiation</b> at total <b>doses</b> of up to lo 8 rad, additional cross-linking of the polymer occurs, resulting in increased strength and lower leachability...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of accumulated radiation doses in people professionally exposed to ionizing radiation was performed using methods of biological (chromosomal aberrations frequency in lymphocytes) and physical (radionuclides analysis in urine, whole-body radiation meter, individual thermoluminescent dosimeters) dosimetry. A group of 84 "A" category employees after {{their work in}} the territory of former Semipalatinsk test site (Kazakhstan) was investigated. The dose rate in some funnels exceeds 40 μSv/h. After radionuclides determination in urine using radiochemical and WBC methods, it was shown that the total effective dose of personnel internal exposure did not exceed 0. 2 mSv/year, while an acceptable dose limit for staff is 20 mSv/year. The range of external radiation doses measured with individual thermo-luminescent dosimeters was 0. 3 - 1. 406 µSv. The cytogenetic examination showed that chromosomal aberrations frequency in staff was 4. 27 ± 0. 22 %, which is significantly higher than at the people from non-polluting settlement Tausugur (0. 87 ± 0. 1 %) (р ≤ 0. 01) and citizens of Almaty (1. 6 ± 0. 12 %) (р≤ 0. 01). Chromosomal type aberrations accounted for 2. 32 ± 0. 16 %, 0. 27 ± 0. 06 % of which were dicentrics and centric rings. The cytogenetic analysis of different types group radiosensitivity among «professionals» (age, sex, ethnic group, epidemiological data) revealed {{no significant differences between}} the compared values. Using various techniques by frequency of dicentrics and centric rings, the average cumulative radiation dose for group was calculated, and that was 0. 084 - 0. 143 Gy. To perform comparative individual dosimetry using physical and biological methods of dose assessment, calibration curves (including own ones) and regression equations based on general frequency of chromosomal aberrations obtained after irradiation of blood samples by <b>gamma-radiation</b> with the <b>dose</b> rate of 0, 1 Gy/min were used. Herewith, on the assumption of individual variation of chromosomal aberrations frequency (1 – 10 %), the accumulated dose of radiation varied 0 - 0. 3 Gy. The main problem in the interpretation of individual dosimetry results is reduced to different reaction of the objects to irradiation - radiosensitivity, which dictates the need of quantitative definition of this individual reaction and its consideration in the calculation of the received radiation dose. The entire examined contingent was assigned to a group based on the received dose and detected cytogenetic aberrations. Radiosensitive individuals, at the lowest received dose in a year, showed the highest frequency of chromosomal aberrations (5. 72 %). In opposite, radioresistant individuals showed the lowest frequency of chromosomal aberrations (2. 8 %). The cohort correlation according to the criterion of radio-sensitivity in our research was distributed as follows: radio-sensitive (26. 2 %) — medium radio-sensitivity (57. 1 %), radioresistant (16. 7 %). Herewith, the dispersion for radioresistant individuals is 2. 3; for the group with medium radio-sensitivity — 3. 3; and for radio-sensitive group — 9. These data indicate the highest variation of characteristic (reactions to radiation effect) in the group of radio-sensitive individuals. People with medium radio-sensitivity show significant long-term correlation (0. 66; n= 48, β ≥ 0. 999) between the values of doses defined according to the results of cytogenetic analysis and dose of external radiation obtained with the help of thermoluminescent dosimeters. Mathematical models based on the type of violation of the radiation dose according to the professionals radiosensitivity level were offered...|$|R
