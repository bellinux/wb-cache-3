5|$|Alkin made {{financial}} claims {{from the state}} for her nursing, {{some of which were}} paid, although a petition of 1654 refers to her severe illness. The same letter stated that she had had to sell many of her possessions, including her bed. A petition for financial <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> May 1655 is the last recorded note on her, and it is presumed that she died soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|As {{mayor of}} Buffalo, he presided over {{emergency}} <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> blizzards {{such as the}} mid-October 2006 two-foot snow storm.

5|$|For {{his service}} to the Allies in World War I, White was created a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order by George V {{on behalf of the}} British Empire. Following his <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> active {{military}} service in Europe, White embarked upon a global journey that consisted of Egypt, Palestine, India, Burma, the Malay Peninsula, Java, China, Japan, and the Philippines. He returned to the United States in June 1920 and soon thereafter resumed his law practice in Charleston.|$|E
5|$|In late 1818, however, {{demand for}} U.S. goods fell sharply in Europe. Land values {{also began to}} fall, {{touching}} off the Panic of 1819. Many persons in the state were unable to repay their loans. A struggle began between creditors seeking to collect money owed to them and debtors seeking <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> obligations they could not meet. A Debt Relief Party sprang up in the state, which had long been a single-party bastion.|$|E

5|$|One {{of these}} two queens might have been Reptynub, the only known consort of Nyuserre.

5|$|Palliative care is {{specialized}} {{medical care}} for people with serious illnesses, including Parkinson's. The goal of this speciality is to improve {{quality of life for}} both the person suffering from Parkinson's and the family by providing <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> the symptoms, pain, and stress of illnesses. As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E
5|$|Pilgrimages were {{a popular}} {{religious}} practice throughout the Middle Ages in England, with the tradition {{dating back to}} the Roman period. Typically pilgrims would travel short distances to a shrine or a particular church, either to do penance for a perceived sin, or to seek <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> an illness or other condition. Some pilgrims travelled further, either to more distant sites within Britain or, in a few cases, onto the continent.|$|E

5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and {{the ebb and flow}} of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. <b>Relief</b> <b>from</b> Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

August 633, Khalid went to Daumat-ul-jandal and defeated the rebels in the Battle of Daumat-ul-jandal, capturing the city fortress. On his journey back to Mesopotamia, Khalid {{is said to have}} made a secret trip to Mecca to participate in Hajj.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the flat}} {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 is almost entirely agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either side of the highway. <b>Relief</b> <b>from</b> the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route.

5|$|Fertilisation of Orchids {{is a book}} by English naturalist Charles Darwin {{published}} on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.|$|E
5|$|Following their <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> Tobruk by {{units of}} the British 70th Division, the 2/17th Battalion was {{evacuated}} by the sea to Alexandria, and then moved to Palestine, arriving there in mid-October, establishing a camp at Julis. Shortly afterwards, a company was detached from the battalion to undertake guard duties in Broumane, in Syria, and in January 1942 {{the rest of the}} battalion followed. There, they were tasked with undertaking garrison duties as part of the occupation force that had been established there after the Syria–Lebanon campaign, to defend against a possible German attack on the Allied flank through the Caucasus. Relieving the 2/12th Battalion, the battalion established itself around Afrine, north of Aleppo; in March, after the 2nd New Zealand Division arrived, the battalion moved to Latakia.|$|E
