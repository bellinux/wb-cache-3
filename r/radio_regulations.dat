To get needed, radical changes in <b>radio</b> <b>regulation,</b> much more attention should be directed toward central issues of constitutional law.

Asking these questions does not call forth a pre-determined answer, nor is discussion of them within the competence of only a small group of radio technology experts.

The effect of this revision was to eliminate the international requirement that a person demonstrate Morse code proficiency in order to qualify for an amateur radio operator license with transmitting privileges on frequencies below 30MHz.|$|E
25|$|The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is {{the part}} of the United Nations (UN) that manages the use of both the RF Spectrum and space {{satellites}} among nation states. The Plenipotentiary Conference is the top policy-making body of the ITU, meeting every four years in order to set the Union's general policies. The ITU is divided into three Sectors: the Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) determines the technical characteristics and operational procedures for wireless services, and plays a vital role in the Spectrum Management of the radio-frequency; ITU-R Study Group 1 is the Spectrum Management study group; the Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) develops internationally agreed technical and operating standards; and the Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D) fosters the expansion of telecommunications infrastructure in developing nations throughout the world, that make up two-thirds of the ITU’s 191 Member States.

40|$|This chapter {{reflects}} on radio spectrum {{management in the}} United States, {{with the aim of}} identifying useful historical and comparative lessons for European Union policy makers as they contemplate the adoption of pan-European market mechanisms to allocate radio frequencies. It explores the history of American <b>radio</b> <b>regulation</b> and the impact of conflicting interpretations of that history on contemporary policy debates surrounding the liberalization of spectrum markets. The public interest theory of policy making has long been critiqued as inappropriate to spectrum management by economists following the lead of Ronald Coase. But the American experience with <b>radio</b> <b>regulation</b> suggests that economic efficiency, consumer welfare and the promotion of technical innovation are better understood as variants of the public interest, and ought to be weighed against other public interest dimensions of broadcast regulation, including the importance of preserving localism and diversity on the airwaves...|$|R

500|$|When Italian DVB-T {{broadcasting}} {{started in}} December 2010 interference {{was observed in}} northwest parts of Istria, and later in areas around Zadar and Šibenik. The interference {{was caused by the}} use of frequencies assigned to Croatia by Italian transmitters and excessive transmitter power. A complaint was filed by the Croatian regulator of the DVB-T market, the Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM), with the Italian authorities. OIV installed additional transmitters in the affected areas to strengthen its signal coverage and reduce interference by February 2011 at a cost of 1million kuna ( [...] 133,000 euros). Although Italian Minister of Economic Development Paolo Romani announced in August 2011 that the problems should be resolved shortly (a transmitter causing interference was shut down and the power of several others was reduced), the situation was not completely resolved throughout 2011 and the International Telecommunication Union's <b>Radio</b> <b>Regulations</b> Board became involved in the process.

SAR measurement system at 150 MHz satisfying this regulation is necessary accordingly for SAR conformity assessment. The international SAR measurement standard(IEC 62209 - 2) includes the evaluation method on frequencies above 300 MHz, and the commercial SAR measurement system can measure SAR above 300 MHz only. The size of the reference dipole antenna(760 mm, return loss: — 27. 57 dB) and flat phantom (1, 300 mm(L) × 900 mm(W) × 200 mm(H)), targeted SAR values for numerical analysis(1 g: 1. 08 W/kg, 10 g: 0. 77 W/kg) for SAR validation evaluation at 150 MHz frequency are proposed in this paper.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the UK {{community}} radio sector {{has grown from}} a handful of experimental broadcasters to encompass a diverse range of some 200 services. By comparison with other types of broadcast radio in the UK, these services are heavily regulated with a variety of requirements being places upon their structures, inputs, processes and outputs. The process by which community <b>radio</b> <b>regulation</b> was developed has underpinned its subsequent acceptance by the sector. Most importantly, current UK community <b>radio</b> <b>regulation</b> was developed in conjunction with representatives of the sector and the fifteen experimental stations launched in 2001 / 2002. The paper considers the relatively 'light touch' regulation of the country's commercial radio sector {{and the ways in which}} the new 'Third Tier' impacts on existing mainstream providers, in particular the BBC. It also poses the argument that the recent change in direction for BBC Local Radio might place that service at risk as the community stations more fully realise Frank Gillard’s vision for local radio in the 1960 s. There will be an evaluation of the potential threat community radio poses to BBC Local Radio, and asks what, if anything, needs to happen to enable the two to comfortably co-exist.
