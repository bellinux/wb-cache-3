40|$|Grounding Systems (GSs) must {{be tested}} {{periodically}} {{in order to}} maintain the touch <b>voltage</b> and <b>step</b> <b>voltage</b> below a safe value in all the zones of the installation. Measurement of the ground resistance and of the touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> are typically done by the fall-of-potential method, locating the auxiliary current electrode at remote distance to test the effective behavior of the GS. In urban areas, it could be very complicated or impossible to install the auxiliary current electrode as required, not having area around with sufficient accessibility. At this aim, the paper describes a methodology of using multiple current electrodes at short distances modifying the classic fall-of-potential practice, so that the measurements of touch <b>voltage</b> and <b>step</b> <b>voltage</b> result always conservative. The adequacy of a GS is verified if the values of touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages,</b> tested inside and in the vicinity of the GS are below the permissible limits, regardless if they are true or conservatively increased. Thus, the measured touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> by the suggested method, always conservative, allow verifying the adequacy of GSs, in the cases where it is impossible to locate the remote auxiliary electrode...|$|R

We propose an approach to correct the grid, in case some voltage drops violate the threshold condition, by making {{minor changes to the}} original design. Previous work has been done in [1] on the DC {{model of the}} grid and this paper deals with the transient model. Rather than directly reducing the steady state voltage drops below the threshold we work on reducing the first time <b>step</b> <b>voltage</b> drops. The method uses current constraints proposed in [2] to find the first time <b>step</b> <b>voltage</b> drop whose distance to the corresponding threshold is the largest. It then tries to estimate it {{as a function of the}} metal widths on the grid. A non-linear optimization problem is then formulated and the required metal line width changes that reduce the first time <b>step</b> <b>voltage</b> drops by a sufficient amount are then determined. The reduction of the first time <b>step</b> <b>voltage</b> drop by that amount will make the steady state voltage drops of all the nodes less than the threshold...|$|R
40|$|The {{horizontal}} {{electric field}} at the ground surface {{in the vicinity of}} structures hit by lightning flashes is relevant to the safety of human beings and livestock; it determines the touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> around the structure. This paper uses an approximate analytical formula for calculating the horizontal electric field, which was adapted {{to take into account the}} effect of the structure foundation. The input for the calculation is the current waveform at the base of the structure, and the results agree well with those obtained by other authors using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The approximate formula is applied to calculate touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> in the vicinity of a structure and the results show that the use of the direct current (DC) approximation to calculate touch and <b>step</b> <b>voltages</b> may lead to significant errors; especially for fast-rising currents and relatively good-conducting soils.

40|$|With the {{background}} of experience from field investigations in cable networks, multiple pre-strikes and re-ignitions are known to occur during switching operations, causing high frequency, steep fronted transient voltages and currents. Off-shore collection grids consist of vast amount of cables, with different length and connection points, which have low surge impedance compared with overhead lines. Consequently multiple pre-strikes and re-ignitions of switching apparatus with cables can cause transient overvoltages with higher time-derivatives than with overhead lines. The validation test circuits specified in the IEC standards developed for impulses due to fulmination on overhead lines do not consider the conditions of large cable grid and repetitive overvoltages due to switching. With the increase of cable grids and particularly wind parks, it has become important to characterize a collection grid cable system and the related transients during manoeuvres with different switching apparatus. The main contribution of this work is the experimental verification of the transient overvoltage phenomena in cable systems. An attempt is made to characterize this phenomenon in terms of number of re-ignitions, the magnitude and the <b>rate</b> of <b>voltage</b> <b>step...</b>|$|R

When the grounding electrode is installed in two-layer soil structures, the surface layer soil resistivity is different with the resistivity of the soil contacted with the grounding electrodes.
