40|$|ASEE 2009 Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) provides the helicopter designer with an analysis tool capable of evaluating complex <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> <b>aerodynamics.</b> There {{is a wide}} range of turbulence models developed to simulate the viscous turbulent aerodynamics flow, however, more accurately and efficiently modeling turbulence is still a challenge in today’s CFD research and applications. Turbulent transport processes are strongly problem-dependent, which can only give an approximate description with a particular set of empirical constants for a certain range of flows. It is also reported that the same turbulence model predict very different results in different commercial CFD codes. Therefore, the development and application of turbulent models rely on experimental data for validation. In this project, three turbulence models, which are K-ε, K-ω and Reynolds Stress Transport turbulence models are tested and validated in the state-of-art CFD code STAR-CCM+ by simulating the turbulent flow over an N. A. C. A. 23012 airfoil with an N. A. C. A. 23012 external-airfoil flap. The predicted results are compared with wind tunnel data for flow over the airfoil with an external-airfoil flap at different attack angle and flap deflections...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the works performed by RMIT University as contractually agreed with StopRotor Unmanned Aircraft Systems Pty Ltd (project code: 0200314150). This {{is the second}} report {{of a series of}} three planned deliverables and it details the rotary-wing 6 -DOF analytical development and the technical preparation activities performed to carry out, in the subsequent phases of the program, experimental research work in the RMIT industrial wind tunnel and in flight. A suitable form of the aircraft 6 DOF model is presented that will be used as a basis {{for the development of a}} complete rotary wing 6 DOF model for the StopRotor aircraft. The derivatives and coefficients are to be acquired using various engineering methods including: analytical tools, wind tunnel experiments (utilizing the RMIT industrial Wind Tunnel) and experimental flight test. In addition to the 6 DOF model for fixed-wing configuration presented in report 1, this report presents preliminary analysis of the main performance parameters relevant to the rotary wing flight phase. Due to the complexity of the full experimental aerodynamic analysis of the StopRotor in its rotary wing configuration, some derivatives will be approximated using the engineering methodologies presented in this report and others will be taken from the wind tunnel experiments. Wind tunnel experiments are more complex than those of the fixed wing configuration. This is mainly due to the <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> <b>aerodynamics</b> and the fluids interaction to the surrounding environment. In this case the StopRotor is situated inside a closed wind tunnel. The floor and walls surrounding the StopRotor will significantly influence the flow. As this is a common problem with wind tunnel testing of rotary wing aircraft, suitable correction factors can be applied to account for the influence of these items as described in the report...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The {{unsteady aerodynamic forces}} and moments of an oscillating airfoil for the fixed wing case were determined by Theodorsen along {{with the development of}} a lift deficiency function. Loewy subsequently developed an analogous lift deficiency function for the <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> case in which there are an infinite number of layers of shed vorticity, or wakes, below the reference airfoil. With the advent of computer panel codes that calculate the time histories of the wakes generated by oscillating airfoils, a theory is developed for the <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> case in which there are a finite number of layers of shed vorticity below the reference airfoil. This theory includes a lift deficiency function that is completely analogous to Loewy and Theodorsen. It has long been recognized that an airfoil oscillating in pure plunge produces a propulsive force (Katzmayr effect). Garrick used Theodorsen's work to develop equations for the propulsive force that include the lift deficiency function as a parameter. When either Loewy's lift deficiency function or the finite wake lift deficiency function is used, the effect of the propulsive force is greatly enhanced with the proper phase relationship of the wakes. The finite wake theory along with Garrick's work is used to describe the performance characteristics of Higher Harmonic Control. Specifically for the OH- 6 A, coupled pitch-plunge motion results in a propulsive force that significantly reduces the rotor drag force.

40|$|New {{computational}} tools {{associated with}} new numerical and experimental methods have mainly improved {{the understanding of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> <b>aerodynamics</b> resulting in better performances. Nevertheless some challenging problems remain to be solved with more accuracy. So are the precise prediction of the wake structure, the formation and shedding of tip vortices from blades, and {{the features of the}} flow close and around the blade. Concerning new experimental methods, the non-intrusive nature of the Laser Doppler Velocimetry has allowed many experimental works around and in the wake of rotating blades. Recently, velocity profiles measured around and in the boundary layer of a blade began to appear in the literature. As the techniques seems to be got under control in the case of axisymmetric flow, some effort remains to be paid in the case of phase dependent rotating flow. Particularly, the knowledge of the velocity field around the blade of a helicopter rotor in forward flight is of prime interest for qualitative and quantitative purposes. The experimental method presented here has tackled this challenge. In fact, the present paper concerns a new approach of forces (lift and drag) measurement, acting on the profile of a rotor helicopter blade in forward flight. The method is based {{on the use of the}} momentum equation in which all terms are expressed by means of the velocity field measured by a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) technique. The 3 D velocity field has been determined upstream, downstream and around a blade profile by means of a long focal length LDV. The experiments, conducted in a large close section wind tunnel (see Figure 1) on a helicopter rotor model in forward flight (μ = 0. 20), have been realized for a radial position r/R = 0. 70 of the blade located in the advancing and retreating zones (respectively at Ψ b = 90 deg and 270 deg). On a basic point of view, the section of the blade is considered as a fixed ptofile in a fictitious 2 D flow where the momentum equation is applied with success to evaluate the lift and drag forces. ...|$|E

With the wings flapping, produced thrust makes the wings rotation. Furthermore, lift force from <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> increases and overcomes the MAV weight. On {{the basis of}} this principle, a mechanical model is made and sample experiments of averaged lift measurement in different wing length and area and angle of attack are executed.
