5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers developed {{some of the}} earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion.</b> Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E

However, analogies based on simple <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion</b> are inaccurate, as the Higgs field does not work by resisting motion.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} the applied load is carried by {{pressure}} generated within the fluid due to the frictional viscous <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion</b> of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces. Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, metal or other components can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or failure.|$|E

5000|$|A {{frequently}} cited example of uniform acceleration {{is that of}} an object in free fall in a uniform gravitational field.

25|$|Because {{wind-powered}} vehicles typically sail at {{apparent wind}} angles {{aligned with the}} leading edge of the sail, the sail acts as an airfoil and lift is the predominant component of propulsion. Low forward <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion,</b> high speeds over the surface, and high lateral resistance help create high apparent wind speeds—with closer alignment of the apparent wind to the course traveled for most points of sail—and allow wind-powered vehicles to achieve higher speeds than conventional sailing craft.|$|E

6000|$|... 192 Professor Bain (Logic, ii., 13) {{mentions}} two empirical laws, which [...] {{he considers}} to be, {{with the exception}} of the law connecting Gravity [...] with <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion,</b> “the two most widely operating laws as [...] yet discovered whereby two distinct properties are conjoined [...] throughout substances generally.” The first is, “a law connecting [...] Atomic Weight and Specific Heat by an inverse proportion. For equal [...] weights of the simple bodies, the atomic weight multiplied by a [...] number expressing the specific heat, gives a nearly uniform product. [...] The products, for all the elements, are near the constant number 6.” [...] The other is a law which obtains “between the specific gravity of [...] substances in the gaseous state, and the atomic weights. The [...] relationship of the two numbers is in some instances equality; in [...] other instances the one is a multiple of the other.” ...|$|E

30|$|The energy load {{computed}} {{this way}} underestimates the energy actually applied cyclically {{as it does}} not account for the pressure spent for gas movement, the surface tension forces and tissue <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion.</b> The static energy, after the first application of PEEP, does not imply any further energy load to the respiratory system. During ventilation, the cyclic load to the lung parenchyma is only due to the dynamic energy, although the total energy in the system includes both its static and dynamic components.|$|R
60|$|The {{prevailing}} {{hypothesis of}} a luminiferous ether, {{in other respects}} not without analogy to that of Descartes, is not in its own nature entirely {{cut off from the}} possibility of direct evidence in its favor. It is well known that the difference between the calculated and the observed times of the periodical return of Encke’s comet, has led to a conjecture that a medium capable of opposing <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion</b> is diffused through space. If this surmise should be confirmed, in the course of ages, by the gradual accumulation of a similar variance {{in the case of the}} other bodies of the solar system, the luminiferous ether would have made a considerable advance toward the character of a vera causa, since the existence would have been ascertained of a great cosmical agent, possessing some of the attributes which the hypothesis assumes; though there would still remain many difficulties, and the identification of the ether with the resisting medium would even, I imagine, give rise to new ones. At present, however, this supposition can not be looked upon as more than a conjecture; the existence of the ether still rests on the possibility of deducing from its assumed laws a considerable number of actual phenomena; and this evidence I can not regard as conclusive, because we can not have, in the case of such an hypothesis, the assurance that if the hypothesis be false it must lead to results at variance with the true facts.|$|E

5000|$|Guillaume Amontons (31 August 1663 - 11 October 1705) was a French {{scientific}} instrument inventor and physicist. He {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} in studying the problem of friction, that is the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion</b> where bodies are in contact.|$|E
5000|$|A volume Nautical and Hydraulic Experiments with Numerous Scientific Miscellanies was {{published}} posthumously {{by his son}} Henry in 1834 (one volume only, called Volume I). Beaufoy also made astronomical observations and advocated other ideas like rifles in the militia and schemes for reaching the North Pole. This volume challenged the existing orthodoxy that the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion</b> of a vessel was in proportion to her displacement. Chapman had challenged this earlier (1775), but Beaufoy's work was taken up by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the [...] "square-cube" [...] law. Simply put, if a vessel is doubled in size the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion</b> quadruples, but the size of engines and the carrying capacity (fuel, cargo) increase eight-fold.|$|E

50|$|Gravity {{separation}} is {{the separation of}} two or more minerals of different specific gravity by their relative movement in response to the force of gravity and one or more other forces (such as centrifugal forces, magnetic forces, buoyant forces), one of which is <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>motion</b> (drag force) by a viscous medium such as heavy media, water or, less commonly, air.|$|E

40|$|CIVINSThis work {{seeks to}} {{determine}} {{the evolution of the}} indentation and fatigue response of heat-treated Nickel-Titanium shape memory alloys over a range of precipitate sizes and surface normal orientations. Various tests were used {{to determine the}} impact of aging treatments on particle size, coherence, and phase transition temperatures. Through instrumented sharp microindentation and cyclic compression testing, the varying mechanical response of the NITI materials given different aging treatments was determined. Small precipitate sizes were found to strongly resist dislocation motion and the martensitic transformation. Intermediate precipitate sizes had lower <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> both mechanisms. For the larger precipitates, the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> dislocation <b>motion</b> continued <b>to</b> lessen, while the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> martensitic transformation increased. During indentation, the 100 orientation tended to exhibit the greatest <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> dislocation <b>motion,</b> while 221 showed the least. An orientation dependence of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> transformation was not obvious in the indentation tests. Cyclic compression tests showed that orientation and heat treatment combinations that resisted dislocation motion while allowing martensitic transformation showed the least residual strain accumulation and cyclic degradation.
