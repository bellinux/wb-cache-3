25|$|The Titan II had {{debuted in}} 1962 as the Air Force's second-generation ICBM {{to replace the}} Atlas. By using hypergolic fuels, it could be stored {{for long periods of}} time and be easily readied for launch in {{addition}} to being a simpler design with fewer components, the only caveat being that the propellant mix (nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine) was extremely toxic compared to the Atlas's liquid oxygen/RP-1. However, the Titan had considerable difficulty being man-rated due to early problems with pogo oscillation. The launch vehicle used a <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> that was unique to launches from Cape Kennedy.|$|E

500|$|After {{receiving}} his doctorate, Shea took {{a position}} at Bell Labs in Whippany, New Jersey. [...] There he first worked as systems engineer on the <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and then as the development and program manager on the inertial guidance system of the Titan II ICBM. Shea's specialty was systems engineering, {{a new type of}} engineering developed in the 1950s that focused on the management and integration of large-scale projects, turning the work of engineers and contractors into one functioning whole. He {{played a significant role in}} the Titan I project; as George Mueller writes, [...] "e contributed a considerable amount of engineering innovation and project management skill and was directly responsible for the successful development of this pioneering guidance system." [...] In addition to Shea's technical abilities, it quickly became obvious that he was also an excellent manager of people. Known for his quick intellect, he also endeared himself to his subordinates through small eccentricities such as his fondness for bad puns and habit of wearing red socks to important meetings. During the critical days of the Titan project Shea moved into the plant, sleeping on a cot in his office so as to be available at all hours if he was needed.|$|E
500|$|In {{parallel}} to the ICBM programme, the United States developed three separate intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) systems. On 8 November 1955, Wilson approved IRBM projects by both the United States Army and the United States Air Force (USAF). The United States National Security Council gave the ICBM and IRBM projects the highest national priority. The Army Ballistic Missile Agency, commanded by Major General John B. Medaris, with Wernher von Braun as its technical director, developed the Jupiter (SM-78) IRBM. After three failures, its first successful flight {{took place at the}} Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on 31 May 1957. The United States Navy initially participated in the Jupiter programme, intending to launch the missiles from ships, but in view of their size, decided instead to develop [...] a smaller, solid-propellant IRBM that could be launched from a submarine, which became Polaris. Despite reluctance on the part of Major General Bernard Schriever, the commander of the USAF Western Development Division, to take on IRBM development, and a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for missiles among senior USAF [...] officers, who preferred manned bombers, the rival USAF project moved quickly. The Douglas Aircraft Company was awarded the contract {{for the development of the}} missile, which was codenamed Thor (SM-75), in December 1955. Rocketdyne, Ramo-Wooldridge, AC Spark Plug, Bell Laboratories and General Electric were engaged as the subcontractors for the rocket engine, technical coordination, inertial guidance system, <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system,</b> and re-entry vehicle respectively. The first missile was delivered to Patrick Air Force Base on 26 October 1956. After four unsuccessful attempts, the first successful test flight took place on 20 September 1957.|$|E

50|$|The Enzian (named for a genus of {{mountain}} flower, in English the Gentian) was a German WWII surface-to-air anti-aircraft missile {{that was the}} first to use a <b>radio</b> controlled <b>guidance</b> <b>system.</b> During the missile's development in the late stages of the war it was plagued by organisational problems and was cancelled before becoming operational.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} World War II missile <b>guidance</b> <b>systems</b> were {{crude and}} unreliable. Rapid {{advances}} in electronics, sensors, radar and <b>radio</b> communications enabled <b>guidance</b> <b>systems</b> to become more sophisticated and more reliable. <b>Guidance</b> <b>systems</b> improved or introduced after the war included radio command, TV, inertial, astro navigation, various radar modes and, for some short-range missiles, control wires. Later, laser designators manually aimed at the target came into use.|$|R

50|$|In 1941 he and {{the actress}} Hedy Lamarr {{developed}} a <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> for Allied torpedoes that used a code (stored on a punched paper tape) to synchronise random frequencies, referred to as frequency hopping, with a receiver and transmitter.

5000|$|The basic Javelin missile {{body was}} {{retained}} in the upgraded Javelin S15, which replaced the original's <b>radio</b> command <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> with a semi-automatic laser system.

50|$|The first {{missiles}} {{to be used}} operationally were a series of missiles developed by Nazi Germany in World War II. Most famous of these are the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket, both of which used a simple mechanical autopilot to keep the missile flying along a pre-chosen route. Less well known were a series of anti-shipping and anti-aircraft missiles, typically based on a simple <b>radio</b> control (command <b>guidance)</b> <b>system</b> directed by the operator. However, these early systems in World War II were only built in small numbers.|$|R

The {{plan was to}} replace Delta with other rocket designs when they came on-line. From this point onward, the launch vehicle family was split into civilian variants flown from Cape Canaveral which bore the Delta name and military variants flown from Vandenberg Air Force Base which used the more warlike Thor name. The Delta design emphasized reliability rather than performance by replacing components which had caused problems on earlier Thor flights, in particular the trouble-prone AC Spark Plug inertial guidance package which {{was replaced by a}} <b>radio</b> ground <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> mounted to the second stage rather than the Thor itself. NASA made the original Delta contract to the Douglas Aircraft Company in April 1959 for 12 vehicles of this design: ...|$|R
500|$|Joseph Francis Shea (September 5, 1925 [...] February 14, 1999) was an American {{aerospace}} engineer and NASA manager.

After working for Bell Labs on the <b>radio</b> inertial <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile, {{he was hired}} by NASA in 1961. As Deputy Director of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, and later as head of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, Shea {{played a key role in}} shaping the course of the Apollo program, helping to lead NASA to the decision in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous and supporting [...] "all up" [...] testing of the Saturn V rocket. While sometimes causing controversy within the agency, Shea was remembered by his former colleague George Mueller as [...] "one of the greatest systems engineers of our time".|$|R
50|$|The pair of {{deployed}} German guided air-delivered ordnance designs, the Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293, both {{used the}} Kehl-Straßburg <b>radio</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> for control. However, the British {{proved to be}} able to develop countermeasures to interfere with the Germans' use of the Kehl-Straßburg ordnance guidance system, rushed projects were started in 1944 in order to develop alternatives. The first system to be modified in this fashion was the Henschel Hs 293B anti-ship missile. Other examples included the X-4 air-to-air missile, and the X-7 anti-tank version of the X-4.|$|E

5000|$|On 30 November 1955, three {{companies}} were given one week {{to bid on}} the project: Douglas, Lockheed, and North American Aviation.They were asked to create [...] "a management team that could pull together existing technology, skills, abilities, and techniques in 'an unprecedented time.'" [...] On 27 December 1955 Douglas was awarded the prime contract for the airframe andintegration.

50|$|The JB-2 {{was used}} for {{development}} of missile guidance control and seeker systems, testing of telemetering and optical tracking facilities, and as a target for new surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles (ironically fulfilling the former V1's covername, Flakzielgerät — anti-aircraft target device). The JB-2 project used the North American Aviation NATIV (North American Test Instrument Vehicle) Blockhouse and two launch ramps at Holloman: a 400 ft, two-rail ramp on a 3° earth-filled slope, and a 40 ft trailer ramp.
