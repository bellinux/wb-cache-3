40|$|AbstractIn art. 1824 - 1835, the new Civil Code institutes {{a series}} of {{particular}} rules {{in the matter of}} <b>renting</b> <b>dwellings,</b> rules that apply mainly to renting spaces destined to the practice of a professional's activity. Among these we mention the dispositions regarding the termination of the agreement (art. 1824 - 1825), the unwritten clauses (art. 1826), vices that threaten the body health or integrity (art. 1827) or the right to preference when renting (art. 1828). We consider the analysis of these dispositions useful all the more so as the regulation of the new Civil Code in the matter of <b>renting</b> <b>dwellings</b> is not singular. That is why in this study we also aim at referring to the stipulations contained in Law no. 114 / 1996 regarding dwellings and to the O. U. G. no. 40 / 1999 regarding the tenants’ protection and setting the rental price for the spaces destined as dwellings, as main normative documents that, together with the new Civil Code, regulate the rental of dwellings...|$|R

The 1618 population level was once again reached in 1684. Thereafter, the population ﬁgures kept rising. No records of Roßbach’s population from the 17th century are available. In 1885 - only “present” persons were counted, while soldiers and the wandering musicians for which the region was then famous were left out of the total - there were 471 inhabitants (95 houses, no <b>rented</b> <b>dwellings,</b> no multi-family houses with separated living areas; occupancy per dwelling 4.95 persons).

In 1905, after the Kuhbrücke had been transferred to Wolfstein, there were 489 inhabitants. In 1918 there were 466 in 100 dwellings. In 1925, there were 504 in 98 houses.
