Most oceanographic instruments on the seafloor have no connections with the surface and therefore have to run on batteries and store data until recovery. To demonstrate a developing technology, sensors and acoustic modems were powered with energy harvested from the seafloor, and data were relayed acoustically in near–real time to the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) observatory in Monterey Bay, California, and to surface research vessels. MARS is a cabled observatory in deep water (~ 890 m) at the edge of Monterey Canyon. An acoustic modem was attached to the MARS node and configured to send out commands to, and relay data received from, <b>remote</b> <b>modems.</b> Two benthic microbial fuel cells (BMFCs) positioned approximately 0. 5 km away from MARS supplied power to the <b>remote</b> <b>modems</b> and sensors. At their peak performance, these BMFCs produced continuous power densities of ~ 35 mW m⁻² (footprint area). The modems utilized in this study contained an integrated power management platform (PMP) designed to manage and store the electrical energy generated by each BMFC and to record BMFC performance parameters and sensor data on an hourly basis. Temperature and either oxygen or conductivity sensors were chosen because of their common use and environmental relevance. Acoustically transmitted data records show that the BMFCs renewed energy stores and that the oceanographic sensors measured dissolved oxygen, temperature, and conductivity reliably throughout the operational life of each BMFC system (~ 6 months). These systems remained in place for more than 12 months...|$|R

50|$|ULN avoided this delay by always {{negotiating}} the link at 2400 bit/s with no error-correction turned on. Although this eliminated compatibility with older 1200 bit/s modems, {{by this point}} in time they were extremely rare. Once the connection was made, which occurred quickly, both modems sent a small identification string to the <b>remote</b> <b>modem.</b> Both modems then examined the string and selected the fastest common mode. The caller then re-negotiated once at that higher speed.|$|E
50|$|Microcom's {{idea was}} to move the file-transfer {{protocol}} out of the host computer {{and place it in}} the modem instead. In doing so, all data being transferred would be error corrected, not just file transfers. This also meant that devices with no processor, like dumb terminals, could enjoy an error-free link. After connection to the <b>remote</b> <b>modem,</b> Microcom modems played a special tone into the line and listened for a response; if a proper tone was received in reply, the modems entered their error-correcting state.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the Bulletin Board System (BBS), modems typically operated on direct-dial telephone lines that always began and ended with a known modem at each end. The modems operated in either [...] "originate" [...] or [...] "answer" [...] modes, manually switching between two sets of frequencies for data transfer. Generally, the user placing the call would switch their modem to [...] "originate" [...] and then dial the number by hand. When the <b>remote</b> <b>modem</b> answered, already set to [...] "answer" [...] mode, the telephone handset was switched off and communications continued until the caller manually disconnected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{development of}} adaptive filter algorithm for an Underwater Acoustic Telemetry (UWAT) system for {{communication between the}} off- shore underwater device (UD) and on-shore communication system. In this system, FSK modulation and de-modulation techniques are used with centre frequency of 38 KHz with baud rate of 300 Hz. Adaptive filter algorithm has been developed to compensate the distortion introduced due to multipath in under water communication. It has been shown experimentally that received signal has been perfectly demodulated after compensating it by adaptive filter algorithm. This demodulated signal is useful for identifying the commands correctly from the transmitter. The applications of this system can be extended to command and control the activities of underwater data acquisition devices.

5000|$|Data Carrier Detect, {{abbreviated}} as DCD, or alternately Carrier Detect abbreviated as CD, is {{a control}} signal present inside an RS-232 serial communications cable that goes between {{a computer and}} another device, such as a modem. This signal is a simple [...] "high/low" [...] status bit that is sent [...] "from DCE to DTE", or in a typical scenario, from the peripheral to the computer. It is present on virtually all PC serial ports - pin 1 of a nine-pin (DE9) serial port, or pin 8 over a 25-pin (DB25) port. Its purpose varies depending on the device connected, but the most typical meaning is to indicate when a modem is connected to another <b>remote</b> <b>modem</b> via telephone lines.|$|E
5000|$|The TrailBlazer {{addressed}} this problem through a technique known as [...] "protocol spoofing". When the local computer sent a packet to the modem for transmission, the modem's controller immediately sent an ACK message, generated locally. This fooled the computer into thinking the packet had already reached the far end, prompting it to send another packet. The error correction normally being {{applied in the}} protocol was instead handled using a proprietary replacement protocol operating {{on top of the}} MNP protocols to talk to the <b>remote</b> <b>modem.</b> In general, spoofing worked well with any protocol that used small packets, and thus generated lots of ACK messages; the TrailBlazers initially supported UUCP, and support for XModem and Kermit followed.|$|E
50|$|By default, when a modem {{is powered}} up, the DCD signal is de{{asserted}}. It is not asserted until the modem either makes an outgoing call, or answers an incoming call, and then connects with a data modem {{on the other}} end. The signal is asserted {{at the same time}} the modem reports its CONNECT message, and stays asserted until the call is disconnected (either intentionally or because of a fault in the line). DCD is deasserted once the local modem is no longer receiving carrier from the <b>remote</b> <b>modem,</b> regardless of which side initiated the disconnect. So long as the DCD signal is high, the computer can assume that any data coming from the modem was sent from the remote side.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} the {{availability}} and quality of open source device drivers were issues for Linux desktops. Particular areas which were lacking drivers included printers as well as wireless and audio cards. For example, in early 2007, Dell did not sell specific hardware and software with Ubuntu 7.04 computers, including printers, projectors, Bluetooth keyboards and mice, TV tuners and <b>remote</b> controls, desktop <b>modems</b> and Blu-ray disc drives, due to incompatibilities at that time, as well as legal issues.|$|R

The Creator Server extension allowed for a system administrator to update book and page content on any client machine across a LAN or to <b>remote</b> machines via <b>modem</b> dial up.|$|R
5000|$|Pfeiffer {{also made}} several major (and some minor) {{acquisition}}s. In 1997, Compaq bought Tandem Computers, {{known for their}} NonStop server line. This acquisition instantly gave Compaq {{a presence in the}} higher end business computing market. Minor acquisitions centered around building a networking arm and included NetWorth (1998) based in Irving, Texas and Thomas-Conrad (1998) based in Austin, Texas. [...] In 1997 Microcom was also acquired, based in Norwood, MA, which brought a line of <b>modems,</b> <b>Remote</b> Access Servers (RAS) and the popular Carbon Copy software.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} telecommunications, echo is {{the display}} or return of sent data at {{or to the}} sending end of a transmission. Echo can be either local echo, where the sending device itself displays the sent data, or remote echo, where the receiving device returns the sent data that it receives to the sender (which is of course simply no local echo {{from the point of}} view of the sending device itself). That latter, when used as a form of error detection to determine that data received at the remote end of a communications line are the same as data sent, is also known as echoplex, echo check, or loop check. When two modems are communicating in echoplex mode, for example, the <b>remote</b> <b>modem</b> echoes whatever it receives from the local modem.|$|E
5000|$|Local {{telephone}} lines {{use the same}} wires to send and receive data, which results in {{a small amount of}} the outgoing signal being reflected back. This is useful for people talking on the phone, as it provides a signal to the speaker that their voice is making it through the system. However, this reflected signal causes problems for the modem, which is unable to distinguish between a signal from the <b>remote</b> <b>modem</b> and the echo of its own signal. This was why earlier modems split the signal frequencies into [...] "answer" [...] and [...] "originate"; the modem could then ignore any signals in the frequency range it was using for transmission. Even with improvements to the phone system allowing higher speeds, this splitting of available phone signal bandwidth still imposed a half-speed limit on modems.|$|E
50|$|A common {{feature of}} these {{high-speed}} modems was {{the concept of}} fallback, or speed hunting, allowing them to communicate with less-capable modems. During the call initiation, the modem would transmit a series of signals {{and wait for the}} <b>remote</b> <b>modem</b> to respond. They would start at high speeds and get progressively slower until there was a response. Thus, two USR modems would be able to connect at 9,600 bit/s, but, when a user with a 2,400 bit/s modem called in, the USR would fall back to the common 2,400 bit/s speed. This would also happen if a V.32 modem and a HST modem were connected. Because they used a different standard at 9,600 bit/s, they would fall back to their highest commonly supported standard at 2,400 bit/s. The same applies to V.32bis and 14,400 bit/s HST modem, which would still be able {{to communicate with each other}} at 2,400 bit/s.|$|E
5000|$|... 3270 {{devices are}} clustered, {{with one or}} more {{displays}} or printers connected to a control unit (the 3275 and 3276 included an integrated control unit). Originally devices were connected to the control unit over coaxial cable; later token ring, twisted pair, or Ethernet connections were available. A local control unit attaches directly to the channel of a nearby mainframe. A remote control unit is connected to a communications line by a <b>modem.</b> <b>Remote</b> 3270 controllers are frequently multi-dropped, with multiple control units on a line.|$|R
5000|$|When a modem is in data mode, any {{characters}} sent to {{the modem}} are intended to be transmitted to the <b>remote</b> party. The <b>modem</b> enters data mode immediately after it makes a connection. For example, if ATDT5551212 resulted in a phone call that was answered by another computer modem, the modem would report the word [...] "CONNECT" [...] and then switch to data mode. Any further characters received over the serial link are deemed {{to be from the}} remote party, and any characters sent are transmitted to the remote party.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to shells running on local systems, {{there are different}} ways to make remote systems available to local users; such approaches are usually referred to as remote access or remote administration.

50|$|All three subcultures have {{relations}} to hardware modifications. In {{the early days}} of network hacking, phreaks were building blue boxes and various variants. The programmer subculture of hackers has stories about several hardware hacks in its folklore, such as a mysterious 'magic' switch attached to a PDP-10 computer in MIT's AI lab, that, when turned off, crashed the computer. The early hobbyist hackers built their home computers themselves, from construction kits. However, all these activities have died out during the 1980s, when the phone network switched to digitally controlled switchboards, causing network hacking to shift to dialing <b>remote</b> computers with <b>modems,</b> when pre-assembled inexpensive home computers were available, and when academic institutions started to give individual mass-produced workstation computers to scientists instead of using a central timesharing system.

5000|$|RSTS uses {{a serial}} {{communication}} connection {{to interact with}} the operator.

As many as 128 terminals (using multi-terminal service) could connect to a RSTS system, running under a maximum of 63 jobs (depending on the processor being used, the amount of memory and disk space, and the system load). Most RSTS systems had nowhere near that many terminals. Users could also submit jobs to be run in batch mode.

The proposed control system design will help to control system over a mobile using DTMF technique with microcontroller [3]. It is possible to change the control in real time using the algorithms. This will help to reduce the cost, size and human efforts helping the increase the efficiency and productivity of the system [4]. The proposed system also measures the speed and voltage.

40|$|In {{plants of}} the chemical, nuclear and {{off-shore}} industry, application specific high-alloyed steels {{are used for}} pipe fittings. Mixing of different steel grades can lead to corrosion with severe consequential damages. Growing quality requirements and environmental responsibilities demand a 100 per cent material control {{in the production of}} the pipe fittings. Therefore, LIFT, an automatic inspection machine, was developed to insure against any mix of material grades. LIFT is able to identify more than 30 different steel grades. The inspection method is based on Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometry (LIBS). An expert system, which can be easily trained and recalibrated, was developed for the data evaluation. The result of the material inspection is transferred to an external handling system via PLC interface. The duration of the inspection process is 2 seconds. The graphical user interface was developed with respect to the requirements of an unskilled operator. The software is based on a realtime operating system and provides a safe and reliable operation. An interface for the <b>remote</b> maintenance by <b>modem</b> enables a fast operational support. Logged data are retrieved and evaluated.

5000|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{attempt to}} plant a backdoor in the Linux kernel, exposed in November 2003, added a small and subtle code change by subverting the revision control system. In this case, a two-line change appeared to check root access permissions of a caller to the sys_wait4 function, but because it used assignment [...] instead of equality checking , it actually granted permissions to the system. This difference is easily overlooked, and could even be interpreted as an accidental typographical error, rather than an intentional attack.In January 2014, a backdoor was discovered in certain Samsung Android products, like the Galaxy devices. The Samsung proprietary Android versions are fitted with a backdoor that provides remote access to the data stored on the device. In particular, the Samsung Android software that {{is in charge of}} handling the communications with the modem, using the Samsung IPC protocol, implements a class of requests known as remote file server (RFS) commands, that allows the backdoor operator to perform via <b>modem</b> <b>remote</b> I/O operations on the device hard disk or other storage. As the modem is running Samsung proprietary Android software, it is likely that it offers over-the-air remote control that could then be used to issue the RFS commands and thus to access the file system on the device.|$|R
