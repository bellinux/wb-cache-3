40|$|Large-volume caldera-forming eruptions of silicic magmas are an {{important}} feature of continental volcanism. The timescales and mechanisms of assembly of the magma reservoirs that feed such eruptions {{as well as the}} durations and physical conditions of upper-crustal storage remain highly debated topics in volcanology. Here we explore a comprehensive data set of isotopic (O, Hf) and chemical proxies in precisely U-Pb dated zircon crystals from all caldera-forming eruptions of Yellowstone supervolcano. Analysed zircons record rapid assembly of multiple magma reservoirs by repeated injections of isotopically heterogeneous magma batches and short pre-eruption storage times of 103 to 104 years. Decoupled oxygen-hafnium isotope systematics suggest a complex source for these magmas involving variable amounts of differentiated mantle-derived melt, Archean crust and hydrothermally altered shallow-crustal rocks. These data demonstrate that complex magma reservoirs with multiple sub-chambers are a common feature of rift- and hotspot related supervolcanoes. The short duration of <b>reservoir</b> <b>assembly</b> documents rapid crustal remelting and two to three orders of magnitude higher magma production rates beneath Yellowstone compared to continental arc volcanoes. The short pre-eruption storage times further suggest that the detection of voluminous reservoirs of eruptible magma beneath active supervolcanoes may only be possible prior to an impending eruption...|$|E
40|$|Magma {{reservoirs}} {{are thought}} to grow relatively slowly, assembling incrementally under volatile-saturated conditions. Eruptions may be triggered by injections of volatile-rich melt, or generation of over-pressure due to protracted crystallization. Here, we analyse fluorine, chlorine and water in apatite crystals trapped {{at different stages of}} magma evolution, and in melt inclusions from clinopyroxene and biotite crystals expelled during an explosive eruption of the Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy, about 4, 000 years ago. We combine our geochemical analyses with thermodynamic modelling to reconstruct the evolution of magmatic volatile contents leading up to the explosive eruption. We find that the magma reservoir remained persistently water undersaturated throughout most of its lifetime. Even crystals in contact with the melt shortly before eruption show that the magma was volatile-undersaturated. Our models suggest that the melt reached volatile saturation at low temperatures, just before eruption. We suggest that late-stage volatile saturation probably triggered the eruption, and conclude that ‘priming’ of the magma system for eruption may occur on timescales much shorter than the decadal to centennial timescales thought typical for magma <b>reservoir</b> <b>assembly.</b> Thus, surface deformation pulses that record magma assembly at depth beneath Campi Flegrei and other similar magmatic systems may not be immediately followed by an eruption; and explosive eruptions may begin with little warning...|$|E
40|$|Veggie {{is a small}} {{plant growth}} chamber {{designed}} and built by ORBITEC that will fly to the International Space Station on SpaceX- 3, scheduled for the summer of 2013. Ultimately Veggie {{will be used for}} research, education and outreach, and crew recreation. We want to demonstrate the functionality of this hardware by testing a scenario that could allow the crew to grow and consume fresh vegetables. Veggie will be collapsed and transported flat in a cargo transfer bag, and deployed on orbit, where it will be installed in an EXPRESS rack. The chamber consists of three subsystems: an LED light cap, a transparent bellows, and a root mat <b>reservoir</b> <b>assembly.</b> The bellows and flexible support arms allow the distance between plants and light cap to be adjusted for different ages and types of plants. Researchers at Kennedy Space Center and ORBITEC have been working to develop the plant growth interfaces for the proof of concept flight. We have developed a rooting pillow, consisting of a small bag containing media, time release fertilizer, seeds, and a wicking surface to conduct water from the root mat reservoir. Prototype pillows have been tested and results have influenced the design of flight pillows, which will be modified for microgravity from flight-approved materials. Several studies have been conducted selecting species and comparing media types in analog systems. Water content seems {{to be the most important}} factor differentiating media types in these small growth volumes (100 mL). Media type also influenced microbial levels on plants. Since produce sanitizing agents are not currently approved for growing food crops on orbit, plants and media types having very low microbial levels are being selected. Lettuce, mizuna, and other salad greens typically have microbial counts less than 10 (exp 4) colony forming units and thus are good candidates for spaceflight. As we approach flight verification testing, we will finalize species, media selection, harvesting, and microbial sampling procedures. Next steps include testing of Veggie flight and ground hardware and associated equipment. This research was funded by NASA...|$|E
50|$|Flashed getter - The getter {{material}} is held inactive in a <b>reservoir</b> during <b>assembly,</b> then heated and evaporated after initial evacuation, usually by induction heating. The vaporized getter, usually a volatile metal, instantly reacts with any residual gas, then condenses {{on the cool}} walls of the tube in a thin coating, the getter spot or getter mirror, which continues to absorb gas.

Bankell Reservoir is situated to the North of Craigmaddie <b>Reservoir.</b> During the <b>assembly</b> {{of the new}} {{water treatment}} facilities, both the Mugdock and Craigmaddie reservoirs were drained in 2005 and 2006 respectively to facilitate the laying of pipes {{to and from the}} plant, and the resultant scene from Craigmaddie reservoir can be seen above. Special consideration had to be taken for the draining of the reservoirs, as they had never been drained in 150 years of operation.|$|R
40|$|The {{geological}} record contains {{evidence of}} volcanic eruptions that {{were as much}} as two orders of magnitude larger than the most voluminous eruption experienced by modern civilizations, the A. D. 1815 Tambora (Indonesia) eruption. Perhaps nowhere on Earth are deposits of such supereruptions more prominent than in the Snake River Plain–Yellowstone Plateau (SRP-YP) volcanic province (northwest United States). While magmatic activity at Yellowstone is still ongoing, the Heise volcanic field in eastern Idaho represents the youngest complete caldera cycle in the SRP-YP, and thus is particularly instructive for current and future volcanic activity at Yellowstone. The Heise caldera cycle culminated 4. 5 Ma ago in the eruption of the ∼ 1800 km 3 Kilgore Tuff. Accessory zircons in the Kilgore Tuff display significant intercrystalline and intracrystalline oxygen isotopic heterogeneity, and the vast majority are 18 O depleted. This suggests that zircons crystallized from isotopically distinct magma batches that were generated by remelting of subcaldera silicic rocks previously altered by low-δ 18 O meteoric-hydrothermal fluids. Prior to eruption these magma batches were assembled and homogenized into a single voluminous reservoir. U-Pb geochronology of isotopically diverse zircons using chemical abrasion–isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry yielded indistinguishable crystallization ages with a weighted mean 206 Pb/ 238 U date of 4. 4876 ± 0. 0023 Ma (MSWD = 1. 5; n = 24). These zircon crystallization ages are also indistinguishable from the sanidine 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates, and thus zircons crystallized close to eruption. This requires that shallow crustal melting, assembly of isolated batches into a supervolcanic magma reservoir, homogenization, and eruption occurred extremely rapidly, within the resolution of our geochronology (103 – 104 yr). The crystal-scale image of the reservoir configuration, with several isolated magma batches, is very similar to the reservoir configurations inferred from seismic data at active supervolcanoes. The connection of magma batches vertically distributed over several kilometers in the upper crust would cause a substantial increase of buoyancy overpressure, providing an eruption trigger mechanism that is the direct consequence of the <b>reservoir</b> <b>assembly</b> process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMacrophages are {{long-lived}} target {{cells for}} HIV infection and are considered viral <b>reservoirs.</b> HIV <b>assembly</b> in macrophages occurs in virus-containing compartments (VCCs) in which virions accumulate and are stored. The {{regulation of the}} trafficking and release of these VCCs remains unknown. Using high resolution light and electron microscopy of HIV- 1 -infected primary human macrophages, we show that the spatial distribution of VCCs depended on the microtubule network and that VCC-limiting membrane was closely associated with KIF 3 A+ microtubules. Silencing KIF 3 A strongly decreased virus release from HIV- 1 -infected macrophages, leading to VCC accumulation intracellularly. Time-lapse microscopy further suggested that VCCs and associated KIF 3 A move together along microtubules. Importantly, KIF 3 A does not {{play a role in}} HIV release from T cells that do not possess VCCs. These results reveal that HIV- 1 requires the molecular motor KIF 3 to complete its cycle in primary macrophages. Targeting this step may lead to novel strategies to eliminate this viral reservoir...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe exon {{junction}} complex (EJC) {{is loaded}} onto mRNAs {{as a consequence}} of splicing and regulates multiple posttranscriptional events. MLN 51, Magoh, Y 14, and eIF 4 A 3 form a highly stable EJC core, but where this tetrameric complex is assembled in the cell remains unclear. Here we show that EJC factors are enriched in domains that we term perispeckles and are visible as doughnuts around nuclear speckles. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses and EJC assembly mutants show that perispeckles do not store free subunits, but instead are enriched for assembled cores. At the ultrastructural level, perispeckles are distinct from interchromatin granule clusters that may function as storage sites for splicing factors and intermingle with perichromatin fibrils, where nascent RNAs and active RNA Pol II are present. These results support a model in which perispeckles are major assembly sites for the tetrameric EJC core. This subnuclear territory thus represents an intermediate region important for mRNA maturation, between transcription sites and splicing factor <b>reservoirs</b> and <b>assembly</b> sites...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Ant {{diversity}} {{is influenced by}} the structural complexity of the environment. Ants are thus an ecologically important group due to their potential to serve as indicators of environmental quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate ant diversity in areas with different land use histories and thus, within different stages of regeneration in the Permanent Preservation Area of the Foz do Chapecó Hydroelectric Plant <b>reservoir.</b> Ant <b>assemblies</b> among sample sites were compared using rarefaction analysis, and estimated richness, frequency of occurrence, and relative abundance were calculated. Associations between species and sample sites were evaluated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We identified 55 species in total from 24 genera, distributed among seven subfamilies. Eight species had positive associations with sample sites. Estimates indicated that ant richness may be up to 21. 4 % greater than that observed. This study presents an inventory of species capable of colonizing environments undergoing natural regeneration processes, and aids our understanding of ecological recovery dynamics in protected areas near hydroelectric plant reservoirs southern Brazil...|$|R

50|$|Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) {{has been}} used {{effectively}} for over 20 years {{in the oil industry}} and the technology has been evolving in order to meet changing industry demands. CTD takes the well-established concept of Coiled tubing and combines it with directional drilling using a mud motor to create a system for drilling <b>reservoirs.</b> Bottom hole <b>assemblies</b> (BHAs) are now able to drill directional, S-curve and horizontal wells and can be the key to unlocking reserves in mature oilfields via re-entry drilling. Coiled tubing drilling is known for its speed and ability to drill reservoirs in an underbalanced condition and CTD can reduce drilling times between 30%-60% compared with conventional jointed pipe drilling rigs. Therefore, CTD can provide significant economic benefits.|$|R
