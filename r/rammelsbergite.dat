40|$|The Atrevida vein {{is located}} at the {{south-western}} edge of the Catalonian Coastal Ranges, Spain. This vein extends for more than 3 km and is hosted by Silurian and Carboniferous metasediments, late Hercynian granites and continental conglomerates of Lower Triassic age. The Silurian metasediments contain massive sulphide layers with disseminations of platinum-group element (PGE) -bearing, Fe-Ni arsenides. Vein filling largely consists of banded and brecciated baryte rimmed by a complex polymetallic assemblage of Co-Ni-As-Bi-Ag(-U) ores. The Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide assemblage occurs only where the vein cuts the sulphide-bearing Silurian metasediments, and consists of nickeline, maucherite, <b>rammelsbergite,</b> gersdorffite and Ni-skutterudite. These Ni arsenides and sulpharsenides display rosettes, spherules, colloform and botryoidal textures, as well as subhedral crystals. The chemical compositions of these arsenide-sulpharsenide minerals exhibit limited cation substitution but substantial anion substitution of As by S and Sb, exceeding the expected theoretical values at low temperatures. This suggests that most of them formed under disequilibrium conditions. Ni arsenides and sulpharsenides also contain trace PGE. Palladium (up to 157 ppm) is the most abundant PGE, and occurs in solid-solution in all the phases studied, but shows the highest values in <b>rammelsbergite</b> and Niskutterudite. Pt only occurs in massive nickeline (54 - 1338 ppm Pt) and in zoned gersdorffite (29 - 360 ppm Pt) formed {{at the end of the}} depositional sequence of arsenides. The Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide ores at the Atrevida mine formed by reduction of PGE-bearing, oxidizing fluids at temperatures close to, or slightly above 100 °C. These oxidizing fluids most probably collected their PGE budget from the nearby mineralized black shales. During the crystallization of the veined, Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide ores, Pd partly concentrated in the early nickeline and maucherite, but mainly fractionated to the late solutions from which <b>rammelsbergite</b> and Ni-skutterudite precipitated. Pt concentrated only in the latest nickeline and gersdorffite. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The San Juan de Plan deposit, in {{the central}} Pyrenees of Spain, is {{situated}} in an ankeritic horizon in Silurian black shales. The main association consists of pyrite, sulfarsenides, diarsenides, and Co triarsenides (skutterudite), {{as well as a}} late stage consisting of cobaltite, Fe, Cu and Bi sulfides and native Bi. The sulfarsenides are arsenopyrite, alloclasite, members of the gersdorffite– cobaltite solid-solution series, arsenic-rich gersdorffite and cobaltite, whereas the diarsenides range from <b>rammelsbergite</b> to safflorite. <b>Rammelsbergite</b> is characterized by a composition within the range (Ni 0. 71 – 0. 97 Co 0. 02 – 0. 29 Fe 0. 00 – 0. 02) As 1. 75 – 2. 01 S 0. 00 – 0. 26, exceeding the theoretical value (As 1. 93 S 0. 07) given by Yund (1962). Two generations of the gersdorffite–cobaltite solid-solution series have been found on the basis of textural features and chemical composition; the first, (Co 0. 10 – 0. 77 Ni 0. 07 – 0. 80 Fe 0. 03 – 0. 58) As 0. 95 – 1. 27 S 0. 75 – 1. 06, shows a positive correlation between S and Fe contents, and between Co and As contents, whereas the second one, (Co 0. 02 – 0. 91 Ni 0. 02 – 0. 96 Fe 0. 00 – 0. 28) As 0. 99 – 1. 38 S 0. 67 – 1. 01, exhibits a considerable compositional field in the Fe-poor region of the system CoAsS–NiAsS–FeAsS, providing evidence of extensive substitution of Co by Ni, with a positive correlation between As and Ni contents. Arsenic-rich gersdorffite displays a broad range of As and S mutual substitution, (Ni 0. 65 – 0. 98 Co 0. 02 – 0. 27 Fe 0. 00 – 0. 06) As 1. 37 – 1. 83 S 0. 22 – 0. 64, exceeding the experimental value of NiAs 1. 77 S 0. 23 reported by Yund (1962).

40|$|The {{solution}} {{chemistry and}} statistical modelling of the O$ sb 2 $-CaCl$ sb 2 $-HCl leaching of a high-grade arseniferrous uranium ore (Key Lake, N. Saskatchewan) were studied {{with the objective}} of optimizing the co-extraction of uranium and radium. To this end, two types of experiments were carried out: (a) those designed to study arsenic speciation under simulated U-leaching conditions, with the use of model arsenide minerals, namely niccolite (NiAs), <b>rammelsbergite</b> (NiAs$ sb 2 $) and gersdorffite (NiAsS); and (b) statistically designed tests involving actual leaching of samples of the Key Lake ore. Niccolite and <b>rammelsbergite</b> were found to yield H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ in solution as oppossed to gersdorffite, which was found to yield H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $. H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ was found to be metastable in the Fe$ sb 2 $(SO$ sb 4) sb 3 $ leaching system, while in the FeCl$ sb 3 $ and pressure (O$ sb 2 $) leaching systems, further oxidation to H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $ was observed to take place at relatively slow rates. A mechanism has been advanced to account for the latter slow oxidation of H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ to H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $. Finally, it was concluded that the formation of As(III) /As(V) in oxidative acid leaching is independent of the prevailing suspension redox potential which, in turn, renders impractical the possible stabilization of As(III) via potential control. The solubility of RaSO$ sb 4 $ in HCl-MeCl$ sb{ rm x}$ leaching media was quantitatively established by employing the "reduced activity coefficient" method. The estimated solubility profiles clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of CaCl$ sb 2 $ in solubilizing radium as oppossed to other monochloride salt additions. Finally, optimization of the co-extraction of U and Ra was attained {{with the use of a}} computer-aided response surface methodology. An incomplete three-level, four-variable factorial design (Box-Behnken) was applied in the region: 0. 33 kg/L $ leq$ d$ sb{ rm s}$ $ leq$ 0. 99 kg/L; 0. 5 N $ leq$ (HCl) $ sb{ rm o}$ $ leq$ 1. 5 N; 1. 5 M $ leq$ (CaCl$ sb 2 rbrack sb{ rm o}$ $ leq$ 3. 5 M; and 2 hrs $ leq$ Time$ leq$ 6 hrs.

Uranium and radium were found to dissolve simultaneously and rapidly (99 % co-extraction in 2 hrs). Effective reduction of radioactivity levels from 10, 000 pCi/g Ra$ sp{ 226 }$ down to 160 pCi/g has been achieved in a single-stage batch process, thus making possible the production of environmentally innocuous tailings...|$|E

40|$|The Ulsan Fe–W mine {{is located}} within the Cretaceous Gyeongsang volcano-sedimentary basin at the southeastern edge of the Korean Peninsula. Distinct {{hydrothermal}} events resulted in calcic skarn and vein deposits in recrystallized limestone near a Tertiary epizonal granite stock. The deposits of the Ulsan mine present {{a unique opportunity to}} document geochemically the complex evolution of a skarn–vein system that is related genetically to a low-sulfidation system. Isochemical contact metamor-phism of an early skarn stage (stage I) is displayed by the presence of anhydrous Ca–Al–Mg skarn minerals at the contact between granite and recrystallized limestone. Following magnetite deposition in the main prograde skarn (stage II), the first deposition of arsenopyrite occurs intergrown with <b>rammelsbergite</b> – niccolite – gersdorffite – löllingite – native bismuth – bismuthinite – hexagonal pyrrhotite. These common sulfide assemblages are characterized by an overall low-sulfidation state during the main skarn stage. Retrograde skarn (stage III) is characterized by minor impregnations of scheelite in calcite and quartz, with actinolite and chlorite. During the latest part of stage III, Cu–Zn and polymetallic sulfide mineralization was introduced. The latest episode in the hydrothermal system (stage IV) is characterized by Zn–Pb–Ag mineralization in siderite–quartz veins. Decreasing As contents in arsenopyrite from stages II to IV indicate a decrease in temperature or sulfur fugacity (or both) with time. The various skarn-forming events and ore minerals from various stages are interpreted to have resulted from an evolutionary trend from hypersaline magmatic fluids during prograde skarn formation associated with Fe–As(–Ni) mineralization to low-salinity and low...|$|E
40|$|This thesis reviews heavy mineral {{separation}} {{techniques for}} red-bed heavy mineral provenance studies. It demonstrates {{the effectiveness of}} automated mineralogy for mineral comparisons and targeted mineral analysis, resulting in new provenance history conclusions for the Permo-Triassic of SW England. The methodology was developed to remove iron-oxide coatings from grains and provide optimal separation of heavy mineral concentrates in comparison to hydroseparation and panning. Step-wise methodology iterations were validated at each stage using the QEMSCAN (Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANing electron microscopy). The QEMSCAN works {{in a similar way}} to the SEM (scanning electron microscope) and electron-microprobe. Four EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy) detectors measured X-rays, secondary electrons and back-scattered electrons from the sample. The software allocated these to defined geochemical SIP (species identification protocol) categories. The SIP was back-validated using the electron-microprobe, XRD (X-ray diffraction), microscopy and SEM. QEMSCAN was the primary analysis technique. The results included false colour mineral maps and semi-quantitative statistics for the SIP categories. This enabled targeted mineral analysis with supporting techniques. The methodology was applied to the Permo-Triassic of SW England. The QEMSCAN was able to pick up small scale and large scale heavy mineral provenance trends. Case study 1 showed regional heavy mineral trends and allowed lithological correlation of outliers. Case study 2 used heavy minerals to confirm contemporaneous structural evolution and the base of the Upper Permian in South Devon. Case study 3 allowed a re-evaluation of the base Triassic. Case study 4 targeted biotite minerals at Corbyn’s Head. Case study 5 reviewed local vertical and horizontal trends in comparison to regional trends. This has significant oil and gas exploration implications as it gives confidence in correlating deposits over 10 s km and can be applied to North Sea barren red-beds. Finally, some mineral firsts, including <b>rammelsbergite</b> and a topaz rhyolite were identified...|$|E
40|$|The Arburese region (SW Sardinia) is {{well-known}} {{for a large}} swarm of mineralized veins hosted in low-grade metamorphic rocks, extending for about 20 km around the Late Variscan (304 ± 1 Ma) Arbus pluton, {{made up of a}} core of cordierite-bearing biotite leucogranites and an external shell of granodiorites with subordinate mafic rocks (Cuccuru et al., 2015). The largest veins occur in the northern and western sectors (past Montevecchio district), with a primary mineral association of Pb-Zn (Cu, Ag) sulfides in quartz and siderite. Recent works on the southern branch of the vein system (Naitza et al., 2015) evidenced a more complex metallogeny, with Ni-Co-As-Sb-Bi-Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag ores. New microscopy, SEM-EDS and EPMA data allow to highlight the depositional history of these ores, defining two stages of mineralization. In the Arsenide stage, early precipitation of quartz with abundant Ni monoarsenide (nickeline) was followed by growth of Ni antimonide (breithauptite) on nickeline, by Ni, Ni-Co, Co, Fe diarsenides, triarsenides, sulfoarsenides (<b>rammelsbergite,</b> skutterudite, safflorite/löllingite, cobaltite, gersdorffite/ullmannite) and Bi minerals (bismuthinite and native Bi), replacing nickeline and forming rims and inclusions on previously crystallized phases. The Sulfide stage was preceded by cataclasis of the ores; initial abundant precipitation of quartz, siderite and sphalerite, cementing the fragments of the arsenide ores, was followed by Pb-Cu-Ag sulfides (galena, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite/freibergite, bournonite, proustite/pyrargirite, stephanite), and, at last, by ankerite, calcite and pyrite. These sequences of mineralization suggest a relationship with distinct hydrothermal fluids: 1) an earlier fluid, carrying Ni, Co, As and Sb, deposited as arsenides and sulfoarsenides into structurally-controlled traps in response to variations in physicochemical conditions; 2) a late, carbonate and Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag -rich fluid, permeating fractures re-opened after a tectonic phase that involved the previous mineralization, and originating a “Montevecchio-type” mineral association. Depositional histories similar to the Arsenide stage have been reported in other hydrothermal Ni-Co deposits worldwide, as in the Bou Azzer district, Morocco (Ahmed et al., 2009). The geochemistry of these ores requires the presence in the geological sequence of a Ni-Co-rich source (e. g. mafic rocks) from which these elements could be leached by acidic and moderately oxidizing hot fluids. Analogous conditions may have been attained in the Arbus pluton, which includes an olivine-bearing end member (Secchi et al., 1991), possible Ni-Co source for fluids of magmatic origin. During the emplacement of the igneous complex, widespread uralitization of pyroxenes in granodiorites point to high fluid/rock interactions; moreover, quartz- Fe-cordierite graphic intergrowths in leucogranites support a late dehydration of magmas.
