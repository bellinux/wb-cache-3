5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed <b>rectangular</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure.

40|$|AbstractThe MRS forward {{calculation}} of 3 D water-contained medium involves two difficulties. First {{of them is}} to calculate {{the expression of the}} exciting field, which is an integration including 2 Bessel functions’ product. In this paper, the integration was divided into 2 integral intervals. In the first interval, using the Hankel expression of Bessel functions and the latter asymptotic properties of large volume, the double bessel integration was converted into Fourier sine(cosine) transformations and fast calculation to the transformations was adopted to finish the integration in this interval. Traditional calculation method can achieve high accuracy in the second interval. The second difficulty is the space dicretization of the 3 D water-contained medium. Dicretization methods in both cylindrical and <b>rectangular</b> <b>coordinates</b> <b>system</b> were introduced in this paper. The cubic grids in <b>rectangular</b> <b>coordinates</b> <b>system</b> can construct 3 D water-contained bodies of any shape.

5000|$|The {{incoming}} ray {{is reflected}} three times, once by each surface, {{which results in}} a reversal of direction.

When the ray reflects from the first side, say x, the ray's x component, a, is reversed to −a while the y and z components are unchanged, resulting in a direction of b,. Similarly, when reflected from side y and finally from side z, the b and c components are reversed. Therefore, the ray direction goes from b, to b, to −b, to −b,, and it leaves the corner reflector with all three components of direction exactly reversed. The distance travelled, relative to a plane normal to {{the direction of the}} rays, is also equal for any ray entering the reflector, regardless of the location where it first reflects.|$|E
