40|$|With {{reform of}} the legal {{framework}} related to fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> fast approaching, I examine in concrete terms problems of creating such laws {{from the perspective of}} avoiding excessive regulation of fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> My analysis is based on a report created by the Fixed-term <b>Employment</b> <b>Contract</b> Study Group organized by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and I consider the fact that demand for workers with a fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> is mainly medium- and long-term, not temporary and special. The general principle of permanent <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> is asserted when strictly regulating the use of fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> However this is not a general principle embodied in the actual <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> but is a policy preference from the perspective of stable employment. The general principle of permanent <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> would dramatically restrict the use of employees with a fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> in current <b>employment</b> practices in Japan and force these changes. However, legal restrictions on fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> cannot be considered an appropriate legal policy since they do not take into consideration how companies will meet their medium- and long-term demand for labor. Assuming that employees with fixed-term employment contracts—for which there is a medium- and long-term demand—continue to be permitted, the current legal issue becomes providing an appropriate scope of protection. In particular, the law should clearly state the possibility of renewing fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> when concluding or renewing the contract and demand that the reason for terminating employment in the case the contract is not renewed be objectively justifiable and socially appropriate. ...|$|R

40|$|A bill {{currently}} {{pending in}} Congress would render unenforceable mandatory arbitration clauses in all <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> Some perceive these provisions as employer efforts to deprive employees of important legal rights. Company CEOs are firm employees, and, unlike most other firm employees, {{they can actually}} negotiate their <b>employment</b> <b>contracts,</b> very often with attorney assistance. Moreover, many CEO <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> are publicly available, {{so they can be}} examined empirically. In this paper, we ask whether CEOs bargain to include binding arbitration provisions in their <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> After exploring the theoretical arguments for and against including such provisions in these agreements, we use a large sample of CEO <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> to test the several different hypotheses for including such provisions. We find that only about one half of CEO <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> in our sample include such provisions. What factors might determine whether CEOs agree to arbitrate their employment disputes with their companies? We find that CEOs that receive a higher percentage of long-term incentive pay as a fraction of their total pay, that work in industry sectors that are undergoing greater amounts of change, and that have lower long-term profitability are statistically significantly more likely to have arbitration provisions in their <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> The importance of contextual factors for arbitration clauses in CEO contracts indicates that regulation of arbitration clauses in <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> should be more nuanced than that found in pending legislation...|$|R

40|$|Continental Law {{defines the}} <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> by the “subordination” of the {{employee}} to the employer. Since Simon (1951), economics defines authority as the opportunity for the employer to postpone {{the selection of the}} tasks the employee should perform. These definitions do not fit. Using the framework of option pricing in order to interpret Simon’s model, this paper shows that the economic concept of the <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> is a spot contract paired with a call option on the employee’s tasks.

It is argued that equilibrium <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> will tend to give the employer residual rights of control over labour, if workers are potential substitutes and give workers residual rights of control if workers are complements.

40|$|<b>Employment</b> <b>contracts</b> give a {{principal}} {{the authority to}} decide flexibly which task his agent should execute. However, there is a tradeoff, first pointed out by Simon (1951), between flexibility and employer moral hazard. An <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> allows the principal to adjust the task quickly to {{the realization of the}} state of the world, but he may also abuse this flexibility to exploit the agent. We capture this tradeoff in an experimental design and show that principals exhibit a strong preference for the <b>employment</b> <b>contract.</b> However, selfish principals exploit agents in one-shot interactions, inducing the latter to resist entering into <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> This resistance to <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> vanishes if fairness preferences in combination with reputation opportunities keep principals from abusing their power, leading to the widespread, endogenous formation of efficient long-run employment relations. Our results inform the theory of the firm by showing how behavioral forces shape an important transaction cost of integration – the abuse of authority – and by providing an empirical basis for assessing differences between the Marxian and the Coasian view of the firm, as well as Alchian and Demsetz’s (1972) critique of the Coasian approach...|$|R
