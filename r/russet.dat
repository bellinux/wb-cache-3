5|$|However, {{studies of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{indicate that the}} <b>russet</b> sparrow is an early offshoot or basal species among the Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows. While mitochrondrial DNA suggests speciation in Passer occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith estimated that the <b>russet</b> sparrow separated from the other Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as the lower Yangtze valley, which Summers-Smith considered the most likely centre of evolution for the <b>russet</b> sparrow.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} the range, the <b>russet</b> sparrow inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture. Though it damages crops, it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests. In China, the <b>russet</b> sparrow has been {{recorded}} as a captive bird, kept with the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Japan it was eaten in the 1870s and sold in the Yokohama game market. The <b>russet</b> sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas that in most languages it has a different vernacular name from the Eurasian tree sparrow. Examples of these vernacular names include lal gouriya in Hindi and kang-che-go-ma in Tibetan. The Japanese artist Hokusai portrayed the <b>russet</b> sparrow, and due to this, it has appeared on postage stamps featuring Japanese art in Japan, The Gambia, and Guyana.|$|E
5|$|Mortality {{rates in}} the <b>russet</b> sparrow have not been studied, but {{it is known that}} many young birds die from Isospora infections, to which the bird has little resistance. Other {{recorded}} parasites of the <b>russet</b> sparrow include Protocalliphora blowflies, and Menacanthus chewing lice.|$|E

5000|$|It is a late-flowering variety, classed as a [...] "bittersweet" [...] apple, with {{relatively}} high tannins and {{low levels of}} malic acid. It makes a medium-sized tree with a stiffly upright habit.

5|$|The <b>russet</b> sparrow {{is found}} in parts of eastern Asia and in the Himalayas. It is not known whether its {{distribution}} is continuous between these two areas, since the political sensitivity of the Brahmaputra River's valley near the China-India border makes the area less accessible to ornithologists. In the Himalayas the <b>russet</b> sparrow breeds from the far northeast of India through southeastern Tibet, Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh to Kashmir and Nuristan in Afghanistan. Here, the <b>russet</b> sparrow makes short movements to lower altitudes between November and April in many areas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>russet</b> sparrow's {{breeding}} season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus {{has been recorded}} breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its {{breeding season}}, the <b>russet</b> sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests. The <b>russet</b> sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and white wagtail in black kite nests, {{taking advantage of the}} territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing nests in bushes. The <b>russet</b> sparrow also uses the disused nests of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of <b>russet</b> sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Asia, the <b>russet</b> sparrow {{is found}} in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, {{a small part of}} {{mainland}} Russia, Japan, southern Korea, and part of northern China, where it is mostly migratory. It is distributed through southern China and Taiwan, and the mountainous parts of Burma, southern Northeast India, Laos, and Vietnam, where it is mostly resident. The <b>russet</b> sparrow also occurs as a winter visitor in southern Japan, the further south of China, and northern Thailand. In eastern Asia, the autumn migration occurs between August and November.|$|E

40|$|<b>Russeting</b> is {{characterized}} by a particular rough and brown phenotype, which is mainly due to the accumulation of suberin in the inner part of the epidermal cell walls. In our previous bulk transcriptomic analysis, comparing fully <b>russeted,</b> and waxy apple varieties, showed, in apple fruit skin, a massive decreased expression of cutin, wax and some pentacyclic triterpene biosynthesis genes in the <b>russeted</b> varieties, with an expected concomitant enhanced expression of the suberin biosynthetic genes. In the present work, we performed a deep investigation of the aliphatic composition of the cutin, suberin, waxes, and triterpenes in the waxy and <b>russeted</b> patches of the semi-russeted apple variety “Cox Orange Pippin. ” A targeted gene expression profiling was performed to validate candidate genes which were identified in our previous work and might be involved in the respective metabolic pathways. Our results showed that a decrease of cuticular waxes, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, accompanied by an accumulation of alkyl-hydroxycinamates and betulinic acid, occurs in the <b>russeted</b> patches. The suberin monomer composition {{is characterized}} by specific occurrence of 20, 22, and 24 carbon aliphatic chains, whereas cutin is mainly represented by common C 16 and C 18 aliphatic chains. This work depicts, {{for the first time in}} apple, the complex composition of suberin, cutin, waxes and triterpenes, and confirms the strong interplay between these epidermal polymers in apple fruit skin...|$|R

5|$|Outside its {{breeding}} season, the <b>russet</b> sparrow is gregarious {{and forms}} flocks to find food, though it infrequently associates with other birds. Wintering flocks tend {{to keep away}} from human habitation. The <b>russet</b> sparrow is also social at night during the winter, and it forms large communal roosts in trees and bushes. In the breeding season, the female roosts in the nests and the male nests in foliage nearby.|$|E
5|$|Three {{subspecies}} are recognised, differing chiefly in the yellowness {{of their}} underparts. The subspecies rutilans and intensior breed {{in parts of}} eastern Asia, where they are usually found in light woodland, and the subspecies cinnamomeus breeds in the Himalayas, where it is usually associated with terrace cultivation. The <b>russet</b> sparrow is the typical sparrow of human habitations in towns where the house and Eurasian tree sparrows are absent. In {{the southern part of}} its range, the <b>russet</b> sparrow prefers higher altitudes, but in the north it breeds by the sea. The <b>russet</b> sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas to have a distinct name in some languages, and is depicted in Japanese art.|$|E

5|$|Measurements for the <b>russet</b> sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three {{subspecies}}, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form {{there is a tendency}} for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east.|$|E
5|$|The adult <b>russet</b> sparrow {{is mostly}} a seed-eater, eating the seeds of herbs and weeds as well as rice, barley, and other grains. Berries, {{such as those of}} the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, {{especially}} caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male {{is bright}} <b>russet</b> or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the <b>russet</b> of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E

5|$|This sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of herbs and grains, but it also eats berries and insects, {{particularly}} during the breeding season. This diet makes it a minor pest in agricultural areas, but also a predator of insect pests. While breeding, it is not social, as its nests are dispersed. It forms flocks when not breeding, although it associates with other bird species infrequently. In some parts of its range, the <b>russet</b> sparrow migrates, at least to lower altitudes. Its nest {{is located in a}} tree cavity, or a hole in a cliff or building. The male chooses the nest site before finding a mate and uses the nest for courtship display. The typical clutch contains five or six whitish eggs. Both sexes incubate and feed the young.|$|E
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden <b>Russet,</b> and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E
