Here, we present an adaptive approach to efficient resource usage by automatic optimization of resource calendars. We describe a precise model based on a case study at the radiology department of the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam (AMC). We model {{the properties of the}} different groups of patients, with additional differentiating urgency levels. Based on this model, we develop a detailed simulation that is able to replicate the known scheduling problems. In particular, the simulation shows that due to fluctuations in demand, the allocations in the <b>resource</b> <b>calendar</b> must be flexible in order to make efficient use of the resources. We develop adaptive algorithms to automate iterative adjustments to the <b>resource</b> <b>calendar.</b> To test the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate the algorithms using the simulation.

The main components of these systems are planning, scheduling and control modules.

In this paper, we discuss the design issues on resource calendars, which describes the formal shift representation for general resource management in manufacturing planning, scheduling, and control.

30|$|Real-world {{projects}} {{also have}} several calendar constraints {{that can have}} significant impact on project duration. Most project management tools focus only on duration estimations for task. Non-productivity times, such as idle times, are extremely complicated and cumbersome to handle ahead of time. An exhaustive analysis of resource queues is required to estimate how long a task will wait for its resources, once it is eligible to start. For instance, if the duration of a given task requires 24  h using a set of resources, {{it does not mean}} that this task can be carried out in 3 days in 8 -h shifts. The actual duration time depends upon several constraints, including <b>resource</b> <b>calendar</b> constraints. The software tool associates each resource with its daily calendar, and each working shift is decomposed into time intervals, such as regular, idle, or overtime. The calendar can be set up for unlimited time intervals. Since each resource has its own calendar, the slowest resource or the most constrained resource will have the most impact on the actual duration of the task.|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{resource}} over-allocating {{is a big}} concern for project engineers {{in the process of}} scheduling project activities. Resource over-allocating is frequently seen after initial scheduling of a project in practice and causes significant amount of efforts to modify the initial schedules. In this research, a new method is developed for modifying over-allocated schedules in a multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problems (MRCPSPs) with positive cash flows (MRCPSP-PCF). The aim is to maximize profit of the MRCPSPs or logically minimizing costs. The proposed method {{can be used as a}} macro in Microsoft Office Project® Software to modify resource over-allocated days after scheduling a project. This research considers progress payment method and preemptive resources. The proposed approach maximizes profit by scheduling activities through the <b>resource</b> <b>calendar</b> respecting to the available level of preemptive resources and activity numbers. To examine the performance of the proposed method a number of experiments derived from the literature are solved. The results are then compared with the circumstances where resource constraints are relaxed. The outcomes show that in all studied cases, the proposed algorithm can provide modified schedules with no over-allocated days. Afterward the method is applied to modify a manufacturing project in practice. ...|$|E
40|$|Resource {{calendars}} specify nonworking days {{of driving}} resources involved in construction projects. As {{part of the}} resource availability constraints in critical path method (CPM) scheduling, resource calendars may postpone activity start time, extend activity duration, and hence prolong the total project duration. Ultimately, resource calendars bring about changes to the critical path identification. Research has yet to address how to incorporate the effects of multiple resource calendars on the total float determination. In this research, the popular P 3 software {{is used as a}} tool for investigating the current practice of CPM scheduling under resource limit and calendar constraints. We assess P 3 's advanced resource scheduling functions (including resource leveling and resource calendars) and identify P 3 's potential errors in total float determination. Further, we propose a new method based on the forward pass analysis alone for accurately evaluating activity total float subject to <b>resource</b> <b>calendar</b> constraints. The application of the new method is illustrated with an activity-on-node case and a precedence-diagram-method case, with the results compared against those produced from P 3. Our research has elucidated on some critical issues of resource-constrained scheduling in the application domain of construction project management. The findings will provide useful input for the vendors and users of the CPM software-which is not limited to P 3 -to improve the scheduling methodology as well as the accuracy of the resulting project schedules.

30|$|The current {{literature}} has addressed various {{elements of the}} project scheduling problem, such as tasks precedence, resource constraints, multi-modes, multi-skilled resources, multiple projects, multiple <b>resource</b> <b>calendars,</b> <b>resource</b> usage cost, and priority rules. Currently, no approach addresses {{all of the above}} in a systematic and integrated manner. The most widely used tools in the industry are Microsoft Project and Primavera Project Planner (P 3 and P 6 versions). These tools do not support multiple task modes (i.e., only one set of resources for each task), and they use a fixed set of rules for resource allocation, i.e., lack the dynamic resource allocation. They also do not guarantee accuracy in results when tasks require multiple <b>resources</b> with different <b>calendars,</b> resulting in faulty interpretation of finish time of tasks. These shortcomings highlight the need for one approach that can properly assist project managers in dealing with resource allocation.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The issue {{resource}} over-allocating is a {{big concern}} for project engineers {{in the process of}} scheduling project activities. Resource over-allocating drawback is frequently seen after scheduling of a project in practice which causes a schedule to be useless. Modifying an over-allocated schedule is very complicated and needs a lot of efforts and time. In this paper, a new and fast tracking method is proposed to schedule large scale projects which can help project engineers to schedule the project rapidly and with more confidence. Design/methodology/approach: In this article, a forward approach for maximizing net present value (NPV) in multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem while assuming discounted positive cash flows (MRCPSP-DCF) is proposed. The progress payment method is used and all resources are considered as pre-emptible. The proposed approach maximizes NPV using unscheduled resources through <b>resource</b> <b>calendar</b> in forward mode. For this purpose, a Genetic Algorithm is applied to solve. Findings: The findings show that the proposed method is an effective way to maximize NPV in MRCPSP-DCF problems while activity splitting is allowed. The proposed algorithm is very fast and can schedule experimental cases with 1000 variables and 100 resources in few seconds. The results are then compared with branch and bound method and simulated annealing algorithm and it is found the proposed genetic algorithm can provide results with better quality. Then algorithm is then applied for scheduling a hospital in practice. Originality/value: The method can be used alone or as a macro in Microsoft Office Project® Software to schedule MRCPSP-DCF problems or to modify resource over-allocated activities after scheduling a project.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} a novel method {{for determining the}} constraining effect of resources in a manufacturing system under simulation. Traditionally manufacturing systems are constrained {{by one or more}} bottlenecks. Eliminating or mitigating the bottleneck will improve the whole system. However, bottlenecking resources generally only refer to machines, and primarily focus on flow-shops not job-shops. One important resource we believe that is often overlooked is workers and their associated skills, and we propose that a particular skill could be flagged as a bottleneck resource. We define new metrics known as Resource Constraint Metrics (RCM) for measuring the constraining effect of a resource on the entire manufacturing system. These metrics are robust and differentiate between the constraining effects of machines and their requested skills. The metrics can also deal with complex workflows with alternative routing, alternative <b>resources,</b> <b>calendars</b> (a necessary consideration when dealing with workers), worker performance, and multiple modes of operation of machines (e. g. run, setup, and maintenance). The use of RCMs in simulation aids in real-world decision-making, by determining which resource should be focussed on and improved to reduce the overall system constrainedness. This will have the effect of increasing throughput or at least providing the capacity for increased throughput...|$|R
