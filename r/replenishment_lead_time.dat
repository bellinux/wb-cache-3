In this paper, we consider the impact of load-dependent <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> on the optimal assortment and pricing decisions of a make-to-stock manufacturer, who wishes to offer an assortment of vertically differentiated products (i. e., having different quality levels) to the market using a given (flexible) production capacity. Depending on the price and quality levels of the products offered, customers decide to either buy a given product, or not to buy at all. Inventories are reviewed periodically, and the goal of the manufacturer is to set the price and quality levels of the products to maximize long-run expected profit. We characterize the optimal decisions for the infinite capacity system (where replenishment is instantaneous), and compare these to the optimal decisions in the finite capacity system (which implies load-dependent <b>replenishment</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times).</b> We show that, for normally distributed demands, the optimal solution of the infinite capacity system has a simple structure.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the first computationally efficient policies for stochastic inventory models with lost sales and <b>replenishment</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> that admit worst-case performance guarantees. In particular, we introduce dual-balancing policies for lost-sales models that are conceptually similar to dual-balancing policies recently introduced for a broad class of inventory models in which demand is backlogged rather than lost. That is, in each period, we balance two opposing costs: the expected marginal holding costs against the expected marginal lost-sales cost. Specifically, we show that the dual-balancing policies for the lost-sales models provide a worst-case performance guarantee of 2 under relatively general demand structures. In particular, the guarantee holds for independent (not necessarily identically distributed) demands and for models with correlated demands such as the AR(1) model and the multiplicative auto-regressive demand model.

40|$|A {{supplier}} has {{a periodic}} review inventory system that provides several lead-time options to its customers. The inventory <b>replenishment</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is {{a multiple of}} the inventory review cycle. Customers are classified into two groups: short lead-time customers requiring the product immediately and long lead-time customers who allow the supplier the flexibility to deliver immediately or in the next cycle. We consider an inventory-commitment problem, in which the supplier allocates its on-hand inventory to these two groups of customers. When inventory runs out, the supplier backlog orders to future cycles. Therefore, the supplier faces two problems: how the onhand inventories are allocated between two classes of customers and how the backlogged orders are cleared when replenishments arrive? We consider the former as an inventory-commitment problem, and resolve the latter with priority rules.

30|$|Generally, {{the problem}} of {{determining}} production order sizes, their timing and sequencing with setup considerations is equivalent to a capacitated lot size problem. However, the change in business conditions as shown by shortened <b>replenishment</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> increased product variety, high-speed production equipment with more complex setup conditions, increased inventory turnover etc. calls {{for a change of}} paradigm. It appears that the industrial relevance of traditional lot sizing and scheduling models has shifted from discrete parts manufacturing to process industries, particularly, for applications with long processing times of campaigns in multi-stage production systems. Hence, it is more relevant in the multi-plant supply network planning stage than in detailed short-term scheduling of operations. In addition, in the chemical industry setup costs are often easier to determine in the form of direct costs mainly when after a product changeover output is temporarily produced, which does not meet the desired specifications (Chapter 5 of Schöpperl 2013), or excessive clean-out times occur as in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|R
