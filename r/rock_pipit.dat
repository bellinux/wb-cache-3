5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is a much}} less approachable bird than the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit.</b> It is warier than its {{relative}} and if approached it flies some distance before landing again, whereas the <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> typically travels only a short distance, close to the ground, before it alights.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus petrosus), or just <b>rock</b> <b>pipit,</b> is {{a species}} of small {{passerine}} bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts. It has streaked greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European pipits. There are three subspecies, of which only the Fennoscandian form is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is territorial {{at least in the}} breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling an intruder, behaviour only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is closely}} related to the water pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is darker, larger and longer-winged than its relative, and has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit,</b> but has a strong {{supercilium}} and greyer upperparts; it is also typically much warier. The Eurasian rock pipit's dusky, rather than white, outer tail feathers are also a distinction from all its relatives. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water <b>pipit.</b> Vagrant Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations {{are known to be}} nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|R
50|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} seen flying along the cliffs. Some stonechats and meadow pipits gather on the meadow, while <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> move along {{the base of the}} cliffs. House martins make mud nests under the {{overhangs}} of the chalk cliffs.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit's</b> song is a {{sequence}} of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The shrill pseep flight call is intermediate between the soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit and the water pipit's short, thin fist.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is also a}} host to {{the flea}} Ceratophyllus borealis, and several other flea species in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus. The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> can benefit from {{parasitism}} of the common periwinkle Littorina littoria by the castrating trematode Parorchis acanthus. Beaches can become attractive where {{the decline of the}} periwinkle results in more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails as food for the pipits.|$|E
5|$|The family Motacillidae {{consists}} of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest of these groups is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were considered subspecies of the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> until they were separated by the British Ornithologists' Union in 1998. The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is closely related to}} the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits as well as its former subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The family Motacillidae {{consists}} of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest {{of the three groups}} is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were both formerly considered subspecies of the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit.</b> Of these, the <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is the more closely related to the water pipit, based on external and molecular characteristics. Other near relatives are the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits.|$|E
5|$|Adult Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> have a {{complete}} moult in August–September, at which time juveniles replace their body and some wing covert feathers, giving them an appearance very like the adults. From late January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and wing covert feathers, and sometimes the central tail feathers.|$|R
5|$|Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> {{construct}} a cup nest under coastal vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay {{four to six}} speckled pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 16days to fledging. Although insects are occasionally caught in flight, the pipits feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the rocks or from shallow water.|$|R
50|$|Adult Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> have a {{complete}} moult in August-September, at which time juveniles replace their body and some wing covert feathers, giving them an appearance very like the adults.

5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is a {{much more}} approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, close to the ground, before it alights, whereas its {{relative}} is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is hunted by {{birds of}} prey {{including}} the Eurasian sparrowhawk. As {{with other members of}} its genus, it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs laid by cuckoos that specialise in using pipits as their hosts are similar in appearance to those of the pipit.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> may be hunted by {{birds of}} prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or {{act as an}} {{involuntary}} host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
25|$|Sandy shores harbour {{a variety}} {{of plants and animals}} which are buried in the sand. Birds such as curlews and oyster {{catchers}} are to be seen prodding the sand to find these creatures for food. A few cormorants and fulmars breed along the coast where stonechats and <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> can also be spotted. Herring gulls are the commonest breeding birds and are an interesting sight nesting in the chimneys of coastal towns.|$|R
50|$|The {{islands are}} {{also home to}} a number of bird species- the geese of the island's name are {{barnacle}} geese. In addition, the islands have wheatears, <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> and fulmars. Lapwing breed on the island and peregrine falcons hunt for prey. There is evidence of rabbits on the island.The islands have no trees and are composed almost entirely of machair with outcrops of rock. They are crisscrossed by a number of stone walls that provide some shelter for nesting birds.|$|R
5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> when there is less prey available.|$|R
5|$|The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared {{and stock}} doves, common whitethroat, common linnet, stonechat, dunnock, <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> and– in 2007 – Britain's {{first and only}} Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is closely related}} to the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit,</b> but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also {{typically}} much warier. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{breeding}} {{population of the}} Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> vary, but may {{be as high as}} 408,000 pairs, of which around 300,000 pairs are in Norway. Despite slight declines in the British population and some range expansion in Finland, the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason it is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna species {{recorded}} in Pennyghael {{and in the}} surrounding region are: meadow <b>pipits,</b> and <b>rock</b> <b>pipits,</b> wheatears; seabirds such great black-backed gull, lesser black-backed gull, common gulls, gannets, shearwaters; raptors, buzzards, and golden eagles on the Carsaig hills; the Loch has eider, black guillemot, guillemot, black-throated divers, red-throated divers, great-northern divers and also otters; redstart, chaffinch, greenfinch, blackbirds and many species of woodland birds; shore birds oystercatcher, curlew and many species of gull near Burg and Tiroran; swallows near often barns and outbuildings; common sandpiper, eider ducks, lapwing, and whitethroat around the Loch; species seen in the Loch Beg are oystercatcher, curlew, and many water birds, redshank and ringed plover; and in the forested areas eared owls are also recorded.|$|R
50|$|Birdlife is {{abundant}} around the village, with common blackbirds, European robins, dunnocks, Eurasian wrens {{and both the}} song and mistle thrush. Eurasian curlews nest in boggy patches and northern lapwings {{can be seen in}} the fields. European greenfinches, linnets, whitethroats, common chaffinches and willow warblers all nest in the gorse bushes that flank the sheep pastures, along with European stonechat and the whinchat. Barn swallows, house martins and common swifts nest in the farm buildings, alongside house sparrows and white wagtails, while the woodlands are the haunt of the Eurasian nuthatch, common treecreeper, great spotted woodpecker and European green woodpecker. common wood pigeons, stock doves and Eurasian collared doves also breed in the woods, along with the Eurasian woodcock. The long-tailed tit nests in dense thickets of blackthorn and gorse, while the reed bunting, common moorhen and common snipe raise their young in the marshes. Three species of owl nest around the village, and the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, merlin and common buzzard can all be seen hunting. On the coastal cliffs, peregrine falcons and red-billed chough are found, with <b>rock</b> <b>pipits</b> inhabiting the <b>rocks</b> above the tide line. Great cormorants and European shags, common guillemots, razorbills and European herring gulls all nest on these cliffs, as does the northern fulmar.|$|R
5000|$|The geology of Annet is of Hercynian granite overlain with {{raised beach}} deposits. On the {{southern}} end there is a [...] "thick bed of soil, part sand and part soil". The island is low-lying with a top height of 18 m and the coast consists of boulder storm beaches. The effects of wind exposure, salt spray and lack of topography, restricts diversity and only 53 species of vascular plants have been recorded. The north of the island is dominated by a well developed, thick, thrift (Armeria maritima) turf whilst the southern part is dominated by dense stands of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), with some sand sedge (Carex arenaria) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus). Thickets of tree mallow (Lavatera arborea) have developed {{at the back of}} some of the boulder beaches. There were scattered colonies of shore dock (Rumex rupestris) until a storm in 1982 swept away some of the boulder beaches. One colony remains in the corner of a relatively sheltered beach in the south of the island at a freshwater seepage. Shore dock is one of the primary reasons for the selection of the Isles of Scilly as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Annet is the ″British stronghold″ for the lichen Roccella fuciformis.A description of the island by Hilda Quick, a former resident of St Agnes published in 1964 is still relevant today:Many people are disappointed at being unable to visit the famous bird sanctuary, but in fact, there is very little to see there by day. There will be shearwater corpses lying about, (victims of the gulls) several large colonies of gulls, some oystercatchers, <b>rock</b> <b>pipits,</b> and wrens. The walking on the island is horrid, much of it over loose stones hidden in long grass, some bramble and bracken, and awkward great clumps of thrift. What Annet is famous for is its colonies of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels; but since they nest underground, and only come and go in the dark, there is nothing to be seen of them by day. One has to camp out for the night, which is often a chilly process, and requires special permission. The puffins that [...] to breed there in such numbers that their bodies were used for paying rent are now few, and can best be seen from a boat as they swim on the water.|$|R
5|$|Rare vagrant species {{spotted in}} the area include lesser yellowlegs, white-rumped sandpiper, Pallid Harrier (in spring) and Richard's pipit (in autumn). The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared and stock doves, whitethroat, linnet, stonechat, dunnock and <b>rock</b> <b>pipit.</b> There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's feeding {{habitat is}} rocky coasts, {{rather than the}} damp {{grassland}} favoured by the water pipit. The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> feeds mainly on invertebrates, seeking out most of its prey on foot, only occasionally flying to catch insects. It will venture into shallow water as it follows retreating waves, and may take advantage of human activity that exposes sea slaters or other species that hide under stones.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's {{subspecies}} Anthus petrosus littoralis {{in summer}} plumage is particularly close in outward appearance {{to the water}} pipit. The <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and the songs are also different. The species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in the same general area.|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} {{dominated}} on its southern side {{by a large}} hill, the southern slope of which and the quarry at its western end form the Uphill Cliff Site of Special Scientific Interest, notable for its species-rich calcareous grassland. It consists of species-rich calcareous grassland and rock-face situated on Carboniferous Limestone. Steeper banks and knolls in the grassland have a flora which includes orchids, Somerset Hair Grass (Koeleria vallesiana), and Honewort (Trinia glauca), and the Goldilocks Aster (Galatella linosyris) along with several species of butterfly and Weevil (Curculionoidea). The hill and Walborough common, which are adjacent to each other, are local nature reserves making a total area of 38.14 ha. There are a range of flowers including cowslip, primrose and green-winged orchid. The Salt marsh has sea barley, slender hare's-ear and sea clover and limestone grassland with Somerset hair-grass, honewort, green-winged and early purple orchids. These attract redshank, dunlin, shelduck, black-tailed godwit, skylark, linnet, <b>rock</b> and meadow <b>pipit.</b>|$|R
40|$|On April 3 rd 2016 three empty {{shells of}} the Pulmonate two-toothed white snail were found washed ashore in a shell grit bank {{at the eastern}} border of the nature reserve Baai van Heist (municipality Knokke-Heist). One subadult {{specimen}} was clearly an old shell, very probably of fossil Pleistocene or Holocene origin. The other two snails (1 subad. and 1 juvenile) showed small traces of weathering but certainly had a recent appearance. This prompted our presumption that the species could possibly live in situ in the Baai van Heist. On September 19 th 2016 we searched for the species along the eastern mole of the outer port of Zeebrugge, situated within the reserve. At two localities in the mediolittoral zone we could find various live specimens of A. bidentata under stones. The features of the habitats {{in which they have}} been found were in conformity with those known from the literature. Moreover we could ascertain that two-toothed white snails living nearer to the coastline occurred lower beneath the mean tide level than their congeners from a more seaward finding spot. Most of the snails were dwelling on the substrate under stones. We also noticed that larger shell fragments, mainly from mussels, created small cavities under the stones. These could serve as shelter or air-chamber to provide oxygen for respiration. For the first time A. bidentata is now recorded alive along the Belgian coast. On the same day we found a fresh empty shell of the multi-toothed mouse-eared snail Myosotella denticulata in a shell grit bank at the shore of the Baai van Heist. We presume that this species may also live in this nature reserve under similar environmental conditions as the two-toothed white snail. So far however, it has not been discovered in situ. In Belgium this species is known from the IJzer estuary, but it is new to {{the eastern part of the}} coast. From the late 1960 s until the 1990 s the beach area of the Baai van Heist was repeatedly raised with sand dredged offshore of the harbour of Zeebrugge. In grit banks consisting of shells and debris washed out from these sediments, empty specimens of the mouseeared snail Myosotella myosotis have been found on rare occasions. These were clearly old shells of a fossil nature, presumed of Pleistocene (Eemian) and/or Holocene age. Nowadays an embryonic saltmarsh is developping in the Baai van Heist which will create potential habitats for mouse-eared snails. Up to now the species has not yet been observed living on this site. Regarding the foraging behaviour of A. bidentata it is assumed that she is a selective deposit feeder, mainly browsing on sediment particles (epipsammic browsing). Perhaps the snail also browses the epilithic microflora and -fauna from stones, on which she often dwells. Characteristic for the three Ellobiidae is that specimens as from 2. 5 whorls onward the columella in the top of the spire is resorbed. By this a small cavity develops in the snail's shell. We wonder if this cavity has a function in the life of the animals. For instance it may serve as a kind of float for local dispersal or as an air reservoir for respiration during flood at high tide. We further ask ourselves how A. bidentata, considering her non-planktonic life cycle, could have colonized the Baai van Heist. We suggest two possible dispersal mechanisms: rafting and kinds of zoochory. The latter can take place via birds foraging in the snail's habitat, especially turnstones and <b>rock</b> <b>pipits.</b> Also other bird species may be eligible for zoochory, e. g. oystercatcher, curlew, herring gull and possibly some songbirds which occasionally dwell in the intertidal area during migration or in the winter season...|$|R
5|$|The water pipit's feeding {{habitat is}} damp grassland, {{rather than the}} rocky coasts favoured by the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit.</b> The water pipit feeds mainly {{on a wide range}} of invertebrates, {{including}} crickets and grasshoppers, beetles, snails, millipedes and spiders. Barkflies, true flies, caterpillars and homopterans can form a large part of the diet of fledglings. Birds close to snow fields take insects specialised for that habitat such as the springtails Isotoma saltans (the glacier flea) and I. nivalis, and the scorpion fly Boreus izyemalis.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit.</b> The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is almost}} entirely coastal, frequenting rocky areas {{typically}} below , although on St Kilda it breeds at up to [...] The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is not troubled by wind or rain, although it avoids very exposed situations. It may occur further inland in winter or on migration.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is from Latin. Anthus is the name given by Pliny the Elder to a small bird of grasslands, and the specific petrosus means [...] "rocky", from petrus, [...] "rock".|$|E
500|$|The first formal {{description}} naming this species was by English naturalist George Montagu in 1798. It {{had previously been}} described in 1766 by Thomas Pennant, in {{the first edition of}} British Zoology, although he did not distinguish it from the common titlark (meadow pipit). It was first shown to be different from that species by John Walcott in the 1789 edition of his Synopsis of British Birds, in which he called it the sea lark. John Latham was the first to give the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> a scientific name, Alauda obscura in 1790, but the specimen he examined had been misidentified as to the species and was in fact a dusky lark. In the same year, Montagu, whom Latham had consulted about the bird, discovered the Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> on the coast of South Wales, where it was known to some fishermen in the region as the [...] "rock lark". He adopted that name for the species and gave it the scientific name Alauda petrosus.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is highly}} {{territorial}} in the breeding season, {{and throughout the}} year where it is resident. Breeding males have a song display in which they fly to [...] above the ground, then circle or descend {{to the ground with}} a fluttering [...] "parachute" [...] flight. Territorial males will sometimes enter the territory of an adjacent male to cooperate in evicting an intruder. This behaviour, which requires the ability to distinguish the resident from the intruder, is otherwise only known from the African fiddler crab.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian <b>rock</b> <b>pipit</b> is [...] {{long and}} weighs [...] The {{nominate}} race has smoky-olive upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and buff underparts, heavily marked with poorly defined brown streaks. The legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish, {{and there is}} a pale eye-ring. The sexes are alike; although males average slightly brighter than females, the overlap is complete and birds cannot be sexed on appearance or measurements. Immature birds resemble the adult, although they may sometimes be browner and more streaked above, looking superficially similar to meadow pipits.|$|E
