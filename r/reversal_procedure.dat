PATIENTS AND METHODS: 36 patients (19 men, aged 55. 71 + 1. 5 years) underwent laparoscopic-assisted <b>reversal</b> <b>procedures</b> in May 2008 - June 2010. The comparable control {{group consisted of}} 35 patients (16 men, aged 51. 5 + 13. 9 years). RESULTS: operation time was 179. 5 + 65. 1 min, 266. 9 + 71. 8 min in controls. Blood loss was 64. 7 + 33. 7 ml, 181. 8 + 120. 4 ml in controls. No conversions occurred in the main group. In three patients of the main group preventive ileostomy was performed. There were 11 diverting stomas in the control group. Postoperative hospital stays were 9. 1 + 2. 7 days (12. 9 + 3. 4 days in controls). There were 2 (5. 9 %) postoperative complications in the main group: one wound infection and one parastomal fistula. No mortality occurred.

Because {{of the difficulty of}} the <b>procedure,</b> laparoscopic <b>reversal</b> of Hartmann's <b>procedure</b> is not well established. We describe our experience with this laparoscopic procedure to assess its difficulty and safety. Five patients (4 men and 1 woman) underwent laparoscopic <b>reversal</b> of Hartmann's <b>procedure</b> (LRHP). The initial surgeries were performed to manage obstructive colorectal cancer for 4 patients, and rectovesical fistula for one patient. The procedure was laparoscopically completed for 4 patients. Conversion to open laparotomy was required for one patient, secondary to massive adhesion in lower abdomen. Transient ileostomies were made in 2 cases. Operative time ranged from 240 to 545 minutes. There was no operative mortality. LRHP can be performed safely by an experienced surgeon. However, it is still technically challenging and time consuming.

40|$|Several {{instructions}} need to {{be considered}} in order to transfer classical error correction techniques to the quantum regime. The quantum error correction field has been developed to face these issues. One of the common source of errors in quantum systems is environment decoherence. Due to interaction with the environment, the quantum states of a system entangle with the environment and are subject to decoherence. In this thesis, we mainly focused on the amplitude damping {{which is one of the}} most important models of decoherence processes.

40|$|Background: The Hartmann's operation, {{although}} {{less frequently}} performed today, is still used when initial colonic anastomosis is too risky {{in the short}} term. However, the subsequent procedure to restore gastrointestinal continuity is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients and Methods: The review of an institutional review board (IRB) -approved prospectively maintained database provided data on the Hartmann's <b>reversal</b> <b>procedure</b> performed by either laparoscopic or open technique at our institution. The data collected included: demographic data, operative approach, conversion for laparoscopic cases and perioperative morbidity and mortality. Results: Over a 14 -year period from January 1997 to August 2011, 74 Hartmann's reversal procedures were performed (laparoscopic surgery— 49, open surgery— 25). The average age was 55 years for the laparoscopic and 57 years for the open surgery group, respectively. Male patients represent 61 % of both groups. There {{was no significant difference}} in operative time between the two groups (149 min vs 151 min; P = 0. 95), and there was a tendency to lower morbidity (3 / 49 — 7. 3 % vs 4 / 25 — 16 %; P = 0. 24) in the laparoscopic surgery group. In the laparoscopic group, eight patients (16. 3 %) were converted to open surgery, mostly due to severe adhesions. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter for the laparoscopic group (5 days vs 7 days; P = 0. 44). Conclusions: The Hartmann's <b>reversal</b> <b>procedure</b> can be safely performed in the majority of the cases using a laparoscopic approach with a low morbidity rate and achieving a shorter hospital stay...|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} of attentional processes in interval timing was investigated, both behaviorally and pharmacologically, in rats trained on 10 -sec and 30 -sec peak-interval timing procedures. Three behavioral procedures were used: standard peak-interval, prior-entry, and prior-entry reversal. Brain levels of norepinephrine were manipulated using the α₂-agonist clonidine (0. 025 mg/kg i. p.) and the α₂-antagonist idazoxan (2 mg/kg i. p.). In the prior-entry procedure a cue {{of the same}} modality as the signal to be timed preceded signal presentation, in the prior-entry <b>reversal</b> <b>procedure</b> the cue was of a different modality from the signal to be timed, and in the standard peak-interval procedure a cue was not presented. Relative to the peak-interval procedure the rats showed a horizontal rightward shift in their peak functions for the prior-entry <b>reversal</b> <b>procedure.</b> The α₂-agonist clonidine caused a rightward shift in peak functions for all behavioral procedures. The α₂-antagonist idazoxan also caused an unexpected horizontal rightward shift in peak functions. These horizontal shifts may be interpreted {{within the framework of}} an increase (rightward shift) in the latency to start the internal clock that is influenced both by the attentional demands of the task and the effective level of brain norepinephrine. The presentation of a cue directs the rat's attention toward a particular signal modality. If the cue directs attention to a different modality from the subsequently presented timing signal the rat takes longer to notice the signal. The effect of clonidine administration implicates the noradrenergic system in the attentional aspect of interval timing and also provides further support for the role of norepinephrine in general attentional processing...|$|E

Clinical factors including patient comorbidities were analysed to elucidate what preoperative factors were associated with complications following <b>reversal</b> of Hartmann's <b>procedure.</b> RESULTS: One hundred and ten patients were included. Median age was 70 years and 56 % of the cohort were male (n = 61). The mortality and morbidity rate for the acute presentation was 7. 3 % (n = 8) and 34 % (n = 37) respectively. Seventy six patients (69 %) underwent a reversal at a median of 7 months (range 3 - 22 months) post-Hartmann's procedure. The complication rate in the reversal group was 25 % (n = 18). A history of current smoking (p = 0. 004), increasing time to reversal (p = 0. 04) and low preoperative albumin (p = 0. 003) were all associated with complications following reversal.
