25|$|Merle Ronald Haggard (April 6, 1937– April 6, 2016) was an American country singer, songwriter, guitarist, and fiddler. Along with Buck Owens, Haggard and {{his band}} the Strangers helped create the Bakersfield sound, which is {{characterized}} by the twang of Fender Telecaster and the unique mix with the traditional country steel guitar sound, new vocal harmony styles in which the words are minimal, and a <b>rough</b> <b>edge</b> not heard on the more polished Nashville sound recordings of the same era.|$|E
25|$|Architecturally speaking, the Behistun {{inscription}} is {{a massive}} project, that entailed cutting into the <b>rough</b> <b>edge</b> of the mountain {{in order to create}} bas-relief figures as seen in the pictures above. The Behistun mountain, rises up to some 1700 feet as part of the Zagros mountain chains in Iran. The mountain's location is ideal being close to both Ecbatana and Babylonia. The bas-relief itself is located some 300 feet above the base of the mountain. The figures represent two of the king's soldiers, the king himself standing over a fallen usurper and captives of several nations possibly dissidents, or co-conspirators. The inscription itself is written in cuneiform character in Old Persian, Babylonian, and Median.|$|E
25|$|Wrist-length mittens {{used to be}} {{commonly}} made of seal or caribou {{skin with}} the fur and the <b>rough</b> <b>edge</b> of the seam on the outside. Sealskin mittens were frequently made from leftover pieces of skin after boots were cut from them. The back and palm were separate pieces and the thumb one piece; gloves were unknown. Women wore fur mittens reaching nearly to the elbow with wolverine trim along the upper edge. Mittens of silver salmon skins which reached to the elbow were worn by men when hunting in a kayak in spring. The fish were cut down the back and the belly skins used for mittens. These sometimes were lined with grass or had grass mittens, woven all in one piece, inside; often they had a border of bleached sealskin. The combination of fish skin mittens with grass padding was less bulky for paddling than fur mittens. According to Curtis (1930, p.11), mittens of dehaired sealskin that reached barely to the wrist were also worn by men in the spring.|$|E

500|$|The <b>rough</b> <b>edge</b> of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some but an {{attraction}} to others. Joyce Carol Oates wrote: [...] "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, {{the effect was}} dramatic and electrifying." [...] Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate {{as well as his}} lover. Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts. [...] "It didn't take long before people got it, that he was pretty damned special," [...] says Baez.|$|E
2500|$|GamesRadar {{particularly}} {{singled out}} the body-switching event between Serge and Lynx {{as one of}} their [...] "Gaming's Most Satisfying Character Switches", with David Roberts praising the game in how it handled how differently characters interact with the player depending on the body being controlled at the time. The switch and its after-effects were also singled out by Tieryas as a standout moment, praising how the change in perspective shook up the game flow with Serge having to deal with the aftermath of Lynx's harsh prior actions to people, favorably comparing it to the film Face/Off. Other journalists found Kid {{to be more of a}} standout character. Trent Steely of RPGamer selected her as his pick for outstanding female character in RPGs, stating that [...] "Kid deserves to be appreciated for her innate attributes. She truly cares for those around her, in spite of her <b>rough</b> <b>edge</b> and disdain towards authority. She also exhibits great strength and often pushes people to do the right thing. It's for those reasons why Kid deserves to be recognized as one of the better female RPG characters of our time. Jeremy Peeples of Hardcore Gamer deemed her his favorite character out of the 45 person cast, praising the stark contrast between her pleasant exterior and her difficult past of growing up homeless and living a difficult life, comparing her similarly to Aerith from Final Fantasy VII as being a character that the player would bond with and be disappointed when story events take her out of the player's party.|$|E

So, with hands bound, making an effort, he got on his feet, and went and worked the cord against the <b>rough</b> <b>edge</b> of an old wall. The rope, being of a kind of plaited grass, soon frayed and broke, and he freed himself. He had various contusions. His arms were hurt and bruised from the bonds. He rubbed them slowly. Then he pulled his clothes straight, stooped, put on his cap, struggled into his overcoat, and walked away.|$|E

From my note-book I tore out a page, {{and from the}} ammunition box took a shot-gun shell. Removing the wads from the latter with my knife, I emptied the powder on a flat rock. Next I pried the primer, or cap, from the shell, {{and laid it on}} the rock, {{in the midst of the}} scattered powder. All was ready. Maud still watched from the tent. Holding the paper in my left hand, I smashed down upon the cap with a rock held in my right.

Disregarding the possibilities of the ice-run, they had fittingly demonstrated their inefficiency by their choice of the island on which they located. Montana Kid, though possessing little knowledge of the break-up of a great river, looked about him dubiously, and cast yearning glances at the distant bank where the towering bluffs promised immunity from all the ice of the Northland.|$|E

60|$|Once again, setting {{her teeth}} {{because of the}} agony that the touch of the marble gave to her raw and swollen flesh, Miriam began to fret the cords which bound her wrists against the <b>rough</b> <b>edge</b> of the angle-iron. She was {{sure that it was}} nearly worn through, but oh! how could she endure the agony until it parted? Still she did endure, for at her feet lay the bottle, and burning thirst drove her to the deed. Suddenly her reward came, and she felt that her arms were free; yes, numbed, swollen and bleeding, they fell against her sides, {{wrenching}} the stiffened muscles of her shoulders back to their place in such a fashion that she well-nigh fainted with the pain. Still they were free, and presently she was able to lift them, {{and with the help of}} her teeth to loose the ends of the cord, so that the blood could run once more through her blackened wrists and hands. Again she waited till some feeling had come back into her fingers, which were numb and like to mortify. Then she knelt down, and drawing the leather bottle to her, held it between her palms, while, with her teeth, she undid its thong. The task was hard, for it was well tied, but at length the knots gave, and Miriam drank. So fearful was her thirst that she could have emptied the bottle at a draught, but this she, who had lived in the desert, was too wise to do, for she knew that it might kill her. Also when that was gone there was no more. So she drank half of it in slow sips, then tied the string as well as she was able and set it down again.|$|E

[...] These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep [...] Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame, [...] Which into hallow Engins long and round [...] Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire [...] Dilated and infuriate shall send forth [...] From far with thundring noise among our foes [...] Such implements of mischief as shall dash [...] To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands [...] Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd [...] 490 [...] The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.

[...] Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, [...] None arguing stood, innumerable hands [...] Were ready, in a moment up they turnd [...] Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath [...] 510 [...] Th' originals of Nature in thir crude [...] Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame [...] They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art, [...] Concocted and adusted they reduc'd [...] To blackest grain, and into store conveyd: [...] Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth [...] Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, [...] Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls [...] Of missive ruin; part incentive reed [...] Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. [...] 520 [...] So all ere day spring, under conscious Night [...] Secret they finish'd, and in order set, [...] With silent circumspection unespi'd. [...] Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd [...] Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms [...] The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood [...] Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, [...] Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills [...] Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, [...] Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, [...] 530 [...] Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, [...] In motion or in alt: him soon they met [...] Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow [...] But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail [...] Zephiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, [...] Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd. [...] Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, [...] Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit [...] This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud [...] He comes, and settl'd in his face I see [...] 540 [...] Sad resolution and secure: let each [...] His Adamantine coat gird well, and each [...] Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, [...] Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, [...] If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, [...] But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. [...] So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon [...] In order, quit of all impediment; [...] Instant without disturb they took Allarm, [...] And onward move Embattelld; when behold [...] 550 [...] Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe [...] Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube [...] Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd [...] On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, [...] To hide the fraud. At interview both stood [...] A while, but suddenly at head appeerd [...] Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. [...] Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; [...] That all may see who hate us, how we seek [...] Peace and composure, and with open brest [...] 560 [...] Stand readie to receive them, if they like [...] Our overture, and turn not back perverse; [...] But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, [...] Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge [...] Freely our part: yee who appointed stand [...] Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch [...] What we propound, and loud that all may hear. [...] So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce [...] Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front [...] Divided, and to either Flank retir'd. [...] 570 [...] Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, [...] A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid [...] On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd [...] Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr [...] With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd) [...] Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes [...] With hideous orifice gap't on us wide, [...] Portending hollow truce; at each behind [...] A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed [...] Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, [...] 580 [...] Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, [...] Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds [...] Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd [...] With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, [...] But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd, [...] From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar [...] Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, [...] And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule [...] Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail [...] Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host [...] 590 [...] Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, [...] That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, [...] Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell [...] By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd; [...] The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might [...] Have easily as Spirits evaded swift [...] By quick contraction or remove; but now [...] Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; [...] Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. [...] What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse [...] 600 [...] Repeated, and indecent overthrow [...] Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, [...] And to thir foes a laughter; for in view [...] Stood rankt of Seraphim another row [...] In posture to displode thir second tire [...] Of Thunder: back defeated to return [...] They worse abhorr'd. Satan beheld thir plight, [...] And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. [...] O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? [...] Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, [...] 610 [...] To entertain them fair with open Front [...] And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms [...] Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, [...] Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, [...] As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd [...] Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps [...] For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose [...] If our proposals once again were heard [...] We should compel them to a quick result. [...] To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood. [...] 620 [...] Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, [...] Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, [...] Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, [...] And stumbl'd many, who receives them right, [...] Had need from head to foot well understand; [...] Not understood, this gift they have besides, [...] They shew us when our foes walk not upright. [...] So they among themselves in pleasant veine [...] Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond [...] All doubt of Victorie, eternal might [...] 630 [...] To match with thir inventions they presum'd [...] So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, [...] And all his Host derided, while they stood [...] A while in trouble; but they stood not long, [...] Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms [...] Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. [...] Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power [...] Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) [...] Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills [...] (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n [...] 640 [...] Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) [...] Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, [...] From thir foundations loosning to and fro [...] They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, [...] Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops [...] Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, [...] Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, [...] When coming towards them so dread they saw [...] The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, [...] Till on those cursed Engins triple-row [...] 650 [...] They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence [...] Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, [...] Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads [...] Main Promontories flung, which in the Air [...] Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, [...] Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd [...] Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain [...] Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, [...] Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind [...] Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, [...] 660 [...] Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. [...] The rest in imitation to like Armes [...] Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; [...] So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills [...] Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire, [...] That under ground they fought in dismal shade; [...] Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game [...] To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt [...] Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n [...] Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred, [...] 670 [...] Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits [...] Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, [...] Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen [...] This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: [...] That his great purpose he might so fulfill, [...] To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd [...] Upon his enemies, and to declare [...] All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son [...] Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. [...] Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd, [...] 680 [...] Son in whose face invisible is beheld [...] Visibly, what by Deitie I am, [...] And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, [...] Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, [...] Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n, [...] Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame [...] These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, [...] As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd; [...] For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, [...] Equal in their Creation they were form'd, [...] 690 [...] Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought [...] Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; [...] Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last [...] Endless, and no solution will be found: [...] Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do, [...] And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, [...] With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes [...] Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. [...] Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; [...] For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr [...] 700 [...] Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine [...] Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou [...] Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace [...] Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know [...] In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, [...] And this perverse Commotion governd thus, [...] To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir [...] Of all things, to be Heir and to be King [...] By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. [...] Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, [...] 710 [...] Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles [...] That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, [...] My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms [...] Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; [...] Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out [...] From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep: [...] There let them learn, as likes them, to despise [...] God and Messiah his anointed King. [...] He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct [...] Shon full, he all his Father full exprest [...] 720 [...] Ineffably into his face receiv'd, [...] And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. [...] O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones, [...] First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst [...] To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, [...] As is most just; this I my Glorie account, [...] My exaltation, and my whole delight, [...] That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will [...] Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. [...] Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, [...] 730 [...] And gladlier shall resign, when in the end [...] Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee [...] For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: [...] But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on [...] Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, [...] Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, [...] Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, [...] To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down [...] To chains of Darkness, and th' undying Worm, [...] That from thy just obedience could revolt, [...] 740 [...] Whom to obey is happiness entire. [...] Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure [...] Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount [...] Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, [...] Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. [...] So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose [...] From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, [...] And the third sacred Morn began to shine [...] Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound [...] The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, [...] 750 [...] Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, [...] It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd [...] By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each [...] Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all [...] And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels [...] Of Beril, and careering Fires between; [...] Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, [...] Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure [...] Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. [...] Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd [...] 760 [...] Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, [...] Ascended, at his right hand Victorie [...] Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow [...] And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, [...] And from about him fierce Effusion rowld [...] Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; [...] Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, [...] He onward came, farr off his coming shon, [...] And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) [...] Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: [...] 770 [...] Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime [...] On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd. [...] Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own [...] First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, [...] When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz'd [...] Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n: [...] Under whose Conduct Michael soon reduc'd [...] His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing, [...] Under thir Head imbodied all in one. [...] Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd; [...] 780 [...] At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd [...] Each to his place, they heard his voice and went [...] Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd, [...] And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd. [...] This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur'd, [...] And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers [...] Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. [...] In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? [...] But to convince the proud what Signs availe, [...] Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent? [...] 790 [...] They hard'nd more by what might most reclame, [...] Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight [...] Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, [...] Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud [...] Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile [...] Against God and Messiah, or to fall [...] In universal ruin last, and now [...] To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, [...] Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God [...] To all his Host on either hand thus spake. [...] 800 [...] Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand [...] Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest; [...] Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God [...] Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, [...] And as ye have receivd, so have ye don [...] Invincibly; but of this cursed crew [...] The punishment to other hand belongs, [...] Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; [...] Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd [...] Nor multitude, stand onely and behold [...] 810 [...] Gods indignation on these Godless pourd [...] By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd, [...] Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, [...] Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream [...] Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, [...] Hath honourd me according to his will. [...] Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; [...] That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee [...] In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, [...] Or I alone against them, since by strength [...] 820 [...] They measure all, of other excellence [...] Not emulous, nor care who them excells; [...] Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. [...] So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd [...] His count'nance too severe to be beheld [...] And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. [...] At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings [...] With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes [...] Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound [...] Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. [...] 830 [...] Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, [...] Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles [...] The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, [...] All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon [...] Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand [...] Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent [...] Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd [...] Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, [...] All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; [...] O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode [...] 840 [...] Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, [...] That wish'd the Mountains now might be again [...] Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. [...] Nor less on either side tempestuous fell [...] His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure, [...] Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels, [...] Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, [...] One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye [...] Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire [...] Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, [...] 850 [...] And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, [...] Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. [...] Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd [...] His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant [...] Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n: [...] The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard [...] Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd [...] Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd [...] With terrors and with furies to the bounds [...] And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide, [...] 860 [...] Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd [...] Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight [...] Strook them with horror backward, but far worse [...] Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw [...] Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth [...] Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. [...] Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw [...] Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled [...] Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep [...] Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. [...] 870 [...] Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, [...] And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall [...] Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout [...] Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last [...] Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, [...] Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire [...] Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. [...] Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird [...] Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. [...] Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes [...] 880 [...] Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: [...] To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood [...] Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, [...] With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went, [...] Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, [...] Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, [...] Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n, [...] Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode [...] Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts [...] And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd [...] 890 [...] On high; who into Glorie him receav'd, [...] Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. [...] Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth [...] At thy request, and that thou maist beware [...] By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd [...] What might have else to human Race bin hid; [...] The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n [...] Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall [...] Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld [...] With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, [...] 900 [...] Who now is plotting how he may seduce [...] Thee also from obedience, that with him [...] Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake [...] His punishment, Eternal miserie; [...] Which would be all his solace and revenge, [...] As a despite don against the most High, [...] Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. [...] But list'n not to his Temptations, warne [...] Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard [...] By terrible Example the reward [...] 910 [...] Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, [...] Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.|$|E
