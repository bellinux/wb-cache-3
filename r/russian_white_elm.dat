40|$|European <b>White</b> <b>Elm</b> is {{recognized}} as a rare and endangered species in the forest fund of the Republic of Serbia. During the past century massive drying of elms occurred and the indications of their extinction appeared, which consequently led {{to a reduction in}} genetic diversity and the danger of genetic drift. In the area of the Great War Island near Belgrade we found 56 trees of European <b>White</b> <b>Elm</b> that are spatially divided into three subpopulations. In order to assess the genetic potential of European <b>White</b> <b>Elm</b> in the Great War Island and to define adequate conservation measures variability of 14 selected test trees progeny was rated. Results shows that the satisfactory variability within the popoulation exists, which is a good basis for the conservation of genepool available...|$|R

5000|$|The White [...] "Siberian Cat" [...] was mated to Myemgay Yuri, a blue male. She {{produced}} two white kittens, the best was kept and named White Rose (female) and this cat was the foundation female for the <b>Russian</b> <b>White.</b> White Rose was mated back to Myemgay Yuri producing two first generation <b>White</b> <b>Russian</b> kittens. The only line of whites from this mating {{that we are}} aware of is Myemgay Arctic Girl (female) the first generation <b>Russian</b> <b>White.</b> She was mated to Myemgay Little Lemon (blue) and produced Myemgay Arctic Star (female 2nd generation <b>Russian</b> <b>White).</b> Arctic Star was mated back to Myemgay Yuri (blue) and produced Myemgay Arctic Snowflake (female 3rd generation <b>Russian</b> <b>White).</b> Arctic Snowflake was mated to Eastern Ninotchka (blue) and produced Myemgay Arctic Kosack (male 4th generation <b>Russian</b> <b>White).</b>|$|R

40|$|Principles of the {{conservation}} of genetic resources of elms (Ulmus spp) do not differ fundamentally from the general principles accepted for {{the conservation}} of genetic resources of other common Noble Hardwoods. Efficient conservation can best be achieved through appropriate combination of in situ and ex situ methods, which have distinct advantages. Besides that, ex situ conservation is employed when emergency measures are needed for rare endangered populations and when populations are too small to be managed in situ (e. g. risks of genetic drift and inbreeding). The aim of our research is ex situ conservation of genetic resources of field elm {Ulmus minor Mill) and European <b>white</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus laevis Pall) through establishment of field genebanks. Sampling was conducted in one population of field elm and one population of <b>white</b> <b>elm.</b> Plant material (buds) from 8 trees of field elm and 10 trees of <b>white</b> <b>elm</b> was used for in vitro production of clones. Obtained clones will be used for establishment of field genebanks on the experimental estate of the Institute of Lowland Forestry and Environment...|$|R
