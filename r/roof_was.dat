5|$|During World War II, the Allied bombing {{campaign}} and fierce {{fighting in the}} Battle of Berlin caused severe damage; the <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> almost completely destroyed as were the statues above the rear entrance, and there was substantial water damage. In {{the first phase of}} reconstruction in 1951, the statue of the goddess of Fortuna was removed, and is assumed to have been smelted in 1962. The remaining statues, urns, and other carvings on the exterior were removed in 1976–77 due to rain damage. It was completely refurbished in the 1990s and exterior restoration required replacement of some 180 sculptural elements, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures and one of the columns. The original mansard <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed in 1998–99.|$|E
5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out {{beginning}} in 1825. The floor-level was raised above flood-level, a full three feet. The <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt, the south wall was rebuilt using the original materials, and the main features of the 12th-century chancel arch were discarded.|$|E
5000|$|Roofs: Flat <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> {{uncommon}} while gabled <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> almost omnipresent {{in traditional}} Chinese architecture. <b>Roofs</b> <b>are</b> either built on roof cross-beams or rest directly on vertical structural beams. In higher class construction, <b>roof</b> supporting beams <b>are</b> supported through complex dougong bracketing systems that indirectly connect {{them to the}} primary structural beams. Three main types of <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> found: ...|$|R

5|$|Rosenborg had {{originally}} planned to build additional commercial facilities and a tower hotel during the 2002 construction, {{but this was}} canceled. At the 2011 annual meeting, the plans were again launched by Skutle, who stated that construction might start as early as 2011. In March 2005, Rosenborg announced {{plans to build a}} retractable roof over the pitch and lay artificial turf. The <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> estimated to cost NOK100 million, and the club estimated that it could generate NOK30 million per year in increased revenue from concerts and events. By 2007, the roof plans were delayed, with management stating that it would be necessary to complete the construction of all stands before a <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> built, and that they believed the stadium would soon be expanded.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry did not {{question}} or raise {{concern with the}} areas of slab removal during original construction in 1980 when escalators were installed after the <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> completed. It is unclear {{if this was a}} contributing factor.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} damaged {{several times during}} the Blitz in 1940. Part of the Great Hall's <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> destroyed, and a bomb landed between {{platforms}} 2 and 3, destroying offices and part of the hotel.|$|E
5000|$|A flat <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> a <b>roof</b> which <b>is</b> almost {{level in}} {{contrast}} to the many types of sloped roofs. The slope of a <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> properly known as its pitch and flat roofs have up to approximately 10°. Flat <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> an ancient form mostly used in arid climates and allow the <b>roof</b> space to <b>be</b> used as a living space or a living roof. Flat roofs, or [...] "low-slope" [...] <b>roofs,</b> <b>are</b> also commonly found on commercial buildings throughout the world. The National Roofing Contractors Association defines a low-slope roof as having a slope of 3-in-12 or less.|$|R

5|$|After its completion, Winslow Ames {{used the}} house as a rental {{property}} until 1949 {{when he went to}} work in a museum in Springfield, Missouri. The house was sold to Connecticut College. Connecticut College continued to rent it to staff and students until 2004, when plans were made to demolish the house. Changing the flat roof to a gable <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> a significant alteration from the original plan; the date of the alteration is unknown, but it preceded 1995.|$|E
5|$|British Railways {{electrified}} {{the former}} LTSR line in 1959. Electric services began on 6 November 1961 {{and a full}} electric timetable was introduced on 18 June the following year. In the 1980s, the station <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> dismantled and high-rise office blocks were built above the station leaving the 1854 facade intact.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{residents}} of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to restore Old Pine Church: the church's original windows were repaired and the unpainted weatherboards painted; a new <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> installed and the original wood floor replaced. The boarding room addition was probably removed (nothing of it now remains) and the pressed metal ceiling may have been added.|$|E
25|$|Mansard <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> used on {{vertical}} {{or nearly}} vertical surfaces. For the most part, these <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> based on standing seam or batten seam construction.|$|R

50|$|Reflective heat {{reduction}} roofing or a cool <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> {{most beneficial}} in hot sunny climates. If a home's <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> partially or completely shaded, the homeowner may not benefit {{as much as}} someone with a <b>roof</b> that <b>is</b> in direct sunlight. However even if a homeowner's <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> shaded, they will still receive the tax credit, receive benefit of heat reduction roofing, and enjoy a high quality environmentally friendly roof.|$|R
5|$|In World War II the {{building}} suffered some damage during the Allied bombing campaign, but was later severely damaged during the Battle for Berlin {{towards the end}} of the war. The <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> almost completely destroyed by fire and there was substantial water damage. The statues above the rear entrance, on Klosterstraße, were also destroyed. Assessments estimated that 50% of {{the building}} had suffered damage.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s the mayor's {{office was}} refurbished, a new <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> installed, and new trees were {{planted on the}} grounds. In 1964, the city remodeled the City Council {{chambers}} on {{the second and third}} floors. Part of the work was to install new lighting to allow television broadcasts from the chamber, while other work added drop tiles to the ceiling, hiding the domed roof.|$|E
5|$|Pub – The White Horse in {{the village}} centre is a popular pub across the island. It {{suffered}} a fire in 1987, then again 20 years later in 2007 which saw its temporary closure. Prior to the two fires, the pub was thatched, however after the fire in 2007, a tiled <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> built, {{in an attempt to}} prevent future fires.|$|E

5|$|Seddon {{thought that}} the church had once been much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and {{proposed}} inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work. This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|St. Vincent and the Grenadines {{were heavily}} damaged, {{especially}} {{compared to other}} islands in the area. Several hundred homes and two schools were damaged, and the Rose Hall Police Station's <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> lost. Still, the majority of damage was dealt to the agricultural industry. In all, damage to the islands totaled $40million (2002USD, $47million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} has undergone various extensions and alterations {{since it was}} built. The {{building has}} a T shaped plan with the west projecting wing being a hall added in the late 13th century. The great hall has a 15th-century four bay open arch-braced collar-truss timber roof. The <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> covered with slate from local quarries until it was thatched in the mid 19th century. The current clay tiles {{were used in the}} early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of a <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> to resist water. Two broad categories of <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> flat and pitched. Flat roofs actually slope up to 10° or 15° but are built to resist standing water. Pitched <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> designed to shed water but not resist standing water which can occur during wind-driven rain or ice damming. Typically residential, pitched <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> covered with an underlayment material beneath the roof covering material as a second line of defense. Domestic roof construction may also be ventilated to help remove moisture from leakage and condensation.|$|R
40|$|Distribution of {{stresses}} about rectangular openings excavated in {{bedded rock}} was investigated {{by means of}} photoelastic experiments using 37 kinds of models made of gelatine jelly. By those model experiments, influence of ratio of the breadth to {{the height of the}} opening, thickness and elastic modulus of immediate roof and high roof, thickness of packs in the goaf, and fissures contained in the immediate roof or the high roof on the distribution of stresses around the opening was studied. Influence of the thickness of immediate roof, height of caved rocks in the goaf or rigidity of face props in long wall working face were investigated as well. As the results of those experiments, following conclusions were obtained : 1. The tensile stresses of the roof in the bedded rock are larger than these stresses which arise in the non-bedded rock, and the tensile stresses on the <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> larger than the tensile stresses on the floor. 2. When the immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thick, the tensile stresses on the roof and the compressive stresses on the side walls are considerably smaller than those stresses which arise when the immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thin. 3. When the high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thick, the tensile stresses on the <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> still more small, and the compressive stresses on the side walls are a little larger than these stresses which arise when the high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thin. 4. When the modulus of elasticity of the immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> large, the tensile stresses on the <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> larger and the compressive stresses on the side walls are smaller than these stresses which arise when the modulus of elastisity of the immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> large. 5. The compressive stresses on the face decrease as the thickness of the packs in the goaf increases. However, the magnitudes of tensile stresses on the roof undergo only little change. 6. When the immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> fissured, tensile stresses on the <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> almost equal to zero. 7. When the high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> fissured, the tensile stresses are larger as compared with the case in which the high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> not fissured. 8. The compressive stresses on the long wall face decrease as the height of caved rocks in the goaf increases. 9. The compressive stresses on the face decrease as the rigidity of face props increases...|$|R
50|$|A board roof or boarded <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> a <b>roofing</b> {{method of}} using boards {{as the weather}} barrier on a roof. Board <b>roofs</b> can <b>be</b> applied in several ways, the basic types have the boards {{installed}} vertically and installed horizontally. Double board <b>roofs</b> <b>were</b> sometimes used on railroad cars.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{portion of}} the {{existing}} building {{is part of the}} north tower, which was built in the late 14th century. The north aisle, together with the nave and its arcades, dates from the early 15th century, while the south aisle, with its fine hammer-beam <b>roof,</b> <b>was</b> added about 1450. The carved stone font was placed in the church soon afterwards, dating from about 1480.|$|E
5|$|The <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} thatched {{but now is}} tiled, and {{is supported}} by cruck bracing to the timber frame of six principal trusses. The design of the roof {{is similar to that}} in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton, Manor Farm, Doulting and Glastonbury itself, which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof.|$|E
5|$|The smokehouse is {{a square}} two-story {{building}} with a hipped roof, and is believed to date to the early 19th century. East of the smokehouse, a 1-story {{building with a}} three bay facade and a gabled <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> used as a post office in the late 19th century, and may {{have served as a}} schoolhouse originally. The manager's farmhouse stands 2 stories high and is L-shaped with a porch. The springhouse is also 2 stories.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the purpose}} of a <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> to protect people and their {{possessions}} from climatic elements, the insulating properties of a <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> a consideration in its structure and the choice of roofing material.|$|R
50|$|A GRP <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> a single-ply GRP {{laminate}} {{applied in}} situ over a good quality conditioned plywood or OSB deck. The <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> finished with pre-formed GRP edge trims and {{a coat of}} pre-pigmented topcoat.|$|R
50|$|A mono-pitched <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> a single-sloping <b>roof</b> surface, {{often not}} {{attached}} to another roof surface. Mono-pitched <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> {{also known as}} a pent roof, shed roof, lean-to roof, or skillion roof (in Australia). This is in contrast to a dual-pitched roof, {{also known as a}} gabled <b>roof,</b> which <b>is</b> pitched in two different directions.|$|R
