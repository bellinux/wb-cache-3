A lively era of humanism and trade was ended, a phenomenon that would affect the rest of the peninsula in the following decades.|$|E

5|$|Lekson {{developed}} a theory called the Chaco Meridian, {{which is based}} on architectural similarities between the Ancestral Puebloan sites at Aztec <b>Ruins</b> <b>and</b> Chaco Canyon, and Paquime at Casas Grandes in northern Mexico.

The Great North Road roughly follows the Chaco Meridian, and many of the ancient roads in the area appear to follow it towards key sites in the basin.|$|E

5|$|According to the Ayyubid-era chronicler and {{one-time}} {{resident of}} al-Rahba, Ibn Nazif, the fortress of al-Rahba was rebuilt again by Shirkuh's grandson, al-Mujahid Shirkuh II (r. 1186–1240), in 1207. Al-Rahba was the easternmost fortress of Shirkuh II's Homs-based emirate, {{and was one}} of the four principal centers of the emirate, the other three being Homs itself, Salamiyah and Palmyra. He personally oversaw the demolition of al-Rahba's <b>ruins</b> <b>and</b> the construction of the new fortress. Al-Rahba remained in the hands of Shirkuh's descendants until a few years after the annexation of Ayyubid Syria by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1260.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, Skopje greatly {{benefited from}} Socialist Yugoslav {{policies}} which encouraged {{industry and the}} development of Macedonian cultural institutions. Consequently, Skopje became home to a national library, a national philharmonic orchestra, a university and the Macedonian Academy. However, its post-war development was altered by the 1963 earthquake which occurred 26 July. Although relatively weak in magnitude, it caused enormous damage in the city and can be compared to the 1960 Agadir earthquake. The disaster killed 1,070 people, injuring 3,300 others. 16,000 people were buried alive in <b>ruins</b> <b>and</b> 70% of the population lost their home.

By swimming deep within the city's submerged <b>ruins</b> <b>and</b> translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks.

5|$|As Palmyra gained {{importance}} to French efforts to pacify the Syrian Desert, a base {{was constructed in}} the village near the Temple of Bel in 1921. In 1929 the general director of antiquities in Syria, Henri Arnold Seyrig, began excavating the <b>ruins</b> <b>and</b> convinced the villagers {{to move to a}} new, French-built village next to the site. The relocation was completed in 1932; ancient Palmyra was ready for excavation as its villagers settled into the new village of Tadmur. During World War II, the Mandate came under the authority of Vichy France, who gave permission to Nazi Germany to use the airfield at Palmyra; forces of Free France, backed by British forces, invaded Syria in June 1941, and on 3 July 1941, the British took control over the city {{in the aftermath of a}} battle.|$|E
