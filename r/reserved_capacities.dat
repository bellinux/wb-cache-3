40|$|Introduction Wireless ATM(WATM) {{networks}} which extend ATM capability over an {{air interface}} provide broadband and multimedia services to mobile users. In particular, mobile users maintain seamless connections through hando #s when a cell boundary is crossed. Since real-time users dislike a long hando# connection time, especially with high speed connections, a fast hando# scheme is required. Conventional management schemes to support hando# at wireline access networks are classified into two approaches. These are path rerouting and path extension approaches. For a path rerouting hando# procedure a new, optimized {{path to a}} new base station (ta is established while excluding the old connection. Acampora and Naghshineh [1] proposed a virtual connection tree(CT) which consists of a root ATM switch and BS leaves. This tree requires fixed, <b>reserved</b> <b>capacities</b> between the root and the leaves, which leads to reduce utilization of the wireline link. Yu and Leung [2] proposed a source...|$|E

These static approaches work out quite well with traditional power systems. But increasing shares of intermittent generation introduce higher volatility to today's and future power systems which leads to a more volatile need for balancing. In this paper the main influences on the occurrence of imbalances are identified. Subsequently a new method for the dimensioning of <b>reserve</b> <b>capacities</b> is presented.

30|$|WFEBC is {{a measure}} of the {{relative}} contribution of alternative supply paths to the redundancy of the network whereas the <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> associated with a link measures the maximum fraction of the demand of the critical node the network can supply following the failure of the link. Low measures of WFEBC (resp. high <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> values) indicate the availability of more alternative supply paths. Single supply paths, on the other hand, have no alternative supply routes and are expected to be identified with high criticality according to both WFEBC and <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity.</b> The following subsections describe the application of WFEBC to case studies.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine further the new capacity-reliability index {{recently}} proposed for the design of a new <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> model for a signal-controlled road network. This new reliability index explicitly accounts for the probability that all network links would be operated below their capacities when serving different traffic patterns deviating from the average condition. Specifically, the <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> model is reformulated by using the new reliability index in a bilevel optimization framework. In addition, the reliability-based design is compared with that of the <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> model to gain insights between the deterministic and stochastic network design problems. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In this paper, we extend this concept to a general signalcontrolled road network under time-stationary conditions.

We first define and formulate the <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> of a whole signal-controlled road network, and then show how a bi-level programming method {{can be used to}} determine signal setting for maximization of the network <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity.</b> A numerical example is presented to illustrate the concept and the calculation procedure. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the {{correlation}} analysis are summed up by the correlation map presented in Fig.  10, which represents the <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> of the links of the reduced BWFL model plotted against their WFEBC values. It emerges from the analysis of BWFL that the criticality measure <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> is biased; it sometimes falls short of identifying pipe failures leading to significant head losses if the supply of the critical node is not affected. As a result, <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> fails to assess the global impact of pipe failures on the network. On the other hand, WFEBC better reflects the relative contribution of alternative supply paths both to the global and local topological and energy redundancy of the network. The properties of the surrogate measure also make it an adequate pre-selection tool of critical links for further analysis, {{as illustrated by the}} flowchart in Fig.  11. Figure  10 shows that a fraction of pipes with <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> greater than 1 can be filtered out prior to the hydraulic CLA based on their WFEBC values (smaller than 1.17 approximately) with low chances of eliminating critical pipes in the process, as lower WFEBC values are systematically associated with high <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> values.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Decompressive {{laparotomy}} {{followed by}} temporary abdominal closure (TAC) is an established prophylaxis and treatment for abdominal compartment syndrome. The herein presented study {{aimed at the}} comparison of volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> and development of intra-abdominal hypertension after forced primary abdominal closure and different TAC techniques in a porcine model. METHODS: Eight anesthesized and mechanically ventilated domestic pigs underwent a standardized midline laparotomy. A bag was placed into the abdominal cavity. Before abdominal closure, the bag was prefilled with 3, 000 mL water to simulate increased intra-abdominal volume. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was then increased in 2 mm Hg steps up to 30 mm Hg by adding volume (volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity)</b> to the intra-abdominal bag. Volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> with the corresponding IAP were analyzed and compared for primary abdominal closure, bag silo closure, a zipper system, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) with different negative pressures (- 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg). Hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters were monitored throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> was the highest for bag silo closure followed by the zipper system and VAC with primary abdominal closure providing the least volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> in the whole IAP range. Of interest, VAC - 50 mm Hg resulted in a lower volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> when compared with VAC - 100 and - 150 mm Hg. Pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters demonstrated {{no significant differences between}} primary abdominal closure and the evaluated TAC techniques at all IAP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present experimental in vivo study indicates that bag silo closure and zipper systems may be favorable TAC techniques after decompressive laparotomy. In contrast, the VAC techniques resulted in lower volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> and therefore may bear an increased risk for recurrent intra-abdominal hypertension in the initial phase after decompressive laparotomy...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} recognition that mitochondrial dysfunction {{is associated with}} the autism spectrum disorders. However, little attention has been given to the etiology of mitochondrial dysfunction or how mitochondrial abnormalities might interact with other physiological disturbances associated with autism, such as oxidative stress. In the current study we used respirometry to examine <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity,</b> a measure of the mitochondrial ability to respond to physiological stress, in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from children with autistic disorder (AD) as well as age and gender-matched control LCLs. We demonstrate, for the first time, that LCLs derived from children with AD have an abnormal mitochondrial <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> before and after exposure to increasingly higher concentrations of 2, 3 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -napthoquinone (DMNQ), an agent that increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Specifically, the AD LCLs exhibit a higher <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> at baseline and a sharper depletion of <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> when ROS exposure is increased, as compared to control LCLs. Detailed investigation indicated that <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> abnormalities seen in AD LCLs were the result of higher ATP-linked respiration and maximal respiratory capacity at baseline combined with a marked increase in proton leak respiration as ROS was increased. We further demonstrate that these <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> abnormalities are driven by a subgroup of eight (32 %) of 25 AD LCLs. Additional investigation of this subgroup of AD LCLs with <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> abnormalities revealed that it demonstrated a greater reliance on glycolysis and on uncoupling protein 2 to regulate oxidative stress at the inner mitochondria membrane. This study suggests that a significant subgroup of AD children may have alterations in mitochondrial function which could render them more vulnerable to a pro-oxidant microenvironment derived from intrinsic and extrinsic sources of ROS such as immune activation and pro-oxidant environmental toxicants. These findings are consistent with the notion that AD is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors...|$|R

40|$|In power markets {{ancillary}} service is usually centrally handled. The system operator determines the required <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> and purchases {{it from the}} reserve suppliers. The corresponding cost is allocated to consumers. This approach may lead to inefficiency and gaming in {{ancillary service}} markets. Is there any way that individual consumers can treat the <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> through a decentralized decision-making approach? If so, how should each consumer make optimal ancillary service plan? With a decentralized approach, where each consumer tries to maximize his own benefit, could the maximal social welfare be obtained as its centralized counterpart? In this paper, conceptual study results on these issues are presented. Two cases are investigated. The first case aims at reducing electricity interruption risk of a specified consumer via asking a power supplier to improve generation reliability. The provider insurance theory is introduced to guarantee the improvement of generation reliability. In the second case, there are three participants in the market: a power supplier, a consumer (also the insured) and a <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> provider (also the insurer). <b>Reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> is traded and the insurance policy used to enforce the liability of <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> provider. It is shown that in both cases, once the consumer purchases a well-defined insurance policy, the latter will induce incentives for the insurer to provide the required level of reliability improvement or <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity.</b> With insurance policy, the consumer can reduce his expected outage loss and shift his risk to the risk-neutral insurer. It is proven that the suggested decentralized approach can yield maximal social welfare as well. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The high local contribution of these links is not reflected by their associated <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity,</b> as the nodes they supply are closer, or easier to supply, than the critical point of the network.

The analysis {{is based on}} an equilibrium model developed by Just and Weber (2008) for reserve markets.

The results clearly show that shorter periods (with resulting lower variations in overall electricity demand) lead to more efficient dispatch and market results. Not only prices in the <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> markets are expected to be lower, but also spot market prices. As these benefits can be partially reaped by owners of large generation portfolios also under longer contract durations, it discriminates smaller generation companies and can potentially deter market participation.
