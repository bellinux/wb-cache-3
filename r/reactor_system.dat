25|$|A new {{development}} of the activated sludge process is the Nereda process which produces a granular sludge that settles very well (the sludge volume index is reduced from 200-300 to 40 mL/g). A new process <b>reactor</b> <b>system</b> is created {{to take advantage of}} this quick settling sludge and is integrated into the aeration tank instead of having a separate unit outside. About 30 Nereda wastewater treatment plants worldwide are operational, under construction or under design, varying in size from 5,000 up to 858,000 person equivalent.|$|E
25|$|This type of reactor {{contains}} {{a number of}} tubes with small diameter. These tubes contain catalyst and are surrounded by boiling water which removes the heat of reaction. A fixed-bed reactor is suitable for operation at low temperatures and has an upper temperature limit of 530nbsp&K. Excess temperature leads to carbon deposition and hence blockage of the reactor. Since large amounts of the products formed are in liquid state, this type of reactor can also {{be referred to as}} a trickle flow <b>reactor</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Thorium (Th) and Uranium (U) are nuclear fuels in these <b>reactor</b> <b>systems.</b> Lead (Pb), Bismuth (Bi) and Tungsten (W) are the target nuclei in the ADS <b>reactor</b> <b>systems.</b> The Hartree-Fock (H-F) method with an effective interaction with Skyrme forces is widely used for studying the properties of nuclei such as binding energy, Root Mean Square (RMS) charge radii, mass radii, neutron density, proton density, electromagnetic multipole moments, etc. In this study, by using H-F method with interaction Skyrme RMS charge radii, RMS mass radii, neutron density and proton density were calculated for the 232 Th, 238 U, 207 Pb, 209 Bi and 184 W isotopes used on the new generation <b>reactor</b> <b>systems.</b> The calculation results of charge radii have been compared with experimental data and obtained other results have been discussed for hybrid and ADS <b>reactor</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

25|$|Mazda had {{improved}} the fuel {{efficiency of the}} thermal <b>reactor</b> <b>system</b> by 40% when the RX-7 was introduced in 1978. However, Mazda eventually shifted to the catalytic converter system. According to the Curtiss-Wright research, the factor that controls the amount of unburned hydrocarbon in the exhaust is the rotor surface temperature, with higher temperatures producing less hydrocarbon. Curtiss-Wright showed also that the rotor can be widened, keeping the rest of engine's architecture unchanged, thus reducing friction losses and increasing displacement and power output. The limiting factor for this widening was mechanical, especially shaft deflection at high rotative speeds. Quenching is the dominant source of hydrocarbon at high speeds, and leakage at low speeds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Problems with {{synthesis}} and optimization of <b>reactor</b> <b>systems</b> {{are considerably}} {{more complex than}} other process stages. The complexity {{is related to the}} complex and non-linear behavior of the <b>reactor</b> <b>systems.</b> In this work a computational systematic procedure was developed in order to optimize ideal <b>reactor</b> <b>systems.</b> The technique of non-linear optimization of the genetic algorithms was used. This optimization technique is based on the submission of randomly generated individuals through the algorithm. The variables chosen for the optimization were the conversion and volume of the <b>reactor</b> <b>systems.</b> The objective function to be optimized was determined by the material balance, different types of reactors and their possible combinations, in order to maximize the profit in obtaining the product wanted. To the cost function the pertinent project restrictions and the reactor’s operations that compose the system were incorporated, simplifying the solution of the problem in an unrestricted way. Nonetheless, the classic functions of the genetic algorithms found in the literature were adapted to create capable individuals in the conversion interval demanded by the problem. Two cases from the literature were studied and results are similar to those one obtained by the application of the systematic procedure developed...|$|R
