40|$|The {{demand for}} large {{underground}} space is increasing as various needs arise. As {{the scale of}} underground space increases, failure and collapse risks accordingly rise, primarily due to higher uncertainty of properties and a lower arching effect. Therefore, proper primary support systems (e. g., rock bolt and shotcrete) are required to prevent failure of the tunnel face during excavation and large vertical displacement at the tunnel crown and ground surface for safe tunnel construction. Additionally, a pre-improvement support system must be applied before excavation and during the excavation process, depending on the tunnel scale. The necessity of a pre-improvement support system for large underground excavation is verified based on numerical analyses. Important design parameters of the pre-improvement support system are chosen and their effectiveness in terms of tunnel support is analyzed through parametric studies according to various tunnel scales.

40|$|AbstractA {{computational}} formulation able {{to simulate}} fast crack growth in multilayered composite reinforced with z-pins is proposed. In particular, {{in order to}} identify the initiation and the growth of the crack, a moving mesh strategy, based on ALE approach, is combined with a cohesive methodology, in which weak based moving connections with the boundary adjoining layers are implemented by using a finite element formulation.

Despite existing methodologies available from the literature, the present paper proposes a computational procedure able to study the dynamic crack growth in composite structures with a relatively low computational efforts. The analysis is proposed also in a non-stationary framework, in which the influence of time dependence and the inertial forces is taken into account. In order to investigate the accuracy and to validate the proposed methodology, comparisons with experimental data and numerical results are compared.

These {{are one of the most}} congested areas in {{reinforced concrete}} framed structures; placement of concrete and proper compaction in such areas are hence substantially challenging.

Therefore if implementing self-compacting concrete in beam-column joints does not compromise seismic performance of the frame, it can be used instead of conventional concrete. This paper focuses on implementation of high-strength self-compacting concrete in beam-column joints and assessment of its seismic behaviour under reversed cyclic loading. Three interior beam-column subassemblies chosen to vary in concrete type and compressive strength are designed as per the New Zealand Standard NZ 3101 : 2006.

Hence, in this condition, dynamic visual information providing information on linear and angular acceleration would {{play a critical role in}} spatial navigation. To investigate this assumption we compared rat's spatial performance in the MWM and in the homing hole board (HB) tasks using a 1. 5 Hz stroboscopic illumination. In the MWM, rats trained in the stroboscopic condition needed more time than those trained in a continuous light condition to reach the hidden platform. They expressed also little accuracy during the probe trial. In the HB task, in contrast, place learning remained unaffected by the stroboscopic light condition. The deficit in the MWM was thus complete, affecting both escape latency and discrimination of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>area,</b> and was thus task specific.

The monitored slope cross section is at km 0 + 150. The reinforcements are high density polyethylene geogrids;. materials with different tensile strength values were used. The reinforcement strains were measured at three reinforcement levels using linear extensometers. The soil vertical stresses were recorded using load cells. The internal horizontal displacements of the slope were recorded using two inclinometer tubes. The face displacements were recorded topographically in points spaced approximately 1. 2 ?m vertically along the face of the slope on the km 0 + 150 cross section. The reinforced slope behaviour was observed during a period of about 13 months, which includes three months of construction period. This way it was possible to obtain information about the slope behaviour during and after construction (the first 10 months of service). The behaviour of the observed reinforced slope is characterized by: low values of face displacements, slope internal horizontal displacements and reinforcement strains; change of the face displacements configuration at the end of construction during service;tendency to stabilization of the horizontal displacements in {{a relatively short period of}} service; change, during service, of the position of the line passing through the points of the reinforcements where maximum strains were recorded.

40|$|As a {{sediment}} control facility, sabo dam has {{to prevent}} erosions, {{to stabilize the}} riverbank, to reduce the velocity of debris flow, and to store the flow of sediment. Recently, sabo dam is not only intended to control the sediment but also to be utilized as connection bridge. To design sabo dam, {{it has to be}} taken into account the stability of the dam beside its structural - strength. The stability analysis of sabo should be done in 3 points as stability analysis includes stability against overturning and tensile stress, sliding of the base and bearing capacity of ground. To do so, it is considered three conditions. The first is normal condition, the second is the condition when the flood taken place, and the third is when the debris flow happen. As a road bridge, sabo dam will receive significant traffic load therefore the strength of the slab must be analyzed. The standard design used was RSNI T- 02 - 2005 “Pembebanan untuk Jembatan”, and structural analysis used was SAP 2000 software. The results indicated that the safety factor for stability against overturning and tensile stress is 7, 95 and 6, 19 that is larger than the suggested safety factor (Sf), 1, 5 therefore the sabo dam is safe for overturning moment and tensile stress. The safety factor for sliding was a 2, 64 and 2, 33 that is also larger than suggested safety factor 2, 0, then the structure is also safe against sliding. Based on three conditions : normal, flood and debris flow, the calculated maximum stress () were 27, 40 t/m 2, 29, 72 t/m 2 and 29, 28 t/m 2, those are less than allowable bearing capacity of soil under the base of the dam 60 t/m 2. The result of concrete slab analysis indicated that the area of reinforced bar is 3166, 67 mm 2 that is more than existing structure using longitudinal bar D 16 - 200 (1005, 31 mm 2), it means that the slab is not strong enough to resist the load according to RSNI T- 02 - 2005 having the truck load of 50 ton.

40|$|Advanced {{laminated}} composites {{suffer from}} a lack of out-of-plane strength and toughness, leading to delamination and other types of interlaminar failure. Aligned carbon nanotubes (A-CNTs) placed at the interlayer between plies of an aerospace grade carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite (CFRP) have been shown to increase interlaminar toughness while improving laminate strength. While this architecture, known as 'nanostitch', has proven beneficial, morphological changes in the A-CNT layer and their effect on the composite properties has not been studied. This thesis explores the effect of varying the A-CNT height and the layup technique on the resulting interlaminar region morphology and static short beam strength (SBS) in shear, of a quasi-isotropic layup using Hexcel IM 7 / 8552 carbon fiber aerospace composite prepreg. In addition, fatigue testing was performed on a selected A-CNT height to generate a SBS fatigue life curve. Interface morphology and laminate damage were imaged via optical and scanning electron microscopy of cross-sections and crack surfaces, and micro-computed tomography was used to generate 3 D reconstructions of some coupons. Results from static testing indicate that the A-CNT reinforcement of the interlaminar region increase the SBS by 8. 5 %, regardless of height (in the 5 - 65 micron range studied) or the two different layup techniques. This indifference to forest morphology is attributed to damage primarily occurring outside of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>area,</b> indicating that the interlaminar region is sufficiently reinforced by all A-CNT heights considered. Fatigue-life data shows a threefold increase in lifespan for the A-CNT reinforced material. All A-CNT forests affected the interface morphology, increasing the average interlayer thickness by inducing resin agglomerations near the CNT layer. This agglomeration results from resin-rich defects in the original prepreg material. Ancillary tasks involved in generating this thesis included inventing a method of measuring A-CNT forest height using an optical microscope, introducing water into the CNT growth process and controlling the furnace starting temperature to stabilize the height, altering the layup method to generate desired morphologies, and proposing a 'hot-load' system for the furnace to increase the CNT forest production tenfold. by Diana Lewis.
